Now he wants to buy the world’s biggest.

The idea of the U.S. purchasing Greenland has captured the former real-estate developer’s imagination, according to people familiar with the discussions, who said Mr. Trump has, with varying degrees of seriousness, repeatedly expressed interest in buying the ice-covered autonomous Danish territory between the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans.

"Trump calls Tlaib, Omar 'anti-Israel,' defends Netanyahu move to deny them entry",https://www.foxnews.com,"[""Andrew O'Reilly""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-calls-tlaib-omar-anti-israel-defends-netanyahu-move-to-deny-them-entry,"President Trump called Democratic Reps. Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar ""very anti-Jewish and anti-Israel"" and defended his statements urging Israel to block them from entering the country, amid a massive outcry from Democrats.

Speaking to reporters after deplaning Air Force One at Morristown Municipal Airport in New Jersey, Trump said recent comments by the two freshmen Democratic lawmakers about Israel were ""disgraceful,"" arguing they have become the ""face of the Democrat Party.""

""They are very anti-Jewish and they are very anti-Israel,"" Trump said. ""I think it is disgraceful the things they've said.""

The president added: ""This isn't a one-line mistake. what they have said about Israel and Jewish people is a horrible thing and they've become the face of the Democrat Party.""

ISRAEL BLOCKS OMAR, TLAIB FROM ENTERING COUNTRY AMID PRESSURE FROM TRUMP

Trump's comments came hours after the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu barred Tlaib and Omar from entering the country ahead of a planned visit.

The unprecedented move to bar Tlaib, D-Mich., and Omar, D-Minn., from visiting marks a deep foray by Israel into America's bitterly polarized politics. Israel's move came shortly after Trump tweeted that the Israeli government would ""show great weakness"" if it allowed the lawmakers in.

It is also a sharp escalation of Israel's campaign against the international boycott movement.

""They hate Israel & all Jewish people, & there is nothing that can be said or done to change their minds,"" Trump tweeted before calling the two congresswomen ""a disgrace.""

AIPAC CHIDES ISRAEL FOR DECISION TO BLOCK OMAR, TLAIB VISIT

In a statement, Netanyahu said Israel is ""open to critics and criticism,"" except for those who advocate boycotts against it. ""Congresswomen Tlaib and Omar are leading activists in promoting the legislation of boycotts against Israel in the American Congress,"" Netanyahu said.

He added that their itinerary ""revealed that they planned a visit whose sole objective is to strengthen the boycott against us and deny Israel's legitimacy.""

The two newly elected Muslim members of Congress are outspoken critics of Israel's treatment of the Palestinians. Tlaib's family came to the United States from the West Bank.

Israel said it would consider any request from Tlaib to visit relatives on humanitarian grounds.

Tlaib and Omar have also been the target of repeated attacks by Trump in recent months, including a series of controversial tweets on July 14 in which he said they should ""go back"" to the ""broken"" countries they came from. Both are U.S. citizens, and Tlaib was born in the United States. The two are members of the so-called ""Squad"" of new, left-wing Democrats, along with Reps. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.

The decision to ban the congresswomen could further sharpen divisions among Democrats over the issue of Israel ahead of the 2020 elections. Republicans have amplified the views of left-wing Democrats like Tlaib and Omar to present the party as deeply divided and at odds with Israel. Democratic leaders have pushed back, reiterating the party's strong support for Israel, in part to protect representatives from more conservative districts."
CNN Exclusive: New documents reveal behind-the-scenes clash over spending inside Trump inaugural committee,https://www.cnn.com,['Vicky Ward'],08-15-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/15/politics/trump-inauguration-spending-subpoena-investigation/index.html,"(CNN) The former adviser to first lady Melania Trump, who has come under fire for the cost of President Donald Trump's inauguration, was among the event planners who raised concerns about excessive spending in the weeks before the events, according to documents obtained by CNN.

Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a former friend of Melania Trump, has emerged as a witness for investigators and received a subpoena last month by Washington DC's attorney general.

The 10-page subpoena, which has been seen by CNN, asks Wolkoff to hand over a variety of information, including any evidence of inaugural-related expenditures that were ""wasteful, mismanaged, and/or improperly provided private benefit.""

It asks for communications between the inaugural committee and several business entities connected to President Trump or his family, as well as communications between Wolkoff and a number of Trump family members, including Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner.

Multiple agencies are investigating Trump's inauguration, including federal prosecutors in New York who are scrutinizing tens of thousands of documents handed over by the Presidential Inaugural Committeeaccording to people familiar with the inquiry . Authorities are investigating whether any of the donation money was misspent, used to improperly benefit certain individuals or came from foreign donors. Vanity Fair first reported the DC subpoena.

The DC subpoena is the third Wolkoff has received about the inaugural's finances. The other two were from the US Attorney's office in New York's Southern District and from the House Oversight Committee, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Reached by CNN, Wolkoff said she could not comment, citing a nondisclosure agreement she signed with the 58th Presidential Inaugural Committee, the nonprofit group that oversaw Trump's inauguration.

In a one-page statement released in April 2019, Wolkoff said, ""If the PIC were to release me from this obligation, I would be able to speak freely without the fear of legal or financial repercussions. Otherwise I am regrettably unable to provide any substantive comment.""

But two people close to Wolkoff tell CNN that she has responded to the latest subpoena. That could be worrisome for people connected to the inauguration.

Wolkoff was deeply involved in minute details of the inauguration planning and was included in emails viewed by CNN that included costs, schedules and vendors, among other information.

One of the sources close to Wolkoff told CNN that she is meticulous about record-keeping, and has maintained extensive records of her work surrounding the inauguration, including detailed ledgers and spreadsheets of budget expenses.

Welcome to Washington

This is a story, essentially, of a clash of wills and culture. Wolkoff came to Washington unversed in politics but expert in staging large-scale productions for high-end, notoriously detail-oriented cultural institutions, such as the Lincoln Center and Vogue magazine. She was used to working with people she knew and trusted and expected that her role would include checking the price of every line item, according to the sources. She was told she would be given carte blanche, they say. That turned out not to be case.

Stephanie Winston Wolkoff and Melania Trump in 2008.

Wolkoff left the White House in February 2018 amid controversy , when it was revealed that her firm, WIS Media Partners, was paid close to $26 million to plan events for the inauguration.

That month, senior administration officials said the President and first lady were not pleased to have learned about the money paid to Wolkoff's firm by the Inaugural Committee, according to The New York Times

now the White House press secretary, The first lady's former spokesperson Stephanie Grisham,now the White House press secretary, released a statement at the time saying the White House had ""severed the gratuitous services contract with Ms. Wolkoff.""

In her April 2019 statement, Wolkoff disputed that she had been fired, and wrote that Grisham's words were ""not fair or accurate,"" and that she had been ""thrown under the bus.""

All but $1.6 million of the $26 million payment to Wolkoff's company went to vendors and subcontractors for broadcast production services of events, according to a document prepared by the company and viewed by CNN.

The Inaugural Committee was chaired by President Trump's longtime friend, the California-based financier Tom Barrack. The committee's deputy chairman, Rick Gates, became an employee of Colony Capital, Barrack's investment firm, after the inauguration.

In February 2018, Gates pleaded guilty to conspiracy and for lying to investigators, on charges unrelated to the inauguration. Gates is currently cooperating with various investigations, as part of his plea agreement.

Barrack has come under scrutiny recently over his dealings with Saudi Arabia.

Asked about the recent subpoena to Wolkoff, spokespeople for Kushner, Gates, Barrack, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump all declined to comment.

The White House would not comment but has previously said the President and first lady were not involved in inauguration planning.

Double the cost

The Trump Inaugural was different in many ways, most notably in what it cost. The event's record $107 million price tag was more than twice as expensive as President Barack Obama's 2009 inauguration, as well as the 2001 swearing-in of President George W. Bush.

Wolkoff, a longtime friend of the first lady, was asked by Ivanka Trump to run the inauguration after the election, according to one of the sources close to Wolkoff. Wolkoff had a reputation as a strong event planner, having run the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute Gala, known as the Met Gala, in New York City.

Once she landed in Washington, Wolkoff realized that the scope of the inauguration was far beyond what had been outlined to by her Barrack and Gates, according to one of the sources. She'd have to trust the ""Washington way,"" which included, so she was told, working with long-held partnerships.

Thomas Barrack

Four sources familiar with the situation tell CNN that Wolkoff clashed repeatedly with Barrack and Gates over the Inaugural Committee's spending. A particular point of contention was a vendor called Hargrove Inc., a special events company that Wolkoff felt was charging prices beyond what she thought was reasonable. Hargrove has been involved in producing events for every presidential inauguration since 1949 and was paid at least $25 million for Trump's inauguration.

Emails obtained by CNN show the concern Wolkoff and other event planners had about Hargrove's budget. In late December, Gates was copied on an email exchange between Wolkoff and Hargrove managers that said, ""I am expressing my concerns because I have no options at this point."" Wolkoff cited ""many line items that were not reflected, rentals that were not sourced, budgets that were not accurate and décor elements that were not feasible.""

Hargrove's then-president replied that ""our only goal here is to make this the most successful inauguration ever,"" and offered to provide 10 bars free of charge.

An email among inaugural event planners also questioned Hargrove's prices, with one saying a bid to decorate two halls of the convention center was ""literally 5 times anywhere else would be. We've accounted for some premium increase, but this is exceptionally high.""

Another email from another partner in the event planning asked Hargrove why the price was so high for scenic elements, writing that the ""cost ... is not justified with how it has been explained or shown."" CNN did not see Hargrove's response to this email.

Despite the concerns, Gates approved the hiring of Hargrove for Barrack's Chairman's Global Dinner held at Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium, one of multiple events the company was involved in, and the Presidential Inaugural Committee signed off on Hargrove's budget, according to documents viewed by CNN.

Hargrove declined to comment for this story, but a source familiar with the company's work on the inaugural events said Hargrove submitted a detailed scope of work documents and invoices and because the scope of work changes with each inauguration, any comparison with other events would be unfair. Hargrove produces many other major events, including the Democratic National Convention, and CNN has, along with other media outlets, worked with Hargrove in its convention coverage.

A spokesperson for Gates told CNN he had no knowledge of Wolkoff's concerns over Hargrove. Barrack's spokesperson refused to comment, though it is unclear whether he knew about the cost concerns.

Rick Gates

Wolkoff soon felt excluded from meetings convened by Barrack and Gates that she thought she should have been included in, according to one of the sources close to her.

Things got so bad that Wolkoff voiced her distress in a phone call to Trump's then-personal attorney, Michael Cohen, who recorded the call. According to a source with knowledge of the recording, Wolkoff told Cohen that she was concerned about the inaugural spending.

The recorded conversation was acquired by federal agents last year during their investigation into Cohen.

Wolkoff, according to the two sources close to her, had gone to work for the Inaugural Committee against the wishes of the majority of her New York friends, many of whom supported Hillary Clinton.

Wolkoff has told one of those sources, a close friend, that she took the job because she felt she had no choice due to her close relationship with the first lady, as well as a sense of patriotic duty

Despite the friction surrounding the inauguration, Wolkoff agreed to work for Melania Trump as an unpaid adviser. Classified as a special government employee, Wolkoff spent a lot of time working from New York City. She was tasked with crafting certain messaging points, as well as cultivating the first lady's official children's initiative , though to what extent remains unclear. Wolkoff departed the first lady's staff in February 2018 -- Be Best was launched in April.

Privately, Wolkoff has told multiple people that it's her belief she was deliberately set up as a scapegoat to deflect attention from other people involved with the inaugural who, to her mind, were guilty of misspending and with whom she grew to have a difficult relationship.

""Stephanie was underestimated,"" says a person close to Wolkoff. ""They were hoping for a New York socialite who would not look at the details."""
Trump knocks Rep. Steve King for 'rape or incest' comment,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Alex Pappas', 'Alex Pappas Is A Politics Reporter At Foxnews.Com.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-rep-steve-king-rape-incest-comments,"President Trump is dinging Iowa Rep. Steve King for eyebrow-raising comments questioning whether humanity would exist anymore if not for rape and incest. Meanwhile, the embattled GOP lawmaker is resisting calls from critics to resign.

""Certainly it wasn’t a good statement,” the president told reporters Thursday before boarding a flight to New Hampshire for a rally.

King, no stranger to controversy-stirring remarks, has been facing a new backlash over his comments to a conservative group on Wednesday.

STEVE KING HIT FOR PONDERING WHETHER CIVILIZATION WOULD HAVE SURVIVED WITHOUT RAPE AND INCEST

""What if we went back through all the family trees and just pulled out anyone who was a product of rape or incest? Would there be any population of the world left if we did that?"" King said at the Westside Conservative Club in Urbandale, Iowa, according to The Des Moines Register. ""Considering all the wars and all the rapes and pillages that happened throughout all these different nations, I know that I can't say that I was not a part of a product of that.""

King’s comments came as he was arguing against exceptions for rape and incest in anti-abortion legislation. The Iowa Republican has contended that just because the circumstances surrounding conception are bad, that doesn't negate the humanity of the result.

CHENEY BLASTS GOP COLLEAGUE STEVE KING OVER 'APPALLING' RAPE AND INCEST REMARKS: 'IT'S TIME FOR HIM TO GO'

""It's not the baby's fault for the sin of the father, or of the mother,"" he said.

A slew of Democrats ripped into King over the comments. But, some Republicans – including GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, a member of the Republican leadership – have called on King to leave Congress, too.

""Today's comments by @RepSteveKingIA are appalling and bizarre,"" the GOP lawmaker from Wyoming tweeted Wednesday. ""As I've said before, it's time for him to go. The people of Iowa's 4th congressional district deserve better.

King defended himself over the uproar on Thursday, taking shots at Cheney for her response and claiming she isn't sufficiently pro-life.

“I believe all life is sacred regardless of the circumstances of conception,” King tweeted. “@Liz_Cheney finds that ‘appalling’ and ‘bizarre.’”

The U.S. Treasury is about to flood the market with debt to fund a $1 trillion deficit. Here’s why that is a worry,https://www.marketwatch.com,"['Joy Wiltermuth', 'Markets Reporter']",08-15-2019,2019,8,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-us-treasury-is-about-to-flood-the-market-with-debt-to-fund-a-1-trillion-deficit-heres-why-that-is-a-worry-2019-08-15,"There may be some limitations to the U.S. government’s borrowing after all.

An anticipated surge of U.S. borrowing in the global debt markets in the second half of this year is starting to create concern as Treasury is expected to ramp up its issuance of bills, notes and bonds to fund a soaring $1 trillion budget deficit.

The U.S. government’s budget gap has widened 27% compared to the first 10 months of fiscal 2018, as spending has risen 8% and receipts have grown by 3%. The federal fiscal year runs October through September. The Trump administration recently forecast a $1 trillion full-year shortfall, while the Congressional Budget Office is slightly more conservative, putting it at $896 billion.

Last month the U.S. Treasury laid out its plans to borrow $814 billion between July and December, after the Trump administration and Congress agreed to a two-year postponement of the U.S. debt ceiling, ensuring no government shutdown or a federal default.

Not only does the Treasury needs to borrow to cover the fiscal deficit created by Trump’s 2017 tax cuts and the inability of Congress to agree on spending cuts, but Treasury needs to rebuild its cash balance which was run down to pay the governments bills when the debt ceiling was hit in May.

The coming deluge of Treasury issuance has stoked worries on Wall Street about whether there is enough liquidity in the system in the short term to meet the supply without pushing up short-term borrowing costs and inverting the yield curve even further.

U.S. dollar liquidity is deteriorating and “is reaching a point where it may require drastic action if measures aren’t taken to address it soon,” warned Gaurav Saroliya, director of macro strategy at Oxford Economics, in a note on Wednesday.

To illustrate the concern, Saroliya pointed to the higher costs already faced by London-based banks lending to one other overnight in dollars, the popular dollar Libor-OIS spread, which has climbed in anticipation of the Treasury glut hitting markets.

This chart shows the rise of the 3-month dollar Libor-OIS spread since May, even as U.S. Treasury cash balances at the Federal Reserve have dropped from about $400 billion to closer to $150 billion.

Oxford Economics International funding squeeze

As the Treasury restores its cash balance with the coming supply, Saroliya expects liquidity woes to worsen, particularly in a scenario where long-term Treasury notes are yielding less than shorter-dated debt.

“With Treasury issuance set to surge in the wake of the recent debt-ceiling deal, an inverted yield curve could create a significant issuance indigestion in the market,” Saroliya wrote.

On Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury 10-year note TMUBMUSD10Y, -0.12% yield briefly fell below the 2-year note TMUBMUSD02Y, +0.20% yield, an inversion of the funding curve that has foretold past economic slowdowns.

Meanwhile fears of an economic recession rattled U.S. stocks Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.39% closing down 800 points, its biggest one day fall this year, before some recovery on Thursday morning in the benchmark S&P 500 index SPX, +0.25%.

Amid the stock market rout, the chances of a half percentage point cut in the federal funds rate in September rose to 30.4%. Markets are pricing in a 69.6% chance of a quarter-point interest rate cut next month.

Despite the rising Treasury debt issuance, investors globally have been buying U.S. government debt, pushing the 30-year U.S. bond TMUBMUSD30Y, -0.09% to a record low around 2.0% this week, as yields on many other developed country bonds are even lower with about $15 trillion worth of debt now offering negative yields.

Slowing global economic growth due to the U.S. - China trade war is resulting in central banks easing monetary policy, and an array of geopolitical risks from Brexit, to Italian political instability, the U.S. sanctions on Iran, and violent protests in Hong Kong are encouraging investors into the safe haven of U.S. debt.

But in the short-term money markets, the coming flood of U.S. Treasury debt issuance may cause some indigestion.

Bond dealers who underwrite the Treasury’s debt sales in the weekly auctions are already holding record amounts of U.S. Treasurys on their books as the fiscal deficit has increased. Now their need to borrow more cash in short-term money markets, using Treasuries as collateral, to buy even more government debt is pushing up short term rates.

A key risk barometer, the U.S. “repo” market, where cash is borrowed overnight using Treasurys for collateral, has signaled that liquidity is tightening.

Repo rates have climbed recently in relation to what the Federal Reserve pay banks to hold excess reserves. The rate that lenders have charged for cash in the market for Treasury repurchase agreements was 2.22% on Tuesday, compared with the 2.1% that the Federal Reserve pays banks to hold excess reserves, known as the IOER rate.

Liquidity may also be tightening in the market for short term borrowing of U.S. dollars internationally, known as the “foreign repo pool” where non-U.S. investors keep cash balances with the Federal Reserve, and the rising costs of currency hedging given the strength of the U.S. dollar may make investing in U.S. Treasury debt less appealing, Saroliya noted.

China and Japan were by far the largest foreign holders of Treasury securities, as of July 16, in the most recent report of holders.

For Saroliya, it all boils down to the Federal Reserve needing to act to preserve liquidity, perhaps by cutting benchmark U.S. rates by another 50 to 100 basis points or through another round of quantitative easing or bond buying.

“And that needs to be immediate!” Saroliya urged.

Earlier this month, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Mark Cabana also warned that the historically high levels of Treasury securities held by dealers could pose problems when it come to issuing more debt.

This chart shows dealer holdings of Treasury debt rising between January and July, at the same time custody holdings at the New York Fed have declined.

“We are concerned that the U.S. banking system is nearing reserve scarcity,” Cabana wrote in a note to clients. Ultimately, he said opening the Treasury “floodgates” would likely “force the Fed to start expanding its balance sheet by year-end.”

To be sure, not everyone sees doom in the U.S. adding to the already $22.4 trillion national debt.

“A lot of Street commentators have highlighted the fact that there is going to be a huge amount of supply in the Treasury market, and how that is going to affect rates,” said Robert Sabatino, global head of liquidity at UBS Asset Management, in an interview with MarketWatch.

“When you look at the space though this is a market that most people want to own at some point, especially given the fact that there are $15 trillion of bonds in negative yields,” he said. “It makes the U.S. look really attractive.”"
State Department watchdog details political retaliation against 'disloyal' staffers,https://www.politico.com,['Nahal Toosi'],08-15-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/15/state-department-inspector-general-report-political-retaliation-1464586,"Another report from State Department Inspector General Steve Linick on the broader topic of alleged political retaliation is expected to focus on staffers who worked directly for the secretary of state's office. | Alex Wong/Getty Images State Department State Department watchdog details political retaliation against 'disloyal' staffers

Top officials in the State Department bureau that deals with international institutions engaged in “disrespectful and hostile treatment” of staffers, including harassing some over suspicions that they were “disloyal” due to their suspected political views, a federal watchdog says.

At least one top career employee was forced out of her position for inappropriate reasons, while others found themselves stripped of their duties because of their superiors’ political biases, according to the watchdog.

Story Continued Below

The findings were contained in a report published Thursday by the State Department inspector general’s office. The report, obtained in advance by POLITICO, is the first of two from the inspector general that explores allegations that President Donald Trump’s political appointees retaliated against career State Department employees. The second report is still being drafted.

Thursday’s report singles out the assistant secretary of State for the department’s Bureau of International Organization Affairs, Kevin Moley, as failing to stop the misbehavior despite numerous complaints. It also contains a raft of examples of alleged inappropriate actions by Mari Stull, another senior political appointee in the bureau, who has since left.

Stull and Moley were said to have “frequently berated employees, raised their voices, and generally engaged in unprofessional behavior toward staff,” according to the report.

The majority of the employees the inspector general’s office interviewed “either directly experienced hostile treatment or witnessed such treatment directed at others. In fact, one IO employee told [the Office of the Inspector General] that working with Ms. Stull involved ‘six to eight hostile interactions per day.’”

The report has been eagerly anticipated by Democrats in Congress. On Thursday, Rep. Eliot Engel of New York, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called its findings “offensive” and said that Moley should “resign or be fired.”

Engel added that he and his colleagues “won’t stop until this culture of impunity is ended and everyone responsible faces stiff consequences.”

Moley did not immediately reply to a request for comment, but in a response to the investigation, which the inspector general included in his report, he said the misbehavior attributed to him “does not represent the person I am or have ever been.” He also insisted that many of the alleged incidents had been mischaracterized.

Stull, who served as a senior adviser to Moley, could not immediately be reached for comment. She declined the inspector general’s interview request during the investigation. Because she was no longer a federal employee — she left the State Department in January — she was not required to cooperate.

Stull, who was known to describe herself as “the Vino Vixen” because of her past keeping of a wine blog, was also alleged in past media reports as having tried to keep lists of career government staffers she considered disloyal or loyal to the president.

The report did not appear to directly address that allegation, but it noted that many of the bureau’s staffers said Moley and Stull “made positive or negative comments about employees based on perceived political views.”

For example, several career employees reported that throughout her tenure at the department, Ms. Stull referred to them or other career employees as “‘Obama holdovers,’ ‘traitors,’ or ‘disloyal.’”

Moley, however, insisted to the inspector general’s office that “the only occasion on which he heard Ms. Stull make such remarks was in reference to former political appointees whom she believed were converted to career employees.”

Career government staffers are sworn to serve in government in a nonpartisan fashion, no matter who or which party controls the White House. But many of Trump’s political appointees believe there exists a “deep state” among the career staffers that is determined to thwart the president’s agenda.

The Bureau of International Organization Affairs deals with institutions such as the United Nations. That description alone made it a target of scorn among some top Trump political appointees because of the Republican president’s general disdain for multilateral institutions.

In Stull’s case, it may not have been all about ideology. Investigators wrote that they found evidence that she tried to retaliate against two employees of the bureau who she determined had failed to help her deal with a legal issue in one of her past jobs.

Stull had previously worked at the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization, and had filed an administrative claim regarding her time there. While still at the FAO, she tried to enlist a staffer in the State Department bureau to help with her case. The employee, after talking to his manager, consulted with legal advisers, who told him it was best not to intervene.

The report describes how, after joining the bureau, Stull went out of her way to undermine and complain about that employee and his manager.

“Ms. Stull’s criticism of these employees and her attempts to remove job responsibilities from the employee whose assistance she sought appear likely to have been based on her belief that the individuals did not provide her with sufficient assistance in her private employment dispute,” the report states.

In at least one case, the report says, there’s strong evidence that Moley forced out a high-ranking staffer — a principal deputy assistant secretary with an excellent record and extensive experience — after she raised concerns to him about Stull’s behavior and morale issues in the bureau.

“The circumstances of Assistant Secretary Moley’s removal of the PDAS suggests that he undertook a personnel action based on non-merit factors, namely, her articulation of concerns about Ms. Stull’s conduct,” the report states.

In another case, Moley and Stull are accused of deciding not to fill a bureau role that dealt with human rights because they did not like the leading candidate for the role, possibly because of the person’s relationship with the LGBTQ community. The person’s past work dealing with the U.N. agency that deals with Palestinian refugees was also said to have bothered Stull, who felt the agency was anti-Semitic.

Stull and Moley didn’t appear to understand or be willing to follow established chains of command at the State Department. They would assign duties to staffers without going through supervisors, for instance, or get upset if they weren’t immediately copied on certain papers, even though staffers were following standard procedures on when to route papers to them.

“For example, in April 2018, Ms. Stull asked a mid-level employee, without going through the employee’s supervisors, for information about another nation’s contributions to the UN,” the report states. “Ms. Stull did not believe the data provided was accurate, called the work product ‘garbage,’ and threw it at another employee.”

In one case, Moley is said to have implied, in an email, that the reason he needed to offer clearance on a document was to make sure it reflected the Trump administration’s position.

In another case, multiple witnesses said Stull and Moley had berated a junior employee over a document-routing issue, making her cry. Moley told investigators that he’d never raised his voice at an employee, and that the only time he had heard Stull raise her voice was to him.

Employees alleged that Stull even criticized some of them for clearing certain documents before she’d joined the bureau. “Two employees told OIG that Ms. Stull’s inappropriate conduct had become so pervasive that employees were afraid to put their name on any clearance pages,” the report states.

Moley, meanwhile, “criticized employees when they told him that official travel that he planned in May 2018 did not qualify for first class accommodations under the department’s travel policies and accused them of ‘not fighting hard enough’ to meet his demands,” the report states.

Stull appeared especially fixated on the career staffers’ political views, even though such employees are supposed to serve in a nonpartisan fashion. Some staffers told investigators that “Stull made positive comments about some specific career employees because they reportedly made contributions to Republican candidates.”

Stull also berated an employee because she’d accompanied a delegation of members of the Congressional Black Caucus to the United Nations. The bureau’s staffers routinely accompany such delegations regardless of its composition, the report notes. But Stull “expressed displeasure with her for accompanying the Congressional Black Caucus delegation because it consisted of only Democratic members.” She accused the employee of trying to “thwart” Trump’s agenda, the report says.

The staffer soon found herself stripped of many of her responsibilities; she eventually left the State Department.

Inspector General Steve Linick recommended that the department develop a “corrective action plan” to fix the leadership deficiencies in the bureau. He also recommended that the department consider other moves, including “disciplinary action” against Moley.

The State Department has agreed on both counts.

Linick has been investigating allegations that Trump appointees had targeted career staffers for political retaliation since spring 2018. His other cases include ones involving the alleged actions of aides to former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. They include one case exposed by POLITICO in which a career staffer of Iranian descent was ousted from a top policy role.

Linick’s investigation grew to cover the international organizations bureau after a June 2018 report in Foreign Policy about Stull, whom career staffers accused of deeply hostile behavior, including compiling loyalty lists.

The report issued on Thursday is based on thousands of emails and other documents, as well as investigators’ interviews with more than 40 people, including Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is not listed as having been interviewed.

“Nearly every employee interviewed by OIG raised concerns about the leadership of IO and the treatment of staff,” the report states.

The report, in a footnote, says Stull sent the inspector general’s office a letter in August 2018 that raised concerns “regarding fraud, waste, and abuse, as well as allegations that she had herself experienced retaliation as a result of her efforts to address these concerns.”

Investigators have looked separately into Stull’s claims, but they noted that the probe that led to the soon-to-be-released report did not uncover information to corroborate her allegations.

Many staffers said that they approached Moley with concerns about sinking morale, but that he would minimize it, according to the report. Moley told investigators no employee had ever brought such concerns to him.

“When individuals raised concerns with Ms. Stull about her treatment of employees, she asserted that she was herself the victim of harassment and informed at least one employee that raising such concerns was pointless because the Trump administration ‘has my back,’” the report states.

The report details several attempts by the State Department’s top leaders to get Moley and Stull to adjust their behavior, but it appeared to have limited effect, according to the report.

“Approximately 50 of 300 domestic IO employees have departed IO since Assistant Secretary Moley took over its leadership, and nearly all of the former employees who OIG interviewed stated that poor leadership of the bureau contributed to their decision to depart,” the report states.

"New evidence shows why Steele, the Ohrs and TSA workers never should have become DOJ sources",https://thehill.com,[],08-15-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/457628-new-evidence-shows-why-steele-the-ohrs-and-tsa-workers-never-should-have,"One of the inevitable outcomes of the Russia case will be that the Department of Justice (DOJ) almost certainly will need internal reforms.

The first reform is the most obvious, given the unraveling of the Russia collusion narrative: a new set of rules governing when the FBI can investigate or spy on a First Amendment-protected political campaign during an election.

The FBI never should have been allowed to sustain a counterintelligence investigation into Donald Trump Donald John TrumpGibraltar releases Iranian tanker despite US move to block it Warren leads Democratic field by 5 points in Wisconsin: poll Stephen Colbert on Trump: 'He's trying to invite us into this madness' MORE’s campaign based on hearsay from Australian diplomat Alexander Downer, who helped to arrange a $25 million Australian government donation to the Clinton Foundation, and on a “minimally” verified dossier written by British spy Christopher Steele, who was working on the Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonWarren leads Democratic field by 5 points in Wisconsin: poll The Hill's Morning Report — Recession fears climb and markets dive — now what?

The second reform may be less visible but becomes painfully obvious, thanks to a series of internal DOJ investigative memos released this month that expose glaring issues with the handling, vetting and weighting of “confidential human sources.” That’s a fancy term for people — sometimes called “snitches” or informants, in street vernacular — who secretly provide evidence to law enforcement.

Some examples of the DOJ’s problems with informers fall outside the Russia case but mirror the same issues unmasked in the now-debunked probe of Trump.

Take, for example, the DOJ inspector general’s finding this month that the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) was paying other government officials at the Homeland Security Department’s Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to work as informants.

The IG spared few words in decrying the idiocy of allowing government security officers collecting a federal salary to double-dip into taxpayers’ money by receiving informant pay to report criminal activity they were required by their jobs to disclose.

Two agents and one supervisor “violated the DEA Confidential Source policy” by paying three TSA workers as informants, the report concluded. And one agent wrongly served as handler for a TSA informant with whom he was involved in a “personal relationship,” investigators found, exposing a problem dating to 2013.

“By establishing the TSA employees as paid Limited Use Confidential Sources, the DEA agreed to pay for information that the TSA employees were already obligated to provide to law enforcement,” the IG concluded.

ADVERTISEMENT

In other words, there should be a bright line: Government agents should stick to their jobs and leave the informing to private citizens.

That line similarly was breached in the minds of many when Bruce Ohr, then the DOJ’s assistant deputy attorney general, began collecting anti-Trump information on July 30, 2016, from former MI6 agent Steele and pushing it on the top levels of the DOJ and the FBI.

At the time, Ohr knew his wife, Nellie, and Steele worked for the Fusion GPS research firm on the same project to dig up Russia dirt on Trump, to help the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) win the 2016 election. Furthermore, Ohr told the FBI he knew Steele was a foreigner “desperate” to stop a Trump presidency, FBI memos show.

With his seniority inside DOJ, Ohr quickly got Steele’s information to the FBI’s deputy director, Andrew McCabe, and three top DOJ supervisors, despite the red flags.

Before long, Steele was working as a confidential informant for the bureau, and his dossier was used to secure a surveillance warrant targeting the Trump campaign weeks before Election Day.

When Steele got fired Nov. 1, 2016, by the FBI for leaking to the media, Ohr became a conduit for the bureau to keep getting information from Steele for months. Ohr met at least 12 times in late 2016 and 2017 with FBI agents to provide new intel from the British spy. In other words, Ohr transitioned from being a DOJ supervisor to a backdoor source for the FBI to receive information from a terminated source.

And he didn’t stop there.

Records released this week, thanks to litigation by the conservative group Judicial Watch, show the senior DOJ official took at least two research files from his wife and her Fusion GPS work and provided them to FBI agents investigating Trump. One alleged that unverified ties existed between the Trump organization and Russian mobsters; the other provided a timeline alleging wrongdoing by former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort.

Nellie Ohr testified to Congress that some of her anti-Trump information came from foreign officials in Ukraine, including a parliamentary member highly critical of Manafort.

Examination of the Nellie Ohr documents given to the FBI shows some of her source material also came from former Ukrainian presidential candidate Yulia Tymoshenko and a lawsuit she filed against Manafort.

Why is that significant? Tymoshenko and Hillary Clinton had a simpatico relationship after the former secretary of State went out of her way in January 2013 to advocate for Tymoshenko’s release from prison on corruption charges.

So, Bruce Ohr became a conduit of information not only for intelligence from Clinton’s British opposition-researcher but also from his wife’s curation of evidence from a Clinton foreign ally and Manafort enemy inside Ukraine. Talk about foreign influence in a U.S. election!

To Ohr’s credit, he disclosed his potential conflict of interest involving his wife to DOJ officials. To DOJ’s discredit, he was allowed to act as a source for both his wife and Steele anyway.

Ohr also didn’t get compensated as a paid informant, like the TSA workers. But documents show a curious thing happened during the time he began peddling the anti-Trump intelligence from his wife and Steele: His annual performance bonus doubled from about $14,000 in November 2015 to $28,000 in November 2016.

The blurred line between government official and informer/source didn’t stop with Ohr. Former FBI General Counsel James Baker also admitted he took dirt on Trump from DNC lawyer Michael Sussmann in summer 2016 and gave it to the agents investigating the Trump campaign.

The ultimate consequence — some might argue folly — of all these blurred lines is most easily exposed in an often overlooked document from the Russia probe.

I’ve written that the FBI kept a spreadsheet showing almost all of what Steele provided agents and Ohr on Russia-Trump dirt turned out to be unverified, disproven or nothing more than internet rumors. But when the FBI closed its paperwork on Steele in 2018, a professional intelligence analyst concluded in his human source validation report that the bureau assessed it had only “medium confidence” in Steele and that his intelligence could only be “minimally” verified.

In other words, his intelligence wasn’t very good. And yet, America spent nearly three years in turmoil only to learn that Steele’s Trump-Russia allegations — paid by Clinton and propagated by Ohr — were not true.

The tales of Bruce and Nellie Ohr, Christopher Steele, Yulia Tymoshenko, and those DEA and TSA agents raise a stark warning: The lines between government officials and informants, unverified political dirt and real intelligence, personal interest and law enforcement, became too blurred for the Justice Department’s own good.

That’s a problem sorely in need of fixing.

(Alastair Pike/AFP/Getty Images)

A report by the State Department’s inspector general concludes that leadership of a leading department bureau mistreated and harassed staffers, accused them of political disloyalty to the Trump administration, and retaliated against them.

In response to repeated counseling by more senior State officials that he address staff concerns, the report concluded, Kevin Moley, assistant secretary for international affairs, “did not take significant action.”

The report, released Thursday, is a sweeping condemnation of Moley and more specifically of his former senior adviser, Mari Stull. A former lobbyist and consultant for international food and agriculture interests, Stull left the department in January following press reports that, among other things, she had compiled a list of staffers deemed insufficiently loyal to the Trump administration.

The 30-page report — based on what it said were interviews with dozens of current and former employees, as well as documents — chronicled numerous episodes of Stull berating and belittling employees, and Moley’s repeated failure to deal with complaints reported to him.

Both Stull and Moley, it said, “frequently berated employees, raised their voices, and generally engaged in unprofessional behavior toward staff,” and reportedly moved to retaliate against those who had held their jobs under the previous administration.

Stull, it said, referred to some employees as “Obama holdovers,” “traitors,” or “disloyal,” and accused some of being part of the “Deep State” and the “swamp” — terms that President Trump has used to refer to federal employees. All of those so accused, the report said, were career staffers and not political appointees.

Some staffers said Moley accused them of “undermining the President’s agenda,” the report said.

In a response appended to the report, Moley said he had no recollection of much of the counseling, and said the description of his behavior with employees “does not represent the person I am or have ever been.” He said accounts of the departure of two senior bureau officials was inaccurate, and that he had not witnessed Stull’s reported behavior.

Stull, the report said, declined to speak to investigators.

Recommendations included in the report advised Undersecretary of Political Affairs David Hale, who supervises the international affairs bureau, to develop a “corrective action plan to address the leadership and management deficiencies,” and to consider other action, “including disciplinary action.”

The State Department response, contained in the report and repeated Thursday by a Department spokesman, accepted the recommendations. Noting that Stull was “no longer with the Department,” it said that “with regard to the second employee,” Moley, it would submit a “corrective action plan” within 60 days.

Moley served in a number of government positions in previous administrations, including as permanent U.S. representative to the Geneva-based United Nations office working with international organizations under former president George W. Bush.

The State Department’s international organizations bureau is in charge of U.S. relations with international organizations. Although Moley was nominated for the position under secretary of state Rex Tillerson, he was unanimously confirmed by the Senate a week after Trump fired Tillerson in March 2018. Stull was appointed by Moley in April of that year — as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took over the Department — and left last January.

After Politico first published reports of personnel problems in the bureau in July 2018, congressional Democrats raised concerns with Pompeo. The secretary, the report said, referred the matter to the inspector general, which was already investigating what it said were “similar issues involving the Office of the Secretary.”

Inspector General Steve Linick later told Congress that he had decided to separate the matter into two reports — one on the international organizations bureau, and the other on those portions of the Department that reported directly to the secretary’s office. The latter report has not yet been released."

The pressure from Trump revealed a more forceful West Wing role in the highly controversial decision. Mnuchin had repeatedly refused to designate China as a currency manipulator because China’s currency moves didn’t meet the Treasury Department’s established criteria for that action.

But Trump exerted immense pressure on Mnuchin earlier this month, after the Chinese let their currency, the yuan, cross a symbolic threshold that it had not passed in some time.

This came after an escalation in the U.S.-China trade conflict, with Trump announcing he would be putting a 10 percent tariff on $300 billion in additional Chinese exports and China pledging retaliation. (This week, Trump delayed some of those new tariffs out of concern for what they would to do the U.S. economy during the holiday period.)

[‘It could get very serious’: Why some analysts fear a U.S.-China currency war]

The Chinese yuan has been weakening this year, with differing explanations as to why. Trump has alleged that the Chinese government has intentionally weakened its currency to gain an advantage over U.S. companies. When a country weakens its currency, it makes its exports cheaper and more competitive.

But a number of international economic experts have said that the Chinese currency has weakened because of independent market forces, including a worsening of the Chinese economy. The Treasury Department had declined as recently as May to name China a currency manipulator, even though Trump has raised concerns since before he was president.

There are two federal laws that dictate the treasury secretary’s power to label certain countries as currency manipulators. Currency ma­nipu­la­tion often draws a strong international response, because it can skew currency and trade markets and create distortions in how goods flow around the world. The laws are meant to protect the process from political interference, and they set out specific criteria that must be met in order for the designations to occur.

In the Aug. 5 designation, Treasury Department officials did not specify what had changed after their May 28 announcement that cleared China. Instead, they pointed to public statements from the Chinese government as a way of affirming an active government role in controlling the currency.

“In recent days, China has taken concrete steps to devalue its currency, while maintaining substantial foreign exchange reserves despite active use of such tools in the past,” the Treasury Department said. “The context of these actions and the implausibility of China’s market stability rationale confirm that the purpose of China’s currency devaluation is to gain an unfair competitive advantage in international trade.”

White House and Treasury Department spokesmen declined to comment.

One of the people with knowledge of Trump’s pressure on Mnuchin said the White House wanted China labeled as a currency manipulator so that it might prod Chinese officials back to the negotiating table. This has proved unsuccessful so far. Instead, it has inflamed tensions between the countries.

The three people spoke to The Washington Post on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to reveal the discussions.

As a practical matter, labeling China as a currency manipulator simply begins a process of discussions between the Treasury Department and the International Monetary Fund, though the IMF has declined to agree with the designation.

Trump has increasingly complained that the strong U.S. dollar is hurting the U.S. economy. He has blamed this dynamic both on the Chinese government and the Federal Reserve, though many businesses and investors have said it is a result of the White House’s adversarial trade agenda."

"FBI 'indifferent' to possible China hack of Hillary Clinton's server, as State Department fought to protect her, interviews suggest",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fbi-indifferent-to-possible-china-hack-of-hillary-clintons-server-as-state-department-fought-to-protect-her-interviews-suggest,"Interviews with intelligence community officials have revealed that senior FBI leaders ""seemed indifferent to evidence of a possible intrusion by a foreign adversary"" into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s non-government email server, and that State Department officials allegedly sought to ""downgrade classified material found on the server,"" according to Senate investigators still probing the matter.

The information was contained in a letter and interview transcripts sent Monday by the majority staff on the Senate Finance and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committees to senior Senate Republicans including Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. The letter also noted that “neither the committees nor the FBI were able to confirm whether an intrusion into the server occurred.""

The review began after two August 2018 news articles ""alleged that a Chinese state-owned company hacked former Secretary Clinton’s nongovernment server and inserted code that forwarded nearly all of her emails to the foreign company,"" the letter stated, citing an article in The Daily Caller, and a later piece by Fox News.

'OMG' -- TOP CLINTON AIDE STUNNED BY APPARENT ATTEMPT TO HACK SERVER IN MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

A source briefed on the matter confirmed to Fox News at the time that the Office of the Intelligence Community Inspector General (ICIG) was so concerned by the revelation that officials drove over to the FBI to inform agents -- including anti-Trump agent Peter Strzok -- of the development soon after it was discovered via the emails' metadata in late 2015 or early 2016.

The source said the hack was from a Chinese company, describing it as a front for Chinese intelligence.

The letter to Grassley continued: ""The reporting indicated that two Intelligence Community Inspector General [ICIG] officials – Frank Rucker and Jeanette McMillian – discovered the code and brought the possible intrusion to the attention of the FBI.""

In a December 2018 interview with Senate investigators concerning the reporting on the potential foreign hack, Rucker said Strzok -- then the deputy assistant director of the FBI’s counterintelligence division in charge of the Clinton investigation -- seemed ""aloof and dismissive.""

And Strzok didn't ask many questions, according to Rucker.

McMillian, meanwhile, said FBI employees were ""poker-faced"" during the roughly hourlong meeting about the potential breach, even though both the CIA and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) had ""significant equities"" in the information contained on the server.

STATE DEPT IDENTIFIES 23 VIOLATIONS, 'MULTIPLE SECURITY VIOLATIONS' AMID ONGOING REVIEW OF CLINTON EMAILS

The FBI did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.

McMillian told investigators the episode began when Rucker identified an email address in Clinton's email metadata as a potential ""live dropbox"" for all her emails, which a foreign actor could access.

When Rucker then Googled the email address on the suggestion of then-ICIG Charles McCullough, the name of a Chinese company, ""Shandong Carter Heavy Industry Machinery,"" popped up -- leading Rucker and McCullough to suspect Chinese involvement, according to Rucker's interview with investigators.

In April, the ICIG and Justice Department IG determined that the address apparently matched the one that former Clinton technology aide Paul Combetta -- who managed her server and thoroughly deleted a slew of her emails -- had created as a ""dummy"" to create backups of Clinton's emails.

However, the DOJ IG and ICIG said they “did not identify any information obtained by the FBI during the [Clinton email] Midyear investigation reflecting that Combetta’s dummy email account was associated with a Chinese company or the Chinese government.""

Throughout, according to McMillian's remarks to Senate investigators, FBI brass generally seemed ""impressed"" with Rucker's technical abilities in finding the apparent breach, and apparently took the issue seriously. McMillian specifically said Strzok had found the email account's presence in Clinton's metadata ""strange.""

McMillian said she made sure to tell the FBI that the ICIG was not trying to usurp the FBI's authority after bureau officials asked how it had found information about the potential breach. The FBI made clear the ICIG would provide information to the bureau, but not the other way around, McMillian and Rucker said.

A May 2016 email from Strzok, obtained by Fox News last year, said “we know foreign actors obtained access” to some Clinton emails, including at least one “secret” message “via compromises of the private email accounts” of Clinton staffers.

Strzok, earlier this month, filed a lawsuit against the bureau and the Justice Department – arguing that the FBI caved to the “unrelenting pressure” of the president when it fired him.

DOJ IG Michael Horowitz previously concluded that although he could not prove Strzok had let his political bias influence official decisions during the Clinton email investigation, he did not have confidence that Strzok had acted without bias at critical junctures in the probe.

In text messages with his then-lover, FBI lawyer Lisa Page, Strzok said on his government-issued phone that ""we'll stop"" Trump from becoming president, and called Trump supporters ""retarded.""

Separately, Rucker and McMillian offered more details into reports that the State Department sought to cover for Clinton by downgrading the classification of emails on the server.

FBI SCRAMBLED TO ANSWER TO CLINTON LAWYER IN DAYS BEFORE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, NEW DOCS REVEAL

“At first, State fought back against the intelligence community being involved,"" McMillian told investigators, before noting that they eventually relented.

McMillian claimed that two State Department employees tried to shield some of Clinton's emails from disclosure under the ""deliberative process"" exemption under the Freedom of Information Act -- rather than labeling the emails classified.

The employees, Austin Evers and Catherine Duval, did not immediately return Fox News' request for comment. Evers has since launched the organization American Oversight along with other former Obama administration officials. The group says it is devoted to uncovering ethics issues in the Trump administration.

Rucker also claimed that then-Ambassador Patrick Kennedy questioned ""whether certain emails should be provided to the intelligence community for review and fighting against classifying other emails,"" according to the Senate investigators.

The State Department didn't respond to Fox News' request for comment.

Interviews released in 2016, known as 302s, first revealed the serious allegation that Kennedy applied pressure to subordinates to change classified email codes so they would be shielded from Congress and the public.

Fox News was told as far back as August 2015 that Kennedy was running interference on Capitol Hill. But Kennedy, in his FBI interview on Dec. 21, 2015, “categorically rejected” allegations of classified code tampering.

“In return for altering the classification, the possibility of additional slots for the FBI at missions overseas was discussed,” then-House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, now a Fox News contributor, said at the time.

In a lengthy statement, the FBI denied it had agreed to declassify any emails in exchange for more overseas slots from the State Department.

Barr announced Saturday that he had directed the FBI and the DOJ inspector general (IG) to investigate Epstein’s apparent suicide at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in Manhattan over the weekend, which came while he awaited trial on sex trafficking and abuse charges.

“We fully support your call for a thorough investigation of the circumstances surrounding Mr. Epstein’s death. True accountability, however, especially for the victims of Mr. Epstein, requires full transparency,” Johnson and Grassley wrote in a letter to the attorney general.

“For that reason, we ask for your commitment to make the results of the FBI and IG investigations public as soon as they are completed,” they added, also requesting the DOJ keep them apprised of any progress the investigation makes along the way.

Barr said he was “appalled” and “angry” over the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death, saying in public comments Monday that the DOJ was aware of “serious irregularities” at the Manhattan prison.

“We are now learning of serious irregularities at this facility that are deeply concerning and demand a thorough investigation,” Barr said Monday. “The FBI and the Office of Inspector General are doing just that.”

Epstein, who in 2008 was convicted on separate sexual misconduct charges, was arrested last month over allegedly leading a sex trafficking operation dealing in underage girls from 2002 to 2005.

Lawmakers have demanded answers as to why Epstein, who had been placed on suicide watch back in late July after reportedly being found with marks on his neck, was not more closely monitored. Officials have also expressed concern about reports of misconduct at the prison, including that guards in Epstein’s unit fell asleep and failed to check on him for roughly three hours during the time when he is believed to have hanged himself.

On Tuesday, the DOJ ordered the Bureau of Prisons to temporarily reassign the MCC warden amid the ongoing probe."
Acting DHS secretary on ICE facility attack in Texas: Rhetoric must be toned down,https://www.foxnews.com,"['David Montanaro', 'David Montanaro Is A Senior Editor With Fox News.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/acting-dhs-secretary-ice-facility-attack-texas,"Acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan said Wednesday on ""Fox & Friends"" that the latest attack on an ICE facility in Texas could be the result of politicians and pundits ""demonizing"" federal agents for enforcing existing laws.

After shots were fired into an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office and another facility associated with the agency in San Antonio, Texas, early Tuesday, ICE said in a statement that, ""Political rhetoric and misinformation that various politicians, media outlets and activist groups recklessly disseminate to the American people regarding the ICE mission only serve to further encourage these violent acts.""

McAleenan agreed, calling on those who oppose the Trump administration's policies to tone down their rhetoric before someone gets hurt, noting that this is the fourth such incident targeting an ICE facility.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION BOOSTS ABILITY TO DENY GREEN CARDS TO IMMIGRANTS USING WELFARE PROGRAMS

""I think the environment where we're demonizing law enforcement for doing their jobs, for enforcing the laws on the books, is concerning, it can be dangerous and it can result in people taking actions that are not supported by the facts,"" he said.

The FBI is investigating the ""targeted attack"" in which shots were fired at around 3 a.m. at an ICE building where two floors house administrative and executive offices, according to the San Antonio Express-News. The outlet reported another shooting occurred at a separate facility where an ICE contractor is located.

The Texas attack follows two separate incidents last month, when a man attacked an ICE building in Washington state and protesters raised a Mexican flag at a Colorado ICE facility.

Many on the left renewed their harsh criticism of ICE after 680 “removable aliens” were arrested last week at several Mississippi food processing plants where they were working. It was deemed the largest single-state immigration enforcement operation in U.S. history.

Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said the raids were part of a ""campaign of terror"" by the Trump administration, while the Congressional Hispanic Caucus wrote in a letter to McAleenan that the purpose of the raids was ""to instill fear in Latino and immigrant communities at a time when Latinos are already living in terror.""

McAleenan said progress is being made when it comes to working with Mexico and Central American nations to stem the flow of migrants at the border, but the laws ""in the interior"" must also be enforced, including going after businesses who employ undocumented workers."

Hatewatch alleged that Matthew Gebert ""oversaw the Washington, DC-area chapter of a white nationalist organization, hosted white nationalists at his home and published white nationalist propaganda online."" According to the report, he used a pseudonym -- Coach Finstock -- to express ""a desire to build a country for whites only.""

Tyson aims to reduce USDA involvement in beef inspection at Kansas plant,https://theweek.com,[],08-14-2019,2019,8,https://theweek.com/speedreads/859008/tyson-aims-reduce-usda-involvement-beef-inspection-kansas-plant,"Tyson Foods is requesting that company employees at a Kansas beef plant take over some inspection responsibilities previously held by United States Department of Agriculture officials.

If enacted, the proposal would reduce the number of USDA inspectors present on the line in the factory for ""post-mortem, pre-sortation activities"" regarding food safety and disease conditions, per the proposal. The company's request to the USDA was written in March, and obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request by Food and Water Watch, a company that is suing Tyson, reports NBC News.

The USDA is considering the proposition, reports NBC News, which is in reference to the company's factory in Holcomb, Kansas.

According to the proposal, the requested changes aim to improve efficiency, work toward pathogen reduction, and ""allow better use of Agency's resources"" while providing equal outcomes to current inspection practices.

But consumer advocates are hesitant. Former USDA chief veterinarian Pat Basu told NBC News ""bypassing safeguards"" may result in missed signs of disease, drug injections, or bacteria due to lack of adequate training.

""It could be devastating for the whole country — you cannot turn it over,"" he told NBC News.

This isn't the first time the government has considering bowing out of certain inspection responsibilities. The Obama administration allowed an increase in privatized poultry inspection, reports NBC News, and the Trump administration announced a proposition to establish a ""new voluntary inspection system"" for pork plants.

Did Trump Brag About Crowd Sizes While Past Presidents Consoled Massacre Victims?,https://www.snopes.com,['Dan Macguill'],,,,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-beto-crowds-el-paso-victims/,"In the aftermath of a spate of mass shootings in August 2019, attention turned to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tone in discussing the killings, and the wider issue of gun violence in the United States, as well as his comportment in visiting two of the cities affected, El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio.

Trump was criticized for smiling and offering a thumbs-up gesture while visiting an infant whose parents had been shot to death in a massacre in El Paso, and allegations that the president was using the tragedies as an opportunity to gain political capital extended to unfounded rumors that his administration had hired “fake” medical staff to pose with him at a hospital in Dayton.

On Aug. 9, the left-leaning Facebook page Occupy Democrats posted a meme that purported to highlight a stark difference in tone and decorum between Trump — who supposedly used a visit to El Paso to brag about crowd sizes and snipe at Democratic presidential candidate and former Congressman Beto O’Rourke — and his predecessors in the Oval Office — who purportedly offered words of comfort and solidarity in the aftermath of previous mass shootings.

We received multiple inquires from readers about the accuracy of the meme, which read as follows:

“Littleton, I can only say tonight that the prayers of the American people are with you.” — Bill Clinton, after Columbine. “This is a day of mourning for the Virginia Tech community — and it is a day of sadness for our entire nation.” — George H.W. [sic] Bush. “Here in Newtown, I come to offer the love and prayers of a nation. You are not alone.” — Barack Obama. “Crazy Beto only had like 400 people in a parking lot, they said his crowd was wonderful.” — Deplorable Trump, in El Paso.

The caption of the meme read: “SERIOUSLY, what is WRONG with Trump?!?! He REALLY said this to the El Paso victims.”

The Occupy Democrats meme was a largely accurate recounting of four post-shooting statements made by the four most recent occupants of the White House. (Strictly speaking, Trump was addressing medical staff who had treated victims of the El Paso shooting, rather than the victims themselves, and the second quotation was, apparently in error, attributed to George H.W. Bush, rather than George W. Bush.)

Despite the authenticity of the quotations, the meme presented an incomplete and rather misleading picture of Trump’s overall comportment in visiting El Paso after the August 2019 massacre there. While the president did indulge in side-sniping about a political opponent who had been fiercely critical of him (something his predecessors markedly did not do in similar circumstances), Trump did also offer words of solidarity and comfort to the victims of the August 2019 massacres, their families, and the wider communities affected by the shootings.

Clinton

The first quotation in the meme was taken from remarks Bill Clinton delivered in a White House press conference on April 20, 1999, the day of the Columbine High School massacre in Littleton, Colorado. His speech can be read in full here, and viewed in full in the video below.

In the most relevant section, Clinton said:

“To the families who have lost their loved ones, to the parents who have lost their beloved children, to the wounded children and their families, to the people of the community of Littleton, I can only say tonight that the prayers of the American people are with you.”

﻿

Bush

The second quotation in the meme came from a speech that George W. Bush gave on April 17, 2007, during a convocation at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia, the day after a student shot to death 32 people on that campus. The full text of his speech is available here, and it can be watched in full below.

In the section quoted by Occupy Democrats, Bush said:

“Laura and I have come to Blacksburg today with hearts full of sorrow. This is a day of mourning for the Virginia Tech community, and it is a day of sadness for our entire nation. We’ve come to express our sympathy. In this time of anguish, I hope you know that people all over this country are thinking about you and asking God to provide comfort for all who have been affected.”

Obama

The third quotation in the meme was taken from a speech Barack Obama gave during an interfaith vigil at Newtown High School on Dec. 16, 2012 — two days after a shooting massacre at nearby Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut.

The speech can be read in full here, and watched in full in the video below. During the relevant section, Obama said:

“Here in Newtown, I come to offer the love and prayers of a nation. I am very mindful that mere words cannot match the depths of your sorrow, nor can they heal your wounded hearts. I can only hope it helps for you to know that you’re not alone in your grief. That our world, too, has been torn apart. That all across this land of ours, we have wept with you, and we’ve pulled our children tight. And you must know that whatever measure of comfort we can provide, we will provide. Whatever portion of sadness that we can share with you, to ease this heavy load, we will gladly bear it. Newtown, you are not alone.”

Trump

The fourth and final quotation in the meme consisted of remarks Trump made while talking to hospital staff during a visit to University Medical Center in El Paso on Aug. 7, 2019, four days after a mass shooting at a Walmart store in that city.

Police in El Paso have linked the suspected shooter, Patrick Crusius, to a white nationalist manifesto posted online shortly before the massacre began. The author of the manifesto decried what he characterized as a “Hispanic invasion of Texas” and espoused the discredited “white genocide” theory.

Although the manifesto’s author, thought by El Paso police to be the suspected Walmart shooter, stipulated that his anti-immigrant sentiment predated the elevation of Trump to the presidency, some observers have pointed out areas of overlap between how the president talks about immigration and immigrants, and how the manifesto addressed them.

Others, including Democratic politicians and long-standing critics of the president, went further in connecting Trump to the manifesto and the El Paso shooting. U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) said the manifesto was so similar to Trump’s rhetoric that it “could have been written by the people that write Trump’s speeches.” O’Rourke described the massacre as “an act of terror inspired by [Trump’s] racism.”

Conventional news media were not permitted to accompany the president and first lady Melania Trump on their visits with shooting victims, families and medical staff in Dayton and El Paso on Aug. 7, but amateur footage emerged later that showed Trump addressing medical professionals at University Medical Center in El Paso.

In the short clip, the president commended the work done by hospital staff in caring for the victims of the shooting, saying “the job you’ve done is incredible,” and “it’s an honor to be with you.” Without any obvious reason or prompt, Trump then shifted to talking about a rally he had held in El Paso in February 2019 (although he mentioned “three months ago,” Trump’s most recent rally in the city was in February, six months earlier):

“I was here three months ago and we made a speech and we had a — what was the name of the arena? — that place was packed … That was some crowd, and we had twice the number outside. And then you had this crazy Beto — Beto had like 400 people in a parking lot, they said, ‘His crowd was wonderful!’ …”

Trump was referring in those remarks to a counter-protest held in response to his Feb. 11 rally at the El Paso County Coliseum. The counter-protest was led by O’Rourke and was estimated to have had between 7,000 and 15,000 attendees — considerably more than the “400 people in a parking lot” claimed by Trump.

During his rally, Trump thanked the El Paso fire department for allowing 10,000 of his supporters to enter the arena, despite the venue’s having a capacity of 6,500. In response, a spokesperson for the fire department corrected the president, insisting that no special permission had been given, and the number of attendees inside the arena was no greater than its capacity. At other times, Trump claimed that as many as 35,000 supporters had come to the rally, taking into account those outside the arena.

For an unknown reason, Trump decided to re-open that six-month-old dispute and grievance over crowd sizes and news coverage, while meeting and praising hospital staff who had treated and cared for the victims of a mass shooting. That struck some observers as grossly inappropriate, and we found no record of former Presidents Obama, Clinton or Bush having engaged in similar behavior while meeting the victims of past shootings or the medical professionals who had treated them.

However, Trump’s “crazy Beto” aside was not the extent of his remarks on the massacres in Dayton and El Paso, and the Occupy Democrats meme misled readers by cherry-picking that unscripted moment and comparing it with remarks made by previous presidents from behind a podium, during prepared speeches.

In a White House address on Aug. 5, Trump offered sentiments of solidarity and comfort to the victims of the Dayton and El Paso shootings and their families:

“The First Lady and I join all Americans in praying and grieving for the victims, their families, and the survivors. We will stand by their side forever. We will never forget. These barbaric slaughters are an assault upon our communities, an attack upon our nation, and a crime against all of humanity. We are outraged and sickened by this monstrous evil — the cruelty, the hatred, the malice, the bloodshed, the terror. Our hearts are shattered for every family whose parents, children, husbands and wives were ripped from their arms and their lives. America weeps for the fallen.

“We are a loving nation, and our children are entitled to grow up in a just, peaceful and loving society. Together, we lock arms to shoulder the grief. We ask God in heaven to ease the anguish of those who suffer, and we vow to act with urgent resolve.”

﻿

The salient difference between Trump and his three most recent predecessors was not that they gave “presidential” speeches after mass shootings, because Trump, too, gave a relatively dignified speech from the White House. The key difference, in the context of the Occupy Democrats meme, was in Trump’s comportment and behavior when he stepped away from the podium. We therefore rate the truth of this meme as “Mixture.”"
Exclusive: Google Insider Turns Over 950 Pages Of Docs And Laptop To DOJ,https://saraacarter.com,[],08-13-2019,2019,8,https://saraacarter.com/exclusive-google-insider-turns-over-950-pages-of-docs-and-laptop-to-doj/,"A former Google insider claiming the company created algorithms to hide its political bias within artificial intelligence platforms – in effect targeting particular words, phrases and contexts to promote, alter, reference or manipulate perceptions of Internet content – delivered roughly 950 pages of documents to the Department of Justice’s Antitrust division Friday.

The former Google insider, who has already spoken in to the nonprofit organization Project Veritas, met with SaraACarter.com on several occasions last week. He was interviewed in silhouette, to conceal his identity, in group’s latest film, which they say exposes bias inside the social media platform.

Several weeks prior, the insider mailed a laptop to the DOJ containing the same information delivered on Friday, they said. The former insider is choosing to remain anonymous until Project Verita’s James O’Keefe reveals his identity tomorrow (Wednesday).

He told this reporter on his recent trip to Washington D.C. that the documents he turned over to the Justice Department will provide proof that Google has been manipulating the algorithms and the evidence of how it was done, the insider said.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai told the House Judiciary Committee in December, 2018, that the search engine was not biased against conservatives. Pichai explained what algorithm’s are said Google’s algorithm was not offensive to conservatives because its artificial intelligence does not operate in that manner. He told lawmakers, “things like relevance, freshness, popularity, how other people are using it” are what drives the search results. Pichai said even if his programmers were anti-Republican, the process is so intricate that the artificial intelligence could not be manipulated and it was to complicated to train the algorithm to fit their bias.

Google did not immediately respond for comment on the insider’s claims, however, this story will be updated if comment is provided.

The insider says Google is aware most people are unaware or not knowledgeable about these advanced IT systems and therefore unable to determine who is telling the truth.

“I honestly think that a free market can fix this issue,” he told this reporter at a meeting in Washington D.C. “The issue is that the free market has been distorted and what’s happened is that the distortion is so grotesque and the engineering is so repulsive, all we need to do is just expose what’s going on. People can hear that it is bad but that can be bias. But when they see what Google has actually written with the documents, this will actually be taught in universities of what totalitarian states can do with this type of capability.”

“It will be so revolting that it doesn’t matter what the solution is, a solution will just form as a reaction to this manipulation they have done,” the Google insider said.

He said he’s asked himself many times if he’s overreacting “and every time I simply look back at the documents and realize that I am not.”

“It’s that bad,” he said. “Disclosing Google’s own words to the American public is something I am, must do, if I am to consider myself a good person. The world that google is building is not a place I, or you or our children want to live in.”

— James O'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) August 13, 2019

Another Google insider, who has come forward already, told O’Keefe and other media outlets recently that it is the programers at Google who use the algorithms to manipulate the information to advance its leftist agenda.

Greg Coppola, a software engineer, told Project Veritas that he doesn’t “have a smoking gun.”

However, “I’ve just been coding since I was ten, I have a Ph.D., I have five years of experience at Google, and I just know how algorithms are. They don’t write themselves. We write them to make them do what we want them to do.”

“I look at Search and I look at Google News, and I see what it’s doing,” he said. “I see Google executives go to Congress and say … that it’s not political, and I’m just so sure that that’s not true.”

Department of Justice officials declined to comment on the document dump. But SaraACarter.com has reviewed the documents and obtained proof from the Google insider that the documents were delivered to the DOJ.

The unnamed Google insider first spoke to O’Keefe’s Project Veritas. O’Keefe has been criticized by the left for outing the political bias of executives and employees of Google and other social media companies.

In the nonprofits most recent video, Project Veritas uses their undercover techniques to get Google employees to talk openly about their disdain for Trump and how their artificial intelligence operates.

Jenn Gennai, who heads Google’s Responsible Innovation Team, did not know she was being filmed by O’Keefe’s group. She told the undercover journalist that “the reason we launched our AI principals is because we’re not putting our line in the sand. They were not saying what’s fair and what’s equitable so we’re like, well we’re a big company, we’re going to say it.”"
DHS wants to shift money to immigration enforcement: report,https://thehill.com,[],08-14-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/latino/457497-dhs-wants-to-shift-money-to-immigration-enforcement-report,"The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reportedly wants to shift funds to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) by moving money from its other accounts, Politico reported Wednesday, citing two House aides and a congressional office.

The aides reportedly said that congressional appropriators are looking at a request to reallocate more funds to ICE. The news outlet reported that it was not clear how much money the department aims to redirect, what it would be used for or whether such a request needs Congress's approval.

The Hill has reached out to DHS and ICE for comment.

Day 3: Eastern Corn Belt Yield Forecasts Break Sharply From USDA,https://www.dtnpf.com,['Katie Dehlinger'],08-15-2019,2019,8,https://www.dtnpf.com/agriculture/web/ag/crops/article/2019/08/15/day-3-eastern-corn-belt-yield-break,"""I think it's spot on,"" he said. ""We put our corn in under subpar conditions, just like everyone else, and it's been backpedaling ever since.""

Since the wet spring ended, his region has received a scant 1.5 inches of rain in July and only two-tenths of an inch in August. During pollination, hot-and-dry weather took its toll. ""A quarter of the ears I pulled were zippered. The ground is hard as a rock, and there are cracks an inch to half-an-inch deep,"" he said.

Gro's county-level yield map for soybeans pinpoints the state's potential yield average at 46 bpa, down 29% from last year and 9 bushels lower than USDA's August estimate. Most soybean yields in the northern two-thirds of the state are down 10 to 15 bpa from last year in Gro's maps.

Young actually thinks these yield estimates are too optimistic for his region.

""I think soybeans could be a worse story than corn,"" he said. ""We're starting to see spider mites showing up because we've been so dry. So many flowers are brown -- you'll have a pod with decent-sized soybeans sitting right next to a brown flower with no pod on it, or a pod the size of your pinky nail.""

Both Young's corn and soybean fields were planted three weeks later than normal -- which was a common experience for Illinois farmers, DTN's Anderson noted.

""The slow start has progress running well behind average; corn was finally almost finished pollination during the Aug. 11 weekend, but 20% of the Illinois soybeans had yet to bloom,"" he said.

Young urged growers to venture deep into their fields in the weeks ahead to get a better grasp on the true yield potential of their crop, particularly cornfields.

""Most of the industry's focus has been on areas already committed to prevented planting,"" he said. ""We've been assuming the rest of it was OK, because it came up quickly and it looked like it pollinated. But the ears I pulled that were zippered actually all looked decent in the husks before I pulled them down. People need to get out and look.""

INDIANA

Flooded and ponded ground was a common sight in Indiana this spring, and it shows up as dark-brown swaths on Gro's NDVI maps. The effect is especially prominent in central, eastern and southern parts of the state. See the map here: https://app.gro-intelligence.com/….

""Indiana got unloaded on during the spring, with precipitation in the March-April-May time frame coming in ninth-wettest in 125 years of record-keeping,"" Anderson said.

As a result of the spring weather, more than 700,000 acres of the corn across the state went unplanted, along with 230,000 acres of soybeans, according to the latest Farm Services Agency data.

""Spring temperatures were near average, but soils had no chance to dry out with the consistent rain,"" Anderson said. ""Then, to add to crop stress, the faucet turned off. Mid-July to mid-August, rain has been less than half the normal amount over most of the state. Usually, this sort of trend is a relatively minor swing. But a lot of corn and soybean acreage has shallow roots this year because of wet ground; so this drier trend is very unwelcome.""

In northwestern Indiana's Newton County, Kurt Line said they were irrigating pretty hard until earlier this week when they got an inch or two of rain. The majority of corn in his area was planted in June, although some was planted in April and May in between rains. He said the late start to the growing season took the top end off yield potential.

Gro's county yield maps show a similar trend. The statewide average corn yield is on track to hit 138 bpa, a 27% tumble from USDA's final 189-bpa yield last year. In 2018, a vast majority of counties in Indiana had yield potential above 180 bpa. This year, the highest forecast yield is 178 bpa in Vermillion County, and in the parts of the state hit hardest this spring, yields aren't expected to top 100 bpa. See the county maps here: https://app.gro-intelligence.com/….

Line said Gro's forecast for 161 bpa for Newton County seems a little low to him.

""What I've been in recently, I'm still optimistic. If we get the right weather the rest of the way, we could maybe have a close-to-normal corn crop,"" he said, adding that a lot of the crop is at risk if there's an early frost.

As of the weekend of Aug. 11, 21% of the corn crop hasn't pollinated yet and 30% of the soybean crop hasn't bloomed.

Gro's soybean yield forecast of 46 bpa is 21% lower than last year's final USDA yield of 58.5 bpa. The differences from 2018 are stark. Last year, the lowest county average was 49 bpa while the majority of the state saw yields in the upper 50s and lower 60s. This year, the bulk of the state is forecast to have yields from the mid-30s to mid-40s, with a low of 34 bpa in Hamilton County just north of Indianapolis. The highest forecast is in Jasper County at 55 bpa.

That's just east of Line's farm, where Gro forecasts a county yield of 53 bpa.

""I would take the under,"" he said. There are a lot of holes in the bean fields, including areas that were replanted and then drowned out again. ""They seemed to struggle to get much growth until just the last couple of weeks. They finally looks like beans should, but we sure lost a lot of opportunity to capture sunlight. We were still planting beans on the longest day of the year.""

OHIO

Much of Ohio saw record-setting rainfall this spring, and as a result, almost 1.5 million acres -- 880,000 of it corn and almost 600,000 of it soybeans -- went unplanted.

""The NDVI image shows how the heavy spring rain lashed the state -- almost the entire western half of Ohio has zero, or close to it, for the vegetation anomaly reading. And the west-central and northwestern sectors are almost entirely zeroed out in the NDVI analysis,"" Anderson said. You can see the map here: https://app.gro-intelligence.com/….

The rain continued in June, and USDA's crop progress values show just how late everything was planted in Ohio: 29% of the corn crop hadn't pollinated as of the weekend of Aug. 11 and 31% of the soybeans hadn't yet bloomed. Typically, both of those phases are almost finished.

This year, Gro's Ohio yield forecast is 27% lower than last year at 136 bpa. Typically, the western half of Ohio has the strongest yields in the state, and last year, the averages ran from around 185 bpa to 200 bpa. This year, many of those county yield forecasts are closer to 120 bpa.

Logan County, Ohio, farmer Bill Bayliss said it's hard to even speculate about the corn crop this year. He got some corn planted in early June and then it got wet again.

Anderson said Ohio had the eighth-wettest June in 125 years of record keeping.

But in recent weeks, the tap has turned off, and Bayliss said his farm hasn't seen measurable precipitation in at least three weeks. His corn is in the process of pollinating.

""It's a very inopportune time to be trying to pollinate as hot and as dry as it is,"" he said, adding that he wouldn't be surprised by Gro's 121-bpa average for his county.

On soybeans, Gro's statewide yield forecast of 42 bpa is also 27% below last year. Yields in the state's northwest region range from the upper-20s to mid-40s, a sharp departure from last year's mid-50s to low-60s.

Bayliss planted soybeans until the beginning of July and said his farm may not make Gro's 36-bpa estimate for his county.

""They're podded, but they're knee high at the best,"" he said. ""That field should have been at least waist high at this time of year. Between getting planted late and turning dry, it's just a bad combination.""

State Dept. 'deeply concerned' by China threats as unrest in Hong Kong grows,https://www.politico.com,['Caitlin Oprysko'],08-14-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/14/engel-mccaul-hong-kong-china-1463442,"House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Rep. Eliot Engel (left) and Rep. Michael McCaul wrote that the protests are ""the result of Beijing’s successive violations of their commitment to honor the will of the people of Hong Kong.” | Jose Luis Magana/AP Photo congress State Dept. 'deeply concerned' by China threats as unrest in Hong Kong grows

Bipartisan U.S. concern over the discord in Hong Kong is growing, as the State Department on Wednesday issued a travel warning for the region and expressed support for pro-democracy demonstrators there.

The bipartisan leaders of the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday condemned Chinese authorities' hostility to protesters and threats of military intervention in a joint statement, warning that should Beijing attempt to use force to shut down peaceful demonstrations, they “would be met with universal condemnation and swift consequences.”

Story Continued Below

“The House Foreign Affairs Committee has called upon Beijing to cease encroaching on Hong Kong’s autonomy — it is Beijing’s actions that are at the root of the frustration among the people of Hong Kong. No foreign powers are fomenting this dissent,” Chairman Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) and ranking member Michael McCaul (R-Texas) wrote. ""It is the result of Beijing’s successive violations of their commitment to honor the will of the people of Hong Kong.”

Engel and McCaul expressed their “deep respect for the brave efforts of Hong Kong people from every walk of life who have demonstrated their clear desire for freedom, democracy, and the rule of law.”

Separately, the State Department on Wednesday issued a travel advisory for Hong Kong due to the unrest, instructing travelers to exercise increased caution.

""Police have used a variety of crowd control measures, including the deployment of tear gas. The protests and confrontations have spilled over into neighborhoods other than those where the police have permitted marches or rallies,"" the notice reads.

The protests began earlier this spring in opposition to a since-suspended plan that would allow extraditions to mainland China. They've since grown broader in scope and have intensified in recent months leading up to this week, when demonstrators occupied the Hong Kong airport and effectively blocked air travel to and from the airport for two days in a row. Police there have grown increasingly confrontational, and clashes broke out periodically Tuesday. Beijing called the skirmishes ""a near-terrorist act.""

Satellite images have emerged purporting to show Chinese troops gathering near the border with Hong Kong, raising worries of a potential violent conflict. Lawmakers have compared the simmering tensions to the 1989 massacre of hundreds of peaceful protesters in Tiananmen Square, warning against a repeat.

A State spokesperson said Wednesday that the department was “deeply concerned” by reports of military movement along the border.

The State Department urged Beijing to abide by its commitments under the treaty that created the “one country, two system” administrative structure that governs Hong Kong. “We encourage China and all parties in Hong Kong to pursue a solution that respects the liberty of Hongkongers and Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy, as enshrined in the Sino-British Joint Declaration,” the spokesperson said.

“We condemn violence and urge all sides to exercise restraint, but remain staunch in our support for freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly in Hong Kong. The ongoing demonstrations in Hong Kong reflect the sentiment of Hongkongers and their broad and legitimate concerns about the erosion of Hong Kong’s autonomy. We categorically reject the false charge of foreign forces as the black hand behind the protests. The continued erosion of Hong Kong’s autonomy puts at risk its long-established special status in international affairs.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday called the recent developments “extremely alarming"" and said that American officials had a responsibility to speak out in defense of the protesters, regardless of the crucial role China plays in American trade. “If America does not speak out for human rights in China because of commercial interests, we lose all moral authority to speak out elsewhere,"" she said.

“To the thousands of young people in Hong Kong who are speaking UP for human rights and speaking OUT against the Communist Party of China: we see you waving the American flag, and we hear you singing our national anthem,” wrote House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. “America stands for freedom. America stands with Hong Kong.”

Some of the strong language has underscored the delicate line U.S. lawmakers must walk — the desire to express support for democracy while not undermining the protesters' legitimacy, something Beijing has repeatedly sought to do.

Chinese propaganda has blamed the U.S. for the protests, suggesting the CIA had been pulling strings behind the scenes. Earlier this week, China's foreign minister accused the U.S. of fomenting dissent among ""anti-China rabble-rousers."" The State Department spokesperson denied U.S. involvement in the pro-democracy protests, where demonstrators have been seen waving American flags.

President Donald Trump has so far maintained some distance from the unrest in Asia, telling reporters on Tuesday: “The Hong Kong thing is a very tough situation. I hope it works out peacefully. I hope nobody gets hurt. I hope nobody gets killed.”

But at the White House, Trump aides have been watching events closely and worry that it could spiral out of control, according to a current and a former White House official.

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross defended Trump’s dovish approach in an interview on CNBC Wednesday, questioning what role the U.S. could play in the conflict.

“This is an internal matter,” Ross said of Trump’s relative neutrality, noting that Trump has made clear he’s monitoring the situation. “He talked about the possibility of troop build-ups — so it’s not that we’re not watching it.”

Lawmakers, meanwhile, have taken a more active stance. In their letter on Wednesday, Engel and McCaul also denounced state-run media publishing information about a U.S. diplomat who met with activists, calling them ""the actions of a 'thuggish regime.'""

"Newark lead crisis: After filters fail, city hands out expired water",https://nj1015.com,['Sergio Bichao'],08-13-2019,2019,8,https://nj1015.com/newark-lead-crisis-after-filters-fail-city-hands-out-expired-water/,"NEWARK — What else could go wrong?

The city on Tuesday had to stop giving out free bottles of water to people affected by lead contamination after learning that the water was past its expiration date.

Although the water is not unsafe to drink, officials had to order replacements.

It was the latest snafu in a years-long crisis involving thousands of households in the state's largest city.

The city began giving out cases of water on Monday after testing showed that the filters that the city has been distributing to homes might not be effective. Lead levels exceeded the safety standards in two of the three homes that were tested. More testing will be done.

Newark has distributed more than 30,000 filters since last year to homes with lead service lines the connect buildings to water mains. The federal Environmental Protection Agency told the city that the filters were effective.

The source water is not contaminated with lead but the chemicals used to treat the water had been causing the lead in the pipes to leach into the water. The problem was discovered in 2017.

The water treatment facility has since changed the chemicals but officials are now worried that reduced use of tap water in the affected households may prevent the anti-corrosion treatment from working because the water has to be flushed from the pipes.

The city distributed 20,000 cases of water on Monday. The state ordered 20,000 replacement cases and another 50,000 cases for Tuesday.

The Natural Resources Defense Council is suing the city in U.S. District Court, arguing that the city has failed to adequately monitor lead levels and that officials should go instruct every resident in person on how to properly install the filters.

Federal lawmakers from New Jersey have asked the EPA to provide more federal resources to help Newark.

In a letter Tuesday to EPA Regional Administrator Peter Lopez, the lawmakers asked the EPA to help distribute bottled water to residents.

""Given your commitment to safeguard the residents of Newark and to advance the goal of protecting public health and the environment, we respectfully request your immediate assistance in identifying any and all options to provide not only technical assistance, but on the ground support and resources in Newark until further analysis is concluded and a solution to these new concerns is implemented,"" according to the letter signed by U.S. Sens. Cory Booker and Bob Menendez and U.S. Reps. Albio Sires and Donald Payne Jr.

DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan: Border Crossings Down 43 Percent Since May,https://www.nationalreview.com,"['Mairead Mcardle', 'John Hirschauer', 'Charles C. W. Cooke', 'William Z.

(James Lawler Duggan/Reuters)

Acting DHS secretary Kevin McAleenan said Wednesday that border crossings have declined 43 percent since May, when arrests between ports of entry at the southern border increased for the fourth straight month to 132,887, up from 99,304 arrests in April.

“So those efforts are making progress, 43 percent reduction in crossings since May,” McAleenan said. “We’re hoping to continue the progress in August.”

McAleenan said DHS is working with Central American countries to protect migrants who need asylum as well as conduct an “aggressive effort against human smugglers,” a project he said “could really change the game.”

“I’ll be going back to Central America next week to try to build on that with El Salvador and Panama and really address this problem as a regional effort,” he said.

The number of immigrants being held at border stations is also down significantly from its June high of 20,000, McAleenan said. “This morning we have less than 4,000, and they’re not staying with us very long. We’re able to repatriate the single adults quickly. The unaccompanied children are going to a better situation with Health and Human Services.”

The acting DHS chief went on to take a shot at what he sees as a toxic political environment “where we’re demonizing law enforcement for doing their jobs,” calling it “concerning.”

There have been several attacks on Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities in recent weeks, including incidents on Tuesday in which shots were fired into two San Antonio facilities. The FBI is investigating those attacks as an “assault on a federal official case.”

“It can be dangerous, and it can result in people taking actions that are not supported by the facts, that are not in response to anything inappropriate that our men and women of ICE and enforcement removal operations are doing,” McAleenan said. “And I think we’ve got to tone that down, absolutely.”"
ANALYSIS: Who and what the Horowitz report is likely to cover,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-14-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/analysis-who-and-what-the-horowitz-report-is-likely-to-cover,"The 448-page report detailing special counsel Robert Mueller's two-year Trump-Russia investigation is public. Next up: Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz's report into how that investigation started.

That report, anticipated to be released after Congress returns from August recess, will come amid an ongoing contentious debate between Republicans who think the government unfairly targeted President Trump and Democrats who believe Trump deserved to be investigated for his alleged ties to Russia.

But what Horowitz's report, which is expected to delve into alleged abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the FBI's use of the salacious and unverified dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele, contains has been held close.

Still, recent developments have offered a sneak preview of the cast of characters who could make appearances when Horowitz explains what his team uncovered.

Former FBI Director James Comey received good news a couple weeks ago when the DOJ decided not to charge him over leaking his memos, despite a criminal referral from Horowitz, who concluded Comey leaked classified information and showed a lack of candor. But the leak inquiry was just a narrow slice of the broader investigation Horowitz launched in March of last year.

Horowitz is likely scrutinizing every aspect of the FISA approval process, and the head of the FBI plays an integral role. Comey signed three of the four FISA warrant applications and renewals targeting former Trump campaign associate Carter Page, who was never charged with wrongdoing, during the Trump-Russia investigation. Comey defended the FBI’s use of the Steele dossier but admitted the dossier wasn't verified when he approved its use, and investigators were still working to verify its contents when he was fired in May 2017. The final FISA renewal happened a month later.

The FISA filings required approval from top members of the FBI and the Justice Department, so other possible targets of Horowitz's inquiry likely included the approvers of the four applications and renewals: Comey; Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates; Dana Boente, the only signatory in active government service and currently Trump’s top lawyer at the FBI; then-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe; and then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller to be special counsel the month before.

Mueller told Congress he wasn't involved in approving that final FISA warrant.

The 412 pages of redacted FISA documents released in 2018 show the Justice Department and the FBI made extensive use of Steele’s dossier, which he put together in 2016 at the behest of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS. The Clinton campaign hired the firm through Marc Elias of the Perkins Coie law firm and was briefed about Steele's findings throughout the race.

Also last week, McCabe and former FBI special agent Peter Strzok, both fired during the Trump administration, separately sued the Justice Department alleging political bias played a role in their removals. Strzok demanded reinstatement and back pay, and McCabe demanded he receive his full retirement pension.

Horowitz has a history with both men. He previously concluded anti-Trump texts sent from Strzok to FBI lawyer Lisa Page, his mistress, not only showed Strzok was biased but also that he was willing to take official action to affect Trump's electoral prospects. Horowitz also concluded McCabe leaked information without authorization and ""lacked candor"" with investigators.

Horowitz's findings were cited in both their firings, and he's likely not done with them since both played prominent roles in the Trump-Russia investigation.

And last Thursday, FBI interview notes with top DOJ official Bruce Ohr shed light on his role as a conduit between Steele and the FBI in 2016 and 2017, after the bureau says it cut Steele off as a source for leaking to the media. Ohr told the FBI that Steele was desperate Trump not win and suggested some of Steele's information may have stemmed from ""Russian conspiracy theories."" Bruce Ohr's wife, Nellie, worked at Fusion GPS, and Bruce Ohr passed her research along to the FBI.

Horowitz is also likely looking into the FBI's use of an article by Michael Isikoff to bolster its FISA filings. The FBI told the court it didn't think the piece was connected to the dossier, even though Isikoff only wrote it after meeting with Steele.

The Justice Department inspector general said when he launched the investigation last year at the behest of then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions he would “examine the Justice Department’s and the FBI’s compliance with legal requirements"" related to FISA filings against Page and review the DOJ’s and the FBI’s dealings with Steele. But while Horowitz said he would consider including other issues that arose during the investigation, Attorney General William Barr has since suggested the inquiry is narrow.

Former FBI General Counsel James Baker is also likely to be among those scrutinized, since he admitted he inserted himself into the FISA approval process and reviewed the first FISA application. Baker defended how the FBI handled the Steele dossier, claiming “we took it seriously” but “we didn’t necessarily take it literally.”

Republicans have argued the dossier's Democratic benefactors and its author's anti-Trump bias were left out of the FISA applications. Democrats countered that the FBI acted appropriately, saying the Justice Department and the FBI met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis for probable cause.

Officials such as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec knew by October 2016 portions of Steele’s dossier were inaccurate. And State Department officials such as Jonathan Winer and Victoria Nuland seem to have been involved in spreading Steele's information within the U.S. government.

Many members of the media also received info from the Steele dossier, which may have contained Russian disinformation, at the behest of Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson.

The Steele dossier's central thesis was ""a well-developed conspiracy of co-operation"" between the Trump campaign and Russia, but Mueller didn't agree. Although Mueller concluded the Russians interfered in the 2016 presidential election, the investigation did not establish the Kremlin and Trump's campaign criminally conspired. Mueller’s report also shot down at least one of Steele’s biggest claims — that Trump lawyer Michael Cohen met with foreign hackers in Prague.

Horowitz reportedly “homed in” on Steele, and his team reportedly interviewed the ex-spy in June.

Meanwhile, Barr, along with U.S. Attorney John Durham, launched his own inquiry into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation after Trump gave him broad declassification authority to look into it."
The USDA Dropped a Corn Bombshell. What It Means for Deere and Other Stocks.,https://www.barrons.com,['Al Root'],,,,https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-usda-dropped-a-corn-bombshell-what-it-means-for-deere-and-other-stocks-51565705634,"Text size

The U.S. Agriculture Department, or USDA, zigged on Monday when the market expected it to zag.

The farming agency released its monthly world grain report, called WASDE, and, surprisingly, the agency sees a bigger U.S. corn crop—despite poor weather in the Midwest. Corn prices cratered as a result.

Corn futures contact prices dropped “limit down” on Monday—dropping about 6%—meaning futures reached their maximum allowable daily losses on Chicago exchanges. And corn prices were down again Tuesday. What roiled commodity traders was the USDA increasing the expected corn yield per acre for farmers in the 2018/2019 crop year. (For farmers the “crop year” goes from harvest to harvest.) The USDA now expect farmers to produce about 169 bushels of corn per acre, up from expecting 166 in July. (Bad weather has had an impact though—U.S. corn yield was more than 176 bushels per acre last year.)

That’s good news if you are a user of corn, such as a food company, such as corn buyer Post (ticker: POST).

“We view the USDA’s August WASDE report as positive for packaged food manufacturers, as fears over a run-up in grain-driven input cost inflation are being alleviated by a robust corn supply outlook,” writes Citigroup analyst Cornell Burnette in a Tuesday research report. “Thus, our positive thesis for the sector remains intact.”

But higher corn production isn’t such good news if you sell inputs or equipment to farmers, such as Deere (DE).

“Deere’s near-term fundamentals were challenging exiting the second quarter 2019 but there was hope that investors could look through near-term weakness as higher corn prices would deliver demand reacceleration in 2020,” writes Baird analyst Mig Dobre in a Monday evening research report. “The 2019 crop still has challenges that could drive prices higher, but the near term is decidedly more difficult after today’s USDA forecast updates.” Dobre rates shares of Deere Buy, but he cut his price target to $150 from $170 based on the USDA news.

Things could still change for the U.S. corn outlook. Weather, exports, ethanol demand all feed into the USDA models, and all inputs are fluid. Agricultural consultant Mark Feight of International Agribusiness Group, or IAG, believes the corn acreage figures could still come down when the USDA reports figures in October.

Stocks usually don’t overreact to a single crop report because equity prices reflect long-term business value—at least, that’s what the theory says. The long-term trend in agricultural prices and acreage matters more for stocks. Still, there were some big moves along the agricultural value chain on Monday.

Post , for instance, dropped 1.4% on Monday along with the 400-point drop of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. That wasn’t a surprise, but ethanol producer Green Plains (GPRE) actually dropped 4.3%, even though corn is an input for the company. Ethanol demand also influences Green Plains stock. Input provider Corteva (CTVA) dropped 6%, and tractor maker Deere dropped 5% in Monday trading.

VA Partners With DoD to Upgrade Supply Chain at High Risk for Abuse,https://www.military.com,['Richard Sisk'],08-14-2019,2019,8,https://www.military.com/daily-news/2019/08/14/va-partners-dod-upgrade-supply-chain-high-risk-abuse.html,"The Department of Veterans Affairs announced a partnership with the Defense Department this week to upgrade its supply chain system, which is perennially on a government watchdog agency's ""high risk"" list for waste, fraud and abuse.

The partnership with the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) will give the VA access to the DLA's worldwide procurement system in an effort to streamline the VA's purchase of everything from medical and surgical supplies to cleaning equipment and construction materials, the VA said in a news release Monday.

""This is a huge step forward in our efforts to transform VA into a modern, high-performing organization by simplifying operations and leveraging DoD's supply chain system to support our veterans,"" VA Secretary Robert Wilkie said in a statement.

Army Lt. Gen. Darrell Williams, director of the DLA, said the agreement would help the VA reduce costs for supplies.

Related content:

""On behalf of DoD, we are proud to be a value-add to VA on behalf of America's veterans,"" he said in a statement.

The VA release said the DLA will help ""create a centralized ordering system for VA"" aimed at ""reducing risk, waste, fraud and abuse in purchasing medical equipment and supplies,"" problems that have plagued the system for years and repeatedly been cited by the VA's Office of Inspector General and the Government Accountability Office.

In March, the GAO again put the VA on its biennial ""high risk"" list of agencies and departments whose practices are open to abuse; it also added a new area of concern at the VA -- acquisition management.

""VA's procurement policies have historically been outdated, disjointed and difficult for contracting officers to use,"" the GAO report states.

In 2017, the department launched a new program aimed at overhauling its supply chain system to achieve $150 million in cost reductions, the GAO noted.

However, the GAO reported in November 2017 that the new program ""was rushed, lacked key stakeholder involvement and buy-in, and relied on establishing non-competitive blanket purchase agreements for the overwhelming majority of products, resulting in low utilization by medical centers.""

The VA's Office of Inspector General was particularly scathing in a series of 2017 reports on supply chain scandals at the Washington, D.C., VA Medical Center.

IG Michael Missal found the problems at the Washington VA so troubling that he took the unusual step of issuing preliminary findings prior to the final report to alert the Veterans Health Administration to a situation ""sufficient to potentially compromise patient safety.""

The final report concluded that no patients were harmed but found that $150 million in supplies had never been inventoried, storage areas were filthy, and there was no system for ensuring that defective medical instruments and supplies were not used on patients.

Poor oversight of the medical supply system led to shortages in operating rooms at the hospital, according to the report. At one point, the operating room ran out of vascular patches to seal blood vessels and ultrasound probes used to map blood flow.

In addition, the hospital had to borrow bone material for knee replacement surgeries and also ran out of tubes needed for kidney dialysis, forcing staff to go to a private-sector hospital to procure them, the report added.

New policy at Interior's in-house watchdog clamps down on interactions with press,https://thehill.com,[],08-14-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/457452-new-policy-at-interiors-in-house-watchdog-clamps-down-on,"A new policy rolled out by the Interior Department’s inspector general puts strict limits on the office’s interactions with reporters.

The press office for the agency’s internal watchdog, which is investigating a number of Interior officials, including Secretary David Bernhardt, is now prohibited from providing journalists with information on its work beyond, “Our report speaks for itself,” or “We have no comment.”

The policy, which took effect Aug. 5, is a change from the previous practice of sometimes providing reporters with background or additional information.

When asked this week about a new report released by the IG office, the press office told The Hill it could use one of two statements: “Our report speaks for itself” or “We have no comment.”

The policy change comes under the leadership of acting Inspector General Gail Ennis.

Mark Lee Greenblatt, Trump's nominee to replace Ennis as head of Interior’s IG office, has been confirmed by the Senate but has not yet assumed the role. Greenblatt, a former assistant inspector general for investigations at the Commerce Department, is anticipated to begin his new job in the coming weeks.

Stephen Hardgrove, chief of staff for the inspector general’s office, said in an email to The Hill that the policy change “was put in place for the period of time that we had an Acting Inspector General and while awaiting the arrival of our appointed Inspector General, Mark Greenblatt.”

“Of course each Office of Inspector General determines what, if any, information they choose to elaborate on for closed investigation,” he added.

Ennis was sworn in for the SSA role at the beginning of the year, her first time serving as an inspector general (IG). The Senate confirmed her by unanimous consent.

Interior’s IG office is handling a number of investigations, including an ethics probe into six Interior officials, including Bernhardt.

The IG office told House lawmakers that it is also looking into former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke Ryan Keith ZinkeNew policy at Interior's in-house watchdog clamps down on interactions with press Overnight Energy: EPA proposes scrapping limits on coal plant waste | Appointee overseeing federal lands once advocated selling them | EPA lifts Obama-era block on controversial mine Latest appointee overseeing federal public lands once advocated to sell them MORE's alleged use of private email to conduct public business. That investigation is being included in a criminal probe overseen by a joint Justice Department and Interior IG team, Ennis told House lawmakers in a letter released publicly at the end of July.

The letter was the first public acknowledgement that Zinke is being criminally investigated for matters involving his stake in a Montana land deal with the chairman of oil services company Haliburton, as well as Interior’s initial decision to obstruct construction of a tribal casino project in Connecticut following heavy lobbying from rival casino MGM.

Ennis previously worked as a partner at the Washington-based law firm WilmerHale, which lobbies for a number of clients with business before Interior. One of the companies represented by the firm is Twin Metals, a Minnesota-based mineral mining company that is lobbying to build a hotly debated copper-nickel mine near the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. In May, the Trump administration moved to renew one of the mine's mineral leases, reversing a decision from the Obama administration.

Unlike most IG officials, who are usually career government employees, Ennis is a political appointee who previously contributed to Trump’s campaign.

She donated $4,275 in total to Trump’s Make America Great Again Committee and his presidential campaign, according to Federal Election Commission data."

States sue to block EPA's coal power plant emissions rule,https://www.cnn.com,['Gregory Wallace'],08-13-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/13/politics/lawsuit-coal-rule-epa/index.html,"Washington (CNN) A coalition of states and cities will ask a federal court to block the Trump administration's overhaul of emission regulations for coal-fired power plants.

The administration rolled out its Affordable Clean Energy, or ACE, rule earlier this summer, shifting regulatory authority to states while also promoting energy independence and offering hope to the struggling US coal industry.

It replaced one of the Obama administration's hallmark plans to address climate change, the Clean Power Plan. A divided Supreme Court had blocked that rule from taking effect while challenges to its legality played out.

The Trump-led Environmental Protection Agency said the rule would not overstep the legal bounds that Republicans believe Obama's plan crossed. But the EPA itself says the rule could result in 1,400 more premature deaths by 2030 than the Obama-era plan it will replace.

Several states pledged to sue over the Trump administration plan. In the lawsuit , 22 states and seven cities will claim the rule ""disregards requirements of the federal Clean Air Act.""

Wisconsin Corn Farmers Facing More Market Uncertainty After USDA Planting Report,https://www.wpr.org,['Hope Kirwan'],08-14-2019,2019,8,https://www.wpr.org/wisconsin-corn-farmers-facing-more-market-uncertainty-after-usda-planting-report,"Wisconsin grain farmers are facing even more uncertainty this season as the U.S. Department of Agriculture releases more data on the number of corn and soybean acres planted.

In an annual acreage report released Monday, the USDA’s Farm Service Agency announced farmers across the country reported being unable to plant 19.4 million acres by crop insurance deadlines this spring. That’s the highest number reported since records started in 2007.

In Wisconsin, farmers reported 592,808 prevented planting acres. The FSA report shows 77 percent of those acres were planned to be corn.

Paul Mitchell, director of the Renk Agribusiness Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the numbers make up a significant amount of the state’s typical corn and soybean production.

""Twelve percent of the corn acres that we normally would plant are prevented planting,"" Mitchell said. ""For soybeans, it's 7 percent. So those are high (percentages).""

But Mitchell said industry analysts were expecting prevented planting numbers to be even higher, causing corn prices to plummet Monday after steadily improving this spring.

""It's an additional level of anxiety for farmers or uncertainty as we try to sort out what’s going on,"" Mitchell said. ""This is the time that you can make or lose money by marketing decisions and there is nobody to tell you what the right thing to do is because nobody really knows.""

At 44,927 acres, Outagamie County had the highest number of prevented plantings in the state.

Mitchell said farmers in much of the state’s northeastern region struggled to get their crops planted this spring.

""Those soils have a lot of clay in there, it’s just a wetter soil,"" Mitchell said. ""It holds the water better whereas in the Central Sands, the sandy soils, if it rains, you can get out there the next day and still operate.""

Duane Voy is director of the St. Paul Regional Office for the USDA’s Risk Management Agency, which oversees federal crop insurance programs. Voy said the agency is still gathering data from insurance agents on actual prevented planting claims.

He said producers should talk to their crop insurance agents if they’re unsure about the programs.

""Many people in Wisconsin may not be familiar with the prevented planting coverage because it hasn't been utilized that often and for many folks, this is the first time they may have had prevented planting,"" Voy said.

He said other commodities have also had problems with this season’s wet weather and could be eligible for insurance claims later this season.

""Potatoes don't particularly like wet feet,"" Voy said. ""So the ones that are in sandy areas that are irrigated may do well, but we’ve heard some issues on potatoes. You also have quite a few processing beans, and in wet and cooler conditions mold can be a problem. That's also an insured cause of loss."""
DOJ accuses Dems of trying to 'game the system' in 'so-called' impeachment probe,https://www.politico.com,"['Kyle Cheney', 'Andrew Desiderio']",08-13-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/13/doj-congress-impeachment-probe-1460638,"Justice Department lawyers said the demand for former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify and the request for Robert Mueller’s grand jury evidence are based on “completely different factual and legal issues.” | Saul Loeb/Getty Images) congress DOJ accuses Dems of trying to 'game the system' in 'so-called' impeachment probe The Justice Department criticizes the Democrats' attempt to link the Don McGahn and Mueller grand jury cases as an attempt to search for a friendly judge.

The Justice Department on Tuesday accused House Democrats of shopping for a friendly federal judge in its effort to force former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify about potential obstruction of justice by President Donald Trump.

In a new court filing, the Justice Department dinged the House Judiciary Committee for “attempting to game the system” by seeking to formally link its McGahn suit to a separate effort to access former special counsel Robert Mueller’s grand jury evidence.

Story Continued Below

Democrats say the cases are related because they are both connected to an ongoing “impeachment investigation” that could result in an effort to recommend Trump’s ouster. And tying the cases together could help expedite them, they argued.

But the Justice Department said House Democrats undercut their own argument for haste by waiting three months to file a lawsuit against McGahn, who refused to testify after the White House claimed he was “absolutely immune” and directed him to refuse to cooperate with Congress.

“For one thing, the committee’s desire for rapid adjudication rings hollow given that the committee waited until August to file suit over former counsel McGahn’s testimony despite being formally advised of the former counsel’s absolute immunity from compelled congressional testimony on May 20, 2019,” the filing states.

“Thus, any delay is the committee’s doing at this point.”

Judiciary Committee officials have emphasized efforts to show federal judges that they are making meaningful accommodations with the Justice Department and with McGahn directly. As recently as the week before the McGahn lawsuit was filed, the committee was deep into negotiations with McGahn that could have potentially averted the litigation.

The White House and the president’s GOP allies have repeatedly stressed the importance of the “accommodation process,” and they have criticized Democrats when they believed those efforts were cut short too quickly.

The Justice Department said the House’s true aim was to put both cases in front of D.C.’s chief federal judge Beryl Howell, who already was considering the grand jury matter, because of the perception that the appointee of former President Barack Obama might rule favorably in their case. It’s an attempt, the department argues, to manipulate longstanding requirements that cases be randomly assigned to judges to prevent judge-shopping.

Underscoring their point, Justice Department lawyers — arguing on McGahn’s behalf — said the demand for McGahn to testify and the request for Mueller’s grand jury evidence are based on “completely different factual and legal issues” and have no basis for being linked.

“[T]he two cases could not be more different,” the attorneys argued.

The Justice Department’s filing came a day after House lawyers argued in a separate filing that two of their court cases should be linked because both “seek key evidence for the Judiciary Committee’s investigation into whether to recommend articles of impeachment … based on the same underlying obstructive acts by President Trump.”

The Justice Department did not directly address the House’s assertions that it is conducting an impeachment investigation, but the filing referred to the effort as a so-called probe.

Last week, Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) said his panel was engaged in “formal impeachment proceedings,” a rhetorical escalation that matched what House lawyers had told federal judges in recent court filings. Nadler has also said that if the courts move quickly to address the House’s litigation, his committee could recommend articles of impeachment by the end of the year.

Democrats appear to lack the votes to open an impeachment inquiry in the traditional fashion, driven in part by Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s resistance to taking that step. Pelosi is mindful of forcing her most vulnerable caucus members to take a politically difficult vote when impeachment efforts are all but certainly doomed in the Republican-controlled Senate. She has repeatedly argued for continued litigation against and investigation of the president.

Republicans have pointed to her ambivalence as evidence that no formal inquiry has begun.

“Democrats seem to believe, when it comes to holding this president accountable, that the ends justify the means and that they shouldn’t be constrained by House procedure when our democracy is under siege,” Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, wrote in a recent op-ed. “In reality, they may do more to harm our democracy than any president ever could.”

In their own filing, Democrats argued that their authority for claiming to be in the midst of an impeachment probe stems from Jefferson’s Manual — a guide to parliamentary procedure employed by the House and Senate. The manual indicates that impeachment proceedings are launched in a variety of ways, not just through a formal vote of the House. One method is via the referral of articles of impeachment to the Judiciary Committee.

As Nadler and other Democrats note, the House referred articles of impeachment to the committee in January, and they say those articles are now officially under consideration for approval or amendment.

Democrats in recent weeks have pointed to a series of House actions they say bolster their position. In early June, the House voted to allow all committee chairs to enforce subpoenas in court — with the approval of House leaders acting on behalf of the entire chamber.

And last month, the House adopted a resolution declaring all Trump-related subpoenas and demands for information — retroactively and into the future — to have the support of the full House. Impeachment inquiry supporters say this is evidence that the House intended, however indirectly, to back impeachment proceedings without a formal vote.

Similarly, Judiciary Committee officials have noted that previous votes to authorize impeachment proceedings have been intended to empower the committee to issue subpoenas and convene depositions in an era when committees had far less authority than they do in the modern era. Now, the committee already has subpoena and deposition authority, they note.

U.S. Secretary of Veterans Affairs Wilkie visits Boise VA,https://www.idahostatesman.com,[],,,,https://www.idahostatesman.com/news/northwest/idaho/article233724477.html,"Secretary Wilkie: Boise VA seems to click U.S. Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert Wilkie visited the Boise VA Medical Center because ""Everything is working here."" Up Next × SHARE COPY LINK U.S. Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert Wilkie visited the Boise VA Medical Center because ""Everything is working here.""

After the U.S. Senate confirmed Robert Wilkie as U.S. Secretary of Veterans Affairs in July 2018, he said people asked him what his goal would be for his first year.

“It was a military goal,” Wilkie said. “It was to walk the post and calm the institution down because it had been buffeted by legions of bad stories.”

So how are things one year later?

“The place is much calmer. We are a much calmer institution,” he said in an interview in Boise with the Idaho Statesman.

Traditionally, Veterans Affairs has ranked last or near last as a place to work in the federal government’s public-services sector, he explained.

“We are up to No. 6 in one year, and we are going to go higher,” he said. “Our patient satisfaction rates are at an all-time high. The last survey we did, it was 89.7%”

Wilkie also spent much of his first year walking the post — he has traveled to 35 states visiting VA campuses.

“I felt the key to the new VA leadership was to get out of Washington,” he said. “This is a bi-partisan comment. I just think too many people get sucked into the Beltway culture and sit in those big offices overlooking the White House.”

Wilkie visited Boise’s VA campus on Wednesday.

“Boise is a special trip because there really isn’t a place in the country where everything seems to click. It doesn’t matter what it is ... everything is working here,” he said. “This is probably the cleanest and most efficient VA in the country. And I am not just saying that ... The statistics prove it out.”

One of the area’s where the Boise VA is excelling is in telehealth, which connects patients to health care services through computers and cellphones. Idaho is leading the pack in part due to a uniquely western U.S. feature.

“Even today we (on the East Coast) do not understand the scale of the American West,” Wilkie said.

When trying to explain the West’s remoteness and vastness to non-Westerners, Wilkie said he uses two examples.

“One is the loneliest sign in America,” he said. “It is in Houston on Interstate 10. It says ‘El Paso 910 miles.’ The other is it is an eight-and-a-half-hour drive from here to Coeur d’Alene, another population center in this state. We cannot understand that scale.”

To overcome these long distances, Boise VA Medical Center has begun using telehealth to connect doctors and veterans.

“Boise was the place that started this,” Wilkie said. “It allows us to reach into areas that are hard to get to.”

“On the mental health front, it creates a sea change in the way we treat those who have mental health issues because we are not forcing people to come and sit in a large room and expose themselves emotionally,” he explained. “It really is cutting edge for mental health treatment and it also allows our doctors to practice across state lines.”

From Boise, the VA has spread telehealth nodes into Washington, Oregon and Alaska.

“It is imperative that we expand our telehealth footprint,” he said. “That is another reason why I am here. It has worked. And it should be working as a model for the rest of the country.”

Top priority: Veteran suicide prevention

Wilkie said he has made veteran suicide prevention one of his department’s top priorities.

Idaho has struggled with having one of the nation’s highest suicide rates.

“Idaho had 400 suicides last year and 20% of these were veterans,” Wilkie said.

One of the challenges with veterans is most who take their lives are not in the VA system. Wilkie estimates about half of Idaho’s veterans are not in the VA system.

“This is where the federal government can help,” he said.

Under his plan, “We will open the aperture to give (Boise VA Medical Center Director David) Wood more resources to go into the community, not only the state government localities, but also the nongovernmental organizations, the tribal organizations, to help us find those veterans who are out there.”

The community of Boise is already on the right path, Wilkie said.

“There are 48 suicide and mental health programs here that this VA leadership works with in the community,” he said. “Even in our largest cities, we do not have that many.”

Rumor mill: VA not privatizing

Wilkie noted he wants to put to rest a rumor about the VA.

“One of the charges leveled at VA in the last two years is that the President of the United States is on the path to privatize this institution,” he said. “I just gave the Congress the largest budget in the history of the department, $220 billion, calling for 390,000 employees.”

“We will have a higher budget,” Wilkie said, based on his discussions for next year’s budget. “I am the only one in the Cabinet who does not have to present budget cuts,” he said. “So my response to the critics is if we are privatizing, we are going about this in a very strange way.”"
DHS in a ‘Mad Scramble’ to Catch Up With Domestic Terror,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Betsy Woodruff', 'Erin Banco', 'Political Reporter', 'National Security Reporter']",08-13-2019,2019,8,https://www.thedailybeast.com/department-of-homeland-security-is-in-a-mad-scramble-to-catch-up-with-domestic-terror,"It wasn’t that long ago that senior Department of Homeland Security officials shied away from focusing on domestic terrorism, often fearing political backlash.

The White House pushed the sprawling department to focus overwhelmingly on immigration enforcement, at the expense of just about everything else. DHS veterans told reporters that white supremacist terror was the FBI’s issue, not theirs. When a DHS analyst warned of far-right violence in 2009, congressional Republicans bellowed in protest, with a lasting chilling effect. Under the Trump administration, the department disbanded a group of intelligence analysts focused on domestic terrorism. Cybersecurity staffers got shipped to the border. In the days after the massacre at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, leading DHS minds focused on the migrant caravan. And, as NBC reported, the administration cut funding for DHS grants designed to prevent radicalization.

But as white supremacists have terrorized communities around the country, senior officials at DHS have tried to step up their work against the threat. They fought to get that counter-radicalization money back, for instance. A consensus within the department slowly began to form: DHS exists to fight terrorism—even when those terrorists are American.

Then came the El Paso shooting, which left 22 people dead in the Texas border city. That’s when, in the words of one senior DHS official, “ the dam broke.”

“There were robust conversations before El Paso,” added that official, who spoke anonymously to discuss internal talks. “Acting DHS Sec. Kevin McAleenan has been very clear that this is a top priority for the Department, as Nielsen had also previously stressed. But the conditions are different now. We will ensure the Department is doing everything possible with existing capabilities and resources, and seek more capabilities and resources as needed. And more will be needed.”

Since the shootings in El Paso and Dayton that left 31 people dead, DHS officials are working overtime to find ways to ramp up domestic terrorism prevention efforts, according to four DHS officials familiar with the situation. But it’s not easy, sources said; over the last two years, the department has maximized resources focused on border security, and it’s already strained.

“These two shootings have caused a mad scramble where they are pulling every publication and book off the shelf in an attempt to figure out what they can do to address this problem,” said one former DHS official.

Senior DHS leadership had a call on Saturday night after the El Paso shooting and then again on Sunday afternoon, after a second shooter killed 10 people in Dayton. The violence was spiraling. So McAleenan directed senior officials to start a working group to assess what DHS was doing about domestic terrorism and what more it could do immediately, according two sources familiar with the situation. The department’s advisory council is supposed to speak with McAleenan about domestic terrorism prevention this week, one of those sources said.

It’s too soon to tell if El Paso will be a turning point for DHS. But just taking a serious look at what the department is doing to fight domestic terrorism and what more it can do—that marks a significant moment, especially when many in the White House remained laser-focused on stopping the flow of immigrants.

“People are scrambling,” said a current DHS official.

And they aren’t alone. The Daily Beast reported last week that the National Counterterrorism Center, another 9/11-era counterterror institution, has also quietly amped up its work fighting domestic terror.

DHS, meanwhile, heightened its efforts last week after President Trump condemned white supremacy and domestic terrorism. For more than two years, according to current and former DHS officials, the White House has directed the department to rev up its efforts to deal with the mass flow of migrants into the country.

Now, department officials are looking to elevate the mission to prevent domestic terrorism by leveraging existing resources and surging capabilities from throughout the department, according to another senior DHS official. It’s not dissimilar to the concept the department uses in responding to a natural disaster, the official added. The number of people involved is smaller, but it draws from people all across the department. They’re also putting together an action plan looking at the growing threat from domestic terrorism, according to multiple DHS sources.

“To ensure our communities are safe, we are focusing efforts on enhancing our prevention and preparedness, and creating response assets in communities so they will be better able to mitigate risk and respond to these kinds of events when they do occur,” McAleenan said in a statement to The Daily Beast. “So far we’ve reached thousands of people in communities around the country, educating them about indicators of radicalization or mobilization to violence. Community awareness can play a major role in preventing an attack.”

But significant turnover among senior DHS leadership has complicated its efforts to help state and local law enforcement partners.

“Trying to find someone in charge at DHS overall—it’s been hard lately!” said one senior state law enforcement official who requested anonymity to speak candidly. “Since DHS has been in existence, it’s always been fairly chaotic. But this is probably the longest it’s been with so many people in acting positions.”

The department’s effort to increase its focus on domestic terrorism has left officials in DHS playing catch up. One official said some of the individuals working overtime do not have domestic terrorism experience, as most have spent their careers on international terrorism.

“That’s a bit of a challenge,” said the official.

The challenge hasn’t gone unnoticed.

“This scramble is a direct result of the fact that notwithstanding concerns raised by some in DHS over the past several years, there have been no serious planning efforts by the department to focus on [domestic terrorism],” said John Cohen, former deputy undersecretary for intelligence and analysis at DHS. “That’s due in large part because of the insistence by the White House that the department first and foremost focus on immigration and border security.”

The Daily Beast reported on DHS’ decision to disband a group of domestic terror analysts just days before McAleenan took office. Soon after, the secretary directed a review of all DHS efforts to combat targeted violence and domestic terrorism, including programs funded by federal grants doled out to the department in 2017, a department spokesperson said.

“Given the proof-of-concept nature of these programs, DHS was not prepared until earlier this year to make an assessment of their efficacy,” a spokesperson for the department said, adding that McAleenan directed the department to request more funds for domestic terrorism prevention for fiscal year 2020."
Treasury Department Is Wrong. China Didn't Just Devalue Its Currency.,https://www.dailysignal.com,['Riley Walters'],08-13-2019,2019,8,https://www.dailysignal.com/2019/08/13/the-treasury-department-is-wrong-china-didnt-just-devalue-its-currency/,"The U.S. Treasury Department has incorrectly labeled China a manipulator of its currency.

An important distinction exists between devaluing a currency and currency depreciation.

Devaluing implies the People’s Bank of China actively manipulated the value of the Chinese renminbi to gain unfair advantage for its exports. Depreciation simply means the renminbi has lost purchasing power relative to the U.S. dollar, based on market forces.

There’s no indication that China is actively devaluing its currency.

However, according to the Treasury Department, China met a broad definition of manipulation laid out in the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, which says of the Treasury secretary:

The Secretary considers that such manipulation is occurring with respect to countries that (1) have material global current account surpluses; and (2) have significant bilateral trade surpluses with the United States.

The law itself doesn’t make clear what a “significant” level of trade surplus with the U.S. equals.

Like many things Congress does, it leaves the most critical details of the law to the executive branch to determine. It must do so, because the criteria laid down in the law could implicate any number of countries, such as Japan, India, Taiwan, Thailand, and South Korea.

And the U.S. trade deficit with the European Union is more than $100 billion.

Yet, the criteria Treasury used in this case are different from another criterion it uses to monitor and label currency manipulators based on the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015.

Under that law, and by standards set by the Treasury, a country is considered a currency manipulator only if it: 1) has an annual trade surplus with the U.S. of more than $20 billion; 2) has a material current account surplus that’s more than 2% of its gross domestic product; and 3) has shown persistent, one-sided intervention in foreign exchange markets, with net foreign exchange purchases of more than 2% of its gross domestic product.

China meets only one of these three criteria. It has had a trade surplus with the U.S. valued at more than $300 billion a year since 2012. It hasn’t met more than one criteria since 2016.

Even then, a dozen other countries, such as Mexico, Vietnam, and Switzerland, also meet at least one criteria established under the 2015 law.

The Context

The recent announcement comes just days after President Donald Trump announced new taxes on $300 billion worth of imports from China, to begin Sept. 1.

It also comes just after news that the Chinese renminbi depreciated against the U.S. dollar to a symbolic 7 renminbi to $1, down from roughly 6.88 renminbi last month.

Trump claimed this recent depreciation was because of manipulation even before the Treasury Department had a chance to clarify.

Nonetheless, the depreciation of the renminbi beyond 7 renminbi has always been seen as significant.

It signals a further weakening of the Chinese economy. Currencies tend to trend along with the health of their local economies. That means when the U.S. economy is strong, the dollar appreciates. When the Chinese economy is weakening, the renminbi depreciates. Both are happening.

That’s why over the past four years, the renminbi has depreciated against the dollar roughly 13%, while China’s annual growth in gross domestic product has decreased from 7% to 6.2%.

The depreciation beyond 7 renminbi was also seen by the Trump administration as a potential offset to the cost of tariffs it has imposed on imports of goods from China.

The administration already has levied a 25% additional tax on roughly $250 billion worth of goods from China. New tariffs, a 10% additional tax on $300 billion worth of goods from China, could go into force as soon as Sept. 1.

A weaker Chinese currency implies American dollars can buy more Chinese exports, while the Chinese can buy fewer American exports. Despite the change in the dollar/renminbi exchange rate, Americans have been paying billions of dollars a month in import taxes.

Value of China’s Currency

According to international measures, both the Chinese renminbi and U.S. dollar are overvalued by as much as 15% to 20%.

According to the Bank for International Settlements, the real effective exchange rate for China and the U.S. is roughly 123.7 and 115.6, respectively.

That’s well above an index that’s equal to 100, which weighs their relative strength to other global currencies and takes into consideration consumer prices.

The Treasury Department’s semiannual report on the foreign exchange policies of our major trading partners stopped publishing the real effective exchange rate of the Chinese renminbi—potentially because it goes against any argument that China’s currency is undervalued.

China does have a history of currency manipulation. Questions about China’s currency interventions arose in 1992, 1994, 2003, and 2014. Since then, to the extent China has manipulated its currency it has done so only to prop up the value—in order to stem capital flight, not to devalue the currency in an attempt to boost exports, which is mostly what the 1988 law is about.

However, legitimate concerns over China’s currency management haven’t arisen for the past five years, and not since Beijing stopped artificially pegging the renminbi’s value to the dollar.

Now, the People’s Bank of China sets an exchange rate that’s more or less determined by the value of several global currencies and allows the renminbi to depreciate up to 2% a day.

It’s easier for the bank to allow the renminbi to depreciate up to 7 renminbi than to continue to cut into foreign exchange reserves to keep it propped up.

Negotiations on the Horizon

A silver lining beyond the heated rhetoric is that labeling China will have little real effect.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will now have to negotiate with Beijing either bilaterally or through the International Monetary Fund to achieve an effective balance of payments.

Reports from earlier this year said a currency agreement is a part of the looming U.S.-China deal. Very little suggests the U.S. could take even further punitive action against China beyond the use of more tariffs.

But the recent escalation, leading to a potential currency war and prolonging of U.S.-China trade tensions, spooked markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 3% on Monday.

And if the Trump administration is somehow successful in persuading Beijing to manipulate its currency in the other direction—appreciate the renminbi against the dollar—it would just mean Americans would have to pay even more for Chinese imports.

Editor’s note: The second chart has been modified to correct inadvertently reversed trend lines for the U.S. dollar and Chinese renminbi."
Gutfeld: Trump's feud with Scaramucci shows he's the 'Al Davis of presidents',https://www.foxnews.com,['Charles Creitz'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-scaramucci-feud-gutfeld-al-davis,"President Trump's feud with Anthony Scaramucci is the latest example of the commander-in-chief's commitment to winning at all costs, according to Greg Gutfeld.

""Donald Trump is like the Al Davis of presidents,"" Gutfeld said Monday on ""The Five,"" referring to the iconic longtime principal owner of the Oakland Raiders. ""He had a singular motto, which was 'Just win, baby' -- he didn't care how. He attracted rough, scary and weird people -- that was the entire Oakland Raiders.""

SCARAMUCCI BREAKS WITH TRUMP, SAYS GOP MAY NEED 'CHANGE AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET'

Davis served as head coach-general manager of the Raiders in the 1960s and later was GM and principal owner until his death in 2011.

Of the comparison between Davis and Trump, the ""Greg Gutfeld Show"" host said he saw a similarity between the Raiders' choice of players and the individuals hired by the White House.

""You also get these weird third-stringers,"" he added, naming Scaramucci and former White House aide Omarosa Manigault-Newman -- who, post-termination, attacked Trump in a ""tell-all"" book.

""They get in under the guise of loyalty and then when it doesn't work out, they turn on you... He's like Omarosa.""

Earlier Monday, Scaramucci told CNN the president has a ""nihilistic way to his personality.""

""I think you have to consider a change at the top of the ticket when someone is acting like this,"" he told anchor John Berman.

After the televised remarks, Trump fired back on Twitter, claiming Scaramucci, who briefly served as White House director of communications in 2017, was upset at not being rehired.

""Scaramucci, who like so many others had nothing to do with my Election victory, is only upset that I didn’t want him back in the Administration (where he desperately wanted to be),"" Trump wrote.

""Also, I seldom had time to return his many calls to me. He just wanted to be on TV!"""
"Upper Peninsula mine approved despite major concerns from DEQ and EPA staff, records show",https://www.duluthnewstribune.com,"['Keith Matheny', 'Detroit Free Press']",,,,https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/business/energy-and-mining/4612571-Upper-Peninsula-mine-approved-despite-major-concerns-from-DEQ-and-EPA-staff-records-show,"Over and over, Michigan environmental regulators sounded alarms as they reviewed a proposed large, open-pit ore mine in the Upper Peninsula near the Menominee River, prized for walleye fishing and a major tributary to Lake Michigan. The mine would send acidic mining wastes into the river and surrounding waterways, which would then spill into the Great Lake, staff said. More acres of wetlands would be harmed than the mining company was projecting, evaluators found.

Then the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and then-Michigan Department of Environmental Quality approved the mine anyway.

At stake in whether the Back Forty Mine proceeds is the potential endangerment of one of the most important rivers in Michigan, part of a system that drains more than 4,000 square miles of the U.P. and northern Wisconsin, and a river culturally iconic to the Menominee Indians of Wisconsin, whose creation story includes that they come from the river’s mouth. Sacred burial grounds of the tribe are potentially threatened by the mine. The tribe is now among those appealing wetlands and surface water permit approvals for the mine.

The level of DEQ staff concern, and at times frustration, with Canadian company Aquila Resources' plan to mine for gold, zinc and copper within 150 feet of the river — in the western U.P. on the Michigan-Wisconsin border — has only now come to light, through agency documents presented as evidence in the appeal pending before an administrative law judge.

The open-pit sulfide mine would operate on 83 acres and its pit would be 2,000 feet by 2,500 feet, and 750 feet deep, according to the company. The life of the mine is planned at approximately seven years, and Aquila estimates it will produce:

512 million pounds of zinc

468,000 ounces of gold

51 million pounds of copper

24 million pounds of lead

4.5 million ounces of silver.

An on-site processing mill also will crush and refine minerals and ores through flotation, separation and the use of cyanide, according to the company's plans.

The DEQ emails, letters and memos show concern that Aquila Resources and its engineering firm, Green Bay, Wis.-based Foth Infrastructure and Environment, LLC, was understating the project's impact on the river and surrounding wetlands, according to regulators. The methods Aquila was using to measure wetlands impacts were improper, and the mining company wasn't changing them, DEQ staff said. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency shared similar concerns, documents show.

Eric Chatterson, a geology specialist in DEQ's Water Resources Division, wrote there was a ""high likelihood"" that crushed minerals and ores from the mine ""will be observed in the groundwater that discharges to the Menominee River and Shakey River,"" in an April 5, 2018, email to a department colleague. He added that the problems would continue when the mine ultimately closed, stating, ""Impacted groundwater from the backfilled pit is expected to migrate to local surface water sources.""

That's a particular concern for many, as sulfide ores exposed to air and water undergo chemical reactions that create sulfuric acid that harms water quality and is toxic to fish and smaller aquatic organisms.

Aquila's permit request, according to DEQ staff, was also failing to capture the mine's full impact on surrounding wetlands, which are vital to natural habitat, erosion protection and water quality. An unsigned, undated DEQ memo said of the groundwater model Aquila Resources was using as part of its permit application: ""It provides little to no use in assessing impacts to nearby wetlands.""

DEQ officials found that at some locations around the mine, operations would reduce the groundwater feeding wetlands ""in excess of 6 inches to greater than 5 feet throughout the modeled life of the mine,"" wrote Kristi Wilson of the DEQ's Water Resources Division to Aquila Resources officials on Jan. 19, 2018.

The EPA was similarly concerned. Christopher Korleski, director of the Water Division at EPA's Region 5 that includes Michigan, wrote the DEQ's Coleen O'Keefe on March 8, 2018, stating the agency objected to the issuance of a permit for the mine for, among other reasons, that the company had not yet demonstrated that ""the mine site plan is protective of water quality throughout the life of the mine and post-closure.""

But two months later, on May 3, 2018, following a meeting with Aquila officials and ""supplemental information"" being presented to the EPA, Korleski changed his stance.

""Based on the information EPA has received from Aquila, a number of objections identified in EPA's March 8 letter have been resolved,"" he stated. ""In addition, we believe that there is a ready pathway for the resolution of EPA's remaining objections through MDEQ's inclusion of specific conditions in a final permit issued by June 6, 2018.""

But the information provided by Aquila provided little of new substance, said Janette Brimmer, an attorney with the environmental nonprofit Earthjustice who is representing the Menominee tribe it its permit appeal.

For example, regarding EPA's concern about potential adverse impacts to water quality at the mine's closure, the agency accepted Aquila's statement that the closure plan would not be developed until after the mining pit was excavated, ""allowing the use of the mineralogy data from the pit walls to factor into the plan,"" and that any final closure plan would require review and approval by DEQ. Regarding secondary wetlands impacts, Aquila stated it was ""working with MDEQ to address concerns regarding the assessment of secondary impacts using modeling and water budgets.""

""That's the million-dollar question: What changed?"" Brimmer said. ""Nothing changed. Nothing changed on the ground. The data didn't change. Nothing changed other than, presumably, the politics. I would have liked to have been a fly on the wall in those EPA Region 5 meetings (with Aquila officials).""

EPA says its concerns were addressed

EPA Region 5 responded to Free Press requests for an interview with an emailed statement, stating Aquila's requirement to finalize plans with the state of Michigan and evaluate impacts prior to starting construction in wetlands addressed the agency's concerns.

The EPA reversal put the DEQ on a clock: Approve or reject the mining company's wetlands, lakes and streams permit within a month, by June 6, 2018, or authority on the permit application would transfer from the state agency to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

""I am concerned about the inevitable groundwater discharge that will be created from the mining and backfilling of the pit,"" Chatterson wrote to Wilson in a May 17 email, adding that Aquila's design plans to reduce polluted discharges when they closed and backfilled their mine ""should be approved by the Groundwater Permits Unit prior to construction activities,"" countering the EPA's position that the plan could be developed by the company after its pit was dug.

By that June 1, DEQ had approved Aquila Resources' final necessary permit to proceed with the mine. The wetlands, lakes and streams permit included numerous provisions that the company had to follow before work could proceed, including new groundwater level evaluations using methods approved by the DEQ. The permit allows for the filling of almost 6 acres of wetlands, with an indirect impact to more than 17 acres of wetlands from reductions in groundwater supply.

Scott Dean, a spokesman for the DEQ, which is now known as the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, or EGLE, touted the approved permit's provisions that Aquila Resources must meet, including ""an enhanced groundwater modelling and monitoring plan consistent with industry best practices,"" annual monitoring data to guard nearby wetlands over the years of the mine's operation, and adaptive protections that ramp up ""if adverse water impacts are detected during the life of the project.""

Aquila also will be required to develop ""state-of-the-art controls"" aimed at spill prevention and response to potential pollution releases, including chemicals used and stored on-site, and the storage and disposal of waste rock, Dean added.

More than a year after the state approved the wetlands and surface waters permit, Aquila Resources has not yet provided EGLE with the information required in the conditional permit, Dean said. The agency's Water Resources Division authorized Aquila to install groundwater and surface water monitoring equipment at the site in June.

Aquila must also still submit a design plan ""to ensure that the mine pit may be backfilled with waste material in a manner that is protective of water quality,"" Dean said.

Additionally, Aquila is filing with EGLE for a dam safety permit for its mining tailings and waste rock management facilities; an air pollution control permit, and revisions to an earlier approved permit for nonferrous metallic mineral mining, to meet the changed provisions for their plans as outlined in the wetlands permit, Dean said.

Brimmer said she's never before seen a situation where conditions that are typically confirmed in a permit application instead become conditions to resolve later in an approved permit.

""The DEQ witnesses, each and every one of them, were asked back in June (during testimony on the permit appeal), 'Have you ever before done a permit like this? Have you ever seen anything like this before?' To a person, they said no.""

The with-conditions permit approval turns the way the process should work on its head, Brimmer said.

""In order for the public to participate and comment on this, they have to understand what the risks are to that river. What are you proposing? What have you analyzed?"" she said. ""You can't do that when all of those details are blanks to be filled in later.

""It robs the public of meaningful participation in this process, which is a cornerstone of environmental law and regulation.""

Aquila Resources officials also responded to Free Press interview requests with an emailed statement.

""Aquila Resources, Inc. has obtained all the major permits for the Back Forty Project. Federal and state agencies, including the U.S. EPA and EGLE have completed an exhaustive review of potential impacts. Multiple environmental studies of the project spanning over a decade informed our permits. Aquila believes in the value of public input and participation, and strongly supports processes that encourage engagement with stakeholders. Each of these permitting processes allowed for extensive public comment and participation, which we actively engaged in, listening to and learning from our stakeholders. Our permits contain stringent terms and conditions to ensure the project operates with minimal impact on the Menominee River, groundwater, wetlands, and other natural resources.""

For the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin, concerns about the Back Forty mine project go beyond potential environmental damage.

The tribe, with about 9,500 enrolled members, traces its creation story and history to the Menominee River, tribal chairman Douglas Cox said.

""The story is that the first being associated with our tribe, the Great Bear, came out of the lake at the mouth of the Menominee River and walked onto the land,"" he said.

The area is known to the tribe as Sixty Islands, and further legends tell of an ancient Menominee woman who performed ceremonies in the area and was taken up by the spirits that live in the river, Cox said.

""Our tribal members continue to visit that site, and some say they can hear or see that ancient Menominee woman, who is still there today,"" he said.

The area near the mine ""is our homeland,"" Cox said. ""Our people still go there, they still fish there, they still gather there.""

There are burial mounds with the remains of tribal ancestors ""up and down the Menominee River,"" he said.

""If you tell Americans, 'We're going to go dig up your grandma and grandpa to build a mine, to build industry, to disturb the banks of a historic river that's in your blood,' how does that feel?"" he said.

""It's protection of our cultural resources. There are cultural resources that are at risk from this development. We haven't gotten due attention under the law for our cultural resources.""

The Michigan-based permitting process for the Back Forty mine has left the Wisconsin side of the river mostly on the sidelines, Cox said.

""When the EPA, the Army Corps, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service all take actions that are federal, they are obligated to consult with the tribe under laws such as the National Historic Preservation Act, the National American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act,"" he said.

""(Michigan) gets to contend, 'Nope, we're the authority now, so we're not obligated to do anything with you Indian nations — you independent, sovereign nations. We'll send you a letter, let you know what we're doing. But we won't communicate with you directly.' ""

Cox questioned Michigan's ""strange-sounding process"" of leaving so many things unresolved in the approved permit.

""You would think that, rather than try to conditionalize a permit to include all that's required, you would just say, 'We're not going to issue this permit until all of these big things are addressed, like groundwater modeling,'"" he said. ""I guess in Michigan they don't see it that way.""

Across the river, in Michigan's Menominee County, the board of commissioners passed a resolution opposing the Back Forty mine back in 2017.

""It's right on the river, 150 feet from the Menominee River,"" board vice chairman William Cech said. ""There's never really been a successful sulfide mine without leaving a large stain on the landscape that they are digging in.

""If the mine was 5 miles in from the water, it might be a whole different story. But because it's that main waterway that leads right into Lake Michigan, we are afraid.""

More hearings on the appeal ahead

There is no further opportunity for the public to comment on the Back Forty Mine's wetlands and surface waters permit. Hearings on the tribe's permit approval appeal are scheduled through Wednesday in Lansing, but may be extended to a later date, Brimmer said.

The tribe is also challenging the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' failing to act as the primary permitting authority for the Back Forty mine. The tribe is slated to present oral arguments in the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago on Sept. 5, Brimmer said.

""We're going to keep fighting,"" Cox said.

Interior centralizes ethics reviews after recent high-profile probes,https://thehill.com,[],08-14-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/regulation/energy-environment/457415-interior-centralizes-ethics-reviews-after-recent-high-profile,"The Department of the Interior will be centralizing ethics reviews across its many agencies at its headquarters, following years of ethics investigations centered on many of the department’s top staff.

In an order signed by Secretary David Bernhardt Wednesday and shared with The Hill, ethics officials at the Bureau of Land Management, the National Park Service and others will report to ethics officials based at Interior’s headquarters rather than agency directors.

But ethics officials who reviewed the plan criticized its broad focus on all agency employees rather than the high-level officials currently being investigated for ethical lapses.

Scott de le Vega, director of Interior’s Departmental Ethics Office, said the change was designed to ensure Interior’s roughly 70,000 employees are getting consistent ethics advice regardless of which branch of the department they serve.

They also want to ensure ethics officers are held accountable for the advice they give.

“The Department of the Interior has received criticism from the Government Accountability Office, from the Office of Government Ethics, not to mention from the Hill itself and Republican and Democratic administrations about lapses in ethical behavior from the highest levels to the lowest levels at the department,” de la Vega told The Hill.

“The way we are reorganizing and restructuring things will build a stronger program so that we ensure that our employees have the best tools and resources for them to mitigate and reduce the chances of those ethical lapses occurring again.”

Ethics experts apprised of the plan by The Hill criticized its focus on thousands of employees rather than the top staff whose actions have resulted in at least half a dozen investigations by the agency’s Office of Inspector General, as well as countless other requests for investigations.

Much of the attention to ethics issues within the department during the Trump administration has focused squarely on those at the top, particularly at Bernhardt, a former energy lobbyist who has been followed by protesters donning “swamp creature” masks during many of his congressional appearances.

“Ethical leadership should come from the top of the top. An ethical workplace depends on leadership that sends the tone,” said Delaney Marsco, ethics counsel at the Campaign Legal Center (CLC). “So the idea that the fix is to centralize who other ethic officials report to ... they might be missing the boat a little bit. They should definitely be focused on ensuring their senior level officials are complying with ethics laws first.”

The CLC was one of several groups to file an ethics complaint against Bernhardt following reporting from The New York Times that he was influential in easing rules that would benefit a former client.

“The ethical problems at Interior have nothing to do with 70,000 rank-and-file employees and has everything to do with David Bernhardt and his inner circle,” said Aaron Weiss, at the Center for Western Priorities, a conservation group that has repeatedly criticized ethics issues at Interior. “There’s 70,000 employees getting good ethics advice, and we know David Bernhardt has been getting poor ethics advice and in some cases doing everything he can to skirt his ethics obligations.”

The centralized ethics office will be housed within Interior’s solicitor’s office. That’s not unusual, ethics experts say, but the man nominated to fill that post and who already fills the role in a de facto capacity, Daniel Jorjani, has been mired in ethical issues of his own.

Sen. Ron Wyden Ronald (Ron) Lee WydenWyden calls for end to political ad targeting on Facebook, Google Ex-CIA chief worries campaigns falling short on cybersecurity Overnight Energy: Trump sparks new fight over endangered species protections | States sue over repeal of Obama power plant rules | Interior changes rules for ethics watchdogs MORE (D-Ore.) has vowed to try and block his confirmation given concerns about whether he was truthful to Congress during his confirmation hearing about his potential involvement in a controversial ethics policy at the Interior Department that has been criticized for giving political appointees more power over public records.

De la Vega said the order from Bernhardt comes as he is trying to increase ethics staff throughout Interior, raising the number from the 21 employees he oversaw when arriving in April of last year to 90.

Bernhardt’s order directs the agency to complete its ethics reorganization by the end of the year.

De la Vega, a career official, served in a number of capacities at the White House under the Obama administration, including as the ethics official for former Vice President Biden.

He said the secretary’s office won’t be let off the hook under the reorganization.

“Making sure that the secretary’s office — and all of the politicals at [Interior] within the secretary’s office — making sure they get proper ethics advice and proper ethics attention to the questions and concerns that they raised in the course of their policymaking, that is also a top priority for my office,” de la Vega said.

Ethics experts said centralizing ethics functions isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but it could sideline ethics officials within departments that are the most familiar with how they function and what conflicts of interest must be avoided.

“The mandate of Interior is so broad and there are so many bureaus,” Marsco said. “I don’t understand how centralizing who the reporting person is gets at the ultimate goal of making sure everyone is receiving consistent advice. If that’s the goal, there are other ways to do that like more training.”

The ethics reorganization comes on the heels of another one announced just last week. Interior will now be organized into 12 regions based on various watersheds to consolidate communication between 49 offices spread across eight different bureaus within Interior. Each region will be headed by a field assistant who will coordinate activities across the bureaus.

Both moves have been described as a way of centralizing power within the secretary’s office.

“It’s certainly centralizing the power of the designated agency ethics official,” Virginia Canter, chief ethics counsel for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said of the role filled by de la Vega. “In normal times I could see why they’d do this, but these are not normal times.”

Defense inspector general to investigate Pentagon’s $10 billion cloud contract,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Aaron Gregg', 'Reporter Covering The Defense Industry', 'Commercial Aviation', 'Government Contractors.', 'Aaron Gregg Covers The Defense Industry', ""Government Contractors For The Washington Post'S Business Section.""]",08-13-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/08/13/pentagon-inspector-general-investigate-billion-military-cloud-contract/,"

The Defense Department’s inspector general has assembled a team of auditors to evaluate the Pentagon’s handling of its largest cloud computing project, a massive contract that could be worth up to $10 billion over 10 years.

The review presents yet another hurdle for the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure contract, known as JEDI, which has been mired in controversy and costly litigation for more than a year. The matter was referred to the inspector general by members of Congress and through the agency’s complaints hotline, said Dwrena Allen, a spokeswoman for the inspector general.

“We are reviewing the DoD’s handling of the JEDI cloud acquisition, including the development of requirements and the request for proposal process,” Allen said. “In addition, we are investigating whether current or former DoD officials committed misconduct relating to the JEDI acquisition, such as whether any had any conflicts of interest related to their involvement in the acquisition process.”

In the statement, the inspector general did not commit to eventually publicizing its findings. Allen said the work of evaluating the contract had already begun and would be completed “as expeditiously as possible.”

Dana Deasy, the Defense Department chief information officer in charge of the procurement, told reporters last week that his office would consult with the inspector general before awarding the massive contract. He did not say whether the award would be delayed until the inspector general completes its review.

The JEDI contract is meant to speed up the military’s use of cloud computing systems, which employ networks of remote servers to improve computing processes and ease the transmission of data. Defense Department officials say they need to adopt such technology to compete with Russia and China for military dominance. They want to turn to a single commercially oriented tech company to operate that system, and they have said only Amazon and Microsoft meet the minimum specifications.

The process has been dogged by allegations that it is biased in favor of Amazon Web Services since it was unveiled last year. Oracle and IBM have protested the award, arguing that turning to a single company for such an important responsibility is unwise and that the process is rigged in favor of Amazon.

The inspector general’s announcement comes as a slow boil of controversy surrounding the procurement has suddenly bubbled up into a political firestorm.

President Trump recently instructed new Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper to reexamine the contract over concerns that it will go to Amazon, a move that some observers characterized as an inappropriate incursion into the Pentagon’s business. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)

[Meet the man at the center of the high-stakes, winner-take-all $10 billion Pentagon cloud contract called JEDI]

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), whose political action committee has received donations from Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, has asked that the contract be delayed and lobbied the president directly on the matter, a member of his staff said. Democratic Sens. Mark R. Warner (Va.) and Jack Reed (R.I.) raised concerns that Trump may have acted inappropriately by intervening in the procurement.

In its most recent lawsuit, Oracle accused Amazon of benefiting from an “organizational conflict of interest” by hiring away Defense Department officials who had worked on JEDI.

Multiple investigations into Oracle’s claims have concluded that the allegations against Amazon should not preclude it from participating in the procurement and that the Defense Department was reasonable in how it structured the contract.

Oracle’s latest legal action before the U.S. Court of Federal Claims ― a highly unusual months-long court battle in which lawyers representing Amazon and the Defense Department teamed up to fight Oracle’s claims ― failed to block the award. Among other conclusions, the judge presiding over the case found that Oracle was not materially harmed by any procurement irregularities because it is not part of the competition anyway.

Oracle’s lawsuit did, however, manage to delay the award for several months while the Defense Department reexamined the role of Deap Ubhi, a Defense Department official later hired by Amazon.

[Read federal judge Eric G. Bruggink's rejection of Oracle's JEDI bid protest]

Ubhi had worked for Amazon before joining the Defense Department, where he worked on the JEDI procurement as a member of the Defense Digital Service. He repeatedly praised Amazon and referred to himself as an “Amazonian” while he was a public official, suggesting that he was biased in favor of Amazon.

A Defense Department investigation concluded that Ubhi’s involvement had not skewed the procurement in Amazon’s favor. The contracting officer overseeing JEDI did conclude, however, that Ubhi violated federal conflict-of-interest rules.

The judge presiding over the case concluded that Ubhi had lied to both the Defense Department and Amazon about the circumstances surrounding his departure from government service. The judge also concluded that Ubhi’s claims that he had been “leading the effort” to accelerate the department’s commercial cloud adoption were untrue, calling Ubhi’s statements about his role in the procurement “self-promoting, fabulist and often profanity-laced.”

Ubhi has not responded to repeated requests for comment, and his employer has declined to make him available for an interview. An Amazon spokesman did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday on the Defense Department inspector general’s review."
New Jersey Paralegal Allegedly Used DOJ Access to Help Son’s Gang Identify “Snitches”,https://slate.com,['Molly Olmstead'],08-14-2019,2019,8,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/08/new-jersey-gang-paralegal-doj-access-snitches.html,"The state seal of New Jersey. Photo illustration by Slate. Photo by Wikipedia.

A paralegal in the New Jersey U.S. Attorney’s Office has been accused of using her government access to identify people in her son’s gang who cooperated with investigators, putting them in danger of retaliation from their fellow gang members, according to filings in a federal court in Brooklyn. The woman pleaded not guilty to the charges on Tuesday.

According to prosecutors, Tawanna Hilliard, 44, used her access to Department of Justice computers to search databases to identify cooperating witnesses from the 5-9 Brims, a set of the Bloods street gang, at the direction of members of that gang. According to NJ.com, Hilliard had worked in the New Jersey U.S. Attorney Office’s Civil Division for nine years.

Hilliard also specifically targeted the co-defendant in a robbery case that resulted in her son, Tyquan, being sentenced to 10 years in prison. In May 2018, the man and Tyquan Hilliard robbed an AT&T store in Monticello, New York. The men threatened the store clerk and two shoppers with a gun and bound them with duct tape in a storage room. They fled the scene and led the police on a high-speed chase before crashing their car and being captured.

Texts between the mother and son allegedly show Tawanna Hilliard complaining that the co-defendant’s cooperation with the investigators after the robbery ruined her son’s defense. The man was “giving up murders, victims, shooters and all…SMH,” she wrote in a text, according to court documents. Tawanna Hilliard allegedly responded by posting a video on YouTube of the co-defendant talking to investigators about that robbery, with the title “NYC Brim Gang Member Snitching Pt. 1.” The man and his family then received death threats from other inmates linked to the Bloods, according to prosecutors.

According to NJ.com, the indictment contends that before his arrest, Hilliard told her son in an April 2016 call that she had “looked up” cases for another gang member who wanted to locate people who “snitched.”

Hilliard has been charged with witness tampering, obstruction of justice, and obtaining information from a government computer. She was released on bond with the order not to contact her son or other gang members. Her son is also charged in the indictment."
