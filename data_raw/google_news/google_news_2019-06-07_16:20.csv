"CNN’s Don Lemon laments Trump-era ‘toxicity’ and trolls, says he may move on: reports",https://www.foxnews.com,['Dom Calicchio'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/cnns-don-lemon-laments-trump-era-toxicity-and-trolls-says-he-may-move-on-reports,"The news – plus barbs from social media trolls and other critics -- may be too much for CNN’s Don Lemon to bear much longer.

The host of “CNN Tonight” told an audience in New York City on Thursday that the current “level of toxicity” in society – which he attributed to the Trump presidency – has him questioning whether he’ll still be on the air when the 2020 presidential election rolls around, according to reports.

“I don’t know if it’s worth this level of toxicity,” the 53-year-old Lemon said about continuing in his current position, the Daily Beast reported.

“I’m 10 years older than when he rode down the escalator in July 2015,” Lemon added, referring to Donald Trump's campaign announcement four years ago.

Lemon made the remarks at the Financial Times’ “Future of News” conference.

The anchor also spoke about the negative, unsolicited feedback he sometimes receives.

“I was doing a shoot in the park the other day and someone shouted at me, ‘I’m sick of watching you. We built this country. I can’t wait for CNN to fire your black a--, you f----t,'” he recalled, according to Deadline.

“So, all of those sorts of people call you on the phone and say those things, or they write you. I don’t go on social media anymore, it’s so toxic,” he added.

Lemon went on to blame the Trump era, and even the president himself.

“I’m black and gay on cable television in prime time — a unicorn — and I’m a target of the right, a target of white extremists, neo-Nazis and of the president,” Lemon said, according to Deadline.

He added later, “ I wonder how long I will continue to do this particular job,” the Daily Beast reported.

Lemon speculated he might be happier as a celebrity chef, or perhaps doing journalism “in a different way.”"
Automakers Tell Trump His Pollution Rules Could Mean ‘Untenable’ Instability and Lower Profits,https://www.nytimes.com,['Coral Davenport'],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/06/climate/trump-auto-emissions-rollback-letter.html,"Mr. Newsom said he is not interested in a “midway” deal requiring California to loosen its rules. “A rollback of auto emissions standards is bad for the climate and bad for the economy,” he wrote in an email. “I applaud the automakers for saying as much in their letter today to the President. We should keep working towards one national standard — one that doesn’t backtrack on the progress states like California have made.”

The letters are the latest twist in Mr. Trump’s effort to roll back regulations on auto manufacturing, an industry he has vowed to support. Some industry chief executives and lobbyists have been privately telling the White House for months that the president’s efforts may do more harm than good, but Thursday’s action represents a particularly strong pushback.

“Our thinking is, the rule is still being finalized, there is still time to develop a final rule that is good for consumers, policymakers and automakers,” said Gloria Bergquist, a vice president at the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers.

Criticizing the president’s plan comes with risk for the automakers. The White House has courted their support for his moves, and, privately, some officials have said that they fear industry criticism could lead the president to retaliate by imposing tariffs on auto imports. That, too, could be painful, because many cars and components are now made or partly assembled across the border in Mexico or Canada.

But they also fear the costs of the uncertainty and regulatory headaches that potentially await them should Mr. Trump’s rollback go through as planned.

For example, automakers would have to demonstrate that the average mileage of all the cars they sell in California is much higher than in states like Utah, where the new Trump standard of about 37 miles per gallon would be in effect.

But because Americans increasingly prefer SUVs over thriftier vehicles, manufacturers might have to significantly cut prices on electric vehicles in the high-mileage states, a potentially money-losing proposition, while raising the prices of gas guzzlers. At the same time, auto lots in low-mileage states might hold a completely different mix of vehicles at different prices."
"Fox News exclusive: Trump launches blistering attack on 'nasty, vindictive, horrible' Pelosi",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Liam Quinn', 'Liam Quinn Is A Senior Editor At Fox News. He Can Be Found On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/president-donald-trump-nancy-pelosi-nasty-vindictive-horrible-person-fox-news-exclusive,"President Trump has taken the gloves off in his ongoing feud with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

Speaking exclusively to Fox News’ Laura Ingraham in Normandy, France, in an interview that aired Thursday, the president first took time to pay tribute to the heroes who fought on D-Day 75 years ago, describing them as “incredibly brave people” who displayed incredible “valor.”

Then, the president switched gears, slamming Pelosi, D-Calif., as a “nasty, vindictive, horrible person” -- after saying he had “tried to be nice to her.”

“I think she’s a disgrace. I actually don’t think she’s a talented person, I’ve tried to be nice to her because I would have liked to have gotten some deals done,” Trump said on “The Ingraham Angle.”

“She’s incapable of doing deals, she’s a nasty, vindictive, horrible person, the Mueller report came out, it was a disaster for them.”

FOX NEWS EXCLUSIVE: TRUMP SAYS MUELLER MADE A 'FOOL' OF HIMSELF

Trump then referenced former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report, suggesting some Democrats hoped it would give them the so-called silver bullet to take him down.

“They thought their good friend Bobby Mueller was going to give them a great report and he came out with a report with 13 horrible, angry Democrats who are totally biased against me,” the president told Ingraham.

“A couple of them worked for Hillary Clinton, they then added five more, also Democrats. With all of that, two-and-a-half years, think of it, from before I even got elected, they’ve been going after me and they have nothing.”

Ingraham then asked Trump if he cared whether or not Mueller would testify publicly about his report. The president used the question as another chance to unload on Pelosi.

“Let me tell you, he made such a fool out of himself the last time she -- because what people don’t report is the letter he had to do to straighten out his testimony because his testimony was wrong but Nancy Pelosi, I call her nervous Nancy, Nancy Pelosi doesn’t talk about it,” Trump told Fox News.

“Nancy Pelosi’s a disaster, OK, she’s a disaster and let her do what she wants, you know what? I think they’re in big trouble because when you look at the kind of crimes that were committed, and I don’t need any more evidence, and I guess from what I’m hearing there’s a lot of evidence coming in.

“And then ask Nancy, why is her district [having] drug needles all over the place? It’s the most disgusting thing what she’s allowed to happen to her district, with needles, with drug addicts... with people living on the sidewalk.”

Trump continued, referencing Pelosi’s reported comment to fellow top Democrats that she would like to see him in “prison.”

MUELLER SAYS CHARGING TRUMP WITH A CRIME WAS ‘NOT AN OPTION’ IN RUSSIA PROBE

“It was a horrible, nasty, vicious statement while I’m overseas... She didn’t want to – she is a terrible person and I’ll tell you her name, it’s nervous Nancy because she’s a nervous wreck.”

Pelosi, as Politico reported, made the remark while defending her stance against impeaching the president in an evening meeting with House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., and other top Democrats.

“I don’t want to see him impeached, I want to see him in prison,” she said, according to multiple Democratic sources familiar with the meeting. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., and Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., also reportedly attended the meeting.

Trump also discussed his potential 2020 opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, during his interview with Ingraham.

After being asked about Biden downplaying the potential threat of China to the U.S. at a recent town-hall event, Trump said: “He just doesn't get it, he just doesn't get it.”

“How happy would President Xi be to have Joe Biden be the nominee of the Democratic party,” Ingraham followed up, to which the president replied: “Well he wants him, he wants him.”

Elsewhere during the president’s wide-ranging interview with Ingraham, he said Mueller made “such a fool” out of himself last week when he delivered his first and only public statement about the Russia investigation.

“Let me tell you, he made such a fool out of himself ... because what people don’t report is the letter he had to do to straighten out his testimony because his testimony was wrong,” Trump told Ingraham.

Trump was referring to Mueller’s initial suggestion that the president was not charged with an obstruction-of-justice offense because of longstanding Justice Department policy.

“Charging the president with a crime was not an option we could consider,” Mueller said last week, citing an Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinion stating that a sitting president could not be indicted.

“If we had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said that. ... We concluded that we would not reach a determination one way or the other about whether the president committed a crime,” Mueller said.

Opinion | Trump Destroys American Greatness From Within,https://www.nytimes.com,['Timothy Egan'],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/07/opinion/trump-july-4.html,"Normally, the courts would be bulwarks against the barbarians. And indeed, many judges have stood up to some of Trump’s most outlandish and illegal behavior. But the Trump effect, turning everything he touches to a cheap commodity, is to denigrate the legal arbitrators as “Obama judges” or “Mexican” judges. You’re with him or against him.

This is dangerous stuff. And it gets worse. The most disgusting of the recent corruptions is the attempt to make the military another extension of presidential vanity. The White House wanted to “minimize the visibility” of the U.S.S. John S. McCain while Trump was in Japan. So, a family name synonymous with sacrifice on behalf of country was covered up so that President Bone Spurs would not be offended. Kim Jong-un has to be jealous.

Following this desecration, the acting defense secretary, Patrick Shanahan, said the military “will not be politicized.” Sorry. That ship has sailed.

You would think that matters of the soul would be harder for the soulless occupant of the White House to tarnish. After a round of golf last Sunday, a disheveled-looking Trump abruptly showed up at a church in Virginia. The White House said Trump wanted parishioners to pray for victims of a recent mass shooting. Instead, they were asked to pray for Trump. The pastor later said he had been blindsided.

The same cannot be said for the man who oversees the Census Bureau, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. He’s trying to use a mandate of the Constitution, the decennial census, to shore up power in the Electoral College and Congress for the aging white men of Trump’s base.

Any day now, the Supreme Court will rule on Ross’s effort to insert, into the census form that goes out to every household, a citizenship question, something that hasn’t been asked since 1950. It could mean that about 6.5 million people would go uncounted — citizens and noncitizens.

This is a blatant abuse of power and of an otherwise benign government agency, affecting not just the number of representatives or electoral votes each state gets, but also the fate of numerous cities dependent on federal billions in mostly blue America."
Rudy Giuliani’s Ukraine Shenanigans Become Potential Fodder for House Democratic Investigators,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Erin-Banco Asawin-Suebsaeng', 'Erin Banco', 'Asawin Suebsaeng']",06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.thedailybeast.com/rudy-giulianis-ukraine-shenanigans-become-potential-fodder-for-house-democratic-investigators,"Top congressional Democrats are actively discussing opening a probe into Rudy Giuliani for his overseas political and consulting work, including a recent attempt to uncover dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden, a source with direct knowledge tells The Daily Beast.

The contours of a potential probe are still under consideration. But it would likely look at whether Giuliani’s relationships with foreign politicos interfered or intersected with American foreign-policy efforts.

Asked about the prospect of lawmakers investigating his foreign work, President Donald Trump’s lawyer had a defiant response: Bring it on.

“If they want to come after me, I gladly accept it, because we could just make the Biden stuff bigger news,” Giuliani told The Daily Beast. “Do it! Give me a chance to give a couple speeches about it and hold a press conference. I’d love that… I think it’d be a fun fight. I’ll just compare it to all the things they’re not investigating… If they want, we can have a big fight over this.”

The former New York City mayor insisted there was “nothing illegal or unethical about” any of his overseas trips or foreign work in the Trump era, and accused Democrats on Capitol Hill of “trashing the Constitution” and potentially engaging in the “biggest misuse” of congressional power “since Joe McCarthy.”

The news of a potential Giuliani probe comes as Democrats on the Hill are attempting to ramp up their investigations into President Trump. Several congressional committees, including judiciary and oversight, have called on former Trump officials to cooperate in their investigations. But the White House has stonewalled those efforts, refusing to acquiesce to witness-interview and document-production requests.

In response, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler’s (D-NY) plans on introducing a resolution next week that would allow committees to sue the Trump administration and witnesses from the Mueller probe who do not comply with subpoenas, according to Democratic aides.

Giuliani would be, perhaps, the highest-profile investigative target to date. The president’s lawyer ultimately canceled his trip to Ukraine amid a backlash from Democrats and some disapproval from Republicans. But prior to that, he’d been open about his plans to go to the country to help uncover information on the origins of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe and to encourage investigators to look into whether Biden had influenced a case that had been brought against his eldest son. As The New York Times first reported, Giuliani was seeking information on the involvement of Hunter Biden in an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch. During the Obama administration, Vice President Biden had pushed for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor whose office controlled the inquiries into the company, on which Biden’s son had a seat on the board.

Giuliani, much of pro-Trump media, and President Trump himself had tried to frame the Biden story as a major political scandal. But it has since fizzled out. A Bloomberg News report noted that testimony from a former Ukrainian official and internal documents did not match the timeline or narrative that Biden had intervened to benefit Hunter. “There was no pressure from anyone from the U.S. to close [the] cases,” the former official said. “It was shelved by Ukrainian prosecutors in 2014 and through 2015.”

Speaking to The Daily Beast last month, the day before he nixed the trip, Giuliani said that he was briefing the president on his progress in Ukraine. He also noted that, based on their private conversations, he believed he had the full blessing of President Trump to keep digging on any actions Biden had taken. He mocked critics who accused him of “going after poor Joe.”

“The answers lie in Ukraine,” Giuliani insisted then. “This is what a defense lawyer does… I’m going after it like a hound dog.”

At the time, he compared his investigative jaunt to the kind of work done by Perry Mason, a fictional lawyer-detective from the 1950s and ’60s TV series.

In addition to Giuliani’s efforts in Ukraine, congressional Democrats are also said to be interested in the trips he has taken to Armenia and Romania.

Giuliani sent a letter to Romanian President Klaus Iohannis in August 2018 recommending changes to the country’s anti-corruption program. The contents of that letter diverged from the official State Department stance on the issue. He told Politico that he was paid for writing the letter by a global consulting firm. In October 2018, Giuliani appeared in Armenia, reportedly invited there by an Armenian businessman who lives in Russia. At the time, Giuliani said he was in Armenia as a “private citizen.” He spoke at a conference alongside a sanctioned Russian official.

“I hope they do investigate me for that because I would resist… and go on a rampage,” Giuliani said. “I’ll tell them I won’t comply [with a subpoena or any request] unless you investigate Biden first!”

He then added that such a probe, if launched by Democratic lawmakers, “would be harassment of the worst kind,” and that it would “also [be] interfering in my role as an attorney” for President Trump."

"VA may owe veterans millions in refunds but knowingly hasn't paid them for years, probe finds",https://www.usatoday.com,"['Donovan Slack', 'Published P.M. Et June']",06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/06/06/va-may-owe-disabled-veterans-millions-refunds-home-loan-fees/1367679001/,"CLOSE

WASHINGTON – More than 50,000 disabled veterans could be owed as much as $190 million in refunds from the Department of Veterans Affairs for home loan fees they were wrongly charged or no longer owe, an investigation has found.

Senior leaders knew about the problem for years but didn’t ensure veterans received what they are due, the investigation by the VA inspector general found.

Veterans pay the fees when they buy homes with the help of VA's Home Loan Guaranty Program, but they are supposed to be exempt if they are disabled. Fees can total up to 3.3% of a home's value.

In cases where veterans improperly paid the fees or the VA later determined they were disabled, the agency is supposed to issue refunds.

But the VA didn’t do that in thousands of cases dating back more than a decade because the veterans didn't ask for the refunds.

VA loan managers, who knew about outstanding debts to veterans since at least 2014, told investigators that they had been focused on other priorities, including processing high volumes of applications.

Investigators from the inspector general’s office said in their report released Thursday that they found it “troubling” that the managers were “aware that thousands of veterans were potentially owed more than $150 million yet did not take adequate actions to ensure refunds were issued.”

“It is the review team’s opinion that requiring a veteran to submit a claim for a refund improperly places the burden and responsibility solely upon the veteran,” investigators said.

'Internal quality improvement'

The VA issued a press release last month – as the inspector general was preparing to release the investigation results – announcing that the agency is now notifying veterans when they buy homes under the program that they are exempt from the fees if they are disabled or later determined to be disabled.

“Through an internal quality improvement effort, VA has put a plan in place to better inform veterans through key communications when the law allows VA to waive the fee for a veteran,” VA Secretary Robert Wilkie said in the release.

The release did not say what is being done to ensure veterans due refunds from loans in prior years are paid. The inspector general found the amounts owed in its review ranged from $5,000 to $20,000.

The VA said veterans who believe they are owed a refund should consult the agency’s website for more information about VA home loan funding fees.

Between 2012 and 2017, the VA collected roughly $10 billion in fees from veterans under the loan program.

The inspector general estimated disabled veterans who were wrongly charged accounted for $286 million of those fees. But the VA only refunded about $100 million, leaving an estimated $190 million that may still be due to 53,200 veterans.

The Loan Guaranty program was established in 1944 to help veterans finance home purchases. Loans are provided by private lenders, but the VA guarantees a portion of the loans for eligible buyers. The lenders collect the fees and transmit them to the VA.

If a veteran wrongly paid the fees, the VA can refund the money directly to the veteran. If the fees were included as part of a loan, the VA pays the lender, which applies it to the loan balance.

'Other priorities'

In 2014, regional VA loan officials in St. Paul, Minnesota, notified senior VA managers that an analysis found nearly $150 million may be due in refunds to disabled veterans for fees on 48,000 loans issued between 2006 and 2014.

“As of January 2019, the review team received no indication that a large-scale effort had been initiated to issue refunds to these veterans,” the inspector general said.

The director of the Loan Guaranty program since 2017, Jeffrey London, told investigators he “considered contracting out the task of issuing refunds, but never requested the award of a contract because other priorities…took precedence,” the investigators wrote.

The inspector general recommended the agency identify and pay all the veterans owed refunds. In addition, the VA should implement procedures to minimize the number of veterans who are wrongly charged fees and conduct periodic reviews to ensure those who are receive prompt refunds.

The VA told investigators some of the fees were incorrectly assessed by lenders, not the VA. But agency officials said in their response to the report that they “generally agreed” with the investigation’s findings and are consulting lawyers about complexities related to issuing refunds.

The agency “has drafted a plan with contingencies ready for implementation depending on the (legal) opinion,” the VA response said. The agency did not elaborate on what the plan is or when refunds will be issued.

The House Oversight Committee could vote to hold him contempt in a dispute with his agency over the Trump administration’s effort to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census. (Susan Walsh/AP)

The Justice and Commerce departments denied an order from a House committee for more documents about the decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census, all but ensuring that the House will hold Attorney General William P. Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt of Congress.

In a letter to Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) on Thursday, Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd said the agency had tried to be accommodating to the panel, and described as “premature” a vote on contempt over the department’s refusal to comply with this demand.

The Justice Department said that certain documents the Democrats subpoenaed are protected by attorney-client privilege and therefore cannot be released. Cummings had given the agency until 5 p.m. Thursday to produce them or he would schedule a vote to hold Barr in contempt.

The Commerce Department later said that it was also rejecting the committee’s demands and accused the committee of “playing politics,” according to a statement obtained by Politico.

Several weeks ago, the House Judiciary Committee voted to hold Barr in contempt for refusing to release special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s report in full and without redactions.

Boyd wrote that the department already gave the committee 17,000 pages of documents and has made witnesses available.

The census question is the focus of one of the many House investigations into President Trump and his administration. The White House has said it will not comply with committee subpoenas.

Democrats have accused the administration of adding the citizenship question to scare immigrants away from responding to the decennial survey, the results of which are used to guide congressional redistricting and the number of representatives a state gets in Congress.

Despite Trump administration officials’ denials, evidence revealed last week suggests that the question was added as a way to give an electoral advantage to Republicans and white voters.

A consortium of states, cities and civil rights groups sued over the citizenship question, and three federal judges struck it down.

The Supreme Court heard the case in April.

Boyd cited the ongoing litigation as an added challenge.

In addition to the documents it wanted, the Oversight panel also subpoenaed Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Gore to testify.

In March, Gore met with the Oversight Committee, but Cummings said he refused to answer more than 150 questions, citing the litigation over the census question. Boyd said the Justice Department has offered to make Gore available to the committee again if counsel from the agency also can attend."

Why Mueller’s team omitted that part of the Kilimnik narrative from its report and related court filings is not known. But the revelation of it comes as the accuracy of Mueller’s Russia conclusions face increased scrutiny.

The incomplete portrayal of Kilimnik is so important to Mueller’s overall narrative that it is raised in the opening of his report. “The FBI assesses” Kilimnik “to have ties to Russian intelligence,” Mueller’s team wrote on Page 6, putting a sinister light on every contact Kilimnik had with Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman.

What it doesn’t state is that Kilimnik was a “sensitive” intelligence source for State going back to at least 2013 while he was still working for Manafort, according to FBI and State Department memos I reviewed.

Kilimnik was not just any run-of-the-mill source, either.

He interacted with the chief political officer at the U.S. Embassy in Kiev, sometimes meeting several times a week to provide information on the Ukraine government. He relayed messages back to Ukraine’s leaders and delivered written reports to U.S. officials via emails that stretched on for thousands of words, the memos show.

The FBI knew all of this, well before the Mueller investigation concluded.

Alan Purcell, the chief political officer at the Kiev embassy from 2014 to 2017, told FBI agents that State officials, including senior embassy officials Alexander Kasanof and Eric Schultz, deemed Kilimnik to be such a valuable asset that they kept his name out of cables for fear he would be compromised by leaks to WikiLeaks.

“Purcell described what he considered an unusual level of discretion that was taken with handling Kilimnik,” states one FBI interview report that I reviewed. “Normally the head of the political section would not handle sources, but Kasanof informed Purcell that KILIMNIK was a sensitive source.”

Purcell told the FBI that Kilimnik provided “detailed information about OB (Ukraine’s opposition bloc) inner workings” that sometimes was so valuable it was forwarded immediately to the ambassador. Purcell learned that other Western governments relied on Kilimnik as a source, too.

“One time, in a meeting with the Italian embassy, Purcell heard the Italian ambassador echo a talking point that was strikingly familiar to the point Kilimnik had shared with Purcell,” the FBI report states.

Kasanof, who preceded Purcell as the U.S. Embassy political officer, told the FBI he knew Kilimnik worked for Manafort’s lobbying firm and the administration of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, whose Party of Regions hired Manafort’s firm.

Kasanof described Kilimnik as one of the few reliable insiders the U.S. Embassy had informing on Yanukovych. Kilimnik began his relationship as an informant with the U.S. deputy chief of mission in 2012–13, before being handed off to the embassy’s political office, the records suggest.

“Kilimnik was one of the only people within the administration who was willing to talk to USEMB,” referring to the U.S. Embassy, and he “provided information about the inner workings of Yanukovych’s administration,” Kasanof told the FBI agents.

“Kasanof met with Kilimnik at least bi-weekly and occasionally multiple times in the same week,” always outside the embassy to avoid detection, the FBI wrote. “Kasanof allowed Kilimnik to take the lead on operational security” for their meetings.

State officials told the FBI that although Kilimnik had Ukrainian and Russian residences, he did not appear to hold any allegiance to Moscow and was critical of Russia’s invasion of the Crimean territory of Ukraine.

“Most sources of information in Ukraine were slanted in one direction or another,” Kasanof told agents. “Kilimnik came across as less slanted than others.”

“Kilimnik was flabbergasted at the Russian invasion of Crimea,” the FBI added, summarizing Kasanof’s interview with agents.

Three sources with direct knowledge of the inner workings of Mueller’s office confirmed to me that the special prosecutor’s team had all of the FBI interviews with State officials, as well as Kilimnik’s intelligence reports to the U.S. Embassy, well before they portrayed him as a Russian sympathizer tied to Moscow intelligence or charged Kilimnik with participating with Manafort in a scheme to obstruct the Russia investigation.

Kasanof’s and Purcell’s interviews are corroborated by scores of State Department emails I reviewed that contain regular intelligence from Kilimnik on happenings inside the Yanukovych administration, the Crimea conflict and Ukrainian and Russian politics. For example, the memos show Kilimnik provided real-time intelligence on everything from whose star in the administration was rising or falling to efforts at stuffing ballot boxes in Ukrainian elections.

Those emails raise further doubt about the Mueller report’s portrayal of Kilimnik as a Russian agent. They show Kilimnik was allowed to visit the United States twice in 2016 to meet with State officials, a clear sign he wasn’t flagged in visa databases as a foreign intelligence threat.

The emails also show how misleading, by omission, the Mueller report’s public portrayal of Kilimnik turns out to be.

For instance, the report makes a big deal about Kilimnik’s meeting with Manafort in August 2016 at the Trump Tower in New York.

By that time, Manafort had served as Trump’s campaign chairman for several months but was about to resign because of a growing controversy about the millions of dollars Manafort accepted as a foreign lobbyist for Yanukovych’s party.

Specifically, the Mueller report flagged Kilimnik’s delivery of a peace plan to the Trump campaign for settling the two-year-old Crimea conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

“Kilimnik requested the meeting to deliver in person a peace plan for Ukraine that Manafort acknowledged to the Special Counsel’s Office was a ‘backdoor’ way for Russia to control part of eastern Ukraine,” the Mueller report stated.

But State emails showed Kilimnik first delivered a version of his peace plan in May 2016 to the Obama administration during a visit to Washington. Kasanof, his former handler at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, had been promoted to a top policy position at State, and the two met for dinner on May 5, 2016.

The day after the dinner, Kilimnik sent an email to Kasanof’s official State email address recounting the peace plan they had discussed the night before.

Russia wanted “a quick settlement” to get “Ukraine out of the way and get rid of sanctions and move to economic stuff they are interested in,” Kilimnik wrote Kasanof. The email offered eight bullet points for the peace plan — starting with a ceasefire, a law creating economic recovery zones to rebuild war-torn Ukrainian regions, and a “presidential decree on amnesty” for anyone involved in the conflict on both sides.

Kilimnik also provided a valuable piece of intelligence, stating that the old Yanukovych political party aligned with Russia was dead. “Party of Regions cannot be reincarnated. It is over,” he wrote, deriding as “stupid” a Russian-backed politician who wanted to restart the party.

Kasanof replied the next day that, although he was skeptical of some of the intelligence on Russian intentions, it was “very important for us to know.”

He thanked Kilimnik for the detailed plan and added, “I passed the info to my bosses, who are chewing it over.” Kasanof told the FBI that he believed he sent Kilimnik’s peace plan to two senior State officials, including Victoria Nuland, President Obama’s assistant secretary of State for European and Eurasian affairs.

So Kilimnik’s delivery of the peace plan to the Trump campaign in August 2016 was flagged by Mueller as potentially nefarious, but its earlier delivery to the Obama administration wasn’t mentioned. That’s what many in the intelligence world might call “deception by omission.”

Lest you wonder, the documents I reviewed included evidence that Kasanof’s interview with the FBI and Kilimnik’s emails to State about the peace plan were in Mueller’s possession by early 2018, more than a year before the final report.

Officials for the State Department, the FBI, the Justice Department and Mueller’s office did not respond to requests for comment. Kilimnik did not respond to an email seeking comment but, in an email last month to The Washington Post, he slammed the Mueller report’s “made-up narrative” about him. “I have no ties to Russian or, for that matter, any intelligence operation,” he wrote.

Kilimnik holds Ukrainian and Russian citizenship, served in the Soviet military, attended a prestigious Russian language academy and had contacts with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. So it is likely he had contacts over the years with Russian intelligence figures. There also is evidence Kilimnik left the U.S.-funded International Republican Institute (IRI) in 2005 because of concerns about his past connections to Russia, though at least one IRI witness disputed that evidence to the FBI, the memos show.

Yet, omitting his extensive, trusted assistance to the State Department seems inexplicable.

If Mueller’s team can cast such a misleading portrayal of Kilimnik, however, it begs the question of what else might be incorrect or omitted in the report.

Elijah Cummings indicates he will move ahead with contempt vote against Barr and Ross,https://www.cnn.com,['Laura Jarrett'],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/06/politics/doj-2020-census-response-house-oversight/index.html,"(CNN) The chairman of the House Oversight Committee indicated Friday morning that he will proceed with a contempt vote against Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross over a dispute about documents regarding a potential citizenship question on the 2020 census.

The Department of Justice said on Thursday it was working to get the committee more documents in response to a subpoena for the information, but said some materials the panel has requested will continue to be withheld. Justice is also refusing to allow John Gore, a senior official in the civil rights division, to appear before the committee without department counsel in the room -- which the committee has thus far refused to allow.

House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings, however, said that offer was insufficient.

""We gave Attorney General Barr and Secretary Ross every opportunity to produce the documents the Committee needs for our investigation, but rather than cooperate, they have decided that they would rather be held in contempt of Congress,"" Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, said in a statement Friday morning. ""They produced none of the documents we asked for, they made no counter-offers regarding these documents, and they seem determined to continue the Trump Administration's cover-up.""

Cummings had said Monday he would postpone the contempt vote if the Commerce and the Justice departments produced the materials the committee had previously requested.

Former DHS official on CBP declaring 'full-blown' border emergency: Authorities at point of 'desperation',https://www.foxnews.com,"['David Montanaro', 'David Montanaro Is An Editor With Fox News.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/cbp-declaring-full-blown-border-emergency,"The head of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) declared Wednesday a ""full-blown emergency"" at the southern border, as the number of apprehensions surged last month to levels not seen in more than a decade.

Responding on ""America's Newsroom"" Thursday, former Department of Homeland Security official Theresa Cardinal Brown said it's clear that authorities at the border are in a state of ""desperation.""

Brown said the situation is different from years past because of the number of families and children who are seeking asylum at the border and having to be detained.

OPERATION TARGETING MS-13 GANG IN TEXAS NETS NEARLY 2 DOZEN ARRESTS, OFFICIALS SAY

TRUMP SAYS MEXICO IS AN ‘ABUSER’ OF THE US, AMID TARIFF NEGOTIATIONS

In his comments to reporters, Acting CBP Commissioner John Sanders called the immigration system ""broken,"" explaining that facilities housing migrants near the border are ""well beyond capacity.""

""This ongoing crisis has placed a tremendous strain on our limited resources and operational effectiveness,"" he warned.

Brown told Bill Hemmer that Border Patrol agents and other officials feel like they're not getting enough support and resources from lawmakers in Washington, D.C.

MEXICO OFFICIALS PREPARE TO INTERCEPT ABOUT 1,000 MIGRANTS

""I hear very much the desperation of operators and people whose job it is to deal with the people they encounter at the border effectively and humanely, who feel like they're not able to do their job. ... It is a crisis,"" she said.

Brown said the White House and lawmakers from both parties need to come together and figure out how to deal with the crisis.

She said tensions are high between House Democrats and President Trump in particular, but she pointed back to Bill Clinton negotiating ""significant legislation while he was under impeachment.""

U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported nearly 133,000 arrests in May. The number surpassed 144,000 when counting migrants deemed inadmissible -- more than a 30 percent increase from the prior month and double the influx recorded at the beginning of the year.

The number of apprehensions was the highest monthly total in more than 13 years. In April, authorities recorded 99,304 arrests.

The latest figures could embolden President Trump amid tense negotiations with Mexico over the immigration crisis.

Last week, in an effort to force Mexico to do more to “stop the invasion” of migrants into the U.S., the president vowed to impose a new 5 percent tariff on all Mexican imports. The tariffs, set to go into effect on June 10 absent an agreement, would increase over time, reaching 25 percent by Oct. 1.

Congressional Democrats Demand State Dept. End ‘Disturbing’ Policy Denying Citizenship to Kids of LGBT Couples,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Scott Bixby'],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.thedailybeast.com/senate-democrats-demand-state-dept-reverse-disturbing-policy-denying-citizenship-to-kids-of-lgbt-couples,"Nearly one hundred members of Congress, including five presidential candidates, have added their names to a pair of letters calling on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to immediately reverse a State Department policy that withholds American citizenship from some children of U.S. citizens who are born abroad.

One letter, led by Sens. Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Kamala Harris of California and signed by 17 other Democratic members of the chamber, calls the policy “a thinly veiled attack on LGBTQ Americans whose children are conceived through the use of egg donors and gestational surrogacy.”

“Your Department’s reinterpretation of immigration law to deny the constitutional right of citizenship to the children of same-sex couples who are born outside the United States is extraordinary and deeply disturbing,” the letter states. The letter’s 19 signatories urge Pompeo to immediately drop the State Department’s appeal of a court ruling striking down the policy, “and make it clear that every U.S. married couple is entitled to the same rights under the U.S. Constitution, no matter whom they love.”

In addition to Merkley and Harris, the letter was signed by Sens. Ed Markey (D-MA), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Tom Udall (D-NM), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Chris Coons (D-DE), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Bob Casey (D-PA), Tim Kaine (D-VA), and Ron Wyden (D-OR).

Another letter, signed by the co-chairs of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus and every gay, lesbian and bisexual member of the House of Representatives, was delivered to Pompeo on Thursday afternoon. In that letter, the 80 signatories called the policy “discriminatory and cruel.”

“Welcoming a new child into a family should be a time of joy and excitement, but instead it is being met by your Department treating these couples differently than their different-sex counterparts,” the second letter, led by Reps. Deb Haaland (D-N.M.), David Cicilline (D-R.I.) and Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.), stated.

The policy in question changes the State Department’s interpretation of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), a 1952 law that codifies eligibility for U.S. birthright citizenship. Under the policy, children born abroad via assisted reproductive technology like gestational surrogacy or sperm donation are considered to have been born “out of wedlock,” even if their parents are legally married U.S. citizens.

“Out of wedlock” births abroad face a bevy of legal and logistical hurdles to gaining birthright American citizenship, and the policy has led to numerous instances of the children of U.S. citizens being effectively turned away at the border.

“They basically take our marriage, and they say ‘It doesn’t mean anything. Your child was born out of wedlock,’” Adiel Kiviti, whose three-month-old daughter was born with the help of an egg donor and a gestational surrogate in Canada, told The Daily Beast last month. “We were there when she was born, she took her first breaths in our arms. Make no mistake: We are her parents—we are her only parents on her only birth certificate.”

“This is a very clear attack on families, on American families,” his husband Roee, who married Adiel in California in 2013, said at the time. “Denying American married couples their rights to pass their citizenship, that is flat-out discrimination, and everyone should be concerned about this.”

Two same-sex couples have sued the State Department over the policy, which they say disproportionately affects LGBT families, who stick out when seeking government documents that recognize the birthright citizenship of children born abroad.

The INA makes no reference to biology in determining birthright citizenship of children born abroad to married U.S. citizens, giving the policy little textual support in law. In February, a federal judge ruled that “the basis for the State Department’s imposition of a biological requirement is its strained interpretation” of existing immigration law, and dismissed attempts to institute a biological testing standard for the children of binational married couples as “unilateral.”

But the State Department has appealed that ruling, and has fought to summarily dismiss a suit brought by another same-sex couple against the policy.

The publication of a story by The Daily Beast on the policy brought renewed national attention to the issue, prompting nearly every Democratic presidential candidate, as well as senior congressional leadership, to call for the policy’s reversal.

“Once again, the Trump administration is demonstrating just how far they are willing to go to undermine our core values and advance their hateful agenda,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a statement last month. “The State Department must uphold our laws, end this cruel and inhumane policy and treat every family with the dignity and respect that they deserve.”

In the letter from Senate Democrats, signatories called the department’s legal defense of the policy part of a larger tapestry of decisions that have hurt LGBT Americans, from its decision to not grant visas to the same-sex partners of some foreign diplomats to what they called the “muted” response to anti-LGBT persecution abroad.

“Every new American parent should focus on celebrating the birth of a child, not be consumed with fear that all members of their family may not be welcomed back home to the United States,” the signatories wrote. “The United States can best advocate for LGBTQ rights around the world by living its values at home, especially during this month of Pride.”

The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter."
Someday the U.S. Will Have to Actually Deal With Its Nuclear Waste Problem,https://slate.com,['Jane C. Hu'],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/technology/2019/06/department-of-energy-nuclear-waste-reclassification-yucca.html,"Photo illustration by Slate. Photo by Jeff J. Mitchell—WPA Pool/Getty Images.

Of all the things in the world to worry about, nuclear waste management is not at the top of most people’s lists. We trust (or hope, at least) that expert scientists and policymakers will make good decisions about how to make sure radioactive byproducts stay far, far away from us, by whatever means possible. But, many of those experts say, we’re going to need to figure out a new way to manage our country’s nuclear waste—and soon.

To that end, the Department of Energy announced Wednesday that they are reclassifying the definition of “high-level,” or highly radioactive, waste stored in underground tanks at Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington state, the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina, and the Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho Falls. The DOE hopes that the redefinition will expedite cleanup of the waste. Currently, the high-level waste stored at these sites is waiting for the government to open a secure waste repository (like Yucca Mountain in Nevada, which has been in limbo for decades). But if some of the less radioactive waste qualifies under the new definition, it might instead be shipped off to other sites, like one in Texas, where it could be mixed with “concrete-like grout.” The cleanup at Hanford has already cost the country billions of dollars and is projected to cost billions more as we continue the search for the waste’s final home. (Adding some urgency to developing a new plan is the risk that containers could leak and contaminate the environment, especially if there’s an earthquake in Washington.)

The DOE’s new plan could be cost-effective, sure, but the question is whether it’s safe. When the agency first announced reclassification plans in October 2018 and solicited public comment, the proposal received thousands of responses. And Washington state officials are not happy; Gov. Jay Inslee and Department of Ecology Director Maia Bellon have both sent letters of concern to the DOE. “I am gravely concerned with DOE forging ahead with a new interpretation of HLW that does not comport with federal law, despite objections from Washington state,” wrote Bellon.

Some countries tried storing barrels of waste in ice sheets, which turns out to be less than ideal given that ice both moves and melts.

In addition to the waste we already have sitting around at Hanford and other old nuclear weapons facilities (charmingly called “legacy waste”), nearly 100 commercial nuclear reactors at 60 facilities around the U.S. are creating new waste every day. The type of waste produced by those two types of facility contains different radioactive materials with varying half-lives, but the same storage issues remain: What will we eventually do with all this radioactive stuff?

The lack of solution is not from lack of discussion. There have been all sorts of wacky ideas floated about where to store nuclear waste. Some have proposed we shoot it all into space, maybe have it orbit Venus. But given how spacecraft are prone to explosions, which would effectively mean showering the world with bits of radioactive waste, that idea stalled. In the ’90s, the idea of burying waste in deep ocean seabeds seemed promising, but it never really got off the ground. And some countries tried storing barrels of waste in ice sheets, which turns out to be less than ideal given that ice both moves and melts. As the earth thaws out, old waste becomes uncovered.

Here in the U.S., we’re running out of space, and experts are concerned about the lack of long-term solutions. “Instead of a planned, coherent system, we have the confusion of an unplanned, less than optimal system,” nuclear experts wrote in a 2018 report on nuclear waste management strategy and policy, calling the U.S. program “an ever-tightening Gordian Knot” subject to technical, scientific, logistical, regulatory, legal, financial, social, and political challenges. “This is not a situation that builds public confidence.”

Currently, we’re at a standstill. In 1987, the government designated Yucca Mountain in southern Nevada as the storage facility for waste, but more than three decades later, proper approvals are still pending. Buckets of radioactive waste are still sitting around at the various facilities around the U.S., waiting for a place to go. While critics from environmental advocacy organizations like Columbia Riverkeeper and National Resource Defense Council have condemned the DOE’s reclassification, calling it “irresponsible,” “outrageous,” and an “attempt to cut corners,” local government welcomed the new policy. Richland, Washington, Mayor Bob Thompson told the Tri-City Herald that the decision was a “fantastic opportunity” to speed up Hanford’s cleanup.

We could avoid adding to the problem by trying to reduce the amount of waste generated. One way to do that is to recycle. By separating out uranium and plutonium from used nuclear fuel, engineers can reuse those in reactors to generate additional energy and throw out the rest. “Ninety-five percent of original energy is in the unused fuel,” says Kathryn Huff, an assistant professor of nuclear engineering at the University of Illinois, who likens the process to recycling a soda can: You wash out the sugar and dirt to reuse the aluminum. By reusing fuel, nuclear plants could cut down on the amount of space they need for waste containment by an order or two of magnitude.

On that front, countries like France, the U.K., and Japan are way ahead of us. France, in particular, leads the game; it generates about 80 percent of its energy through nuclear plants, but thanks to its recycling site, called La Hague, the waste currently fits “in a room not significantly bigger than a basketball court,” says Huff. Of course, the U.S. is a far bigger country than France, we’ve run our reactors for longer, and we have a lot more waste already sitting around, so we’ll never shrink our waste pile to that size. But La Hague is a testament to how the amount of true waste can be reduced through reprocessing.

Adopting recycling is subject to many of the same logistical and regulatory pitfalls as building a repository. For one, recycling is more expensive, and without regulatory pressure to change existing systems, commercial nuclear energy plants may not want to pony up the cash. (Opponents of reprocessing, like the Union of Concerned Scientists, also point to high costs of reprocessing, estimating it could cost tens or even hundreds of billions to implement.) Beyond the costs of just reprocessing waste, we’d also have to build critical infrastructure, like recycling facilities and retrofitting of existing reactors to accept recycled fuel. France’s energy system is government-run, and its government has decided to invest the money to have less waste sitting around in the long term.

To make progress on recycling, or building a repository, or even having a coherent plan for the roughly 80,000 metric tons of waste in our country, experts say any decisions about nuclear management need to be removed from the political cycle. “The instability in the dynamics of American politics makes it a challenge to develop a sustainable program,” says Huff. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future, a group of experts assembled by the Obama administration in 2012, brought up similar concerns in its recommendations and suggested that the government establish an entirely new government entity to oversee nuclear waste policy. “The overall record of DOE and of the federal government as a whole, however, has not inspired widespread confidence or trust in our nation’s nuclear waste management program,” the commission wrote in the final report. “The Commission concludes that a new, single-purpose organization is needed … to get the waste program back on track.” Members recommended also that this organization would solicit active consent from affected communities and implement policies that would provide continuity from administration to administration.

But until then, it seems inevitable that the rules will keep shifting, and we’ll keep passing the buck on the problem of waste management. What’s now “high-level” waste seems destined to be reclassified, but it’s also possible that the next administration could change the definition right back. Unless the government moves toward a longer-term solution, we’ll likely be stuck in limbo until something catastrophic happens, the waste’s radioactivity decreases over thousands of years, or the world ends—whichever comes first.

NYT reporter: Sources say Christopher Steele worried DOJ inspector general will 'throw him under the bus',https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/nyt-reporter-sources-say-christopher-steele-worried-doj-inspector-general-will-throw-him-under-the-bus,"Trump dossier author Christopher Steele is seemingly deeply worried about the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse investigation being carried out by the Justice Department inspector general.

Matthew Rosenberg, a correspondent for the New York Times and CNN national security analyst, said he has spoken with people in Steele's orbit who confirmed the British ex-spy is willing to meet with “investigators close to the inspector general investigation."" But Steele is also “incredibly concerned and obsessed that this investigation is going to throw him under the bus,"" Rosenberg said Tuesday on CNN.

This week a report from the Times in the United Kingdom said Steele is willing to meet with U.S. officials, but only to discuss his work for the FBI as a confidential source, and wants the United States to get permission from the U.K. government first. The report came out as President Trump was in the country for a state visit.

Quoting sources close to Steele, Rosenberg framed Steele’s thinking as, ""‘Look, I was working on this dossier other people were paying for — that the Democrats were paying for. I saw things that seemed frightening to me and alarming. And I went to old contacts at the FBI to tell them. I wasn’t a paid source in this case.’ That’s his view of it.”

Steele’s dossier, which was packed with unverified claims about President Trump's ties to Russia, formed a key part of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications that were used to justify surveillance warrants against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. Steele was working for Fusion GPS, which received funding through the Perkins Coie law firm from the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee. Steele's Democratic benefactors were not revealed to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.

Rosenberg said Steele does not think he should be blamed for any actions of the FBI or DOJ and “he was simply helping them out and what they did with it, whether they misused it in a FISA or whatever they did, he had nothing to do with that.”

Rosenberg agreed with this assessment, saying Steele wasn’t part of the FISA process, but was “simply a source of information.”

Steele worked to provide information from his dossier to over a dozen journalists and media organizations. Steele also used various government contacts, such as top DOJ official Bruce Ohr, State Department official Kathleen Kavalec, and others, in his efforts to get the dossier into the hands of U.S. officials and have it taken seriously.

“[Steele] is acutely concerned that he’s going to be thrown under the bus here,” Rosenberg noted.

Earlier this year Attorney General William Barr said he expected inspector general Michael Horowitz’s investigation to be wrapped up by the end of May or June. Fox News host Sean Hannity said this week that sources were telling him Barr may already have a copy of the inspector general's report on the FISA abuse investigation, so if Horowitz does soon speak with Steele it is unclear what that will mean for the inquiry that was thought to be winding down if not complete.

Barr also is taking a broader look into the origins of the Russia investigation and picked U.S. Attorney John Durham to lead the review."
DHS officials tell senators migrants are 'renting babies' to cross the border,https://www.politico.com,['Marianne Levine'],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/06/dhs-migrants-renting-babies-border-1356307,"A U.S. Customs and Border Protection vehicle sits near the border wall with Mexico in Calexico, Calif. | Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo Immigration DHS officials tell senators migrants are 'renting babies' to cross the border

Department of Homeland Security officials told senators at a lunch Wednesday that migrants are “renting babies” to speed their trip across the border, according to Sen. Chuck Grassley.

“I can't believe that this actually happened, that the people down there in Central America or Mexico are renting babies to get across the border and then sending the babies back and renting them again to come back across the border,” he Iowa Republican said Thursday.

Grassley said DHS officials made the claim at the GOP’s weekly Steering Committee lunch. He said he did not request additional evidence but expressed alarm if it is true.

“I hope you guys will help advertise that, assuming that the information I heard yesterday was accurate, because that is a humanitarian crisis that we have to be concerned about,” Grassley said.

DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

This not the first time DHS officials have claimed children are being used to make border crossings, though the agency has presented little evidence of fraudulent cases.

Earlier this year, then-DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said the agency uncovered “‘recycling rings’ where innocent young people are used multiple times to help aliens gain illegal entry.”

DHS has recently begun an initiative to look into “fake families” as a way to discourage child trafficking.

Under the pilot program, federal immigration officials have requested DNA samples to help confirm parent-child relationships of migrants caught at the border.

Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Mark Morgan told reporters Tuesday that 206 fraudulent cases had been identified from mid-April through the end of May. However, he did not say how many of those cases involved children traveling with another relative who was not a biological parent or step-father or step-mother.

Grassley’s comments come amid Republican senators' growing frustration that Mexico has not done more to stem crossings at the border.

“Every carrot I know has been exhausted in terms of getting the Mexican government to be more cooperative on a sustained basis,” Sen. Marco Rubio said. “A lot of what’s driving this migration is the reality that they’re going to be assisted on that path toward the United States.”

"Civil rights groups snub Barr meeting on police reform, despite past outcry",https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/civil-rights-groups-snub-barr-meeting-on-police-reform-despite-past-outcry,"Attorney General Bill Barr got a surprise this week when he hosted a listening session for civil rights groups supposedly concerned about the Justice Department's commitment to police reform.

Hardly anybody showed up.

DOJ REVEALS DEMS ACKNOWLEDGED BARR SUBPOENA WAS 'OVERBROAD'; NADLER FIRES BACK, OFFERS TO MEET 'WITHOUT CONDITIONS'

The meeting itself stemmed from a commitment he made to Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., during his confirmation hearing. The 2020 presidential candidate had challenged Barr to host the session to discuss a memo from his predecessor Jeff Sessions limiting the use of so-called ""consent decrees"" to reform local police departments accused of rights violations.

But after Barr invited numerous groups to such a meeting on Tuesday, the only person to attend was Frederick Misilo, president of the Arc, an organization that provides advocacy for those with intellectual disabilities.

A statement from the Justice Department said the meeting between Barr and Misilo was “productive” and touted the “critical role” of partnerships between the federal government and state agencies in protecting people’s rights.

“As Attorney General Barr publicly stated in his Senate hearings, he is committed to vigorous enforcement of federal civil rights laws and has directed the Department to continue its diligent work on these matters,” the statement said.

However, a Justice Department official accused the other invited organizations of letting politics get in the way of advancing that conversation.

“The attorney general clearly spent the time to listen to this one president, and if there were more folks, we would have had more perspectives, but they kind of just wanted to play the political games,” the official told The Washington Post.

Misilo told the Post that the 40-minute discussion with Barr was “helpful,” and that Barr expressed “an openness to take our interests under advisement,” though Barr did not commit to any specific action.

The other organizations on Barr’s invite list were the American Civil Liberties Union, the NAACP, the Human Rights Campaign, the National Fair Housing Alliance, UnidosUS, and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund.

The Leadership Conference on Civil & Human Rights, a coalition of civil rights groups, sent a letter to Barr on Tuesday explaining why the above groups were not going to meet with him. They said a larger number of them had initially requested a meeting with Barr, but the attorney general only selected a portion of them. The letter was signed by the six groups who declined Barr’s invitation, as well as others who were not invited -- including The Drug Policy Alliance, Human Rights Watch, The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and the National Urban League.

""In our view, the decision not to include certain organizations severely limits the Department's ability to learn about and consider the critical civil rights and public safety issues at stake,"" the letter said.

The handling of consent decrees has long been a contentious issue.

The Obama administration had used such decrees in cities where there were concerns of unfair treatment of minorities by the police. A consent decree with the Baltimore Police Department, for example, came about after a DOJ investigation found patterns of discriminatory conduct.

Sessions’ memo said that while consent decrees are “sometimes necessary and appropriate to secure compliance with federal law,” there are federalism-based concerns with federal court decrees that govern state and local government entities. It outlined requirements for future consent decrees, including defined limits on the terms of decrees, as well as “specific and measurable actions that trigger the decree's termination,” so that a consent decree can come to an end if an agency shows that they have “come into durable compliance” with the relevant federal laws.

The Justice Department stated that Barr is also planning a listening session with state and local law enforcement, and that ""the Department's door remains open to groups who wish to discuss these important civil and constitutional issues.""

Sessions' memo was sent out in November 2018. Since then, the DOJ has still used consent decrees, entering into one to reform the Chicago Police Department in January 2019."
"The President’s ‘Emergency’ Tariffs on Mexican Goods, Explained",https://www.nytimes.com,['Charlie Savage'],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/06/us/mexico-tariffs.html,"But the law does not mention tariffs, and no previous president has used it to impose them, according to the Congressional Research Service. The law has been used to impose sanctions on foreign adversaries and wrongdoers — blocking their property and prohibiting transactions with them — for things like terrorism, human rights abuses, malicious hacking, narcotics trafficking, and the proliferation weapons of mass destruction.

What can Congress do about it?

Under the National Emergencies Act of 1976, Congress can legally terminate an “emergency” that a president says exists — and turn off the special powers the president has activated — by enacting a resolution to do so. Senate Republicans apparently threatened to join Democrats in doing just that after a lunch this week in which they were briefed by administration lawyers about the tariffs proposal.

“I will yield to nobody in passion and seriousness and commitment for securing the border,” Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, told reporters afterward. “But there’s no reason for Texas farmers and ranchers and manufacturers and small businesses to pay the price of massive new taxes” — a burden he estimated would be about $30 billion in his state alone.

But Mr. Trump predicted Republican lawmakers who are openly angry at his plans would back down, saying it would be “foolish” for them to try to block him. And because he can veto such a resolution, at least two-thirds of the lawmakers in each chamber must be willing to vote to override his veto for such a resolution to prevail, meaning many Republicans would have to take the political risk of publicly breaking ranks with Mr. Trump.

What other emergency actions has Trump taken or threatened?

In February, after a standoff with House Democrats over funding for his border wall caused a record-breaking government shutdown, Mr. Trump declared that illegal migration and drug smuggling along the southern border had created a “national emergency” there, enabling him to redirect billions of dollars in Pentagon funds, which Congress had appropriated for other purposes, to border barriers.

That move is currently tied up in court. But Congress separately tried to stop it by passing a resolution to terminate his emergency declaration, with about a dozen Republican lawmakers in each chamber joining Democrats to approve it. Mr. Trump vetoed the resolution, and with most Republicans still sticking with him, an override effort failed to reach the two-thirds threshold to pass the House.

The Trump administration also declared an emergency last month to permit it to circumvent Congress and sell about $7 billion in arms to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan that had been stopped by lawmakers last year, invoking a provision of the Arms Export Control Act of 1976 for national-security exigencies. A bipartisan group of senators announced this week that they would push a set of resolutions to block that move, but their fate was unclear."

Democrats lurching toward potential impeachment and ramping up their probes of President Donald Trump are becoming increasingly worried that the Justice Department will subvert their efforts.

An internal DOJ watchdog report on the origins of the Russia probe is expected to spotlight potential political bias by FBI agents at the heart of the Russia probe. The report, due out as soon as this month and as late as October, could raise pointed questions about the FBI’s decision-making at the time — handing Trump a bludgeon in his long-running campaign to accuse the bureau of mounting a “coup” against him.

Story Continued Below

They fear the report, by DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz, who is respected by lawmakers from both parties, will diminish any momentum Democrats are seeking in their efforts to convince Americans that Trump obstructed the Russia investigation, later taken over by special counsel Robert Mueller.

“Their whole point is to go on a wild goose chase and then to create a chain of implausible connections that show that the special counsel report — and what we’re doing — is somehow fruit of the poisonous tree. It’s absurd,” Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), a member of the Judiciary and Oversight committees, said in an interview.

Members of both parties largely acknowledge that the results of the inspector general’s report are likely to bode poorly for the senior FBI officials who decided to launch the investigation into Trump’s presidential campaign — in turn, giving Trump and his allies much-needed political firepower against House Democrats who are seeking to highlight the evidence laid out in Mueller’s report.

Beginning next week, Democrats are pursuing an aggressive public-relations strategy aimed at illuminating the evidence, as laid out in Mueller’s report, that Trump sought to thwart or otherwise shut down the special counsel’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. That pursuit — part of an effort by Democratic leaders to make the case to the public that Trump should be impeached — could face significant roadblocks if Republicans get their way.

And it’s not just the IG report that could disrupt Democrats’ plans. Trump recently gave Attorney General William Barr broad authority to declassify information about how the Russia probe began — an order that prompted Democrats to warn of selective declassification that wouldn’t tell the full story.

“I don’t think it will throw us off track, but it will certainly give Republicans ammunition to try to divert attention away from the specifics of the Mueller investigation,” said Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.), a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee. “It’s a profound breach of confidence that the legislative branch has in the executive branch, and a profound disruption in the intelligence apparatus worldwide.”

In particular, the inspector general’s report is likely to embolden Trump and give his allies new ammunition to discredit Democrats’ pursuit of Trump’s personal finances and additional evidence that he obstructed justice — probes that Republicans have long derided as politically motivated and an abuse of congressional authority.

“Because Inspector General Horowitz is known for calling balls and strikes, any validity that he offers in his report that substantiates some of the things that conservative members have been saying for some time … will change the narrative overnight,” Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), a top Trump ally, said in an interview.

Trump is likely to latch on to any hint of evidence that would suggest that an anti-Trump bias permeated the upper echelons of the FBI. His allies on Capitol Hill have been parroting those claims of bias, in addition to allegations that senior officials leaked information to the media and inappropriately relied upon salacious and unverified claims about Trump that were outlined in a controversial dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201906/2786/1155968404_6044499667001_6044494384001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

“Just like [Democrats] waited for the Mueller report to come out, they should wait for the IG’s report to come out,” Meadows added. “Because the IG’s report will actually go at the root of improper motivations on the investigation.”

Democrats, wary of Republicans’ narrative becoming dominant, are preemptively trying to dispel those claims.

“If there’s really a ‘deep state’ within DOJ to tank Donald Trump, then they should’ve revealed in 2016 that they had a counterintelligence investigation ongoing with regard to the Trump campaign,” said Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.), who sits on the Intelligence and Oversight committees. “The fact that they reopened the Hillary Clinton investigation on the eve of the election is potent proof that there’s no deep state conspiracy at DOJ against Donald Trump.”

“There’s nothing there. It’s a big nothingburger,” Krishnamoorthi added.

The release of the IG report will mark the second time in two years that Horowitz’s work will have become a flashpoint in Congress’ efforts to get to the bottom of Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. Last year, he issued a report on the FBI’s handling of the 2016 Hillary Clinton probe, concluding that he couldn’t find evidence that political bias affected any decisions in the investigation.

His bottom-line finding heartened Democrats, but Horowitz also revealed he was continuing to probe potential bias in the opening of the FBI’s Russia probe, launched just weeks after the Clinton investigation ended in July 2016. One of the agents involved in both investigations, Peter Strzok, has become a fixture for Republicans, who unearthed thousands of text messages last year in which Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page sharply criticized Trump.

“[W]e did not have confidence that Strzok’s decision to prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on the [Clinton probe] was free from bias,” Horowitz concluded in that report.

Though Horowitz concluded that potential bias was unlikely to have affected the Clinton probe — in part because of multiple layers of decision-making at the FBI — he drew no conclusions on whether Strzok’s personal views infected his actions in the Russia probe, telling lawmakers last year that it was still under review.

V.A.

That number, based on the department’s eligibility projections, could increase as much as 30 percent under the new Mission Act, adding just over a half-million veterans to the pool seeking private care — although both critics and supporters of the change believe that number is low.

“I think it’s safe to assume that over the next several years you will see more veterans getting their health care in the community,” said Dan Caldwell, a senior adviser to Concerned Veterans for America — an advocacy group with ties to the billionaire industrialist Charles G. Koch — which has pursued expanding the use of private health care for veterans. Democrats on Capitol Hill agree.

Even so, it will take some time to see whether the expanded access to private care results in a gentle migration of veterans who are not being well served by nearby V.A. centers, or in a shift of a significant share of veteran care to an increasingly expensive private health care marketplace, starving the V.A., as critics have warned. The quality of care in the private system, as well as wait times within it, will be closely monitored by both opponents and supporters of private care.

“I don’t expect a flood of veterans coming in tomorrow or next week saying I want to go into the private sector,” Robert Wilkie, the secretary of veterans affairs, said Tuesday in an interview. “I’m confident that we will have a good rollout. I’m looking forward to it.” Mr. Wilkie said he will visit the V.A. in Salem, Va., on Thursday to observe the start there.

Mr. Wilkie has repeatedly said that most veterans would continue to seek care at department health care centers because they largely like the care and the understanding of veterans’ issues. Several studies underscore the V.A.’s popularity."
"Sally Yates, ex-DOJ official fired by Trump, to raise money for Georgia Democrats",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,['Steven Senne Ap'],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/sally-yates-ex-doj-official-fired-by-trump-to-raise-money-for-georgia-democrats,"Former acting Attorney General Sally Yates, a career federal prosecutor who tangled with the Trump administration but has presented herself as apolitical and nonpartisan, is scheduled to attend a Georgia Democratic Party fundraiser on Thursday.



Sally Yates (Steven Senne/AP)

Yates, 58, is slated to attend an ""Official Battleground After Party” fundraiser Thursday night in Atlanta, sponsored by Georgia Democrats. The appearance comes nearly a year and a half since she left her Justice Department position involuntarily, on Jan. 30, 2017. Yates, heading the Justice Department while President Trump's attorney general nominee, Jeff Sessions, awaited confirmation, refused to enforce the new administration's travel ban order.

Yates had been deputy attorney general during the final two years of the Obama administration. She ascended to acting attorney general once President Barack Obama's attorney general, Loretta Lynch, resigned upon Trump's inauguration.

Her 10-day tenure was dominated by her warnings about then-national security adviser Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, whose contacts with foreign government officials including Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak led her to be fear that he may be compromised.

Yates later told a Senate committee she was concerned Flynn might have violated the Logan Act, a late 19th century law prohibiting private citizens from engaging in negotiations with foreign governments.

Yates' concerns became more fleshed out with the May 2019 release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report, which suggested the FBI had been looking into Flynn even before his calls with foreign officials during the Trump transition.

Flynn was not charged with crimes related to collusion, coordination, or conspiracy with the Russian government in 2016 — indeed, no Americans were — but he did eventually plead guilty to lying to the FBI. Flynn allegedly denied to investigators that he’d spoken with Kislyak about sanctions from the U.S. in response to Russia’s election interference, even though the FBI says that a transcript of their talk says otherwise.

Yates was eventually fired on Jan. 30, 2017, not because of her involvement in the Flynn affair, but following her statement that the Justice Department under her leadership would not enforce Trump’s executive order temporarily banning any immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries.

Trump’s executive order was issued on Jan. 27, 2017, and that same day Yates said that the Justice Department would not be enforcing it. “My responsibility is to ensure that the position of the Department of Justice is not only legally defensible, but is informed by our best view of what the law is after consideration of all the facts,” Yates wrote. “At present, I am not convinced that the defense of the Executive Order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the Executive Order is lawful.”

“Consequently, for as long as I am the Acting Attorney General, the Department of Justice will not present arguments in defense of the Executive Order, unless and until I become convinced that it is appropriate to do so,” Yates said at the time.

Trump fired her three days later.

Yates was praised for her decision by a number of Obama holdovers inside the Justice Department at the time, including Andrew Weissman, who emailed her, “I am so proud. And in awe. Thank you so much. All my deepest respects.” Weissman would go on to be Mueller’s right-hand man when the special counsel investigation was launched in May 2017 following the firing of then-FBI Director James Comey.

Yates subsequently further explained her reasons for refusing to enforce Trump’s order, saying, “I came ultimately to the conclusion that our defending this travel ban would require me to send lawyers of the Justice Department to court to say this ban had nothing to do with religion — it was all based on national security, nothing to do with religion.”

Throughout the episode, Yates portrayed herself publicly as a nonpolitical figure. Georgia Democrats courted her to run for governor in 2018 or Senate in 2020, but she declined both times.

Yates, now in private law practice in Atlanta, did not respond to a request for comment by the Washington Examiner."
Interior has 5 versions of the secretary's schedule -- but they don't always match,https://www.cnn.com,['Ellie Kaufman'],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/politics/david-bernhardt-conflicting-calendars-interior/index.html,"Washington (CNN) During the early days of the Trump administration, lawmakers and government watchdogs complained agencies weren't turning over Cabinet secretaries' schedules as has been practice. Now, one department has presented those groups with the opposite problem, creating new questions about a lack of consistency and transparency.

The Interior Department has released five different versions of Secretary David Bernhardt's schedule for the first five months of 2019.

The department released Google calendar entries, two versions of daily cards -- which are synopses of the secretary's calendar given to him as a reminder of upcoming events, according to Interior -- briefing book pages and secretary's schedules, which are released on the same section of the Interior website as press releases.

But many of these sources give conflicting information when compared side by side on any given day.

With none of the five sources apparently being the definitive record, it raises questions about what the secretary is actually using to schedule his days and why the public doesn't have access to it.

Conflicting schedules

Take January 10 of this year.

At 9:30 a.m., Bernhardt had a meeting titled ""deputy secretary lapse working group."" Or did he? That information comes from his Google calendar entry, a schedule page and the daily cards for that day. So, it seems clear.

But the briefing book entry for the day says Bernhardt attended a staff meeting at that time. Is that the same meeting or a different one?

Then, according to the briefing book, he had two vaguely described entries -- another staff meeting at 11 a.m. and an ""external lunch off the record"" at noon.

So, what do the Google calendar, daily cards and secretary's schedule page have at that time? No mention of an 11 a.m. meeting, but an additional 11:45 a.m. meeting with Matt Pottinger and Eric Johnson (NSC) and no mention of a 12 p.m. lunch but a 12:30 p.m. meeting with Brian Jack (OPA), according to the Google calendar and daily cards. NSC stands for the National Security Council and OPA stands for Office of Political Affairs, an office in the White House. The department schedule page seems to confirm that information in a more opaque way, listing an 11:45 a.m. meeting with NSC and a 12:30 p.m. meeting with OPA.

Depending on which calendar you pick, at 2 p.m., Bernhardt either had a meeting with ""Bremberg & Leggit (DPC)"" according to the Google calendar, daily cards and secretary's schedule page, or he had an ""external call - TRCP,"" according to the briefing book. TRCP stands for Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership. A spokesperson for the group confirmed that a member of their organization had a phone call with Bernhardt on that day and time.

At 4:15 p.m., Bernhardt was either in a staff meeting, according to his Google calendar and secretary's schedule page, or he was in an ""AS/WS Operations Meeting,"" according to two versions of the daily cards for that day.

Maybe those are the same, since an operations meeting would presumably be with staff. And that's just one day.

""Like most (if not all) of us, the Secretary of the Interior has a daily schedule that is subject to constant change,"" Interior Department spokeswoman Molly Block said.

""Appointments that were expected get canceled, unexpected appointments arise and plans get interrupted by events. The department seeks to ensure that the public has access to the secretary's activities by posting online the various tools used to plan his day by different staff members,"" Block said. ""We are constantly working to ensure that the public has a window into the work the secretary is doing on behalf of the American people.""

Five calendars, no consensus

Not all of the calendars conflict every day. On certain days, all five versions of Bernhardt's schedule line up. In some cases, external meetings that don't include meeting attendees on the daily cards have meeting attendees listed in the secretary's schedule page for the same day. Since mid-March, versions of the secretary's schedule pages have included more names of meeting participants.

But there are too many discrepancies to know what the secretary is doing other days. On February 21, there are at least three discrepancies between the name or subject of the meeting, and another 10 instances of meetings and departure times not listed on all the calendars.

And it's not just the entries themselves that don't line up. The different sources of Bernhardt's scheduling information don't cover all five months of 2019. The department posted Google calendar entries from January to May, two versions of daily cards from January to April 16, briefing book pages from January to March and webpages with the the secretary's schedule page from January to March and April 28 to May 24.

The Center for Western Priorities, a watchdog group that focuses on environmental issues and has been critical of the Trump administration, feels the deluge of contradictory information is not just a matter of sloppy record keeping, but rather a concerted effort to conceal the secretary's activities from the public.

""Despite numerous requests from the public, the press, and Congress, David Bernhardt still refuses to release his actual calendar -- the one that tells him not just where to go, but what his meetings are about,"" Center for Western Priorities Deputy Director Aaron Weiss told CNN. ""It's not just a lack of transparency. It's Bernhardt taking repeated steps to conceal his actions.""

Some of the entries include vague terms like ""external"" and ""internal"" meeting, which Bernhardt has been criticized for in the past, because it gives little insight into who he's meeting with and for what purpose they're meeting.

A CNN review found 88 entries in Bernhardt's daily cards that use the term ""external"" or ""intergovernmental"" to describe a meeting without any further details.

""No one keeps a day planner that only says 'internal briefing' and 'external meeting' with no details. You simply couldn't' function,"" Weiss said.

Calendar controversy continues

Bernhardt, a former fossil fuel lobbyist, previously came under scrutiny from watchdog groups and Democratic members of Congress for not releasing his full schedule publicly. When asked by the House Natural Resources Committee to provide his complete schedule earlier this year, Bernhardt said he had ""not personally maintained a calendar for years,"" and that he had ""no intention of doing so now,"" in a letter to the committee.

A week before his confirmation vote in the Senate, Interior published hundreds of pages of documents containing new details about some meetings that were left off of previous versions of Bernahrdt's calendars.

The House Oversight Committee and the House Natural Resources Committee requested interviews with four Interior staff members to further investigate recordkeeping practices at the department in March.

Before becoming secretary, Bernhardt served as deputy secretary to former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. When Zinke resigned amid a host of ethics scandals at the end of 2018, Bernhardt stepped in to lead the agency in an acting role and was confirmed to the post in April.

When Zinke announced his resignation in December, he referred to the allegations against him as ""false.""

""I love working for the President and am incredibly proud of all the good work we've accomplished together,"" Zinke wrote on Twitter. ""However, after 30 years of public service, I cannot justify spending thousands of dollars defending myself and my family against false allegations."""
Former FBI lawyer James Baker cooperating with DOJ inspector general's FISA abuse investigation,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/former-fbi-lawyer-james-baker-cooperating-with-doj-inspector-generals-fisa-abuse-investigation,"The Justice Department watchdog's investigation into Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse might not be winding down yet.

Former top FBI lawyer James Baker said this week he is cooperating with the Justice Department inspector general's investigation.

""I have had a longstanding relationship with the inspector general's office, because I firmly believe in the appropriateness and the need for effective oversight of the FBI,"" Baker said in a CNN interview.

Baker's admission is another sign that despite what Attorney General William Barr said earlier this year, Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigation may not be completed by early June.

A focus of Horowitz's investigation is the FBI's use of an unverified dossier on President Trump's ties to Russia, written by British ex-spy Christopher Steele, to obtain warrants to surveil onetime Trump campaign official Carter Page.

Although Fox News host Sean Hannity said this week that sources were telling him Barr may already have a copy of the inspector general's report on the FISA abuse investigation, a British newspaper reported Horowitz may soon be interviewing Steele, casting into further uncertainty the status of the inquiry.

Baker took a lead role in reviewing those FISA applications before submitting them to the FISA court. He has said he took the information ""seriously"" but ""not necessarily literally,"" and also that he is ""nervous"" about Horowitz.

Baker told CNN he is also open to helping Attorney General William Barr and U.S. Attorney John Durham with their review of the origins of the Russia investigation. He stressed that it was a ""small group"" who led the FBI's counterintelligence inquiry into Trump's campaign, namely former FBI Director James Comey and former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.

Baker was appointed FBI general counsel in January 2014 and reassigned by FBI Director Christopher Wray in December 2017. Last year, it was reported that Baker was resigning, and since has written for the Lawfare blog and joined the conservative think tank R Street Institute.

He is also under criminal investigation for alleged unauthorized leaks to the media during his time at the bureau."
Congress and Mueller need to step up and protect America from presidents like Trump,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Donald Ayer', 'Opinion Contributor', 'Published A.M. Et June']",06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/06/07/trump-tramples-constitution-congress-mueller-protect-america-column/1351993001/,"CLOSE

Congress should pass laws to prevent dangerous norm-smashing by Trump and potential like-minded successors. And Mueller must talk to counteract Barr.

I was appointed a United States attorney by President Ronald Reagan and later a deputy attorney general by President George H.W. Bush. All of us at the Justice Department swore an oath to defend the Constitution, not a president or political party. It is not easy for me to acknowledge that we are witnessing a slow-motion unraveling of the bedrock belief that no one is above the law, not even the president.

This unraveling is aided and abetted by a chief law enforcement officer who first articulated his extreme view of executive power more than 30 years ago: William Barr believes the attorney general is “the president’s lawyer.” He is acting like it today, breaking norms that protect the integrity of the justice system no matter who is in the White House. That is why former special counsel Robert Mueller must resist his own instincts to return to private life, and Congress must insist that the truth be told and that norms threatened today be codified into law.

We need a bipartisan response to Barr

Barr has just been thoroughly contradicted by the special counsel. Mueller’s public appearance makes all the more stunning Barr’s action in stepping in to all but exonerate the president 25 days before releasing even a redacted version of Mueller’s report which explicitly stated the opposite. This pattern of behavior by Barr is rooted in his unsolicited memo to the White House and the Justice Department auditioning for attorney general six months before he was nominated.

In that memo, Barr laid out his extreme interpretation of presidential power and of the obstruction of justice statutes and argued it was nearly impossible for a president to commit the crime. He critically pre-judged Mueller’s conclusions before reviewing evidence, writing “Mueller’s obstruction theory is fatally misconceived.” Barr made the untenable claim that Section 1512(c)(2) does not prevent a president from exercising his or her authority over law enforcement proceedings to improperly interfere in an investigation. This extreme view literally puts a president above the law.

How can all of us across the ideological spectrum who reject that view respond effectively?

First, Congress needs to find its voice. Article I of the Constitution gives Congress far-reaching authority to oversee the executive branch. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham are actively providing political cover for Trump to eviscerate centuries-old norms. They must remind themselves that what benefits a runaway executive of their party, could empower an aspiring despot from the left next time. The Mueller report makes a very strong case that Trump obstructed justice, a conclusion more than 1,000 former prosecutors, including lifelong Republicans, reached independently.

Americans need to hear Mueller testimony

Mueller’s report includes 10 instances where President Donald Trump tried to cover up the truth, including ordering the White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Mueller, and then ordering McGahn to “dispute the story and to create a record stating he had not been ordered to have the special counsel removed.” The president sought to influence a number of people to lie, and even directed aides to create false documents and reports. Perhaps worst of all, Trump appears to have attempted to silence a number of witnesses, by dangling pardons as a reward for stonewalling investigators. If anyone else did what the president did, they would be facing prosecution and prison. Congress must hold hearings, with or without administration witnesses.

Second, the American people need to hear direct public testimony from Robert Mueller. I have known Bob Mueller since 1977 when we were assistant U.S. attorneys in adjacent offices, and I have always respected his sense of rectitude and restraint, but he waited weeks to set the record straight. By then, the attorney general had whitewashed his report in a conclusory letter and even held a press conference to further tout the White House political spin now discredited by Mueller — discredited everywhere that is but in the minds of busy Americans without time to dissect Mueller’s 448-page, carefully-worded tome.

Given Barr’s unprecedented efforts to misstate his investigation’s findings, Mueller needs to recognize that his work is not quite done. If all he does is repeat the findings of his own report for a second time, that will in itself be a critical act of public service.

Start the climb back to the America we know

Third, Congress needs to legislate. The Mueller report identified norms smashed by this president which must be codified to have meaning again. Barr’s distressing success in obfuscating the law indicates a need for a new statute (perhaps to be called the William P. Barr No One Is Above The Law Act) reaffirming in unmistakable terms that the president is bound by the law like everyone else.

Given Barr’s assertions to the contrary, Congress should probably spell out that a president commits a crime when he or she falsifies a document or orders someone to create false official documents, uses the offer of a pardon to interfere with an ongoing law enforcement investigation, or encourages a Justice Department investigation into his or her political adversary. And this should be followed by a statement that the inclusion of these specific behaviors engaged in by Trump does not suggest the exclusion of other acts knowingly taken to obstruct an on-going investigation.

It will be a long climb back to the America we have known for generations — but unless Congress does its constitutional duty where Attorney General Barr has been derelict, future presidents might not feel compelled to lead us back in that direction at all. Patriots of all parties must stop this president from running roughshod over the Constitution we are all sworn to defend.

"Homeland Security watchdog whitewashed FEMA disaster audits, including for Louisiana",https://www.nola.com,"['The Washington', 'The Washington Post']",06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.nola.com/environment/2019/06/homeland-security-watchdog-whitewashed-fema-disaster-audits-including-for-louisiana.html,"After catastrophic floodwaters submerged wide stretches of southern Louisiana in 2016, displaced homeowners and officials criticized the federal recovery effort as dangerously slow, leaving thousands of people homeless for months.

Auditors in the Department of Homeland Security inspector general’s office confirmed the concerns with the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s performance in Louisiana - and 11 other states hit over five years by hurricanes, mudslides and other disasters.

Instead, the auditors' boss, John V. Kelly, directed them to produce what they called ""feel good reports"" that airbrushed most problems and portrayed emergency responders as heroes overcoming vast challenges, according to interviews and a new internal review.

Department of Homeland Security Acting Inspector General John V. Kelly

The watchdog concluded that FEMA's response in Louisiana, where 13 people died in the disaster, was a huge success, a ""remarkable,"" ""resilient and mission focused"" effort that ""provided hope and a way forward"" for flooded communities.

Under pressure from Congress, the inspector general in 2017 retracted and purged from its website the Louisiana flooding report, followed the next year with a dozen other audits of FEMA's initial responses. The office called them ""not compliant"" with federal auditing standards.

Now the oversight agency, which evaluates the performance of FEMA and the rest of Homeland Security, has turned the spotlight on itself. Last month it released a 14-month internal review of how Kelly, a career government auditor who rose to acting inspector general in late 2017, chose to flatter FEMA's staff in some reports, instead of hold them accountable.

Kelly's staff routinely praised FEMA's initial disaster responses from 2012 to 2017 with ""superlative language,"" investigators found - and they followed a formula. Each audit found the response ""effective and efficient."" Some reports used fawning terms.

They identified challenges FEMA faced. But invariably they praised the agency for overcoming them. Other negative information, if it pointed to systemic problems, was removed from drafts and sometimes placed in separate ""spin-off reports,"" the internal review found. The audits made no recommendations for improvements.

Investigators determined that Kelly didn't just direct his staff to remove negative findings. He potentially compromised their objectivity by praising FEMA's work ethic to the auditors, telling them they would see ""FEMA at her best"" and instructing supervisors to emphasize what the agency had done right in its disaster response.

The review concluded the office had not met its own standards.

""Our prior approach resulted in unacceptable failures,"" Jennifer Costello, the deputy inspector general, wrote to the head of the internal review team on May 21, calling the ""retraction of publicly issued reports because they are not reliable . . . not an insignificant matter.""

The reports, Costello wrote, ""represent millions of wasted taxpayer dollars and understandably cast doubt on our credibility."" She said the inspector general's office needs to ""hold ourselves to the same standards to which we hold the Department when conducting oversight of its programs and operation."" Kelly recused himself from the review.

Costello noted that the flawed audits represent a tiny fraction of the watchdog's otherwise hard-hitting oversight of FEMA.

In an interview with The Washington Post, Kelly denied directing his staff to sanitize its initial disaster reports. ""There was no motivation to make FEMA look good,"" he said.

He sent his staff an apology when the internal review was made public on May 23.

""I take responsibility for failing to set a tone that all of our products need to be fully objective,"" Kelly wrote. ""While I did not intend to set that tone with respect to the [FEMA] reports, I obviously did.""

Kelly, 64, oversees a staff of 600 auditors and investigators charged with rooting out waste, fraud and abuse in the third-largest federal agency. He plans to retire when the Senate confirms a permanent chief. President Trump has nominated Joseph V. Cuffari, a policy adviser to Arizona Republican Gov. Doug Ducey and experienced federal investigator.

The internal review did not find that Kelly ""was improperly influenced by a personal or family relationship,"" spokeswoman Arlen Morales said in an email. Nor did investigators find any ""deliberate effort to benefit FEMA for personal gain,"" she said.

Kelly has not faced discipline for coaxing his staff to produce the flawed reports.

""Because Mr. Kelly is the senior-most official in our organization, no one within [the office] has authority to impose corrective action upon him,"" Morales said.

Across the federal government, agencies depend on inspectors general to provide them with independent, fact-driven analysis of their performance, conducting audits and investigations to ensure that taxpayers' money is spent wisely.

Emergency management experts said that oversight, particularly from auditors on the ground as a disaster is unfolding, is crucial to improving the response, especially in ensuring that contracts are properly administered.

""I read a couple of those [retracted reports] and realized they weren't good enough to help me,"" said W. Craig Fugate, FEMA administrator for eight years under President Barack Obama.

""We're not that good,"" Fugate said of how the reports characterized FEMA's performance. ""The whole idea of the IG going out early was to find things we could do to take corrective action then.""

Even with improvements to emergency response in the deeply flawed aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, FEMA's performance still is closely watched by local communities and Congress, where disaster response in the Trump administration has become particularly politicized.

Congress agreed only this week to send billions of dollars in long-delayed relief to lingering recovery efforts from multiple natural disasters, including Puerto Rico's 2017 hurricane.

John Roth, who preceded Kelly as inspector general and promoted him to his second-in-command, called the flawed reports an aberration and described Kelly's oversight of other FEMA operations ""unstinting.""

""This was not a rogue IG gone bad,"" Roth said, calling Kelly as ""as square and true blue as you could get."" Roth acknowledged, though, that the mistakes underscore a challenge for inspectors general, who want to maintain credibility with the agencies they oversee while they are issuing critical reports.

After Hurricane Isaac, which killed 41 people in Louisiana and caused more than $3 billion in damage in 2012, auditors found several problems and proposed fixes on the ground before Kelly intervened.

Kelly wanted to ""downplay all the negatives"" because he believed the agency's ""overall"" response was ""good,"" the review found.

So the report cast the problems as ""pressing challenges"" for FEMA that included a shortage of experienced staff and a slow response from headquarters to requests from field staff. FEMA met the challenges, the since-retracted report said.

Auditors emphasized the good that arose from problems. Slow processing of funding requests were blamed on a byzantine process.

After Hurricane Sandy pummeled New York and New Jersey in 2012, Kelly told the staff in an email to alter their draft audits. Since ""FEMA's initial response was generally good for both disasters at all locations it would be best if all three reports were similar,"" Kelly wrote, referring to both Isaac and Sandy.

The audits became known among the staff as ""feel good"" reports.

When tornadoes struck Oklahoma in May and June of 2013, a supervisor who reported to Kelly tamped down the efforts of auditing teams that wanted to be more critical.

""Yes, we will identify some problems, but the point is - how did FEMA overcome them?"" the supervisor wrote to the auditing team, copying Kelly.

""These are feel-good reports to tell the public how well FEMA initially responds to disasters,"" the supervisor wrote. The reports were not to identify ""systemic problems.""

Kelly did not correct or clarify any of the assertions made in the email, the internal review said. ""These opportunities allow us to write quick, meaningful reports that actually help FEMA, and FEMA usually loves the reports,"" the supervisor wrote.

Months later, when catastrophic flooding devastated wide swaths of Colorado, auditors again tried to include their concerns about FEMA's shortcomings, but ""those efforts were ultimately rebuffed,"" investigators found.

The team wrote two spin-off reports following the flooding that found serious problems with the response. Disaster survivors who could not communicate in English or Spanish had problems finding FEMA staff to help them register for disaster aid. And the agency hired only half the workers that it needed for a proper response.

Kelly did not dispute investigators' conclusions about the retracted reports. He defended his approach, telling them he ""thought a report with a single message would be clearer and less likely to get lost or be ignored by FEMA,"" the internal review said.

It was the message the inspector general conveyed after the Louisiana flooding in 2016 that caught the attention of House Republicans. As they complained that FEMA was spending too much money on mobile homes that took months to arrive, the team supervisor changed the draft report to add language that discounted their complaints, investigators found.

Instead, the audit characterized FEMA's response in heroic terms, including ""superlative language,"" and said members of Congress were misguided in their criticism.

""The IG is telling us 'everything's fine,' when it obviously wasn't. It just never matched up,"" recalled former Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who was chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee. ""I wonder how much more pain was inflicted [on disaster victims] by the fact that people weren't being held accountable in real time.""

The committee had held two hearings on the flooding after Chaffetz's staff and two congressmen, including Rep. Garret Graves, R-La., who represents the flooded area, had flown to Baton Rouge to tour the damage.

An elderly man had died in a FEMA trailer with faulty air conditioning. The committee staff kept waiting for the inspector general's team to release its audit, hoping that professionals would confirm their observations and press FEMA to do better, recalled Mike Howell, a former staffer who worked on the issue.

But when the report came out, lawmakers were shocked - and livid.

""Our jaws just dropped,"" Howell recalled. ""They said everything is fine. I said, 'Did you even look at this issue, that issue and the man's death? All of the unoccupied FEMA trailers sitting on lots? The people still not in their houses who can't get a straight answer from FEMA?' They had no answer and we were enraged.""

In a report issued in October 2018 that criticized FEMA's disaster response, committee Republicans also took the inspector general to task.

A manager interviewed by the committee called the reports ""useless"" but said the staff ""kept producing them because that was what [Deputy Inspector General] John Kelly wanted.""

The internal review has led to changes: a new practice of rotating auditors to ""promote the objectivity and independence,"" a reduced ""reliance on testimonial evidence"" and an increased ""reliance on source documentation.""

The office is also training auditors to comply with auditing standards and ways to maintain independence from the people and agencies they are evaluating.

Costello, the deputy inspector general, said in an email, “We have all learned from this experience and are determined not to repeat these mistakes.”

US Energy Dept. Looking For A Few Good Clean Energy Women,https://cleantechnica.com,['Tina Casey'],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://cleantechnica.com/2019/06/06/us-energy-dept-looking-for-a-few-good-clean-energy-women/,"US Energy Dept. Looking For A Few Good Clean Energy Women

June 6th, 2019 by Tina Casey

Just in time for the latest wave of fetal fetishism to sweep across the US, the Department of Energy has embarked on a renewed push to recruit more women into the clean energy field. That’s going to be a little tricky considering the complications that arise for working women when lawmakers insert the cold, probing eye of unscientific public oversight into personal decisions on ubiquitous matters of health care (well, ubiquitous for women of birthing years). Nevertheless, let’s take a look and see what’s going on here.

What is the Clean Energy Education & Empowerment Technology Collaboration Program?

The Department of Energy is already proactive when it comes to recruiting women into the clean energy profession.

But, what do they mean by clean energy? Good question!

One key program that is C3E, the Clean Energy Education and Empowerment Technology Collaboration Program.

C3E comes under the umbrella of the International Energy Agency, and the key word here is clean. With that in mind don’t confuse IEA with IRENA, the International Renewable Energy Agency. IRENA is for renewables. IEA is all of the above.

If IEA is pitching a “clean” energy initiative, that’s going to cover a lot of ground including natural gas, nuclear energy, carbon capture, and energy efficiency.

As the picture comes into sharper focus, consider that the Energy Department first launched C3E during the Obama administration under the leadership of nuclear physicist Steven Chu.

The collaborative effort is now multinational in scope. The Energy Department has a leadership position at C3E, where it shepherds a smallish but interesting mix of participants amongst the fields of female recruiting. So far the members include Australia, Austria, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, Finland, Italy, and Sweden. And the US.

Yes, all 10 of these countries have women in them. That’s interesting, right?

They also represent almost one-third of the 31 members of the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.

That’s even more interesting! NEA concerns itself with issues of uranium supply and waste disposal, to name a few.

In the latest development involving the Energy Department’s support for C3E, a Senior Advisor from the agency’s Office of Nuclear Energy has been tapped for the position of Vice Chair at C3E.

There, fixed it for you. As far as the Energy Department is concerned, nuclear energy is clean energy.

Not All Clean Energy Is All That Clean

Setting aside that little thing about risks and hazards (Fukushima, much?), the nuclear energy field is a fascinating one from a science and technology perspective.

With deep roots in the history of both energy and warfare in the US, the nuclear field is all but guaranteed to maintain a favored position in US energy policy, which translates into job security for those who choose to invest in such a career.

That circles back around to the female recruitment issue. The energy field is one among many sectors competing in the rough-and-tumble race to attract top talent from around the world, which explains the drive for gender diversity as well as diversity in general. If the nuclear industry is going to survive, it’s going to need to attract top female talent.

That’s a tough row to hoe. The burgeoning wind energy and solar energy fields are competing for talent, too, and without the extra baggage of waste disposal and high-impact accidents that burden the nuclear field.

Nevertheless, it’s do or die. Take the US fossil fuel industry, for example. Researchers are beginning to note a collision course between the up-and-coming diversified workforce of tomorrow, and the tsunami of retirements as the existing male-dominated workforce ages out.

In other words, it’s a double whammy for coal, oil and gas: renewables are beating out fossil fuel for a share of the power generation sector, and they’re also nailing down the next generation of innovators, too.

The nuclear energy field could find itself facing a lethal brain drain as well.

If you have any thoughts about that, drop us a note in the comment thread.

Meanwhile, CleanTechnica reached out to IEA for some insights into the Energy Department’s recruitment efforts and they referred us to the Energy Department, so stay tuned for more on that.

US Commerce Department offers solution for obtaining minerals critical to the military,https://www.defensenews.com,"['Kelsey Reichmann', 'Kelsey Reichmann Is A General Assignment Editorial Fellow Supporting Defense News', 'Fifth Domain', 'Federal Times. She Attended California State University.']",06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.defensenews.com/global/the-americas/2019/06/05/us-commerce-department-offers-solution-for-obtaining-minerals-critical-to-the-military/,"A report by the U.S. Commerce Department recommends the government strengthen relations with foreign companies that provide minerals critical to military development.

The report was released Tuesday amid a trade war between the United States and China.

“The United States is heavily dependent on critical mineral imports. If China or Russia were to stop exports to the United States and its allies for a prolonged period — similar to China’s rare earths embargo in 2010 — an extended supply disruption could cause significant shocks throughout U.S. and foreign critical mineral supply chains,” the report states.

The report also notes that the U.S. is import-reliant on 31 of the 35 minerals designated as critical by the Department of the Interior. Furthermore, the U.S. completely relies on imports for 14 of these minerals.

The report also says the country’s imports of “critical mineral commodities” exceed 50 percent of its annual consumption. These rare earth minerals are often used in the production of aircraft, computers and GPS systems.

Last year China produced 78 percent of the world’s rare earth minerals, according to researchers at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

“These critical minerals are often overlooked but modern life without them would be impossible,” Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said in a news release. “Through the recommendations detailed in this report, the Federal government will take unprecedented action to ensure that the United States will not be cut off from these vital minerals.”

One solution to this problem is to enhance international trade and cooperation in relation to rare earth minerals, according to the report.

However, the Government Accountability Office in April found that the U.S. is reliant on China for several critical minerals. And China has noted that it could cut off the U.S. from some rare earth minerals should the trade war continue.

The report from the Department of Commerce proposes a continued expansion of rare earth minerals trading with Canada, Australia, the European Union, Japan and South Korea. It notably does not include China.

The report does, however, mention China as an area to which American production companies relocated, and it called for more investment in the National Defense Stockpile program.

The NDS program, which would provide critical materials to support industrial investments to help civilian needs in an emergency, is not financially sustainable, according to the report."
Talks Between Democrats and Justice Dept. in Doubt Over Barr Contempt Vote,https://www.nytimes.com,['Nicholas Fandos'],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/04/us/politics/trump-hope-hicks-annie-donaldson.html,"Under subpoenas issued by the Judiciary Committee, the two witnesses had been instructed to deliver on Tuesday a range of documents related to their work in the White House, including notes and records related to some of Mr. Trump’s attempts to thwart federal investigators — attempts documented by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, in the report he completed in March.

Mr. Nadler said that Ms. Hicks, who also served as a top aide on Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign, did produce some documents related to her work before the election. He called it a “show of good faith,” though a copy of a letter from Ms. Hicks’s lawyer obtained by The New York Times says she handed over only four documents containing email chains.

In addition to documents, the subpoenas call for Ms. Hicks and Ms. Donaldson to testify publicly this month — and there was no indication on Tuesday whether they would comply. Mr. Nadler made clear his position that both were still expected to show up before the panel. Ms. Hicks has been subpoenaed to appear on June 19 and Ms. Donaldson on June 24.

[Read the Judiciary Committee subpoenas for Ms. Hicks and Ms. Donaldson.]

But there appears to be little chance either former aide will testify, bolstering the case made by a growing number of House Democrats that the president is actively obstructing another branch of government from doing its constitutionally sanctioned oversight function, and that impeachment proceedings are the only proportional response.

The White House issued similar instructions not to cooperate last month to Mr. McGahn, who had served as one of the most important witnesses in Mr. Mueller’s investigation into obstruction of justice. He ultimately did not produce a single document or appear for a hearing. If it does not alter course for the Justice Department, the House is poised to hold Mr. McGahn in contempt of Congress next week, as well, and take the dispute to court to try to enforce its subpoena — steps that could soon follow for Ms. Hicks and Ms. Donaldson if they do not show up to the Judiciary Committee’s hearings.

With potential star witnesses off limits and Mr. Mueller reluctant to testify, Democrats have for now been left to try to figure out other ways to bring Mr. Mueller’s 448-page report to life. On Monday, Mr. Nadler announced that his committee would hold a series of hearings on the report with former federal prosecutors, legal experts and John W. Dean, who went to jail for his role in the Watergate affair.

Republicans, who remain closely aligned with the president, have repeatedly accused Democrats of being less interested in the truth than in manufacturing a conflict with the White House that could provide a pretext for impeachment. They painted the possibility of new talks between the two sides on Tuesday as further evidence Democrats had been acting irresponsibly."
State Department suspends funding of anti-Iran Group which targeted journalists and activists,https://www.cnn.com,['Alex Marquardt'],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/politics/us-suspends-funding-anti-iran-group/index.html,"(CNN) The US State Department has suspended funding for an organization whose hardline stance against the Iranian regime saw it targeting American journalists, activists and academics whom they didn't consider tough enough on Tehran, according to a State Department spokesperson.

The Iran Disinformation Project claims it ""exposes and counters the nefarious influence of one of the world's few remaining totalitarian regimes."" It has been funded through the State Department's Global Engagement Center which combats foreign propaganda and disinformation.

But the organization was so aggressive that social media accounts linked to it went after people it perceived to be too soft on Iran, at a time when the Trump administration is exerting what it calls ""maximum pressure,"" ratcheting up military and economic pressure on Iran after pulling out of the landmark nuclear deal known as the JCPOA.

The Guardian was first to report that the State Department had suspended funding.

Jason Rezaian, a Washington Post columnist and CNN contributor, told CNN Wednesday that an account associated with the organization was ""attacking me, other journalists, human rights advocates and others who have taken a more nuanced approach to US Iran relations and are opposed to war and crippling sanctions on that country.""

Rezaian, who is Iranian-American, spent 18 months in prison in Tehran and is a firm and frequent critic of the regime of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. In a column Wednesday, he highlighted the organization's ""slander and libel"" against American citizens.

""For these thought crimes, we are branded by @IranDisinfo and similar social media accounts as Tehran's 'mouthpieces,' 'apologists,' 'collaborators,' and 'lobbyists' in the West,"" he wrote.

Another target was Human Rights Watch's Tara Sepehri Far who researches human rights abuses in Iran. She recently wrote that American sanctions are ""collectively punishing"" ordinary Iranians and limiting their access to medicine.

In an April 25 tweet, the IranDisinfo account called Far a ""supporter of so-called Moderates within the regime"" and accused her of ""working hard to prove [Foreign Minister Javad Zarif's] claims.""

On Friday, Far tweeted: ""Many of us accepted that toxic slandering is part of the cost of being an analyst or doing human rights work in a very polarized climate of the US government's maximum pressure campaign, but now we realize that part of the slandering is actually being funded by US taxpayers.""

The State Department says it suspended the organization's funding on May 31, until it ""takes necessary steps to ensure that any future activity remains within the agreed scope of work.""

""The bulk of the work by @IranDisinfo has been in line with the scope of a project with the Department of State. We have, however, identified recent tweets that fall outside the scope of the project to counter foreign state propaganda or disinformation,"" a State Department spokesperson said.

The Global Engagement Center was set up in April 2016 under President Barack Obama and refocused after the presidential election primarily to combat Russian disinformation campaigns in the wake of their meddling in the campaign. Brett Bruen, who served as director of global engagement under Obama, said it was funded with $80 million.

""The problem was the Trump administration didn't really want to spend it because that meant recognizing that what Russia was doing on information warfare was a real threat,"" Bruen told CNN on Wednesday in an appearance alongside Rezaian.

""Instead what they have chosen to do is to spend that money and threaten American activists, threaten American journalists like Jason who don't agree with the Trump administration's stand on Iran. That's rather alarming and its quite dangerous,"" he added.

CORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect that the Global Engagement Center was refocused to combat Russian disinformation after the 2016 election and that Brett Bruen was Director of Global Engagement under President Obama."
Department of Energy Redefines Nuclear Waste to Make It Easier to Dispose of,https://www.thestranger.com,"['More Articles', 'Katie Herzog']",06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.thestranger.com/slog/2019/06/06/40409900/department-of-energy-redefines-nuclear-waste-to-make-it-easier-to-dispose-of,"Department of Energy Redefines Nuclear Waste to Make It Easier to Dispose of

JEFF T. GREEN/GETTY IMAGES

If you've got a problem with radioactive waste, you could clean it up, a costly and onerous process, or you could just change the definition of it. Guess which one the Trump administration has decided to do?

This week, the Department of Energy announced that it is revising the classification of radioactive waste at Hanford, the decommissioned nuclear bomb-making site in Benton County, Washington. This isn't because Hanford has actually been cleaned up or anything like that. Nope! It's still considered by many to be The Most Toxic Place in America, which is pretty damn impressive considering the toxic dump in the White House.

In a statement Wednesday, the DOE said that by reclassifying waste at Hanford, as well as two sites in South Carolina and Idaho, they will have more flexibility in how some of that waste is disposed of. There are currently 56 million gallons of radioactive waste and other hazardous chemicals stored in underground tanks at Hanford, and all that waste has been considered ""high level,"" meaning that it requires strict standards for disposal. That, however, will change under the DOE's new rule.

Environmentalists and Washington state leaders, however, are not pleased. In a joint statement, Gov. Jay Inslee and Attorney General Bob Ferguson said, ""The Trump Administration is showing disdain and disregard for state authority with these actions. Washington will not be sidelined in our efforts to clean up Hanford and protect the Columbia River and the health and safety of our state and our people.

“By taking this action, the administration seeks to cut out state input and move towards disposal options of their choosing, including those already deemed to be unsafe by their own assessments and in violation of the existing legally binding agreement. We will consider all options to stop this reckless and dangerous action.”

Hanford has been a radioactive thorn in America's side for decades. In a brilliant Vanity Fair article from 2018, journalist Michael Lewis (who also has a fantastic new podcast on the impacts of deregulation that you should all listen to immediately), wrote of the decades-long Hanford cleanup:



The Department of Energy wires 10 percent of its annual budget, or $3 billion a year, into this tiny place and intends to do so until the radioactive mess is cleaned up. And even though what is now called the Tri-Cities area is well populated and amazingly prosperous—yachts on the river, $300 bottles of wine in the bistros—the absolute worst thing that could happen to it is probably not a nuclear accident. The worst thing that could happen is that the federal government loses interest in it and slashes the D.O.E.’s budget—as President Trump has proposed to do. And yet Trump won the county in which Hanford resides by 25 points.

This change, Richland Mayor Bob Thompson, told the Tri-City Herald, could save the DOE $40 billion. The question is, at what cost?"
DHS broke rules on deporting veterans: GAO report,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Stephen Dinan']",06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jun/6/dhs-broke-rules-deporting-veterans/,"Homeland Security failed to cut U.S. military veterans breaks in deportation cases, the government’s chief auditor said in a new report Thursday that confirms complaints some members of Congress had lodged over too-harsh treatment.

The Government Accountability Office said Homeland Security doesn’t even have the ability to track when veterans are ousted, so it’s not clear how many times it’s happened, nor how many of those were done in violation of policy.

Under a 2004 memo, before a military veteran is a target for deportation, managers at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement are supposed to review the history of the person and decide whether his or her record is exemplary enough to warrant an exception.

In an Obama-era memo, ICE was also ordered to see if veterans facing deportation might qualify for citizenship, which would usually cancel their deportation.

But ICE “does not consistently follow these policies,” the GAO concluded.

Indeed, agency officials told the GAO they weren’t even aware of the 2004 or 2015 policies until investigators raised the matter with them last year.

ICE investigators said they operated without regard to a target’s veteran status.

“Because ICE did not consistently follow these policies, some veterans who were removed may not have received the level of review and approval that ICE has determined is appropriate for cases involving veterans,” the GAO concluded.

Homeland Security said that in every one of the 100 cases GAP reviewed, the veterans being deported had felony convictions for drugs, sexual abuse, firearms violations, kidnapping or terrorist threats.

Still, the department accepted each of GAO’s three recommendations to improve its understanding and adherence to policy, and to collect data on veterans who face deportation.

Police Department', 'June At Pm']",06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2019/06/06/part-pennsylvania-avenue-closed/,"Two vehicles were struck by gunfire early Thursday along Pennsylvania Avenue near the headquarters for the Justice Department and the FBI, D.C. police said.

One man was wounded and drove himself to a hospital, said police, who described his injuries as minor. No one was injured in the second vehicle, a Honda Accord, though police said it was disabled by a bullet that struck the undercarriage and damaged a fuse box.

The shooting occurred about 2 a.m. at Ninth Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW, in the Penn Quarter neighborhood.

A police report said the driver of one car was heading east on Pennsylvania Avenue when she “heard the sounds of gunshots” and “noticed unknown objects hitting her vehicle.” She turned right onto Ninth Street NW, where her car stopped.

The driver “felt glass popping near her feet and legs,” the report says.

No arrests have been made, and police said they have not determined whether either vehicle was targeted."
Agriculture Department plans for feeding the nation miss the mark,https://thehill.com,[],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/447290-agriculture-department-plans-for-feeding-the-nation-miss-the-mark,"The controversial plans of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue George (Sonny) Ervin PerdueAgriculture Department plans for feeding the nation miss the mark Agriculture Department plans for feeding the nation miss the mark Trump to allow use of ethanol gas in move to benefit farmers MORE to move two agency research units out of Washington reminds me of an important lesson from my Army training in marksmanship. Before we ever touched a rifle, we received instruction on topics like rifle mechanisms, cleaning, and safety. Then we learned how to aim, including how to control our breathing and adjust for distance and wind. Once our instruction was mastered, we were cleared for the rifle range. After making the sight adjustments and aiming, then and only then did we fire our rifles.

We all know about “ready, aim, fire” but the moral of my story is also the importance of the initial preparation. The approach Secretary Perdue has taken to ensuring our country is fed and nourished well into the future is to skip the preparation and reverse the order. He “fired” last summer when he made his surprise announcement. His “aim” does not include fixing a problem or making improvements, and the rationale has been vague, unfounded, or disingenuous. The subsequent “ready” phase involved the Agriculture Department scrambling to figure out how to make a site decision, develop site criteria, and consult Congress and stakeholders. The “ready” phase has yet to produce a public cost benefit analysis.

The preparation phase was omitted altogether, unless one counts the Agriculture Department preemptively removing someone standing in the way, who is the only affected official not in an acting capacity. With any new administration, preparation should have included a thorough process to understand the Agriculture Department research arm, its strengths and weaknesses, and its stakeholders, not to mention the major agricultural challenges being addressed. This would have included discussions with current and former leaders, the external agricultural community, and the previous administration, none of which happened. Why should anyone care what the Agriculture Department does with its research units?

For the same reason the federal government has strong research programs in health, defense, and energy, we need strong research programs for our $1 trillion food and agriculture industry. Whether we are talking peaches in Georgia, rice in Louisiana, potatoes in Idaho, wheat in the Dakotas, blueberries in Maine, or swine in the Carolinas, our many commodities are constantly under threat from pests and diseases, highly competitive markets, and extreme weather. It is essential that we maintain the vitality and competitiveness of our commodities, which in turn will keep our farms and rural economies vibrant and flourishing.

Agriculture Department research programs support our health, nutrition, and rural development. They keep us apprised of farming income and estimate commodity projections to inform the long term planning of farmers. They also assess the effectiveness of our nutrition assistance programs, which account for the majority of the agency budget, to help us keep those federal programs running efficiently and effectively.

The research programs inform us about food deserts and new trends in agriculture. These are all initiatives that are much too important to let slip away or become less relevant as they would under current plans by the Agriculture Department. It is true we will still be able to buy groceries at our local stores, however, we need to be concerned about the long term challenges of feeding and nourishing 40 percent to 50 percent more people in the world in the next 30 years on the same amount of land.

Through decades of public service in both government and universities, including as former dean of agriculture at the University of Georgia and former chief scientist and undersecretary of research at the Agriculture Department under President George Bush, I have devoted my career to helping ensure the nation will be fed, nourished, and prosperous. I also worked hard to ensure agricultural research was well administered.

I see little in current plans by the Agriculture Department to help our nation in any of these areas. In fact, I see the opposite. My resistance and that of the rest of the vocal opposition is not fear of change. Change is a given for Agriculture Department research as it adapts to new challenges, modernizes techniques, and makes administrative improvements. Past changes, however, have always been made after careful study and input from a broad sector of voices within the agricultural community.

The backwards “fire, aim, ready” without preparation approach under Secretary Perdue is not good government. To ensure the success of our farmers, our food supply and safety, and rural areas, the Agriculture Department should heed a common sense approach by withdrawing its plans and fully preparing. What do we want? Why? How? At the very least, we should make sure the rifle sights are clean and focused, know what we are aiming for, and know that firing will make the system stronger.

"Mallinckrodt paid 'kickbacks' to keep drug price high, and stuck taxpayers with bill, DOJ lawsuit says",https://www.cnn.com,['Wayne Drash'],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/health/mallinckrodt-lawsuit-doj/index.html,"(CNN) The pharmaceutical company responsible for one of the largest drug price increases in US history ""knowingly paid illegal kickbacks"" as part of an elaborate scheme to make millions and stick the American taxpayer with the bill, the US Department of Justice said Wednesday in a lawsuit filed against Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals.

In its complaint, the government demanded a jury trial that would put front and center the actions of the company at the heart of a 97,000% drug price hike. The price of Mallinckrodt's anti-inflammatory drug Acthar -- best known for treating babies with a debilitating seizure disorder -- has gone from $40 a vial in 2000 to nearly $39,000 today.

The complaint was filed in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by US Attorney William McSwain. Mallinckrodt could face fines of nearly $240 million if found liable.

The government alleged Mallinckrodt used a foundation, called the Chronic Disease Fund, as a conduit to pay kickbacks as part of the scheme to maintain the high price of Acthar.

""The scheme allowed the Company to continually raise Acthar's price yet market it as 'free' to patients and doctors, shifting the drug's ever-increasing cost to Medicare,"" the government said in its complaint. ""As a result of its conduct, Mallinckrodt caused the submission of millions of dollars in false Medicare claims for Acthar.""

EPA chief accuses New York Times reporters of colluding with Sierra Club,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/epa-chief-accuses-new-york-times-reporters-of-colluding-with-sierra-club,"Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler escalated a dust-up with the media Monday by accusing New York Times reporters of colluding with a major environmental group by retweeting a ""made-up"" quote of his.

“Makes me wonder if the two reporters for the New York Times were colluding with the Sierra Club,"" Wheeler said Wednesday, addressing the agency's Scientific Advisory Board.

He told the board's members to use ""caution"" and ""to be careful what you read in the media"" after the incident.

The controversy started when EPA slammed a reporter from Yahoo News on Tuesday, saying he made up a quote from a National Press Club address he gave on Monday. The story reported that Wheeler said the news media does a disservice by reporting on global warming.

EPA clarified that what Wheeler said Monday was: ""The media does a disservice to the American public and sound policy-making by not informing the public of the progress this nation has made.""

Wheeler called the Yahoo News story, which he said was then retweeted by two New York Times reporters, ""made up."" The EPA did not identify the specific reporters, but the climate reporters Kendra Pierre-Louis and Lisa Friedman retweeted the tweet in question.

Later, the Sierra Club used the story in a tweet of its own.

Wheeler told the science advisers to come to him directly if they have any questions about what they read in the media."
Does VA have a secret wait list for health care? Key members of Congress want to know.,https://www.houstonchronicle.com,"['Joe Davidson', 'The Washington Post', 'John Mcclain', 'Sergio Chapa', 'Staff Writer', 'Jenny Dial Creech', 'Melanie Hauser', 'Katherine Feser']",06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/article/Does-VA-have-a-secret-wait-list-for-health-care-13938065.php,"WASHINGTON - Key members of Congress want the Trump administration to address charges of a ""secret"" Veterans Affairs wait list that has a higher number of patients seeking medical care than information publicly available.

Allegations about significantly different data regarding veterans awaiting treatment on internal and public records were made by Jereme P. Whiteman, VA's national director of clinic practice management, in a Washington Post Federal Insider column published online Monday.

The article reported on a letter he sent to VA Secretary Robert Wilkie last week that said, ""In September last year I discovered a secret VA wait list. I disclosed this wait list within my VHA chain of command. Since that date I have been retaliated against by officials within my chain of command. Furthermore, the agency has taken steps to conceal this wait list from the public.""

The monthly number of veterans awaiting care on the internal list is about three times greater than the numbers on the public list.

A VA spokesman said Whiteman's allegations are false. ""VA's electronic wait list (EWL) has two components - one administrative and one clinical,"" said Curt Cashour, the department's press secretary.

The clinical number is public and shows the number of veterans waiting for medical care. ""The administrative component of the EWL has nothing to do with waits for medical treatment,"" he added, ""and tracks routine actions, such as facility and provider transfer requests.""

Top Democrats on the House and Senate veterans' affairs committees are not satisfied with that response.

In a letter sent Tuesday to Wilkie, Rep. Mark Takano, D-Calif., chairman of the House committee, and Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, the ranking Democrat on the Senate panel, said Cashour's explanation ""is, at best, confusing.""

""We, therefore, ask VA to provide - by the end of this week - a more thorough explanation for the existence of two sets of reports on wait time for veterans' health care. In fulfilling this request, VA should provide the House and Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs with the reports described by the article and the appropriate VA officials should make themselves available for a briefing to the Committees.""

A statement from the office of Rep. Phil Roe of Tennessee, the top Republican on the House panel, said, ""Dr. Roe has asked VA about these allegations and will continue looking into them.""

Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-Va., chairman of the House Oversight and Reform subcommittee on government operations, said the ""allegations of a secret internal wait list for veterans - that exceeds the public wait list by three-fold - are deeply disturbing. . . . Congress must get to the bottom of these claims by verifying the accuracy of these internal VA documents and ensuring transparency and accountability for our nation's veterans and the American people.""

Connolly praised whistleblowers and said they ""must be protected"" against reprisals by managers. In addition to reporting his charges about the dual wait lists with VA's Office of the Medical Inspector and the department's Office of Inspector General, Whiteman has filed retaliation complaints with the VA whistleblower protection office and the Office of Special Counsel, which protects whistleblowers across the government.

Inspector General Michael Missal said his office received Whiteman's information and is considering the next steps for his office.

In one example of retaliation, Whiteman said he led a team that implemented a text messaging system to remind patients of their appointments. It cut the number of missed sessions and saved the department millions of dollars. Although he was the team leader, he was the only member who did not get a performance award for the project.

Whiteman's allegations come five years after a national uproar over phony wait lists rocked the VA. That scandal pushed then-VA Secretary Eric Shinseki from office and led to a series of agency reforms. Robert McDonald, who followed Shinseki in office, apologized to veterans in September 2014 congressional testimony and promised to rebuild trust.

He said the VA increased primary care staffing, developed an automated system for tracking new patients and contacted 266,000 veterans ""to get them off wait lists and into clinics.""

On Tuesday, Cashour said the VA now is ""seeing more patients than ever before, more quickly than before."" According to Cashour:

- VA completed more than 58 million internal appointments in fiscal 2018, 623,000 more than the previous year.

- All VA health care facilities now provide same-day services in primary and mental health.

- VA is posting online wait times for every one of its medical centers across the country, and they are updated weekly.

- Regularly updated access data are available online for all VA medical centers and community-based outpatient clinics.

""Veterans are more satisfied with wait times,"" Cashour said, ""than they have been previously."""
Judge won't force DOJ to comply with order to release records relating to Michael Flynn,https://www.salon.com,[],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.salon.com/2019/06/06/judge-wont-force-doj-to-comply-with-order-to-release-records-relating-to-michael-flynn_partner/,"Federal Judge Emmet Sullivan announced in a filing on Tuesday that he will not force the Justice Department to comply with his previous order to release records relating to Michael Flynn, President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser who was charged as a part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.

Last week, the Justice Department boldly defied Sullivan’s orders in a filing, saying that it was refusing to release the audio recordings of Flynn’s discussions with Russian officials, which would include his conversations with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Flynn pleaded guilty in late 2017 for lying to the FBI about the content of these conversations during the Trump administration’s transition period.

The department did release a separate recording and transcript of a voicemail Flynn received from one of Trump’s lawyers, which was relevant to the obstruction of justice investigation. But it said the other materials were not relevant to Flynn’s sentencing, which is the matter before Sullivan.

Many observers saw the refusal as a brash defiance of a judge’s explicit order, and some suggested that it may be a part of Attorney General Bill Barr’s attempts to cover up damaging information for the president.

But Sullivan’s response on Tuesday makes those interpretations less likely.

“The government is not required to file any additional materials or information on the public docket pursuant to the Court’s Orders of May 16, 2019,” the judge’s filing said.

“It was surprising for the court to have asked for these transcripts to be publicly filed in the first place, but it’s even more surprising to see the court back down in the face of outright DOJ refusal,” said Lawfare Executive Editor Susan Hennessey in a tweet. “I’d imagine there was lots of back and forth behind the scenes here.”

She added that it’s possible Sullivan agreed to let the government file the materials under seal.

Former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti said: “I’m surprised by this move, because the information would appear to be relevant to the factors that he is required to consider at sentencing. He appears to be deferring to DOJ’s view of what is relevant.”"

Chris Grundler, who currently serves as director of the Office of Transportation and Air Quality, will become director of the Office of Atmospheric Programs that oversees the agency’s climate change programs and other functions, switching roles with Sarah Dunham, who has held that role since 2011.

Grundler, who has been head of the transportation office with about 400 employees since October 2012, oversaw the roll-out of some of the agency’s most important regulations, including greenhouse gas standards for light-duty vehicles, the second phase of commercial heavy-duty truck emissions rules and biofuel requirements.

He has also overseen efforts to address excess diesel emissions in vehicles, including the EPA’s review of Volkswagen AG and Fiat Chrysler polluting vehicles.

Grundler’s office is also investigating Ford Motor Co’s disclosure in February that employees had raised concerns with its fuel economy and emissions testing.

Bill Wehrum, EPA Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, said in a statement the move “brings fresh and different perspectives to these critical EPA offices, while providing new leadership opportunities for two outstanding senior executives.”

Wehrum said in a memo that Dunham “has been at the center of some of EPA’s most important work on climate change and overseen the continuing success” of its market trading programs and implementation of the Montreal Protocol.

Grundler declined to comment and Dunham could not immediately be reached.

The EPA and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration proposed rolling back the Obama-era vehicle fuel efficiency rules and greenhouse gas emissions limits in August and backed a freeze on fuel efficiency standards at 2020 levels through 2026.

Those rules are still being finalized by the agencies and have not yet been submitted to the White House Office of Management and Budget for review."

OAK HARBOR, Ohio - Furthering the Trump Administration's efforts to increase access to public lands, U.S. Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt today announced from Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge a proposal for new or expanded hunting and fishing opportunities at 74 national wildlife refuges and 15 national fish hatcheries managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) across more than 1.4 million acres.

""President Trump is committed to expanding public access on public lands, and this proposal is executing on that directive by opening and increasing more access to hunting and fishing by the Fish and Wildlife Service at more stations and across more acres than ever before,"" said Secretary Bernhardt. ""Hunting and fishing are more than just traditional pastimes as they are also vital to the conservation of our lands and waters, our outdoor recreation economy, and our American way of life. These refuges and hatcheries provide incredible opportunities for sportsmen and women and their families across the country to pass on a fishing and hunting heritage to future generations and connect with wildlife.""

The proposal would increase the number of units in the Service's National Wildlife Refuge System where the public may hunt from 377 to 382, and the number where fishing would be permitted would be increased from 312 to 316. The proposal would also formally open lands on 15 hatcheries of the National Fish Hatchery System to hunting or sport fishing for the first time.

The following are proposed new or expanded hunting and/or sport fishing opportunities at stations in the state of Oregon:

Bandon Marsh National Wildlife Refuge: Expand existing sport fishing to new areas.

McKay Creek National Wildlife Refuge: Open mourning dove, wild turkey and big game (elk, white-tailed deer and mule deer) hunting for the first time on 620 acres already open to other hunting.

Open mourning dove, wild turkey and big game (elk, white-tailed deer and mule deer) hunting for the first time on 620 acres already open to other hunting. Nestucca Bay National Wildlife Refuge: Open sport fishing for the first time on acres already open to other activities.

The proposal also outlines a comprehensive revision and simplification of all refuge-specific hunting and fishing regulations in all 50 states to more closely match state regulations while continuing to ensure safe and compatible opportunities. The Service worked closely with the states in preparing the proposed rule.

""Well managed hunting and fishing are the backbone of conservation in this country, but inconsistent or overly complex regulations can act as a disincentive,"" said Service Principal Deputy Director Margaret Everson. ""By aligning our refuge regulations with our state partners, we are reducing confusion and the regulatory burden on the American public, helping ensure the tradition and benefits of hunting and fishing can continue.""

Hunting, fishing and other outdoor activities contributed more than $156 billion in economic activity in communities across the United States in 2016, according to the Service's National Survey of Fishing, Hunting and Wildlife-Associated Recreation, published every five years. More than 101 million Americans — 40 percent of the U.S. population age 16 and older — pursue wildlife-related recreation, including hunting and fishing.

""The Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies is delighted by this announcement of a continuing commitment by the Department of the Interior to expanded access for regulated hunting and angling, on National Wildlife Refuges, in partnership with state fish and wildlife agencies,"" stated Ed Carter, President of the Association and Executive Director of the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency. He added, ""We need to get people outside to enjoy the lands and waters, and fish and wildlife resources, of our great nation. This is an important step in that direction!""

""The announcement today by Secretary Bernhardt is incredibly welcome news and builds off great progress in increasing access to refuge lands the last two years,"" said John Devney, Senior Vice President, Delta Waterfowl. ""Duck hunters have been leaders in investing in the refuge system and this action will provide them with new access and opportunities. We are sincerely grateful to Secretary Bernhardt and the Fish and Wildlife Service staff who have worked hard to create these new opportunities for hunters.""

""The Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation applauds Secretary Bernhardt for his efforts to expand hunting and fishing opportunities within the National Wildlife Refuge System,"" said Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation President Jeff Crane. ""This announcement builds off momentum generated over the last few years through Interior Secretarial Orders, and advances recent recommendations submitted by the Hunting and Shooting Sports Conservation Council to increase hunter and angler access to federal lands and waters, including the Refuge System.""

The Service will seek comments from the public on the proposed rule for 45 days, beginning with publication in the Federal Register in coming days. The notice will be available at http://www.regulations.gov, Docket Number: FWS-HQ-NWRS-2019-0040, and will include details on how to submit your comments. The Service intends to finalize the proposed changes in time for the upcoming 2019-2020 hunting seasons. An interim copy of the proposed rule is now available.

A complete list of all refuges and hatcheries included in the proposal is available in the proposed rule and online.

For more than 145 years, the National Fish Hatchery System has worked collaboratively with tribes, states, landowners, partners and stakeholders to promote and maintain healthy, self-sustaining populations of fish and other aquatic species. There are 70 national fish hatcheries visited by more than two million people each year. Hatcheries offer opportunities for viewing the operations and learning about fish, as well as activities such as fishing, hunting, hiking, sightseeing, nature study, birdwatching and photography.

The Refuge System is an unparalleled network of 567 national wildlife refuges and 38 wetland management districts. There is a national wildlife refuge within an hour's drive of most major metropolitan areas. More than 55 million Americans visit refuges every year. National wildlife refuges provide vital habitat for thousands of species and access to world-class recreation, from fishing, hunting and boating to nature watching, photography and environmental education.

Under the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997, the Service permits hunting and fishing along with four other types of wildlife-dependent recreation, including wildlife photography, environmental education, wildlife observation and interpretation, when they are compatible with an individual refuge's purpose and mission.Hunting, within specified limits, is currently permitted on 340 wildlife refuges and 37 wetland management districts. Fishing is currently permitted on 278 wildlife refuges and 34 wetland management districts.

The Service manages hunting and fishing programs to ensure sustainable wildlife populations while also offering other wildlife-dependent recreation on public lands."
"Presidents of the United States ranked, from best to worst: where did Pa.’s presidents end up?",https://www.pennlive.com,"['Sean Adams', 'Sadams Pennlive.Com']",06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.pennlive.com/entertainment/2019/06/presidents-of-the-united-states-ranked-from-best-to-worst-where-did-pas-presidents-end-up.html,"Historians have long debated which of the American presidents were most capable and most successful, and which of them failed to achieve success as chief executive of the United States.

Oddly enough, the two presidents to whom Pennsylvania can lay claim represent both ends of that success spectrum.

C-SPAN has released a book, titled “The Presidents: Noted Historians Rank America’s Best - and Worst - Chief Executives.” Among the contributors are Michael Gerhardt and Jeffrey Rosen, both of the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. In the book, they include a ranking of 43 presidents (Grover Cleveland served as both our 22nd and 24th president in two non-consecutive terms) originally compiled in 2017.

The most recent inclusion is Barack Obama, with current president Donald Trump being excluded from the rankings due to the lack of historical perspective with with to place him on the list.

So, how do the rankings play out?

Sadly, Lancaster native James Buchanan, Pennsylvania’s only native-born president, sits at the bottom of the list. His legacy of caution and inaction in the lead-up to the Civil War generally lands him in the bottom tier of presidents.

Buchanan’s poor ratings among historians is a subject we’ve tackled before. He missed out on making our list of 100 Greatest Pennsylvanians, though he did manage to make our un-ranked follow-up list of additional great Pennsylvanians who didn’t make the first cut.

Our visit to Buchanan’s home of Wheatland revealed that he did excel in politics in many regards, with his tenure as chief executive being the rare (though highly impactful) blemish on his career in public service.

James Buchanan: worst president ever? Or deserving of a spot with our 100 Greatest Pennsylvanians? When we compiled our list of the 100 Greatest Pennsylvanians, many readers suggested that we didn't give the proper due to the 15th President of the United States.

Plus, did you see the outhouse he invented in that video? Surely such a visionary can’t be all bad.

On the other end of the scale sits another kind leader entirely: Dwight D. Eisenhower, who cracked the top 5 in the C-SPAN rankings.

While Eisenhower was born in Texas and was raised in Kansas, he was stationed at Camp Colt in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania early in his military career, and the first home he and his wife Mamie ever owned was the farm he purchased in Gettysburg. The Gettysburg home served as their home during Eisenhower’s tenure as president, and the couple returned there for Eisenhower’s retirement.

The 100 Greatest Pennsylvanians of all time, ranked: Benjamin Franklin, Taylor Swift and more The list ranks Pennsylvanians by their impact not only to our state, but to the nation and the world. Where do William Penn, Betsy Ross, Fred Rogers, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Joan Jett, Wilt Chamberlain, Andrew Carnegie and Gertrude Stein fall?

If you ask us, that’s plenty to consider him a Pennsylvanian. And that’s why he, unsurprisingly, earned a similarly high spot in our ranking of 100 Greatest Pennsylvanians.

As president, Eisenhower ordered the creation of NASA, enforced the desegregation of Little Rock High School, signed the Civil Rights Act and oversaw the establishment of the National Highway System. Only Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt, George Washington and Abraham Lincoln ranked higher than Ike.

Of course, before he went into politics, Eisenhower was also the Supreme Allied Commander during World War II and oversaw the D-Day invasion of Normandy, among many other operations. He later became the Supreme Allied Commander of NATO. Much like Washington, Eisenhower’s transition from military man to moderate executive is pretty much agreed by everyone to be big success in terms leadership.

Countdown to D-Day: how President Eisenhower’s Gettysburg home will mark the invasion’s anniversary Several events are planned at the Eisenhower National Historic Site in Gettysburg,

Our recent visit to the Eisenhower National Historic Site reaffirmed his Pennsylvania credentials in our eyes. So while we might have to share him with a few other states, we’re definitely still confirming him as one of ours.

Something we’re not quite as proud of to this day is our treatment of another president who spent some time in Gettysburg: Abraham Lincoln, who perhaps unsurprisingly nabbed the top spot on C-SPAN’s list.

Lincoln’s unflinching commitment to retaining the union during the Civil War, his signing of the Emancipation Proclamation and his conciliatory plans following a Northern victory all count toward his high score.

That said, when he gave the Gettysburg Address, the Patriot-Union newspaper - predecessor to the Patriot-News and PennLive - gave a rather harsh review to his famous speech back in 1863. In retrospect, maybe Lincoln’s words weren’t “silly remarks” after all.

PennLive and the Patriot-News issued a retraction a few years ago, in case you missed it:

Retraction for our 1863 editorial calling Gettysburg Address 'silly remarks': Editorial Seven score and ten years ago, the forefathers of this media institution brought forth to its audience a judgment so flawed, so tainted by hubris, so lacking in the perspective history would bring, that it cannot remain unaddressed in our archives.
