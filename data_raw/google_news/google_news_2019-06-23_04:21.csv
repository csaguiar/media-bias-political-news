Biden vows to repeal Trump tax cuts on 'Day One' if he captures White House,https://www.foxnews.com,['Vandana Rambaran'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-vows-to-repeal-trump-tax-cuts-on-day-one-if-he-captures-white-house,"Former Vice President and current presidential candidate Joe Biden promised Saturday that on ""Day One"" of a Biden presidency he would repeal President Trump's 2017 tax cuts and close $500 billion on tax loopholes.

Speaking at the South Carolina Democratic Party Convention, Biden said that ""Income inequities are at an all-time high and made worse by Trump's tax cuts and enormous giveaways to the top one-tenth of the 1 percent ... and it's time we start to reward work over wealth.""

Outlining his policy proposals in this visit to the early primary state, Biden said the GOP-backed tax cuts, which have been heavily criticized in some quarters as beneficial only to the rich, have no socially redeeming value. He vowed to ""put that money to good use.""

Biden promised that, among other things, residual funds from the tax break would be put toward initiatives such as green energy research and development, two-year college tuition grants and a public-option health insurance plan.

The 2020 hopeful also proposed an $8,000-per-child credit for child care. In addition, he promised to increase Title I funding for schools with high numbers of low-income students, and to allocate between $15 billion and $45 billion to expand universal pre-K, raise teachers' pay, fully fund special education and double the number of school psychologists, guidance counselors and nurses to support public school systems.

Biden also reiterated his plan to implement a public health care option like Medicare, which would guarantee that low-income individuals have health coverage.

Biden continues to lead the polls in a field of some two-dozen Democratic contenders."
Two Fox News hosts question Trump's comments about Iran: 'This just doesn't add up',https://www.cnn.com,"['Jackie Wattles', 'Cnn Business']",06-22-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/22/media/fox-iran-chris-wallace-shep-smith/index.html,"New York (CNN) Fox News hosts Chris Wallace and Shep Smith challenged President Donald Trump's comments about when and why he decided to call off a strike against Iran.

Trump said Friday that the military was ""cocked and loaded"" to fire on Iran in retaliation for shooting down a US drone earlier this week . But he reversed course ""10 minutes before the strike"" when he learned 150 people could die in the attack, the president said in a series of tweets.

Smith said Fox News' reporting found that Trump would have been given a casualty estimate at a briefing hours before that.

""Something's wrong there,"" Smith said about the president's comments.

Wallace also had questions.

Trump delays planned ICE raids to see if Congress can solve border crisis,https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/delay-ice-deportations,"President Trump announced Saturday that a planned mass roundup of illegal immigrants by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is being delayed for two weeks, in the hope that a bipartisan solution to the border crisis can be reached.

“At the request of Democrats, I have delayed the Illegal Immigration Removal Process (Deportation) for two weeks to see if the Democrats and Republicans can get together and work out a solution to the Asylum and Loophole problems at the Southern Border,” he tweeted.

TRUMP DOUBLES DOWN ON EXPECTED ICE RAID AMID PUSHBACK FROM LOCAL DEM POLITICIANS

“If not, Deportations start!” he added.

The tweet came after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, called Trump Friday and urged him to call off the raids, a source familiar with the situation told Fox News.

The Washington Post reported Friday that ICE was expected to target 2,000 families in up to 10 cities across the U.S., after Trump had announced earlier this week that ICE will “begin the process of removing millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States.”

DEMS TRYING TO ADD 'RADICAL' RIDERS SHIELDING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN BORDER BILL: GOP SOURCES

ICE said in a statement Friday that “due to law-enforcement sensitivities and the safety and security of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel, the agency will not offer specific details related to enforcement operations.”

However, it said that ICE prioritizes arresting and removing those illegal immigrants “who pose a threat to national security, public safety and border security.”

Despite fierce opposition from local Democratic politicians in targeted cities, Trump had stood by the plan earlier Saturday, saying that ""everybody who came into the country illegally will be brought out of the country very legally.""

He also dismissed the Democratic opposition on Saturday, saying they were mostly ""high crime"" cities.

""Well some cities are going to fight it. But if you notice they're generally high crime cities, if you look at Chicago they're fighting it. If you look at other cities they're fighting it. Many of those cities are high crime cities and they're sanctuary cities,"" he said.

It was not immediately clear what form the negotiations would take, but the postponement comes amid an escalating crisis at the border, with more than 140,000 migrants encountered or apprehended at the border in May.

Earlier this month, Trump announced that he had secured a deal with Mexico that would see the U.S. expand its policy of returning asylum applicants to Mexico while claims are processed, instead of applicants being released into the U.S.

The Senate Appropriations Committee this week approved Trump's $4.6 billion request for funding to tackle the humanitarian crisis, but only after the inclusion of a provision that blocks money from being diverted to funding for a wall on the border, and after Republicans dropped a request for more detention beds.

'It Hurt. And It Was Against My Will': Trump Accuser Stands By Her Story,https://www.npr.org,"['Lulu Garcia-Navarro', 'Daniella Cheslow']",06-22-2019,2019,6,https://www.npr.org/2019/06/22/735080909/it-hurt-and-it-was-against-my-will-trump-accuser-stands-by-her-story,"'It Hurt. And It Was Against My Will': Trump Accuser Stands By Her Story

Enlarge this image toggle caption Stephen Chernin/AP Stephen Chernin/AP

The advice columnist who says President Trump sexually assaulted her in a department store dressing room in the mid-1990s says she is ""very glad"" she published her accusation, even as the president denied her story on Saturday and claimed he had ""no idea who she is.""

E. Jean Carroll spoke to NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro on Weekend Edition. She reiterated that Trump assaulted her in the '90s.

""It hurt. And it was against my will,"" she said.

Trump on Saturday doubled down on his denial and claimed that women have been paid to accuse him of wrongdoing.

""Women were actually paid money to say bad things about me,"" Trump told reporters outside the White House. ""But here's a case, it's an absolute disgrace that she's allowed to do that.""

Carroll first detailed the incident in a book excerpt published on Friday in New York magazine.

Carroll said the incident happened when the two met by chance at the upscale department store Bergdorf Goodman in New York City. She says he told her, ""Hey, you're that advice lady,"" and she replied, ""Hey, you're that real estate mogul,"" and then he asked for her help in choosing a present for ""a girl.""

At first, Carroll told NPR, ""I thought it was just charming, you know, he wants my advice on buying a present.""

Carroll said the encounter took a turn when she asked how old the girl was, and Trump asked Carroll how old she was.

""And of course I told him my actual age, which is 52. And he said 'Oh, you're so old,' "" she recalled to NPR.

Then, Carroll claims, Trump asked her to try on a see-through bodysuit in the lingerie department. She said she joked that he should try it on instead.

""And that's where I got into trouble, because we went into the dressing room and he closed the door and that was it,"" she said.

She said ""it was a very short incident"" and that ""to me it's just disrespectful to say, to use the word rape, although it hurt and it was against my will.""

Carroll said that she called a friend after the incident but did not tell the police.

""I had adrenaline pouring through my body,"" she said. ""The idea that anyone, including me, could make a decision at that point about going to the police ... that was almost a second assault on my brain.""

When Carroll published the excerpt from her book in New York magazine, the president responded, writing: ""I've never met this person in my life. She is trying to sell a new book — that should indicate her motivation. It should be sold in the fiction section.""

New York undercut the president's claim about never meeting Carroll with a photograph depicting him talking to her at a party in New York.

Reporters asked Trump about the picture Saturday. He replied, ""standing with my coat on in a line, give me a break.""

Trump compared himself to Brett Kavanaugh, who withstood assault allegations during his confirmation hearings to become a Supreme Court justice.

""When you look at what happened to Justice Kavanaugh, and you look at what's happening to others, you can't do that for the sake of publicity,"" Trump said Saturday.

More than a dozen women accused Trump of sexual wrongdoing before he took office. Carroll said she did not come forward with her story before the 2016 elections because ""there were so many women coming forward. ... I didn't think it was my duty.""

Carroll's book, due out in July, details attacks by people on what she calls the ""Most Hideous Men of My Life List."" The list includes the former CEO of CBS, Les Moonves. He was ousted last year amid similar allegations. Moonves denied Carroll's claims to New York.

Carroll told NPR she decided to publish these accusations in a book because she is a writer.

""My natural mode is to take pen to paper and write about whatever it is I want to write about, and my natural mode is to put it in a book,"" she said.

She said she changed her mind about coming forward because over the past two years, many readers sent in letters about their own experience with sexual assault.

""I just felt like I was not being a real, you know, I was holding something back,"" she said. ""And I just decided because I love my readers, I thought well, OK, I'm going to tell them, this is what happened to me."""

At the time, the river was one of the most polluted in the US. Journalists filled glasses with pitch-black river water, while politicians dipped cloth into the waves that came up oil-soaked.

The river fire lasted roughly 20 minutes, but it sparked public outrage that in part led to the creation of the US Environmental Protection Agency, the federal office tasked with making sure ""Americans have clean air, land, and water.""

"Trump's Pentagon pick is Army veteran, defense lobbyist",https://www.aol.com,"['Aol Staff', 'Eric Tucker']",06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.aol.com/article/news/2019/06/21/trumps-pentagon-pick-is-army-veteran-defense-lobbyist/23754346/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's pick for new defense secretary is an Army veteran who served in the first Iraq war and also has experience as a national security adviser on Capitol Hill as well as a defense industry lobbyist.

Trump announced Friday that he would nominate Mark Esper to lead the Pentagon. Trump had already named Esper, his current Army secretary, to lead the Defense Department on an acting basis, starting Sunday.

""I know Mark, and have no doubt he will do a fantastic job!"" the president tweeted Tuesday.

He later told reporters: ""He's very experienced. He's been around all of the things that we've been talking about for a very long period of time.""

Tuesday's move came after acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan withdrew from the job before his formal nomination had gone to the Senate, citing a ""painful"" family situation that would hurt his children and reopen ""wounds we have worked years to heal.""

Esper was sworn in as Army secretary in November 2017 following a seven-year stint as vice president for government relations at defense contractor Raytheon. That lobbyist background raised immediate alarms from Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which said that Raytheon had recently won multiple government contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

""While Esper may not have had sway over these types of deals as Secretary of the Army, as acting Secretary of Defense he will have potential influence over such deals,"" as well as a proposed merger between Raytheon and United Technologies Corp., CREW executive director Noah Bookbinder said in a statement.

Esper previously served a national security adviser for former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist.

He was policy director for the House Armed Services Committee and a professional staff member on the Senate Foreign Relations committee and also advised former Obama administration Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel when Hagel was in the Senate.

He's also served as a deputy assistant secretary of defense and was a war planner on the Army staff.

Esper spent more than a decade in the Army, including serving in the Persian Gulf War in 1990 and 1991 with the 101st Airborne Division. He has won the Bronze Star Medal and other awards.

""He has a great background. I know him and I think he'll do very well in the acting role,"" said Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., a close Trump ally who speaks frequently with the president.

It is not clear whether Esper's defense industry background might complicate any confirmation prospects.

Shanahan, for instance, came under scrutiny because of his prior career as a Boeing executive and persistent questions about possible conflicts of interest.

The Defense Department's Inspector General cleared Shanahan of any wrongdoing in connection with accusations he had shown favoritism toward Boeing during his time as deputy defense secretary, while disparaging Boeing competitors.

But even so, Bookbinder said Shanahan's past work at Boeing overshadowed his decisions at the Defense Department.

""His successor will likewise risk being tainted by his previous work for a major defense contractor,"" Bookbinder said.

Chinese telecom giant Huawei has filed a civil lawsuit against the U.S. government accusing the Commerce Department of mishandling equipment that it seized from the company in 2017.

According to the complaint filed Friday, the U.S. government took possession of several pieces of equipment, which were being shipped from an independent testing facility in the United States to China, in order to determine if the technology was subject to export controls.

Story Continued Below

Huawei contends it provided the necessary documentation and was told such disputes are usually resolved in 45 days. Nearly two years later, Huawei believes the equipment is still sitting in an Alaskan warehouse, according to the complaint.

Huawei is not seeking financial compensation but instead wants the court to force the Commerce Department to decide whether export control clearance is necessary and, if not, release the equipment.

A spokesperson for the Commerce Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The lawsuit comes as tensions between Huawei and the U.S. government have reached a fever pitch.

The Justice Department charged Huawei earlier this year with violating U.S. sanctions against Iran and stealing trade secrets from U.S. competitors. Meanwhile, Huawei sued the U.S.government, saying a law passed by Congress that banned federal agencies from doing business with the company was unconstitutional.

What's more, the Commerce Department slapped severe trade restrictions on Huawei last month that prevent U.S. companies from selling vital equipment to the company, a penalty that Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei recently said could cost the company $30 billion in lost sales over two years.

Hundreds of migrant caravan members found to have US criminal histories: DHS files,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hundreds-of-migrant-caravan-found-to-have-criminal-histories-dhs-files,"Hundreds of illegal immigrants attempting to cross the southern border as part of massive migrant caravans were found to have criminal histories in the U.S., according to newly obtained Department of Homeland Security documents.

The DHS files were provided to House Oversight Committee Republicans in May and included internal data showing more than 1,000 migrants traveling as part of caravans to the border within the past nine months had “U.S. criminal histories” and hundreds had “U.S. criminal convictions.”

BORDER ARRESTS SKYROCKET IN MAY, AS OFFICIALS DECLARE 'FULL-BLOWN EMERGENCY'

The files detailed one migrant caravan of nearly 8,000 individuals that started toward the border in October 2018 and arrived south of California by December. According to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), 660 of them had U.S. criminal convictions—with 40 convicted of assault or aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and three convicted of murder.

In January 2019, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) tracked another caravan that left Honduras with more than 3,300 migrants. ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) team identified that 860 of those individuals had U.S. criminal histories, including more than 20 convicted of assault or aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, nearly 30 convicted of sexual offenses, two convicted of violence against law enforcement, and one convicted of attempted murder.

The documents, provided to House Oversight Republicans, also revealed that CBP is currently monitoring another “movement of several groups ranging in size from 1,000 to 4,000” in the Mexican states of Chiapas and Veracruz, but did not specify how many of those migrants are believed to have criminal records.

In a letter to DHS Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan on Thursday, committee Ranking Member Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, requested further information about caravan members with criminal backgrounds to “assist” in their “oversight of the crisis at the southern border and better understand the threat posed by large caravans.”

Jordan requested arrest warrants, court documents and other materials detailing the criminal histories of the migrants in the January 2019 and October 2018 caravan; an update of CBP’s monitoring of the caravan movement in Mexican states; and summaries of ICE HSI materials by July 5.

In his letter, Jordan referred to President Trump’s decision in February to declare a national emergency and referred to his comments that the “southern border is a major entry point for criminals, gang members, and illicit narcotics” threatening “core national security interests.”

The newly revealed DHS information comes amid a stunning surge across the border this year. Last month, the number of migrants apprehended at the southern border skyrocketed to levels not seen in over a decade, with CBP reporting nearly 133,000 arrests in May. The number surpassed 144,000 when counting migrants deemed inadmissible—more than a 30 percent increase from the prior month and double the influx recorded at the beginning of the year. The number was the highest monthly total in more than 13 years, officials said.

“We are in a full-blown emergency,” Acting CBP Commissioner John Sanders said earlier this month. In April, authorities recorded 99,304 arrests.

FOOTAGE SHOWS MIGRANTS WALKING AROUND BORDER WALL TO ENTER US

McAleenan, in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, also warned that 90 percent of asylum seekers skip their hearings after being released into the U.S.

The continued crisis at the border comes as Trump has sought to extend and shore up the border wall, declaring a national emergency in a bid to divert billions toward construction -- an effort being challenged in the courts.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration announced that it had reached a deal with Mexico to drop threatened tariffs on Mexican imports in exchange for Mexico increasing efforts to limit U.S.-bound migration flows from Central America.

Through the agreement, the U.S. is slated to extend its policy of returning asylum applicants to Mexico while their claims are processed. The U.S. also committed to accelerating asylum claims while Mexico said it will “offer jobs, healthcare, and education according to its principles.”

The deal also stated that Mexico will take “decisive action” to dismantle smuggling and trafficking operations, while both countries will increase cooperation to protect the border.

Justice Department files antitrust suit to stop massive acquisition by Quad/Graphics,https://www.jsonline.com,"['Rick Romell', 'Published A.M. Ct June']",06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.jsonline.com/story/money/business/2019/06/21/justice-department-files-antitrust-suit-stop-big-quad-graphics-acquisition/1519957001/,"CLOSE

The U.S. Justice Department is suing to block Quad/Graphics Inc.'s proposed $1.4 billion acquisition of LSC Communications, saying the merger would combine the only two significant magazine, catalog and book printers in the country.

""LSC is Quad’s primary competitor,"" Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim said in a statement. ""If this deal were allowed to proceed, Quad would dominate the markets for magazine, catalog, and book printing services and be able to raise prices and reduce quality at the expense of publishers, retailers, and, ultimately, American consumers.”

The two companies are by far the largest printers in the U.S. and their ""intense, head-to-head competition"" has benefited customers, the department said.

Sussex-based Quad, one of the largest private employers in Wisconsin, said it would ""vigorously defend"" the proposed acquisition. The firm said the Justice Department is ignoring ""dynamic conditions"" in commercial printing and the fact that printers compete not just with each other but with burgeoning digital advertising channels such as Google and Facebook.

""Given the continued migration of advertising dollars to digital channels,"" printers have pursued consolidations to reduce overcapacity and battle more effectively with digital competitors, Quad said in a statement.

Neither Quad nor LSC has been a stellar performer of late. LSC lost money in two of the last three years. Over that same period, Quad netted 1.5% on its sales and saw revenue decline.

Both, though, are large companies, with dozens of manufacturing and distribution plants and tens of thousands of workers.

Quad as of December had the equivalent of 20,600 employees, including 8,000 in Wisconsin and 16,900 across the U.S. Sales last year hit $4.2 billion.

Chicago-based LSC was created in 2016 when RR Donnelley & Sons Co. spun off the wing of its business that concentrated on printing magazines, catalogs, retail inserts and books.

LSC employed 22,000 people as of December, including 18,700 in the U.S. Its 2018 sales totaled $3.8 billion.

In an interview last fall, Joel Quadracci, Quad's chairman, president and CEO, said the acquisition of LSC would give Quad the scale and cash-generating capacity to smooth its transition toward becoming not just a printer but ""more of a marketing services partner"" to its customers.

""This is a defining moment in Quad’s 47-year journey,"" Quadracci said.

Sprinkled throughout the Justice Department's complaint, filed Thursday in federal court in Chicago, are examples of how the government says intense competition between Quad and LSC has benefited customers.

When the two printing giants dueled for a contract with a major book publisher, the government alleges, one LSC executive, likening the competition to the Battle of Gettysburg, declared, ""We must win"" — only to see Quad scoop up the account by offering the publisher a deal that would save it $37 million over its current arrangement.

In another case, the complaint says, Quad tried to keep a magazine publisher from switching to LSC by offering a 25% price cut. But when the publisher told LSC of the ""Godfather deal"" Quad had offered, LSC responded with even better terms. It won the contract, and the publisher realized $6.5 million in immediate benefits, the complaint says.

Such episodes, the government alleges, demonstrate why LSC's chief executive told investors a merger with Quad could lead to ""pricing stability"" and eliminate such battles between the companies.

According to the complaint, Quad and LSC control a high percentage of web offset presses in the U.S. and all rotogravure presses — the types of equipment publishers turn to for printing long runs of magazines.

Meanwhile, the government said, a presentation by Quad’s board of directors described LSC and Quad as holding a combined 69% of the catalog printing market.

In a statement, Quadracci said merging with LSC would help ensure print's viability as a channel for publishers and retailers.

""Our goal is to make print a more effective and affordable media option to that of digital giants such as Google and Facebook,"" Quadracci said. ""The DOJ does not appear to recognize the competitive effect of digital media on the print industry.""

The government, for its part, said in its complaint that people will continue to demand printed magazines, catalogs and books. Because of that, a digital-only platform is not an effective substitute to print for many publishers, the complaint said.

Trump's close brush with Iran: Not the first time a President has pulled back from brink of an attack,https://www.cnn.com,['Analysis Zachary B. Wolf'],06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/21/politics/trump-nixon-presidential-threats/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump said Friday that the US military had been 10 minutes away from a strike that could have killed 150 Iranians when he pulled the plug on the operation.

Bravo, said anyone nervous about the US launching military attacks on Iran, while wondering how Trump got that close to ordering a strike without realizing it would cost human life.

This is not the first time a US President pulled back from the brink of an attack.

Richard Nixon did it in 1969 after North Koreans shot down an unarmed US spy plane. Nixon was not worried about human life, but politics. According to The New York Times report at the time, he was concerned that Americans wouldn't back the move, which bore some similarities to bombings years earlier in the Gulf of Tonkin that presaged war in Vietnam."
"State Department condemns Iran, China for persecuting religious minorities",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Carol Morello', 'National Reporter Focusing On Foreign Policy', 'State Department']",06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/state-department-condemns-iran-china-for-persecuting-religious-minorities/2019/06/21/97b5621d-89c9-40d5-b86c-ea87a25b933b_story.html,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, with Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom Sam Brownback, left, and State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus, speaks about the 2018 International Religious Freedom Annual Report on June 21. (Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)

The State Department condemned China and Iran on Friday for treating religious minorities as national security threats meriting surveillance, imprisonment and sometimes death.

In introducing the annual report on International Religious Freedom, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo struck an unusual personal note, noting he had been a Sunday school teacher and a church deacon, and took a swipe at Washington.

“That might sound unusual to a lot of people inside the Beltway,” he said. “But I am one of millions of Americans, and billions of people across the world, who live in the knowledge of a higher power. I often humbly reflect on how God’s providence has guided me to this office, to defend this cause.”

Samuel Brownback, the ambassador for religious freedom, said: “We believe there is no more important time for the United States to promote religious freedom than now.”

The annual report looks at the government policies that violate religious belief and practices in every country of the world except the United States.

China and Iran are among 10 countries of particular concern when it comes to religious freedom, meaning they may face sanctions. The chapters are considerably longer than those of North Korea, which Brownback called “horrible” for religious freedom, or on Myanmar, where ethnic Rohingya have been subjected to harassment and violence.

The report was released amid growing tensions between the United States and Iran, as well as China.

The United States and China have been in a trade war for nearly a year. While talks go on, the Trump administration has shied away from placing sanctions on Chinese officials involved in the detention of 1 million or more ethnic Uighurs and other minority Muslims in the northwest region of Xinjiang. Brownback said some sanctions have been placed on the manufacturers of equipment used to surveil religious minorities, and the United States frequently raises its concerns publicly.

Iranian Christians and other religious minorities are among those who have lost opportunities to emigrate to the United States as part of deep cuts in refugee admissions from Iran. Brownback said the criteria for religious minorities getting preference as refugees changed during the Obama administration, and it is time for the policy to be reviewed.

The religious freedom report lists detailed accounts of religious minorities in countries around the world who were subjected to “death, forced disappearances, and organ harvesting in prison because of their religious beliefs or affiliation.”

Pompeo has spoken forcefully against the treatment of Uighur Muslims sent to what he has called “reeducation camps.” U.S. attempts to berate the Chinese have sparked little change, however. After Pompeo met with four Uighurs in March to discuss human rights abuses, the aunt and uncle of one of them, a U.S. citizen, learned his aunt and uncle had been moved from a camp and sentenced to eight years in prison.

The report said Chinese Christians also have been increasingly oppressed, with authorities closing churches, burning bibles and ordering believers to renounce their faith.

The chapter on Iran accuses the government of meting out harsh punishments to those who are not Shiite Muslims. Iran’s penal code specifies death for crimes like enmity against God, corruption on earth and insulting the prophets.

But there is little the U.S. government can do about it, except protest publicly. With no diplomatic relations between Tehran and Washington, the report says, U.S. diplomats “did not have opportunities to raise concerns directly with the government over its religious freedom abuses and restrictions.”"
U.S. blacklists 5 Chinese supercomputing groups ahead of trade talks,https://www.cbsnews.com,[],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-blacklists-five-chinese-supercomputing-organizations-ahead-of-trade-talks/,"The U.S. Commerce Department is barring five Chinese supercomputing organizations from access to U.S. technology, saying they are national security threats.

The blacklist follows the Trump administration's move last month to restrict sales by U.S. companies to Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei.

Experts say the move could complicate trade talks scheduled for next week between President Donald Trump and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping.

The U.S. on Friday blacklisted five Chinese supercomputing organizations, saying they pose a threat to national security and cutting them off from critical American technology.

The Commerce Department put the Chinese organizations, including supercomputer maker Sugon, on its ""Entity List,"" saying their activities are ""contrary to the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States."" The other four are the Wuxi Jiangnan Institute of Computing Technology and three Sugon affiliates.

Sugon and the Wuxi Jiangnan Institute are involved in China's push to develop ""exascale"" computing systems, which make a billion billion calculations per second, that can assist China's military modernization.

The blacklist effectively bars U.S. firms from selling technology to the Chinese organizations without government approval.

Huawei steps up legal battle over U.S. ban in Texas court





The decision could complicate talks next week in Japan between President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, aimed at de-escalating a trade dispute between the world's two biggest economies.

""The move will not disrupt planning for a Trump-Xi meeting directly, but Beijing will see it as further evidence that those around Trump intend to blunt China's rise as a tech power,"" Michael Hirson, an analyst with political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, said in a report.

The Commerce Department last month blacklisted telecommunications giant Huawei, further heightening tensions with Beijing. Talks to resolve trade disputes between the two countries also broke off last month.

Trump has imposed 25% tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports and is preparing to target another $300 billion, extending the import taxes to virtually everything China ships to the United States. China has retaliated with tariffs on U.S. products.

""Adding more Chinese companies to the U.S. bad guys list may be seen as a way to ramp up the pressure on China,"" said Amanda DeBusk, a partner at Dechert LLP and the former Commerce Department assistant secretary for export enforcement.

DeBusk added: ""However, the Chinese may see this as ill-timed bullying. They cannot be seen as making concessions to the United States, so this may have the effect of hurting any chances for trade agreement."""
EPA to connect Loudoun homes contaminated by landfill to public water,https://wtop.com,['News Traffic Weather'],06-21-2019,2019,6,https://wtop.com/loudoun-county/2019/06/epa-to-connect-loudoun-homes-contaminated-by-landfill-to-public-water/,"The privately owned and operated Hidden Lane Landfill was a 25-acre disposal site that health officials with Loudoun County and Virginia deemed to be the likely source of drinking water contamination in the Board Run Farms community that was first discovered in 1989.

More than 120 properties in the Broad Run Farms community affected by Hidden Lane Landfill superfund site groundwater contamination will be hooked up to the public water system by the federal Environmental Protestion Agency, according to Virginia’s Loudoun County.

The construction won’t cost property owners a dime but it will cost the agency millions.

The privately owned and operated Hidden Lane Landfill was a 25-acre disposal site that health officials with both the county and Virginia deemed to be the likely source of Broad Run Farms drinking water contamination first discovered in 1989.

The chemical that was discovered is called trichloroethylene, or TCE. According to the National Toxicology Program (an interagency group coordinated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services), it’s primarily used in two ways: to make hydrofluorocarbon chemicals, especially refrigerants, and as a solvent to remove grease from metal parts.

The NIH also says it’s a known carcinogen and can increase the risk of cancer.

“We are grateful to the EPA for this decision and while we advocated for the extension of public water to the entire Broad Run Farms community, this is a significant action that will benefit those residents most directly impacted in the community,” Algonkian District Supervisor Suzanne Volpe, who represents the area on the Board of Supervisors, said in a Thursday news release.

“I would also like to commend the dedicated and long-term efforts of Loudoun County staff as well as the Virginia Department of Health and the Department of Environmental Quality for getting us to this milestone.”

There’s no word yet on when construction of the new water lines is slated to begin.

Justice Dept review of intel in Russia probe fuels fears of politicization,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Olivia Gazis'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/justice-department-review-of-intelligence-in-russia-probe-fuels-fears-of-politicization/,"A mix of concern, confusion and defiance has spread through elements of the intelligence community as a murky picture emerges of Attorney General William Barr's review of its investigative and analytical work on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

In particular, current and former intelligence officials are questioning the purpose and propriety of the attorney general's intention, first reported by The New York Times, to enlist John Durham, the U.S. attorney for the District of Connecticut, in scrutinizing the analytical judgments that led a group of agencies to conclude that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign to boost then-candidate Trump's electability.

That judgment, put forth in a declassified Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA) commissioned by former president Barack Obama and released in January 2017, pooled the findings of the CIA, FBI and NSA. The CIA and FBI expressed ""high confidence"" in that conclusion, while the NSA had ""moderate confidence.""

""I see no problem with a DOJ review of whether the CIA and other intelligence community agencies lived up to their legal and regulatory responsibilities related to how they handled any information related to U.S. persons – U.S. citizens and U.S. nationals,"" said Michael Morell, a former CIA deputy director who is a CBS News senior national security contributor. ""Having said that, I see a DOJ review of whether or not the intelligence analysts made the right call as wholly inappropriate. I cannot ever remember a DOJ review of analysis.""

""[Durham] and his team have no experience with, or knowledge of, the process of intelligence analysis,"" Morell said. ""He and his team could well impose a law enforcement standard in coming to a conclusion — a much higher bar than exists in the intelligence community for analytic judgments.""

Both the House and Senate Intelligence Committees have already examined the process by which the ICA was assembled and offered their declassified assessments.

In their March 2018 final report on Russia's active measures, Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee — without describing what kind of evidence was examined — said ""most"" of the ICA's analysis ""held up to scrutiny."" But they criticized its judgment on Putin's strategic objectives for having ""failed to meet most of the analytic standards set forth in the primary guiding document for IC analysis."" (The committee's Democrats dissented from that view.)

That document – Intelligence Community Directive 203 – stipulates, among other things, that analytic products should be ""objective,"" ""timely,"" and ""independent of political consideration.""

But in July, the Senate Intelligence Committee — whose leadership has maintained a vastly more united and bipartisan front than the fractious panel in the House — issued a declassified summary of a months-long assessment that found the ICA to be a ""sound intelligence product."" The committee said it had reviewed ""thousands of pages of source documents and conducted interviews with all the relevant parties — including agency heads, managers, and line analysts — who were involved in developing the analysis and drafting the assessment.""

""In all the interviews of those who drafted and prepared the ICA, the Committee heard consistently that analysts were under no politically motivated pressure to reach any conclusions,"" the summary said. ""All analysts expressed that they were free to debate, object to content, and assess confidence levels, as is normal and proper for the analytic process.""

Analytical disagreement, the committee said, was ""reasonable, transparent, and openly debated.""

The Senate panel is expected to release a declassified version of a far more extensive report on the ICA in the coming months, though the bulk of their assessment is likely to remain classified.

Asked whether the Justice Department's review was duplicative of the panel's work, a spokeswoman for the Senate Intelligence Committee declined to comment.

Morell said a DOJ probe into analysts' conclusions could have a ""chilling effect"" on the analytic process.

""Any analyst asked to submit to an interview with Durham's investigators will want to have their own personal attorney at their side,"" he said. ""Imagine that — needing an attorney to explain an analytic judgment.""

""This will all be watched closely inside the IC and the prospect that DOJ prosecutors may ask questions about how an analyst came to a conclusion could well lead analysts to demur,"" Morell said.

A Democratic House Intelligence Committee official who requested anonymity to discuss ongoing, sensitive matters said the panel had engaged at multiple levels with multiple intelligence agencies and had ""heard a sense of anxiety"" and ""palpable unease.""

The official expressed concern that ""purposeful overreach"" by DOJ could undermine what have been shown to be sound conclusions, and that normal differences of opinion raised in the course of discussion that would go into crafting an analytical judgment could be exploited for political purposes.

In this case, the official said, in what could be a politically motivated effort to score-settle with former CIA Director John Brennan — has been sharply critical of President Trump — routine, healthy discussion could be cast as Brennan putting his thumb on the scale.

""There is no evidence that was the case. These assessments have withstood continued scrutiny for more than two years, and have only been buttressed by continued analysis and collection,"" the official said.

A spokesman for Mr. Brennan declined to comment. The CIA and NSA declined to comment. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The House Intelligence Committee's Democratic chairman, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, said at the National Press Club this week that he had met personally with Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, but the committee has otherwise had ""very little visibility"" into the scope and progress of the review. A Senate Intelligence Committee official also said that panel was in close communication with the intelligence community and similarly had not been offered details about the review beyond the contents of a letter the Department of Justice sent earlier this month.

In its letter, sent in response to an earlier inquiry from the House Judiciary Committee, DOJ indicated the review was ""broad in scope and multifaceted, and is intended to illuminate open questions regarding the activities of U.S. and foreign intelligence services as well as non-governmental organizations and individuals."" It did not explicitly mention a review of analytic processes or the ICA itself."
ICE raids: Acting Homeland Security secretary McAleenan appears wary of enforcing Trump's latest plan,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Aaron Blake', 'Senior Political Reporter', 'Writing For The Fix', 'June At Am']",06-22-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/06/22/trumps-acting-dhs-secretary-appears-wary-immigration-raids-that-says-lot/,"

When President Trump announced his travel ban a week into his presidency, it was up to the Department of Homeland Security to implement it immediately. The result was chaos at our nation’s airports.

When Trump’s Justice Department announced a “zero tolerance” policy on illegal immigration, it was again up to DHS to make it workable. The result was the controversial — and since rescinded — separation of families.

Now Trump is trying to quickly implement another controversial immigration plan, by launching Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids to quickly deport undocumented families, starting Sunday.

And the head of DHS appears understandably wary.

The Washington Post’s Nick Miroff, who has been breaking news like crazy when it comes to the situation on the U.S.-Mexico border, reported Friday that the raids would begin this weekend. The scale is large, with as many as 2,000 families targeted in 10 major U.S. cities.

But this time, Trump’s acting Homeland Security secretary is apparently conveying that he’s not on board with the plan for the “family op.” Kevin McAleenan, who has crafted a solid bipartisan reputation since taking over for Kirstjen Nielsen, has advised against such a quick implementation.

Here are few key passages from Miroff’s latest story:

Acting DHS secretary Kevin McAleenan has been urging ICE, an agency within his department, to conduct a narrower, more targeted operation that would seek to detain a group of about 150 families that were provided with attorneys but dropped out of the legal process and absconded. McAleenan has warned that an indiscriminate operation to arrest migrants in their homes and at work sites risks separating children from their parents in cases where the children are at day care, summer camp or friend’s houses. He also has maintained that ICE should not devote major resources to carrying out a mass interior sweep while telling lawmakers it needs emergency funding to address the crisis at the U.S. border. ... The White House has been in direct communication with acting ICE director Mark Morgan and other ICE officials, circumventing McAleenan, three officials said. ... McAleenan has said that the crisis at the border — where more than 144,000 were taken into custody last month — remains the most urgent problem for DHS. Following Trump’s threats to slap tariffs on Mexico, McAleenan led negotiations with Mexican officials that resulted in commitments to dramatically toughen enforcement and begin work on a regional asylum overhaul that would allow the United States to send asylum seekers back to Central America. Officials say McAleenan does not oppose ICE interior enforcement against families with deportation orders, but he wants a more limited approach that averts a repeat of “zero tolerance.”

The message from McAleenan seems rather simple: This risks distracting from some very real progress that we’re making and also diverts resources to a less pressing issue. It’s an entirely logical stance. The situation on the southern border, after all, has reached crisis levels, according to Trump and his administration. McAleenan has argued the recently struck deal to get Mexico to halt the flow of migrants to the border will be a far more effective way to get the border surge under control. This operation deals with a separate but related issue of undocumented immigrants already within the country’s interior.

The lessons of the travel ban and “zero tolerance” loom large. The former suffered from the haste of its implementation, while the latter suffered from a perceived lack of humanity. The new operation risks problems on both fronts.

It seeks to round up families who have already received deportation orders, which would seem like an easier political sell. Are Democrats and other Trump opponents really going to say the administration can’t deport people who are due for deportation?

But the speed of the operation’s implementation harks back to the travel ban, and the possibility of unhelpful images looms large. Children behind chain-link fences without their parents was one thing. What happens when ICE officials are recorded showing up to deport a family — or, as McAleenan reportedly warned, it results in families being separated yet again? The potential pitfalls of such a large and fast operation are numerous.

Like McAleenan, Nielsen was occasionally reported to have expressed reservations about some of Trump’s initiatives, including the family separation policy. Despite that, the program is likely to be prominent when it comes to history’s evaluation of her tenure. Even John Kelly, Nielsen’s predecessor as DHS secretary who went on to become White House chief of staff, has sought distance from some of Trump’s immigration policies.

McAleenan has stepped into the void and, by the accounts of even Democrats, has been a breath of fresh air. The fact that he apparently wants no part of this new approach seems telling."

— A bright, white dot spotted over the Dayton area and numerous suburbs of the city could be part of the U.S. Department of Defense’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, also known as DARPA.

“DARPA launched three balloons from Cumberland, Maryland, in a flight test for the Adaptable Lighter Than Air Program,” said Heather Babb, spokeswoman for the Department of Defense. “ALTA will demonstrate capability for wind-borne navigation of a lighter-than-air vehicle over extended ranges.”

>> PREVIOUS: What was that bright, white dot hanging over parts of the Miami Valley?

Babb stopped short of confirming that the bright, white dot spotted by numerous News Center 7 viewers was indeed a DARPA balloon, however another spokesperson for DARPA said given the location it was likely one of their balloons.

Sightings of the object were reported Tuesday to News Center 7 from viewers in Xenia, Englewood, West Milton, West Carrollton and Eaton.

DARPA’s ALTA program’s balloons can fly at altitudes of more than 75,000 feet.

“While they do not have independent propulsion, the ALTA vehicle is designed to navigate by changing altitude and thus taking advantage of different wind profiles aloft,” according to DARPA’s website.

DARPA dates back to the launch of Sputnik in 1957 and also has played roles in precision weapons and stealth technology, and other technology advances such as the Internet, automated voice recognition, language transition and GPS.

DARPA is comprised of about 220 government employees in six technical offices, who oversee about 250 research and development programs."
Former EPA staffer says Wheeler lied to Congress,https://thehill.com,[],06-20-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/449626-former-epa-staffer-says-wheeler-lied-congress,"A longtime former Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) staffer is accusing Administrator Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerOvernight Energy: Trump proposal would nix agency reviews of long-term climate impacts | Greens rip decision | House votes to block offshore drilling for one year Overnight Energy: Fight over fuel standards intensifies | Democrats grill Trump officials over rule rollback | California official blasts EPA chief over broken talks | Former EPA official says Wheeler lied to Congress Former EPA staffer says Wheeler lied to Congress MORE of lying in a letter he wrote to Congress Thursday that denied agency staff were shut out as EPA developed a controversial rollback on Obama-era fuel standards.

Critics of the rollback have long contended that the EPA sidelined its Office of Transportation and Air Quality when developing the rule. The office is home to the agency’s in-house lab for testing vehicles emissions.

Wheeler denied that accusation this week, but Jeff Alson, a former senior policy advisor to that office, said Wheeler is not telling the truth.

“I know that is a lie because I was there. I was one of 20 people at EPA working on this for a decade,” Alson told The Hill. Alson retired in April of last year after working 40 years at the agency.

The issue of sidelined staffers came to a head as lawmakers probed the stalled negotiations between EPA and California, which has long had more stringent standards for vehicle fuel economy and is fighting the EPA rollback.

As lawmakers grilled EPA officials over the failed negotiation, the EPA delivered a letter from Wheeler that blamed California for the standstill.

It also accused the state’s negotiator, California Air Resources Board Chair Mary Nichols, of incorrectly saying the Office of Transportation and Air Quality were shut out of the rulemaking process.

""Her testimony that EPA professional staff were cut out of this proposal's development is false,"" Wheeler wrote.

Alson said the administration has denied pushing aside career staff before, but he found this instance particularly grievous.

“To see it in a formal letter that was given to Congress and to specifically accuse someone else of lying when in reality that person was being truthful and when Administrator Wheeler was the one doing the lying, it just put me beyond the point of no return,” he said.

The EPA said Wheeler's letter speaks for itself.

""Career, professional staff within the Office of Air and Radiation were involved in the development of the proposal and continue to be involved in the final stages as we work with NHTSA to finalize this rule,"" a spokesperson said in an email to The Hill.

A key pillar of former President Obama's environmental legacy involved strengthening fuel emissions standards for cars to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2026. But Trump's rollback would freeze the average fuel economy at 37 mpg.

Alson said his office did have two or three “check the box” meetings with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the other agency involved in drafting the rollback, but he said the agency did not collaborate with his EPA office in developing the standards and would not share any of their information with the EPA.

“NHTSA would say nothing about what they were assuming. They wouldn’t give us a copy of their models, they wouldn’t share their assumptions, they wouldn’t share their projections of how much the standards were going to cost,” he said. “They wouldn’t give us anything.”

When Bill Wehrum, EPA’s head of the Office of Air and Radiation, appeared before the House Energy and Commerce Committee Thursday, several Democrats questioned him about the role of the Office of Transportation and Air Quality.

Rep. Paul Tonko Paul David TonkoOvernight Energy: Fight over fuel standards intensifies | Democrats grill Trump officials over rule rollback | California official blasts EPA chief over broken talks | Former EPA official says Wheeler lied to Congress Former EPA staffer says Wheeler lied to Congress Democrats grill Trump officials over fuel standard rollback MORE (D-N.Y.) pointed a Government Accountability Office report that said, “NHTSA cannot be expected to have the same level of in-house expertise related to vehicle power train design and environmental issues as EPA.”

When Tonko pressed Wehrum on the Office of Air and Radiation’s involvement, Wehrum said their work with NHTSA was a “very powerful combination.”

“EPA has had a substantial amount of involvement,” Wehrum said.

Alson said retirement has freed him to talk in ways his colleagues who still work at the EPA cannot. He has been vocal in his opposition to the rollbacks, including penning an op-ed in The Hill, but said he has held back from addressing inaccuracies from administrator's until now.

“The truth is Mary Nichols is telling the truth and Administrator Wheeler is lying, and it’s shameful and it breaks my heart that the man that heads up the agency where I worked for 40 years and spent my life trying to make the world a little bit better can blatantly lie to the American public.”"
Trump tells Fox News DOJ looking into whether his phone calls were monitored,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'President Trump', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-hannity-campaign-launch-justice-department-phone-calls-monitored,"One day after formally launching his 2020 presidential bid, President Trump told Fox News' ""Hannity"" exclusively on Wednesday that investigators are working to determine whether his personal phone calls were secretly monitored by U.S. intelligence agencies during the 2016 campaign -- a possibility he called ""the ultimate.""

Trump also hammered House Democrats for putting his former top communication advisor Hope Hicks ""through hell,"" after pictures of Hicks testifying before a closed-door session on Capitol Hill earlier in the day leaked on social media.

Hicks is the Executive Vice President and Chief Communications Officer for Fox Corporation, and Fox News is a subsidiary of Fox Corporation.

""What's happened to the Democrats -- and in the meantime, they're not doing any work in Congress,"" Trump told Sean Hannity, calling the party ""unhinged.""

""They're not allowed to do that. It's probably illegal,"" Trump said, referring to the leaked pictures of Hicks. Some Democrats complained that Hicks, in her appearance before the House Judiciary Committee, was ordered by the White House to stay quiet about her time as an aide to Trump, citing legal privileges.

But, Trump condemned Democrats' ongoing hearings on collusion and obstruction as an attempt at a ""do-over"" of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.

""Take a look at Ukraine,"" Trump said. ""How come the FBI didn't take the server from the DNC? Just think about that one, Sean."" That was a reference to the DNC's decision in 2016 to turn over its server to the private security firm Crowdstrike, rather than the FBI, after what prosecutors said was a Russian-led hack.

The Hill's John Solomon reported earlier Wednesday that the FBI, in search warrant affidavits, relied heavily on leaked Ukrainian financial documents concerning former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort -- even though the bureau was repeatedly warned that the documents were untrustworthy and likely fake.

Earlier this year, Ukraine Prosecutor General Yurii Lutsenko opened a probe into the so-called ""black ledger"" files that led to Manafort's abrupt departure from the Trump campaign. The investigation commenced after an unearthed audio recording showed that a senior Ukrainian anticorruption official apparently admitted to leaking Manafort's financial information in 2016 -- including his ties to pro-Russian actors in Ukraine -- to benefit Clinton.

CLINTON-UKRAINE ALLEGATIONS 'BIG,' TRUMP SAYS

A Ukrainian court recently ruled that the Manafort leak amounted to illegal interference in the U.S. election. A 2017 investigation by Politico found that Ukrainian officials not only publicly sought to undermine Trump by questioning his fitness for office, but also worked behind the scenes to secure a Clinton victory.

""I don't hear Russia much anymore. You know, they've given up on that one."" — President Trump

Trump told Hannity the episode was hardly surprising, given that the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee (DNC), through the firm Fusion GPS, funded British ex-spy Christopher Steele's creation of an unverified and largely discredited dossier. The FBI went on to cite the dossier in secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court applications to surveil former Trump aide Carter Page.

""I think it's a disgrace,"" Trump said.

Numerous issues with the Steele dossier's reliability have surfaced, including several that were brought to the FBI's attention before it cited the dossier in its FISA application and subsequent renewals. Mueller's report made plain, for example, that former Trump attorney Michael Cohen did not travel to Prague to conspire with Russian hackers seeking to access Democrat files, as the dossier alleged.

Mueller also was unable to substantiate the dossier's claims that Page had received a large payment relating to the sale of a share of Rosneft, a Russian oil giant.

""The fact is, they were spying on my campaign, using intelligence agencies to do it. ... We're trying to figure out whether they listened to my calls. That would be the ultimate. We'll see what happens. If that happens, we'll probably find out. If they spied on my campaign and they may have, it will be one of the great revelations in history of this country. It will be very interesting. I think we're gonna find out.""

Trump said Attorney General Bill Barr is working ""very hard"" to get to the bottom the matter.

DOJ INVESTIGATING NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AS PART OF ONGOING REVIEW OF FBI MISCONDUCT

The lengthy phone conversation began with Trump recounting the Tuesday night launch of his campaign in the jam-packed Amway Center in Orlando. Thousands of Trump supporters arrived more than 40 hours in advance to secure a spot, despite sweltering Florida heat. Some had been camped in chairs for several nights.

""It was an incredible scene -- and outside there were thousands of people,"" Trump told Hannity, comparing the atmosphere to that of a national college football championship. ""It was just an electric evening. ... It's a tailgate party for our country.""

Trump noted that the U.S. has become ""number one in the world in energy,"" referring to the fact that the U.S. is the world's leading crude oil producer. The head of the International Energy Agency said in 2018 that, because of the ""shale revolution,"" the U.S. ""is becoming the undisputed leader of oil and gas production worldwide.”

The positive economic indicators, Trump said, have led Democrats to desperately pivot to discussing obstruction, now that Mueller's report found no evidence of Russian collusion by the Trump campaign, despite multiple efforts by Russian-linked actors to involve the Trump team in its hacking efforts.

""I don't hear Russia much anymore. You know, they've given up on that one,"" Trump said, before touting his administration's economic successes. ""We have the best, lowest unemployment rate for blacks, Asians, Hispanics -- nobody's ever seen numbers like this... If the other side had won, we'd have gone into a depression.

""We have more poeple working today -- almost 160 million people -- than have ever worked in the history of our country,"" Trump added. ""Think of it -- it's a great number.""

Trump also denied a Wall Street Journal report that he will live-tweet the upcoming Democrat primary debates, but suggested it might not be a bad idea.

""Instead of fake news, I'll make them correct news -- and maybe that's OK,"" Trump joked.

""When I make a speech, like last night -- there was a fantastic woman in the front with a sign, 'Please keep tweeting, it matters,'"" Trump continued. ""And, I think it does matter. I don't do it because I enjoy it. When somebody says an outright lie on MSNBC or CNN ... I can counteract those lies, and I have many more followers than they do."""

The U.S. State Department Has 'Not Seen an Uptick' of Deaths in the Dominican Republic,https://people.com,['Steve Helling'],,,,https://people.com/crime/state-department-no-updick-deaths-dominican-republic/,"By now, the news is everywhere.

In the past year, according to the U.S. State Department, at least eight American tourists have died after falling ill in Dominican Republic resorts — and dozens more have gotten sick. The incidents have garnered widespread media coverage, causing many Americans to rethink their travel plans.

But despite the rash of illnesses, the U.S. State Department has not issued an elevated travel advisory for the island nation — and the agency says in a statement that they “have not seen an uptick” in deaths despite the media coverage.

“We are closely monitoring ongoing investigations by Dominican authorities into several recent deaths of U.S. citizens in the Dominican Republic,” the statement says. “We have no higher priority than the safety and welfare of U.S. citizens abroad.”

“Millions of Americans travel to the Dominican Republic every year,” the statement continues. “Speaking generally, we have not seen an uptick in the number of US citizen deaths reported to the Department. While the overwhelming majority travel without incident, we want to assure all Americans that we continue to work actively with the Dominican authorities at the very highest levels to ensure that U.S. citizens are safe and feel safe while in the Dominican Republic.”

In April 2019, the department rated the Dominican Republic a level 2 for safety on a scale where 1 is the safest and 4 is the most dangerous. The rating means visitors should “exercise increased caution due to crime.” In the weeks of intense media scrutiny following the deaths of Americans, there has been no change to the rating.

The FBI has agents in on the island and are investigating the deaths of at least six of the tourists who have died since the summer of 2018. Some of them passed away in what appear to be bizarre — and similar — circumstances. The agencies are not yet releasing further details about the investigations.

Robin Bernstein, the ambassador of the United States to the Dominican Republic, told Univision these high-profile incidents should not be considered anything more than isolated cases. “We have 2.7 million Americans who come to the country and the statistics is that this is a very … unique event,” Bernstein said in a statement. “They come to visit the beautiful beaches and enjoy the great culture.

"10-year Treasury yield drops as low as 1.97%, first time below 2% since November 2016",https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/19/us-treasury-yields-tick-higher-as-investors-await-federal-reserve-meeting.html,"A chart showing the U.S. 10-year treasury yield below 2% as of 11:49 p.m. ET Wednesday.

The policymaking committee of the Fed also dropped the word ""patient"" from its statement, a sign interpreted by some investors as a hint that the central bank hasn't abandoned the idea of a rate cut in 2019. The Fed tweaked its statement to acknowledge that inflation is ""running below"" its 2% objective.

Though the central bank maintained the target overnight lending rate , that decision was accompanied by a growing number of officials open to one rate cut by the end of 2019 with eight members in favor. However, the consensus still didn't expect a reduction until 2020 at the earliest.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell below 2% for the first time since November 2016 on Wednesday — breaching a key psychological level — after the Federal Reserve struck a more dovish tone in its June policy statement and Chair Jerome Powell said that the case for easier monetary policy had strengthened.

At around 11:58 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to price, declined below 2% to 1.9821% — around its lowest levels since November 2016. The yield on the 2-year slipped to 1.7209%, its lowest level since 2017. The 3-month Treasury bill yield ticked lower to 2.175%, as of 7:30 p.m. ET.

While stock investors and home buyers may initially cheer the drop in the benchmark for corporate bond and mortgage rates, the return to levels not seen in more than two years raises serious questions about the state of the economy.

Softer economic gauges like May's anemic jobs report — which showed that the U.S. economy added just 75,000 positions — and a lackluster consumer pricing print suggested to economists and fixed-income traders earlier this month that the central bank may have to assure markets of its willingness to step in if GDP growth decelerates.

Speaking to reporters after the central bank meeting, Powell said policymakers are worried about certain economic data and see an improving case for easier policy.

""Overall, our policy discussion focused on the appropriate response to the uncertain environment,"" he said. ""Many participants now see the case for somewhat more accommodative policy has strengthened,"" Powell said.

Traders are now pricing in a more than 80% chance of a rate cut in July and 70% probability of another reduction in September, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.

""It was largely what the market was looking for: I don't think they went too far as to spook the market in any way,"" said Tom Garretson, a fixed-income strategist at RBC. ""Seeing that eight [officials] are seeing a rate cut this year was dovish.""

""This is mostly an inflation story,"" he added. ""If you look at GDP forecast for 2020 they're up to 2% from 1.9% ... even if they were worried about tariffs, it didn't show up in their forecast.""

The Fed has in recent months been grappling with a consistent shortfall in inflation relative to its self-imposed 2% target. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, increased 1.6% in the year to April after gaining 1.5% in March.

Treasury inflation-protected securities — bonds whose payouts are indexed to consumer prices — show that price growth expectations have slid in recent months. Inflation is a threat to the value of a bond's fixed coupon and principal payments.

Wednesday's decision from the Federal Open Market Committee came after President Donald Trump's repeated criticism of the Fed and Jerome Powell specifically for raising rates and tightening monetary conditions over the last year. Trump, who sees recent Fed policy as damaging to American markets and undermining his bargaining position in trade talks, has broken with tradition in his frequent and vocal criticism of the central bank.

Asked Tuesday whether he wants to remove Powell as Fed Chair, Trump said ""Let's see what he does."" Trump's comments came after Bloomberg News reported Tuesday morning that the White House had looked into demoting Powell in February.

Trump also said Tuesday he will be having an ""extended meeting"" next week with the Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the G-20 meeting in Japan.

Meanwhile, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said Tuesday that the central bank may need to ease monetary policy in the coming months if inflation doesn't bounce back toward its target.

""In the absence of improvement, such that the sustained return of inflation to our aim is threatened, additional stimulus will be required,"" Draghi said.

"Trump EPA snubs carbon capture, an emissions reduction technique favored by environmentalists and Republicans",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-22-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/trump-epa-snubs-carbon-capture-an-emissions-reduction-technique-favored-by-environmentalists-and-republicans,"The Trump Environmental Protection Agency is dismissing a technology that is favored by many Republicans and is widely considered to be among the most effective at slashing emissions from coal plants.

EPA’s Affordable Clean Energy, or ACE, rule, finalized last week to replace President Barack Obama's signature climate change rule, the Clean Power Plan, does not include carbon capture and storage, also known as CCS, in a list of six technologies that utilities can consider to reduce carbon emissions and make their plants more efficient by burning less coal to produce the same amount of electricity.

The snub of carbon capture, critics say, shows the agency is not serious about combating climate change.

""Based on the rejection of CCS, it's hard to conclude the EPA leadership takes the job of regulating carbon pollution seriously,” said Julio Friedmann, a researcher who studies carbon capture at the Center for Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. Friedmann was formerly principal deputy assistant of the Energy Department’s Office of Fossil Energy in the Obama administration.

Carbon capture technology removes carbon dioxide from a power plant's exhaust, so as to not release it into the atmosphere, and traps the emissions underground.

The EPA argues carbon capture has not been “adequately demonstrated” on a commercial scale and is too expensive.

“Our view of the law is that when states develop emissions limits, it cannot be based on carbon capture,” an EPA senior official told reporters on a press call this week.

To be sure, carbon capture is not considered very energy efficient. It requires a chunk of the energy produced by the power plant to run the capture and storage process. So to include carbon capture as part of a rule that aims to bolster coal plant efficiency doesn't make sense.

“CCS could help continued participation of a coal unit, but not because it makes a unit more efficient,” said Christi Tezak, a managing director at ClearView, an energy research group.

But the problem, critics say, is that the EPA is wrong to only accept efficiency improvements at coal plants, because it's an insufficient way to reduce carbon emissions.

The administration explicitly rejected the more expansive approach of the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan that would have required utilities to move away from coal and switch to natural gas or renewables in order to meet a national emissions limit. The ACE rule does not set any federal emissions limit.

While carbon capture was not part of the Clean Power Plan, the United Nations’ international climate panel considers the technology a crucial tool to fight climate change.

""Focusing solely on power plant efficiency as means of emissions reductions seems inadequate,” Friedmann said. “In order to achieve the kind of profound emissions reductions we need, carbon capture should be considered.""

The Trump EPA has snubbed carbon capture in other ways.

It is the process of revising another Obama-era rule regulating new coal plants, as opposed to existing ones, that would have effectively required plants be built with CCS.

The Trump EPA prefers to not require carbon capture, with the agency using the same argument that carbon capture is not viable or cheap enough.

Friedmann disagrees with EPA’s contention.

Carbon capture costs have dropped by more than 50% over the past 10 years, he said.

Eighteen large facilities around the world, including two at coal power plants, currently capture and store 30 million tons of carbon each year.

For example, the Petra Nova coal plant outside Houston, America’s only successfully running carbon capture facility, sends the carbon dioxide via pipeline to nearby oil fields, where it is used to assist in the extraction of crude oil. The sale of carbon dioxide as a commodity for use in products such as cement, plastics, fuel, and carbon fiber helps to offset the added cost of the CCS technology.

There are more carbon capture projects coming, encouraged by expanded tax credits passed into law in bipartisan votes in Congress last year and signed by President Trump.

""CCS has certainly been adequately demonstrated,” Friedmann said. “Many people said renewables were not cost effective until they were. We've heard this before and it does not square with our experience.""

EPA officials say they do not mean to slight carbon capture. EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler told reporters this week that coal plant operators would not be banned from installing carbon capture as part of the ACE rule. States are also free to encourage the use of carbon capture as part of carbon-free electricity mandates.

“It doesn't preclude CCS from taking place,” Wheeler said of the ACE rule.

But carbon capture cannot qualify toward fulfilling whatever emissions limit states decide to impose to meet the requirements of the ACE rule.

EPA’s air office chief Bill Wehrum, the main author of the ACE rule, said carbon capture could still succeed without his agency promoting it.

“Our job is to let the markets do what they do best to improve efficiency, develop technology, and reduce emissions,"" he said. ""We are seeing technologies like carbon capture being developed today and they will continue being developed. This rule doesn’t get in the way of that.”"
DOJ investigating Jared Kushner transactions in Deutsche Bank money-laundering probe,https://www.salon.com,[],06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.salon.com/2019/06/20/doj-investigating-jared-kushner-transactions-in-deutsche-bank-money-laundering-probe/,"The Department of Justice has opened a criminal investigation into potential money laundering by Deutsche Bank, including transactions linked to White House adviser and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner.

The investigation apparently centers on why Deutsche Bank officials failed to alert the Treasury Department about potentially suspicious transactions by Kushner’s family and company in 2016, including transactions involving Russian individuals, the New York Times reports.

Reportedly, bank officials did not submit the reports to Treasury, even though its employees prepared ""suspicious activity"" reports on the Kushner transactions and others. A spokesperson for Kushner Cos., the family's real estate corporation, told the Times that the firm is not under investigation.

The DOJ has already contacted Tammy McFadden, a former anti-money-laundering compliance officer at the bank who told the Times in May that she flagged transactions involving Kushner’s company but that her superiors had declined to file the suspicious activity reports with the federal government.

Some of McFadden’s colleagues had similar experiences in 2017 when they flagged transactions by entities owned by President Trump. It is unclear whether the FBI is investigating the bank’s handling of those transactions, according to the Times' report.

Congressional Democrats have already received some files from Deutsche Bank as they probe the bank’s dealings with Trump. Deutsche Bank was the only mainstream financial institution willing to lend Trump money after a series of high-profile bankruptcies and defaults in the 1990s. The bank lent him more than $2 billion over the last two decades, including $350 million that Trump still owes, the Times reported.

Two House committees have subpoenaed Deutsche Bank for records related to Trump but the president sued to block the bank from turning the files over. A federal judge rejected Trump’s request to block the subpoena and the president's lawyers are currently appealing that ruling.

Deutsche Bank has been under a DOJ investigation since 2015, according to the Times, when agents probed the bank’s role in laundering money for wealthy Russians. The bank was hit with steep fines in both the U.S. and the United Kingdom, but has not faced any criminal charges. The DOJ expanded its investigation last fall.

McFadden told the Times last month that she was fired by Deutsche Bank last year after raising concerns over the bank’s practices and has since filed complaints with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators.

On Wednesday, the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) also called on the Federal Reserve System to investigate whether Deutsche Bank had violated the law by refusing to submit the suspicious activity reports on the Kushner and Trump transactions.

“Deutsche Bank’s careless attitude towards banking compliance laws and failure to police its accounts may now be impacting American government at the highest levels,” said CREW executive director Noah Bookbinder. “Questions about transactions between President Trump and foreign actors whose conduct seemingly warranted suspicious activity reports, potentially facilitated by Deutsche Bank, harms the public legitimacy of the institution of the presidency itself.”"
DHS to Move Biometric Data on Hundreds of Millions of People to Amazon Cloud,https://www.nextgov.com,['Jack Corrigan'],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2019/06/dhs-move-biometric-data-hundreds-millions-people-amazon-cloud/157837/,"The Homeland Security Department is looking to upgrade the software it uses to analyze biometric data on hundreds of millions of people around the globe, and it plans to store that information in Amazon’s cloud.

The agency’s Office of Biometric Identity Management will replace its legacy biometric analysis platform, called the Automated Biometric Identification System, or IDENT, with a new, more robust system hosted by Amazon Web Services, according to a request for information released Monday.

IDENT essentially serves as an enterprisewide clearinghouse for troves of biometric and biographic data collected by the Transportation Security Administration, Customs and Border Protection, Secret Service and other Homeland Security components. The system links fingerprint, iris and face data to biographic information, allowing officials to quickly identify suspected terrorists, immigration violators, criminals and anyone else included in their databases.

In total, IDENT contains information on more than 250 million people, a Homeland Security spokesperson told Nextgov.

According to the solicitation, Homeland Security is in the process of replacing IDENT with the Homeland Advanced Recognition Technology System, or HART. The new system will include the same biometric recognition features as its predecessor, and potentially additional tools that could identify individuals based on DNA, palm prints, scars, physical markings and tattoos.

Whereas IDENT stores records in government-run data centers, the Homeland Security solicitation states “HART will reside in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) FedRAMP certified GovCloud.” Further, “biometric matching capabilities for fingerprint, iris, and facial matching will be integrated with HART in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud.” Amazon Web Services will also store HART’s biometric image data.

Amazon Web Services’ GovCloud US-East and US-West regions are data centers specifically built by the company to house some of the government’s most restricted information. AWS is no stranger to hosting sensitive government data, having already claimed the CIA, Defense Department, NASA and other federal agencies as customers in part because of perceived security improvements over government legacy systems.

When reached for comment, an AWS spokesperson referred inquiries to DHS.

In 2018, Northrop Grumman won a $95 million contract to develop the first two stages of the HART system, and its contract is set to expire in 2021. The department plans to use responses to the latest solicitation to inform its strategy for further developing the platform, the DHS spokesperson said.

Specifically, officials are asking vendors for ideas on how to build those multiple identification functions into the new system, while leaving room to add any new recognition “modalities” as they arise. Officials also want input on developing a handful of general reporting, analytics and search tools, as well as desktop and mobile web portals where Homeland Security employees can access the system.

Interested vendors must respond to the request by July 17.

In addition to the hundreds of millions of records stored locally in its IDENT system, Homeland Security can also access swaths of biometric information housed at other agencies.

According to the solicitation, the agency shares biometric data and technology with the Defense Department and the FBI, which can access some 640 million photos for its own facial recognition operations. Officials also said they can tap into the State Department’s Consular Consolidated Database—which contained nearly 500 million passport, visa and expat records as of 2016—as well as the databases of “several foreign governments as well as state, local, tribal and territorial law enforcement agencies.”

The government’s use of biometric technology, particularly facial recognition, has come under sharp scrutiny in recent months. Members of the House Oversight Committee have expressed broad bipartisan support for reining in the use of biometrics at agencies like the FBI, and on Monday, a group of lawmakers raised concerns about CBP’s expanding facial recognition program.

"A worthless degree? Betsy DeVos wants to change rules for which colleges stay open, close",https://www.usatoday.com,"['Chris Quintana', 'Published A.M. Et June']",06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2019/06/21/college-closing-accreditation-betsy-devos-u-s-department-education/1505318001/,"CLOSE Trump's education secretary's plans for reforming U.S. education revolve around charter schools and vouchers. Video provided by Newsy Newslook

Going to Brightwood College in the 2018 fall semester was supposed to be a safe bet. So thousands of students enrolled across the country.

For those students and others, a degree is supposed to be a lifeline. They sink in time and money that could be spent in the workforce, all for the prospect of higher earnings and a more fulfilling career.

But Brightwood students’ investment didn’t pay off. What’s more, a regulatory group had signed off on the college’s programs — only to change its mind.

Accreditation, as it’s called, is meant to prevent predatory or shoddy schools from leading students astray. And the Accrediting Council of Independent Colleges and Schools had given its signal to students that Brightwood was a worthwhile investment.

Yet in December 2018, the agency revoked the accreditation of Education Corp. of America, which ran the Brightwood locations and other colleges across the country. The closures of dozens of institutions followed swiftly. Students had spent the time and money, but still had no degrees, and no clear path forward.

Don't be one of them: A college closed, leaving thousands without a degree. How to keep it from happening to you

Many of them still struggle. In a Facebook group for students of the closed college, some commiserate over what they call worthless degrees. Others try to give advice about how to get their student loan discharged or receive their transcripts.

What’s more, the Accrediting Council of Independent Colleges and Schools had a checkered history itself. President Barack Obama's administration had moved to strip it of its powers to OK school programs, but following a legal battle, President Donald Trump's administration undid that move.

The Education Corp. of America colleges were just some of the institutions that suddenly closed in recent years. ITT Tech closed in 2016. Corinthian Colleges did the same in 2015. Both had been accredited by ACICS. The accrediting group said it gave multiple warnings, but the colleges weren't able to meet its standards.

What happened?: The trouble at for-profit colleges, in 5 graphs

Now, the Education Department is looking to change the arcane and bureaucratic process of accreditation.

Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and accreditors of universities say new rules will ultimately allow colleges to offer programs more quickly and effectively. That means students landing a job in fields that are hiring, they say.

“With these reforms, our nation’s colleges and universities can spend more time and effort on serving students and less time, energy, and money focused on bureaucratic compliance,” DeVos said in a statement.

Critics of the newly proposed rules say they would make it easier for shady colleges to operate for longer and with less federal oversight.

Many colleges are already doing a poor job of preparing students, said Clare McCann, of the think tank New America. Giving them more latitude under the guise of innovation may lead to students taking chances on junk programs, she argued.

“What these regulations really do is make it so it is much harder to hold those schools accountable,” McCann said.

If anything, the government should hold these agencies to a higher standard, she said.

The public has until July 12 to give feedback on the proposed changes. Here’s what you should know.

Did your college close? Why Brightwood College, Virginia College closed — and what students should do

What is accreditation?

To receive federal money, universities must meet the quality standards of an accrediting organization. According to the Education Department, these agencies ensure schools have “qualified instructors, an adequate curriculum, and necessary support services” for students. Translated, they’re meant to prevent students from ending up with worthless degrees.

Accreditation can essentially be seen as a seal of quality for students, the government and even future employers. And students atunaccredited colleges can’t access federal money in the form of student loans.

The government doesn’t directly accredit schools, but the Department of Education does decide who is and isn’t fit to be an accreditor. The new rules were agreed upon by department officials, accreditors, college leaders and students during several negotiation sessions.

What’s the Education Department trying to do?

Among the changes, the proposed rules would allow colleges to offer new programs with less scrutiny from accreditors. The idea is that colleges could see a hole in the workforce and quickly come up with a new degree or credential to fill it. Accrediting agencies and for-profit colleges like this proposed change.

Under the current rules, it may take months to make changes to a program’s curriculum, said Judith Eaton, president of the Council for Higher Education Accreditation. The group is made up of 3,000 colleges, and it focuses on accreditation issues. The new rules, she argued, would mean a less onerous process for accreditors when dealing with the federal government. And, she said, the new rules may make it so that universities feel free to experiment with, for example, new credentialing programs or increased online courses.

If a college or accrediting group abused the new rules, the Education Department should crack down quickly, she said.

What about colleges that fail?

Theproposed ruleswould also allow schools that have failed to meet accreditation standards up to four years to fix their issues — double the previous amount of two years. The rationale? These changes sometimes take a long time, and allowing the university to fix a problem may lead to more students graduating.

Closing an underperforming college right away, in contrast, may leave those students without an education and nowhere to go to finish their degree.

This is a change welcomed by Nicholas Kent, a vice president at Career Education Colleges and Universities, a group of for-profit colleges.

Critics have said this measure may allow bad colleges to do more damage, but Kent called that description “disingenuous,” saying different programs will have different needs. A nine-month certificate program, he said, will need less time to fix a problem compared with a 6-year-doctoral program.

And he said accreditors are not required to give four years to everyone. Instead, they have the discretion to do so, and they can set up other check-ins.

But allowing a bad institution to operate longer may mean more students attend the failing institution, wasting time and money. And it could cost taxpayers more money because the school could continue to get federal grants and loans, Antoinette Flores, an associate director at the liberal Center for American Progress, has argued.

Plus, she said, the proposed rules could make it easier for outside entities to buy failing colleges. The Department of Education wants to limit a new owner's liability.

“In practice, that means we’re never going to see any of these institutions going away,” Flores said. “That increases the likelihood we’re recycling failed, toxic assets in the system, and we’re never really getting rid of the lowest performances.”

What happens next?

"Marine general 'bullied' subordinates, 'devalued women': Pentagon inspector general",https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/marine-general-bullied-subordinates-devalued-women-pentagon-inspector/story?id=63814450,"A Department of Defense Inspector General report concluded that a Marine Corps general ""disparaged, bullied, and humiliated subordinates, devalued women, and created a negative ... work environment that led to a general distrust of his impartiality and leadership.""

In response, the Marine Corps said it would ""take appropriate action in light of the substantiated misconduct.""

Brig. Gen. Norman Cooling was serving as the Legislative Assistant to the Commandant of the Marine Corps when the Senate Armed Services Committee sent a complaint to then-Defense Secretary James Mattis about Cooling's conduct, leading to the DOD IG investigation which was initiated on March 15, 2018.

The IG concluded that Cooling violated sections of U.S. Code, as well as Defense Department and Navy regulations. He is currently serving as the Assistant Deputy Commandant for Plans, Policies and Operations for the Marine Corps, after being removed from his previous position last year due to the investigation.

United States Marine Corps

After reviewing the IG's draft report, Cooling acknowledged that he ""fell short of maintaining a positive climate throughout the Office of Legislative Affairs (OLA)"" and accepted responsibility for that shortfall, but said the report did not provide ""sufficient evidence by any legitimate legal standard to support a finding that I created a hostile work environment or that I made demeaning remarks about women,"" according to the IG.

""The Marine Corps takes all allegations of misconduct seriously, regardless of rank,"" Marine Corps spokesman Maj. Brian Block told ABC News in a statement on Wednesday. ""The Marine Corps is currently reviewing the DoD IG's report and will take appropriate action in light of the substantiated misconduct.""

""The Marine Corps expects every Marine, uniformed and civilian -- and particularly those in leadership positions -- to hold themselves to the highest standards in their personal and professional conduct. When Marines fall short of our standards they are held accountable,"" he said.

Sgt. Joseph Johnson/U.S. Department of Defense

The IG interviewed over three dozen witnesses and reviewed 11,650 official emails, along with other relevant documents before determining, according to the report, that ""on numerous occasions ... Cooling’s comments and conduct demeaned, bullied, and humiliated his subordinates.""

Among the details of the report:

""BGen Cooling told a female [non commissioned officer] who aspires to be a Marine Corps pilot that he would rather have his daughter work in a brothel than be a pilot.""

""He loudly and publicly berated two staff members whom he accused of trying to 'f**k' him and asked them repeatedly, 'Where the f**k have you been?'""

""He publicly yelled to a staff member that if the staff member did not give him requested budget information he would castrate the staff member.""

""In a staff meeting, he bullied a staff officer when he publicly berated, belittled, and singled her out for ridicule in front of her peers when a Member of Congress canceled a meeting with the Assistant Commandant. He then told his entire staff in the same meeting that if any of them failed to get an office call for the Assistant Commandant with a Member of Congress, he was 'going to jump out this f**king window.'""

""He bullied a subordinate when he attempted to damage her reputation by spreading a rumor about her and potentially damaging her future career by warning the most senior Marine Corps officer in the subordinate’s career field, 'watch yourself, you’ve got to watch out' for her. BGen Cooling further blamed the subordinate for the SASC complaint against him, his removal from the Legislative Assistant position, and this investigation into his conduct.""

Cooling further told the IG that the report ""can only legitimately establish that I made a few isolated comments that some construed in the worst possible way and told third parties so that they ended up in the [SASC complaint].""

""At no time during that brief assignment, nor at any other time during my career, did I ever discriminate against anyone for anything other than their performance,"" he said in the report.

Cooling graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1986 and has deployed multiple times to Iraq and Afghanistan throughout his military career."
Chaos within the EPA exposes Americans to toxins like asbestos,https://thehill.com,[],06-21-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/449756-chaos-within-the-epa-exposes-americans-to-toxins-like-asbestos,"Three years ago, there was bipartisan euphoria when President Obama signed the Frank L. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (LCSA) into law. The updated Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) finally gave the EPA regulatory authority to protect Americans from dangerous toxic substances like asbestos, a known human carcinogen. During the pen signing ceremony, Obama said the much-needed legislation was a crucial step forward, remarking, ""The [old] system was so complex, it was so burdensome that our country hasn't even been able to uphold a ban on asbestos.""

The ongoing battle for chemical safety reform continues.

For many, President Trump Donald John TrumpThe global economy is a soap opera, expect some plot twists Huawei sues US government over seized equipment Trump defends planned ICE deportations MORE’s EPA has been problematic from the get-go. The path for TSCA implementation has and was put in jeopardy when Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott PruittChaos within the EPA exposes Americans to toxins like asbestos How EPA Administrator Wheeler completely misinterprets science The Memo: Can Trump run as an outsider? MORE, former Oklahoma attorney general, was confirmed as the EPA Administrator.

Met with confrontation, Pruitt’s regulatory rollbacks and ethics violations forced him to resign 12 months after his Senate confirmation. Pruitt wasn’t alone. Many who formerly worked at American Chemistry Council (ACC) now hold high-level EPA positions. Most notably, Nancy Beck, was selected to head the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention (OCSPP). Overseeing the toxic chemical unit, Beck carried out Trump’s seeming pro-industry agenda. The revolving doors continue as Beck now heads to the White House's National Economic Council.

The EPA attempted to ban asbestos in 1989, but was sued by Corrosion Proof Fittings, a company that used asbestos in their products. In 1991, an appeals court overturned the ban, resulting in a failure to ban the deadly chemical through TSCA.

Nearly 70 countries have already banned asbestos, but sadly, three years after Obama signed LCSA into law, U.S. asbestos imports, use, and deaths continue. Each year, nearly 40,000 Americans die from preventable asbestos-caused diseases such as lung cancer, mesothelioma, cancer of the larynx and ovary and asbestosis (fibrosis of the lungs). For each life lost, a shattered family is left behind.

For more than a century, asbestos has been confirmed to cause suffering and deaths. The EPA has failed to protect public health and the environment by banning asbestos. Without a ban, asbestos remains lethal and legal today and can be found in consumer products, cosmetics, automotive products, and building materials.

The chlor-alkali industry is the primary asbestos importer and user of raw asbestos for the manufacturing of industrial chlorine and caustic soda. Knowing that there is no safe or controlled use, it’s incredulous that asbestos imports actually surged last year. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the chlor-alkali industry imported 750 metric tons of raw asbestos from Brazil and Russia.

The late Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) fought hard for meaningful chemical reform, and TSCA is on track to fail, again. The EPA’s present asbestos evaluation excludes the risk of asbestos in millions of homes, schools, and offices. Furthermore, industry-friendly rules like the “significant new use” rule (SNUR) is just another attempt to negate asbestos risk.

Trump has long been fascinated with asbestos, and said once on Twitter, “If we didn't remove incredibly powerful fire retardant asbestos & replace it with junk that doesn't work, the World Trade Center would never have burned down.”

DoJ Sues to Block Merger of Country's Two Biggest Printers,https://www.publishersweekly.com,['Jim Milliot'],,,,https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/industry-deals/article/80515-doj-sues-to-block-quad-purchase-of-lsc.html,"The Department of Justice filed a civil antitrust lawsuit Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois seeking to block Quad’s proposed acquisition of LSC Communications. Last fall, Quad announced its intention of acquiring LSC, a move that would unite the country’s two largest printers.

The DoJ said it was filing the suit “to preserve competition in the markets for magazine, catalog, and book printing services in the United States.” In 2018, Quad had revenue of about $4.2 billion. That same year, LSC's sales were $3.8 billion. The numbers put both companies far ahead of any competitors. According to the DoJ complaint, if the acquisition goes through, publishers and retailers “would be denied the benefits of competition that has spurred lower prices, improved quality, and greater printing output.”

“If this deal were allowed to proceed, Quad would dominate the markets for magazine, catalog, and book printing services and be able to raise prices and reduce quality at the expense of publishers, retailers, and, ultimately, American consumers,” said Makan Delrahim, assistant attorney general in the antitrust division, in a statement.

Quad fired back at the lawsuit, noting, among other things, that neither Quad nor LSC has as much as a 5% share of the overall printing market. “We are fully committed to defending the DoJ’s lawsuit in court,” said Joel Quadracci, chairman, president and CEO of Quad in a statement. “We believe the combination of Quad and LSC is the best outcome for all stakeholders and that the DoJ’s attempt to stop the transaction will unfavorably impact our clients, our employees, and the print industry.”

Quadracci further noted that the merger with LSC “will create a highly efficient print manufacturing and distribution platform that will strengthen the role of print in an increasingly multichannel media world that is dominated by digital advertising.” He questioned why the DoJ would seek to block Quad’s purchase of LSC when it has done nothing to address the growing market power of the tech giants.

While the U.S. printing market generates about $76 billion in aggregate annual revenue, Google and Facebook alone have worldwide digital ad sales revenues totaling more than $75 billion, Quadracci said. And while the tech giants are growing, many of the printing industry’s largest customers are downsizing, or have gone out of business, thanks to the loss of advertising dollars to digital competitors. If the printing industry is to survive, Quadracci went on, it needs to continue to consolidate in order to form more efficient companies.

The lawsuit could put the merger in jeopardy, even if the case doesn't make it to court. According to the terms of the acquisition, either Quad or LSC can terminate the merger if the transaction is not completed by October 30, or if there is a final, non-appealable order preventing the transaction. In this case, Quad will be required to pay LSC a “regulatory approval reverse termination fee” of $45 million."
"DHS cancels some Global Entry appointments as summer travel heats up, citing border crush",https://www.cnn.com,['Geneva Sands'],06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/20/politics/global-entry-canceled-appointments-resources-border/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Department of Homeland Security has had to cancel some Global Entry appointments as the summer travel season heats up as it transfers people to help at the southern border, a department official tells CNN.

Global Entry is a Customs and Border Protection program that ""allows expedited clearance for pre-approved, low-risk travelers upon arrival"" in the US. The Trusted Traveler Programs website , which includes Global Entry, already has an alert warning applicants that the ""extended partial government shutdown has resulted in a backlog,"" of applications and renewals.

The personnel shift comes amid a swell of migrant families and children that have arrived at the US border this year. The influx has strained DHS immigration resources and caused concerns about overcrowding and delayed US Border Patrol processing.

In response to efforts at the border, ""CBP is temporarily reducing staff at Global Entry Enrollment Centers nationwide and reassigning them to support frontline traveler processing during the busy summer months,"" Customs and Border Protection said in a statement.

""Regrettably, this situation has forced the cancellation of some scheduled appointments and may make it difficult to schedule an immediate interview,"" the statement said.

"State Department identifies 23 violations, 'multiple security incidents' concerning Clinton emails",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hillary-clinton-emails-state-department-violations-security-incidents,"The State Department revealed Monday that it has identified ""multiple security incidents"" involving current or former employees' handling of Hillary Clinton's emails, and that 23 ""violations"" and seven ""infractions"" have been issued as part of the department's ongoing investigation.

The information came in a letter to Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, who is responsible for overseeing the security review.

""To this point, the Department has assessed culpability to 15 individuals, some of whom were culpable in multiple security incidents,"" Mary Elizabeth Taylor, the State Department's Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of Legislative Affairs, wrote to Grassley. ""DS has issued 23 violations and 7 infractions incidents. ... This number will likely change as the review progresses.""

ATTEMPT TO HACK CLINTON EMAILS STUNNED AIDES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, DOCS SHOW

President Trump highlighted the finding in a tweet overnight, questioning whether Democrats would investigate and saying, ""This is really big.""

The State Department, calling the matter ""serious,"" said it expected to conclude the investigation by Sept. 1. The department acknowledged that the probe was unusually time-consuming.

""Given the volume of emails provided to the Department from former Secretary Clinton's private email server, the Department's process has been necessarily more complicated and complex requiring a significant dedication of time and resources,"" Taylor wrote.

Taylor also noted that disciplinary consequences were pending.

""In every instance in which the Department found an individual to be culpable of a valid security violation or three or more infractions, the Department forwarded the outcome to the Bureau of Diplomatic Security's Office of Personnel Security and Suitability (DS/PSS), to be placed in the individuals' official security file,"" Taylor wrote. ""All valid security incidents are reviewed by DS and taken into account every time an individual's eligibility for access to classified information is considered.

""This referral occurred whether or not the individual was currently employed with the Department of State and such security files are kept indefinitely,"" Taylor added. ""Consistent with the referral policy, for individuals who were still employed with the Department at the time of adjudication, the Department referred all valid security violations or multiple infractions to the Bureau of Human Resources.""

The State Department declined to release the names of the employees, consistent with its procedures. The department promised another update once its review is completed.

NEWLY RELEASED EMAILS SHOW CLINTON TEAM DISCUSSING 'PRIVATE' COMMS CHANNEL WITH ISRAEL

Clinton's private email use has remained in the spotlight, as the DOJ looks into potential misconduct in the handling of federal authorities' surveillance and intelligence operations in 2016. Then-FBI Director James Comey said in 2016 that Clinton's handling of classified information was ""extremely careless"" -- remarks that were watered down from their original draft -- but that ""no reasonable prosecutor"" would bring charges.

It emerged earlier this year that then-FBI general counsel James Baker testified that he thought Clinton should have been prosecuted until he was convinced otherwise ""pretty late"" in the investigation.

And, last month, a trove of partially redacted FBI documents from the agency's investigation into whether Clinton mishandled classified information -- a probe known as the ""Midyear Exam"" -- revealed that top Clinton aides were shocked at apparent attempts to hack her private email servers.

The document release revealed numerous episodes in which the Clinton team either suspected it had been hacked or seemingly acknowledged that security measures had come up short.

""omg,"" top Clinton aide Huma Abedin wrote to Justin Cooper, the technology pro overseeing Clinton's private home-based email servers, when he told her shortly after midnight on Jan. 9, 2011, that ""someone was trying to hack us.""

And in March, it was revealed that the Justice Department ""negotiated"" an agreement with Clinton's legal team that ensured the FBI did not have access to emails on her private servers relating to the Clinton Foundation. Former FBI Agent Peter Strzok testified about the arrangement during a closed-door appearance before the House Judiciary Committee last summer, according to a transcript released this year.

""A significant filter team"" was employed at the FBI, Strzok said, to ""work through the various terms of the various consent agreements."" Limitations imposed on agents' searches included date ranges and names of domains and people, Strzok said, among other categories.

The agreement was reached, Strzok said, because ""according to the attorneys, we lacked probable cause to get a search warrant for those servers and projected that either it would take a very long time and/or it would be impossible to get to the point where we could obtain probable cause to get a warrant.""

Former Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who chaired the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee until 2017 and is now a Fox News contributor, said the arrangement signaled that agents wanted willful blindness.

""What's bizarre about this, is in any other situation, there's no possible way they would allow the potential perpetrator to self-select what the FBI gets to see,"" Chaffetz said, noting that the FBI was aware that the servers contained classified information in unclassified settings. ""The FBI should be the one to sort through those emails -- not the Clinton attorneys.""

The DOJ's goal, Chaffetz said, was to ""make sure they hear no evil, see no evil -- they had no interest in pursuing the truth."""

He Is A Graduate Of University Of North Texas.']",,,,https://www.housingwire.com/articles/49393-ginnie-mae-removes-loandepots-va-loan-restrictions,"After nearly six months of being restricted from participating in some of Ginnie Mae’s mortgage bond programs as part of the agency’s crackdown on lenders for Department of Veterans Affairs loan churning, loanDepot is back in the game.

Ginnie Mae announced Friday that it has removed the mortgage bond restrictions it placed on loanDepot earlier this year.

Back in January, Ginnie Mae limited loanDepot to Ginnie Mae II custom pools for VA single-family guaranteed loans after the agency found that loanDepot’s prepayment speeds on VA loans may have been out of sync with the rest of the industry.

The government’s investigation into VA loan churning began nearly two years ago when the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Ginnie Mae, and the VA began looking into whether certain lenders are aggressively targeting service members and military veterans for quick and potentially risky refinances of their mortgages.

The investigation led to some lenders being booted from Ginnie Mae’s primary mortgage securities platforms, and other lenders, like loanDepot, being restricted for questionable conduct.

Ginnie Mae, like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, is a mortgage bond issuer, but focuses specifically on securitizing pools of government-backed mortgages insured by the VA, the Federal Housing Administration, and other agencies, so issues related to refinancing VA loans would affect Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities.

But now, loanDepot has apparently addressed its practices and Ginnie Mae is satisfied that the lender has things under control.

Therefore, loanDepot is now allowed to participate in the Ginnie Mae I and Ginnie Mae II multi-issuer securities programs.

“The removal of such a restriction is based on the Issuer having demonstrated to Ginnie Mae’s satisfaction that (a) its prepayment speeds are substantially in-line with those of equivalent multi-Issuer cohorts, and (b) such improved performance is sustainable,” the agency said in a statement.

According to the agency, loanDepot is eligible to participate in all bond programs for loans effective for July 1, 2019, issuance.

""While we were disappointed with Ginnie’s original decision, we have partnered with Ginnie Mae in an open and transparent fashion to be able to return to full participation in multiple issuer pools,"" loanDepot Chief Capital Markets Officer Jeff DerGurahian said in a statement. ""However, most importantly, despite the restrictions, we have remained steadfast in our commitment to serve the Veteran community and have never wavered in proudly serving United States Veterans fairly and responsibly.""

Mr. Shanahan, a former Boeing executive who had been serving as the acting defense secretary, announced his resignation as an F.B.I. background investigation, conducted on all cabinet nominees, was continuing because of incidents of family violence.

Mr. Shanahan’s ex-wife had accused him of punching her in the stomach, which Mr. Shanahan has denied. He said his ex-wife started the fight, and his spokesman said she was arrested and charged with domestic violence. The charges were eventually dropped.

Mr. Trump named Mark T. Esper, the secretary of the Army and a former Raytheon executive, to take over as acting secretary of defense.

Though yields rose on the week's final day of trading, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note posted a 4-basis-point decline for the week as it hovered around 2.06%. The 10-year yield fell below 2% for the first time since 2016 on Thursday.

The 2-year Treasury note yield rose slightly on Friday to about 1.76%.

Trump EPA rolls back Obama’s coal crackdown,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Alex Pappas', 'Alex Pappas Is A Politics Reporter At Foxnews.Com.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-epa-rolls-back-obamas-coal-crackdown,"Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler on Wednesday finalized the agency’s plan for replacing Obama-era regulations on emissions from coal-fired power plants, part of a long-running effort by the Trump administration to roll back environmental rules.

TRUMP EPA OVERHAULS OBAMA-ERA REGULATIONS FOR COAL-FIRED POWER PLANTS

While the Obama administration and Democrats saw the Clean Power Plan as a crucial component in international efforts to curb global warming, Republicans have long claimed those regulations went too far and were too costly. From the start of President Trump’s administration, his Environmental Protection Agency has been working to overhaul the program, which was halted by the Supreme Court in 2016 before going into effect.

During a press conference, Wheeler formally signed the Affordable Clean Energy Rule, which would give individual states wide discretion to decide whether to require limited efficiency upgrades at individual coal-fired power plants. Wheeler said the changes are being made because ""the American public elected a president with a better approach.""

The ACE rule, once fully implemented, allows states to select their own energy plans. States will be given three years to submit the plan and the EPA will have 12 months to approve it. Wheeler called it a sign that ""fossil fuels will continue to be an important part of the mix"" in the U.S. energy supply.

In remarks, he also contrasted the ACE rule with proposals being pushed by left-wing politicians, like New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

""The contrast between our approach and the Green New Deal, or plans like it, couldn't be clearer,"" Wheeler said. ""Rather than Washington telling Americans what type of energy they can use, or how they can travel, or even what they can eat, we are working cooperatively with the states to provide affordable, dependable, and diverse supply of energy that continues to get cleaner and more efficient.""

Democrats and environmentalists ripped the move. The rule will go into effect shortly after publication in the Federal Register, but court challenges are expected.

New York Attorney General Letitia James said Tuesday she plans to sue the EPA over the rule. ""This is yet another prime example of this administration's attempt to rollback critical regulations that will have devastating impacts on both the safety & health of our nation,"" the Democrat tweeted.

Joseph Goffman, an EPA official under President Barack Obama, said he feared that the Trump administration was trying to set a legal precedent that the Clean Air Act gives the federal government ""next to no authority to do anything"" about climate-changing emissions from the country's power grid.

The Obama rule, adopted in 2015, sought to reshape the country's power system by encouraging utilities to rely less on dirtier-burning coal-fired power plants and more on electricity from natural gas, solar, wind and other lower or no-carbon sources.

Supporters of the revised rule say the Obama-era plan overstepped the EPA's authority.

""The Clean Power Plan was designed largely to put coal out of business,"" said Mandy Gunasekara, a former senior official at the EPA who helped write the replacement rule.

Trump's overhaul is meant to let states ""figure out what is best for their mission in terms of meeting modern environmental standards"" and providing affordable energy, she said.

With coal miners at his side, Trump signed an order in March 2017 directing the EPA to scrap the Obama rule. It was one of the first acts of his presidency.

REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz/File Photo

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration has no plans to cap H-1B work visas for nations that force foreign companies to store data locally, the State Department said on Thursday.

Reuters reported on Wednesday that the United States had told India it was considering restricting the H-1B visa programs for countries with the data storage requirement. The H-1B program issues U.S. visas to skilled foreign workers.

“The Trump Administration has no plans to place caps on H-1B work visas for nations that force foreign companies to store data locally,” a State Department spokeswoman said in a statement in response to the Reuters article.

While an administration’s “Buy American Hire American” executive order calls for a broad review of U.S. worker visa programs, including the H-1B program, it was not targeted at a specific country, the spokeswoman said.

It is “completely separate from our ongoing discussions with India about the importance of ensuring the free flow of data across borders,” the spokeswoman added.

Earlier on Thursday, India said it was in talks with the United States on H-1B visas, but foreign ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar told a news conference: “We have not heard anything officially from the U.S. government” on capping such permits for Indians.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is scheduled to visit New Delhi next week for talks that will include areas of disagreement between the two countries over trade.

Two senior Indian officials told Reuters on Wednesday they had been briefed last week on a U.S. plan to cap the number of H-1B visas given annually to Indians at between 10% and 15% of the total number issued.

There is no country-specific limit on the 85,000 H-1B work visas the United States issues every year, and an estimated 70% of them go to Indians."

The U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee voted Wednesday to approve his nomination, sending it next to the full U.S. Senate for final approval. The only committee nay vote came from Sen. Jacky Rosen, a Democrat from Nevada.

Edgar, 52, was nominated for the job by President Donald Trump.

Last year, Edgar was part of a contingent of elected officials from Southern California who were invited to the White House to discuss immigration. Since then, Edgar has been invited back to the White House. He’s also become a familiar face on Fox News, where he discussed his city’s vote to opt-out of a controversial California law that limits cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities.

Wednesday’s vote came with no discussion. At a hearing earlier this month Edgar testified that his background heading two companies in Orange County prepared him for the DHS job.

“I have spent over 30 years working for more than 40 Fortune 500 and Global 1000 companies as an executive and as an adviser across many industries, including aerospace/defense, government and technology,” Edgar told the committee.

Edgar has two companies: a management consultancy, Global Conductor Inc, which has some 40 employees, and Global Conductor Construction Corporation, a 35-employee construction business that specializes in installing underground technology for the telecommunications industry in Southern California. Edgar told the committee that his experience includes work in several areas of finance, accounting, budget management and regulatory compliance.

Edgar also suggested his beliefs about immigration are nuanced.

In a statement he read to the committee last week, Edgar spoke about his wife, Betty Sarkis, a teacher at La Quinta High School in Westminster. An Iranian immigrant whose family fled to the U.S. after the Shah was overthrown in 1979, Troy Edgar said “she embodies the American dream in a manner that enables me to understand the hopes and aspirations of millions of people who come to America.”

The issue of immigration, and how the government should treat people coming into the country, was key to the public debate in Los Alamitos last year when Edgar supported a move by Councilman Warren Kusumoto to have their city opt-out of the California sanctuary laws. The council’s 4-1 vote last April set off a flurry of anti-sanctuary resolutions and other actions by cities and counties across California.

Most of the measures passed after Los Alamitos’ vote were city resolutions, which have little weight were widely viewed as symbolic. But Los Alamitos passed a law to ignore the state law, a move that prompted the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California to file a lawsuit against the city. Separately, the City of Huntington Beach sued the state over the sanctuary law, and won, in a case that is now on appeal.

In his testimony last week, Edgar said he “believe(s) in public service and in answering the call of our great country.” If chosen for the job, he said he would “continue (the department’s) critical mission, maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of available resources, and protect taxpayer dollars.”

Cooking outdoors is challenging, especially during the summer. Be sure to follow these steps to food safety to prepare for the occasion!

The summer months are the perfect excuse to spend time at the beach. The best memories in my childhood are with my family enjoying a day at the beach grilling. My parents organized every detail of the trip but looking back and knowing what I know now about food safety, our beach grilling fun could have easily been spoiled with bacteria that could have made us sick.

There are always challenges when cooking outdoors, but a little bit of preparation can have you basking in the sun, enjoying some well-deserved beach time with the family.

Before Firing Up the Beach - Grill

Make sure local ordinances allow grilling activities. If yes…it’s time to pack!

Only pack the amount of food you will consume to avoid leftovers.

Season your favorite meats, poultry or seafood at home before packing them for the trip. Remember to wash your hands before handling the raw items and in between spice containers when seasoning.

Pack perishable foods directly from the refrigerator or freezer into the cooler.

Be sure to keep raw meat and poultry tightly wrapped and store them at the bottom of the cooler. This will help keep any running juices away from cooked foods or foods meant to be eaten raw (e.g. fruits, veggies, salsas, guacamole or bean salad).

Pack the drinks in a separate cooler so the food cooler is not opened frequently.

A full cooler will maintain its cold temperatures longer than one that is partially filled. If you still have space in your portable cooler, pack it full with more ice.

Don’t forget to bring moist towelettes and the food thermometer!

Keeping Food Safe Ashore

Once you arrive at the beach, partially bury your portable cooler in the sand, cover it with blankets or towels, and shade it under a tree or with a beach umbrella.

Do not open the lid of your cooler containing perishable foods unless necessary. This will keep perishable foods colder for a longer time.

Don't leave any perishables sitting out in the hot sun for more than 2 hours (1 hour when the temperature is above 90 °F).

Start setting up your grill and get it clean before bringing the food out.

Clean your hands before placing any foods on the grill.

Beach - Grill Time

Make sure your grilled items are safe to eat by using a food thermometer and checking to see if they reached the right minimum internal temperatures: Beef, pork, lamb and veal (steaks, roasts and chops): 145°F with a three-minute rest. Fish: 145°F Ground beef, veal, lamb, or pork burgers: 160°F. Poultry (whole or ground): 165°F.

Serve all your delicious food using clean plates and utensils.

Remember: Clean your hands before starting to eat!

If you have a question about food safety for your summer activities, call 1-888-MPHotline (1-888-674-6854). Hours of operation are 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday, ET.

Carter'],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/19/us-treasury-calls-for-mandatory-financial-education-for-students.html,"The U.S. Department of the Treasury released a new report on behalf of the Financial Literacy and Education Commission that recommends mandatory financial literacy courses for college students.

With the cost of college rising faster than incomes and a staggering 44 million Americans owing more than $1.5 trillion in student loans, there has been growing concern that students and their families are taking on debt without truly understanding the long-term impact.

﻿Indeed, there is a lot of research exploring this national problem: Nine out of 10 parents and students failed a 2018 quiz about student loan debt. Meanwhile, MarketWatch reported that half of college students taking an AIG survey on personal finance basics got two or fewer questions correct. And in a recent survey from the Brookings Institution, less than 30% of student respondents could correctly answer three questions on inflation, interest and risk diversification.

""Helping students and their families avoid the pitfalls associated with financing higher education, and empowering them to make optimal financial choices, should be a priority of all institutions of higher education,"" the report reads. ﻿"
USDA moves prevent plant harvest date to September 1st,https://www.ksfy.com,['Sam Wright'],,,,https://www.ksfy.com/content/news/USDA-Moves-prevent-plant-harvest-date-to-September-1st-511606771.html,"This year has been historically tough for South Dakota's AG industry thanks to above normal precipitation, but the USDA adjusted a federal aid package announced by President Trump a month ago which required farmers to plant cover crop on prevent plant acres by November first. It initially received mixed criticism because South Dakota is notorious for unpredictable, and usually harsh weather. Dave Poppens works with beans, corn, has a feed lot, and knows the natural challenge he is tasked with overcoming every year; which is why a change in dates helps level the playing field with states in more manageable climates.

""November we could have a foot of snow on the ground, so it makes a big difference in this part of the country,"" Poppens said.

The move has received support from many of South Dakota’s state leaders including Governor Kristi Noem, Congressman Dusty Johnson, and Senator John Thune.

""I have been advocating for this common sense change for months. You don't have to talk to more than two producers in South Dakota that waiting until November the first to allow them to either graze or mechanically harvest cover crops without an indemnity reduction on their prevent acres is far too late,” Senator Thune said.

There is another component of this, producers will also have the flexibility to allow cattle to graze on cover crop areas. The wet season has diminished forage options for a lot of operations.

""Now you can plan on things,” said South Dakota Cattlemen’s Association president Steve Ollerich.

“You can't plan for November first. We could have a blizzard October 10 or 15 and it'd be all covered up with snow.""

It may not be perfect, but it has changed farmers' plans to salvage what they can from a very wet"
