"Gregg Jarrett: Comey's FBI was running a secret counterintelligence operation against Trump, new docs show",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Jarrett', 'Gregg Jarrett Is A Fox News Legal Analyst', 'Commentator', 'Formerly Worked As A Defense Attorney', 'Adjunct Law Professor. He Is The Author Of The No. New York Times Best-Selling Book']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/gregg-jarrett-comey-fbi-counterintelligence-operation-trump,"Newly obtained documents confirm that James Comey’s FBI was running a secret and corrupt counterintelligence operation against the Trump campaign in the summer of 2016 and repeatedly deceiving the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) thereafter in order to wiretap a Trump campaign associate.

The disclosure was the result of a federal lawsuit and a year of litigation. Despite efforts by FBI Director Christopher Wray to obstruct, a federal court issued an order that forced the FBI and Department of Justice to produce the records known as “302 reports.” They are a summary of interviews FBI agents conducted with Bruce Ohr, a top DOJ official.

These 302s show that the FBI and DOJ were warned repeatedly by Ohr that ex-British spy Christopher Steele was virulently biased against the target of their investigation, Trump.

EX-FBI DEPUTY DIRECTOR ANDREW MCCABE SUES DOJ OVER DISMISSAL

That bias tainted the credibility of the “dossier” Steele composed and upon which officials in the Obama administration relied when they officially launched their counterintelligence investigation on July 31, 2016. The “dossier” was also the basis for the surveillance warrant against former Trump campaign adviser, Carter Page.

The FBI and DOJ ignored the warnings of bias and actively concealed it from the FISC. They never advised the judges that the information contained in the “dossier” was “unverified.”

They hid from the judges that it was all funded by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC).

The court was never told that Ohr’s wife helped cultivate some of the researched used against Trump. Having fired Steele for leaking to the media and lying about it, the FBI and DOJ represented to the judge that Steele was “reliable” when they knew he was not. They continued to rely on him months after his termination.

An apparent fraud was perpetrated on the court not once, but four times in successive warrants through June of 2017. These are dishonest, if not felonious acts.

Secret Meetings

On July 5, 2016, Comey stood before television cameras and microphones at a nationally watched news conference.

By mangling the law and contorting the facts, he announced that he was exonerating Hillary Clinton of any crimes for her mishandling of thousands of classified documents.

At roughly the same time, some 3,660 miles away from Washington, Comey’s FBI was meeting in a London building with Steele who conveyed the contents of his initial “dossier” memo dated June 20, 2016, with agent Michael Gaeta. When the FBI agent read the document, he was stunned and remarked, “I have to report this to headquarters.” Thus, on the same day, Comey cleared Clinton, the witch hunt against Trump began in earnest.

On July 30 Steele met with Ohr at 9 a.m. at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington.

Steele shared his “dossier” but added that the FBI already had it in its possession.

Immediately thereafter, Ohr convened a meeting with FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and the FBI lawyer who worked for him directly, Lisa Page.

The 302 reports corroborate Ohr’s congressional testimony behind closed doors that was made public in February of this year.

He told lawmakers that he specifically warned McCabe and Page that the information in the “dossier” was highly dubious and driven by a biased author who despised Trump.

He also advised that it was commissioned by Fusion GPS where his wife worked because, “I wanted the FBI to be aware of any possible bias.”

Page 125 of Ohr’s congressional transcript is especially revealing. “I told them that Steele was desperate that Donald Trump not get elected,” he stated.

He pointedly informed McCabe and Page that Trump’s political rival, the Clinton campaign, was financially underwriting the “dossier,” which would call into question its veracity because the campaign had a motive to distort or fabricate in order to damage its opponent.

Ohr testified that he cautioned the FBI, “These guys were hired by somebody relating to –who’s related to the Clinton campaign.”

In truth, the funding wasn’t merely “related” to the campaign, it was the campaign, along with the DNC. Ohr also disseminated the “dossier” to Peter Strzok and Joe Pientka at the FBI. But Ohr wasn’t done.

Shortly after the July 30 breakfast with Steele, Ohr gave the same improbable intelligence to three prosecutors at the Justice Department during another meeting.

Two of those individuals, Andrew Weissmann and Zainab Ahmad, were later hired by Robert Mueller to be a part of his assembled team of special counsel prosecutors that escalated the investigation of Trump beyond the FBI and DOJ. They, too, were informed by Ohr that the Clinton campaign and Democrats had paid for the “dossier” and that Steele was severely biased against Trump.

Instead of investigating Clinton and her confederates for conspiring with foreigners to defraud the U.S. government or violate campaign finance laws, the FBI used the Clinton-Russian “dossier” to target Trump despite a dearth of evidence that any of it was true.

Information Laundering Scheme

Even though Steele was fired by the FBI as a confidential informant, the new 302 reports confirm that Comey’s FBI kept returning him as a source. By using Ohr as a conduit, they continued to receive information from Steele.

This continued even after Trump was elected and inaugurated as president. Indeed, Steele kept feeding the bureau his phony information through May of 2017.

To circumvent the rules they were breaking, the FBI set up an “information laundering scheme.” Steele would feed information to Ohr, who would pass it to his “handler” Joe Pienka, who would feed it to his partner Peter Strzok, who would give it to Andrew McCabe, who would deliver it to Comey.

Similar to a “money-laundering scheme,” the complex transfer cleansed the dirty information to obscure the original source –Steele. But the information, of course, was largely fabricated and/or the product of Russian disinformation.

It should be remembered that a counterintelligence investigation is designed to collect evidence of foreign threats to U.S. national security. Normally, the president is the beneficiary of such information.

Here, Comey’s FBI was abusing its counterintelligence authority by using it against Trump. Moreover, Comey appears to have been lying to the president about it.

In early 2017, he kept assuring Trump he was not being investigated. These documents show that he obviously was, well into his presidency. And yet, the FBI had no evidence that corroborated any of Steele’s “collusion” allegations.

As John Solomon of the Hill has reported, the FBI developed a “spread-sheet like document” that was 90 percent empty of any proof. This did not deter them. They continued to investigate Trump. And when Comey was fired, he helped engineer part two of the witch hunt --the special counsel investigation.

Always.

""For the last 3 years I have fully supported this President,"" tweeted the former White House communications director about his onetime boss and longtime friend. ""Recently he has said things that divide the country in a way that is unacceptable. So I didn't pass the 100% litmus test. Eventually he turns on everyone and soon it will be you and then the entire country.""

""Eventually he turns on everyone.""

That might seem like an exaggeration made by a disgruntled former friend. It's not. For a man whose life has been defined, in large part, by his open embrace of his inconsistencies and contradictions, one of the very few things Donald Trump has been consistent about is that he goes from love to loathing quickly. If you are close to him (unless you are a member of his immediate family) you are on the clock. It's only a matter of time before he tires of you -- and turns on you.

Consider these names (and this is far from a complete list): Michael Cohen, Omarosa Manigault Newman, Rex Tillerson, James Mattis, Jeff Sessions, Steve Bannon, John Kelly, Paul Ryan, Cliff Sims, Donald McGahn, Chris Christie and Scaramucci.

It’s kinda nice, you know? After all these years he can still keep the relationship fresh.”

Whether Colbert clobbering Trump like Moe on Curly is “fresh” is in the ear of the beholden, he was at it again tonight. The topic du jour was POTUS retweeting conspiracy theories about the late, unlamented Jeffrey Epstein. The wealthy financial/accused sex trafficker died Friday of an apparent suicide at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan. Federal invesigations are underway.

Colbert said Epstein’s death has “set off a wild wave of conspiracy theories online, the sort of stuff that only unstable, tinfoil-hat loons could possibly believe. So Donald Trump…” — he paused to let the crowd have a punchline-free guffaw — “a few hours after Epstein’s body was found, Trump shared a tweet and a video that claimed without any evidence that former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton were responsible for Epstein’s death.” The host was reading from a CNN story.

“Really? Really?” Colbert continued. “Masterminding a scheme to assassinate a high-profile prisoner in maximum-security federal custody? They couldn’t even mastermind a visit to Wisconsin.”

Trump Administration Seeks Decertification Of Immigration Judges' Union,https://www.npr.org,['Richard Gonzales'],08-12-2019,2019,8,https://www.npr.org/2019/08/12/750656176/trump-administration-seeks-decertification-of-immigration-judges-union,"Trump Administration Seeks Decertification Of Immigration Judges' Union

Enlarge this image toggle caption Susan Walsh/AP Susan Walsh/AP

The Justice Department late last week moved to seek the decertification of the union representing hundreds of U.S. immigration judges, ratcheting up a simmering battle over the Trump administration's immigration enforcement policies.

The department filed a petition Friday asking the Federal Labor Relations Authority to determine whether the certification of National Association of Immigration Judges as the union representing some 440 immigration judges should be revoked ""because the bargaining unit members are management officials under the statutory definition,"" according to a Justice Department spokesperson.

""This is nothing more than a desperate attempt by the DOJ to evade transparency and accountability, and undermine the decisional independence of the nation's 440 Immigration Judges,"" Judge Ashley Tabaddor, speaking in her capacity as president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, said in an emailed statement. ""We are trial court judges who make decisions on the basis of case specific facts and the nation's immigration laws. We do not set policies, and we don't manage staff.""

The administration and the immigration judges union have been at loggerheads over a variety of issues, including the judges' status as employees of the Justice Department. Judges are appointed by the attorney general and they are not part of the independent judiciary. They have publicly argued for their separation from the Justice Department.

Last year, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions took the unusual step of reviewing some judicial decisions in the name of reducing the backlog of hundreds of thousands of cases clogging the courts.

Sessions also ordered judges to end the practice of temporarily removing cases from their dockets without issuing decisions, a move known as ""administrative closure.""

The Justice Department also imposed a quota system on judges, linking the number of cleared cases to their performance evaluations. The judges' union said the courts need more immigration judges, not assembly-line proceedings.

President Trump has appointed 190 immigration judges since taking office. As of June 2019, there are more than 900,000 pending cases in immigration courts, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.

The move to decertify the immigration judges' union comes as no surprise to many judges.

""Clearly they want to use the judges to ramrod through cases and ramp up deportation regardless of any due process defects their policies have,"" said one judge who isn't authorized to speak for the union and requested anonymity. Without the union, judges would be effectively muzzled and unable to publicly share their views about the courts, the judge added.

This is not the first time the Justice Department has tried to decertify the immigration judges' union. The Clinton administration sought decertification, but the Federal Labor Relations Authority rejected the notion that judges are managers who make policy. But some judges are concerned that the FLRA under the Trump administration would be less sympathetic to the union.

""It's absurd that anyone would consider us managers,"" said Tabaddor, a judge based in Los Angeles. ""We don't even have the authority to order pencils."""
Gutfeld: Trump's feud with Scaramucci shows he's the 'Al Davis of presidents',https://www.foxnews.com,['Charles Creitz'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-scaramucci-feud-gutfeld-al-davis,"President Trump's feud with Anthony Scaramucci is the latest example of the commander-in-chief's commitment to winning at all costs, according to Greg Gutfeld.

""Donald Trump is like the Al Davis of presidents,"" Gutfeld said Monday on ""The Five,"" referring to the iconic longtime principal owner of the Oakland Raiders. ""He had a singular motto, which was 'Just win, baby' -- he didn't care how. He attracted rough, scary and weird people -- that was the entire Oakland Raiders.""

SCARAMUCCI BREAKS WITH TRUMP, SAYS GOP MAY NEED 'CHANGE AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET'

Davis served as head coach-general manager of the Raiders in the 1960s and later was GM and principal owner until his death in 2011.

Of the comparison between Davis and Trump, the ""Greg Gutfeld Show"" host said he saw a similarity between the Raiders' choice of players and the individuals hired by the White House.

""You also get these weird third-stringers,"" he added, naming Scaramucci and former White House aide Omarosa Manigault-Newman -- who, post-termination, attacked Trump in a ""tell-all"" book.

""They get in under the guise of loyalty and then when it doesn't work out, they turn on you... He's like Omarosa.""

Earlier Monday, Scaramucci told CNN the president has a ""nihilistic way to his personality.""

""I think you have to consider a change at the top of the ticket when someone is acting like this,"" he told anchor John Berman.

After the televised remarks, Trump fired back on Twitter, claiming Scaramucci, who briefly served as White House director of communications in 2017, was upset at not being rehired.

""Scaramucci, who like so many others had nothing to do with my Election victory, is only upset that I didn’t want him back in the Administration (where he desperately wanted to be),"" Trump wrote.

""Also, I seldom had time to return his many calls to me. He just wanted to be on TV!"""
"Attorney general rips ‘failure’ of prison officials to keep Epstein alive, vows to investigate any co-conspirators",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Matt Zapotosky', 'National Security Reporter Covering The Justice Department', 'Devlin Barrett', 'Reporter Focusing On National Security', 'Law Enforcement', 'Rachel Weiner', 'Local Reporter Covering Federal Court In Alexandria', 'Va.', 'Local Court In Arlington', 'August At Pm']",08-12-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/attorney-general-rips-failure-of-prison-officials-to-keep-epstein-alive-vows-to-investigate-co-conspirators/2019/08/12/61e9c570-bd08-11e9-b873-63ace636af08_story.html,"Attorney General William P. Barr on Monday decried what he called a “failure” by federal detention center officials in New York to secure Jeffrey Epstein, pointing to unspecified “irregularities” there that preceded the wealthy sex offender’s apparent suicide while in government custody.

Barr’s comments underscored the increasing scrutiny on the Federal Bureau of Prisons and the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan, where Epstein, 66, was found hanging in his cell Saturday morning, according to officials familiar with the matter. The Bureau of Prisons is part of the Justice Department and falls under Barr’s authority, and he seemed to be blaming officials there for what happened.

The FBI and the Justice Department’s inspector general have been aggressively investigating Epstein’s death, focusing on apparent breakdowns of policy at the facility in the hours before staffers discovered him unresponsive.

[Epstein’s accusers call her his protector and procurer. Is Ghislaine Maxwell now prosecutors’ target?]

Barr made clear, too, that federal prosecutors’ investigation of those who might have facilitated Epstein’s alleged sex abuse of minors will continue, even if Epstein can no longer be prosecuted. Epstein was in jail awaiting a trial on new federal sex trafficking charges.

On Monday, ABC News showed footage of FBI and Customs and Border Protection personnel on the dock of a private island that Epstein owned.

“Let me assure you that this case will continue on against anyone who was complicit with Epstein,” Barr said. “Any co-conspirators should not rest easy. The victims deserve justice, and they will get it.”

Speaking to law enforcement officials in New Orleans, the country’s top law enforcement official said he “was appalled . . . and, frankly, angry” to learn of the Metropolitan Correctional Center’s “failure to adequately secure” Epstein.

“We are now learning of serious irregularities at this facility that are deeply concerning and demand a thorough investigation,” he said.

Barr did not specify what irregularities had been found in the aftermath of Epstein’s death but vowed to “get to the bottom of what happened,” adding, “There will be accountability.”

Lawmakers also demanded answers from federal officials. The Democratic and Republican leaders of the House Judiciary Committee on Monday addressed a letter to acting Bureau of Prisons director Hugh Hurwitz demanding answers to questions about Epstein’s time in federal detention and asserting that Epstein’s death “demonstrates severe miscarriages of or deficiencies in inmate protocol and has allowed the deceased to ultimately evade facing justice.”

The Bureau of Prisons declined to comment Monday.

[Corrections officers did not check on Epstein for hours before his death]

Those who say Epstein victimized them have long asserted that the politically connected multimillionaire was able to evade justice, and many were disappointed that he will now never answer for his crimes at a trial. It is possible that prosecutors — or those who claim to have been abused by Epstein — could sue for his considerable assets. But they will be pursuing his estate for financial compensation rather than the man himself for criminal wrongdoing.

Epstein was being held in a special housing unit of the Metropolitan Correctional Center and should have been checked on by the staff every 30 minutes. But corrections officers had not checked on Epstein for “several” hours before he was found around 6:30 a.m., when the staff were handing out breakfast to inmates, a person familiar with the matter said.

This person, like others interviewed for this report, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation.

Epstein, who had recently come off suicide watch, also should have had a cellmate, the person said. But a man who had been assigned to share a cell with Epstein was transferred Friday and — for reasons that investigators are exploring — Epstein did not get a new cellmate, a person familiar with the matter said Sunday night.

That left Epstein alone and unmonitored — at least in the hours before his death — by even those officers assigned to guard him.

Joel Sickler, a prison consultant hired by Epstein, said before Epstein’s death that his legal team had discussed trying to get him transferred to another jail. Prison consultants advise clients — often white-collar defendants — on how to navigate the bureaucracy and dangers of the prison system.

“He needed to be in a safer location, so we were taking measures to try to get him transferred out of the MCC,” Sickler said. But Sickler said that effort had reached only the discussion stage among the lawyers and that no request had been made to the Bureau of Prisons at the time of Epstein’s death.

“When you’re a high-profile defendant who’s identified as not only wealthy but a sex offender, you’re . . . basically a target in prison,” said Sickler, who added that Epstein had asked to be taken off suicide watch last month.

What happened between the transfer of Epstein’s cellmate and the moment he was discovered dead is now a key focus of investigators. Union officials said while video cameras are prevalent in the Metropolitan Correctional Center, they generally do not show inmates’ cells — meaning footage of precisely what happened to Epstein may not exist.

New York City Chief Medical Examiner Barbara Sampson said that Epstein’s autopsy was complete but that she had not reached a determination on the cause of death, “pending further information.” The medical examiner allowed Michael Baden, a private pathologist, to observe the autopsy at the request of Epstein’s representatives, Sampson said. Her office made no further public statements Monday.

Epstein was arrested July 6 after his private plane landed at New Jersey’s Teterboro Airport from Paris. He was charged with sexually abusing dozens of young girls in the early 2000s. From that point on, he never left federal custody. He tried — unsuccessfully — to be released to home confinement while he awaited a trial, but a judge rejected his request to do so. He was appealing that decision.

On July 23, Epstein was found in his cell with marks on his neck, and jail officials treated the episode as a possible suicide attempt, though they also explored whether Epstein had been attacked. At the time, Epstein had a cellmate: Nicholas Tartaglione, a former police officer in custody on murder and narcotics charges.

Immediately after that incident, officials at the detention center put Epstein on suicide watch, subjecting him to constant monitoring and daily psychological evaluations, people familiar with the matter said. After about a week, he was removed. He was returned to the special housing unit and assigned a different cellmate before that person was moved out Friday, people familiar with the matter said. The people declined to identify that cellmate.

By some accounts, Epstein seemed all right. He showed no apparent signs of distress at a July 31 court hearing, and in the week of his death, he was meeting with his attorneys for many hours and seemed in good spirits, people familiar with the matter said.

Union officials said that understaffing is a persistent issue at the Metropolitan Correctional Center and that it was possible overwork and exhaustion played a role in the incident. The two correctional officers assigned to the special detention unit where Epstein was held were working overtime — one forced to do so by management, the other for his fourth or fifth consecutive day, said the president of the local union for staffers.

Serene Gregg, president of American Federation of Government Employees Local 3148, said the Metropolitan Correctional Center is functioning with fewer than 70 percent of the needed correctional officers, forcing many to work mandatory overtime and 60- or 70-hour workweeks.

She said one of the people assigned to watch Epstein’s unit did not normally work as a correctional officer but, like others in roles such as counselors and teachers, was able to do so. She declined to say which one or specify the person’s regular role.

“If it wasn’t Mr. Epstein, it would have been somebody else, because of the conditions at that institution,” Gregg said. “It wasn’t a matter of how it happened or it happening, but it was only a matter of time for it to happen. It was inevitable. Our staff is severely overworked.”

The facility has long held high-profile inmates.

Weeks after Epstein’s arrest, one of MCC’s most famous prisoners, convicted drug kingpin Joaquín Guzmán, better known as “El Chapo,” was transferred out of the jail, after declaring his time there was “psychological, emotional, mental torture, 24 hours a day.”

The high-rise jail has also held al-Qaeda members, mob boss John Gotti and Ponzi-scheme mastermind Bernard Madoff.

Epstein was held in a section of the jail called Nine South, along with other inmates who officials decide require extra monitoring. The strictest conditions in the MCC are found in a different section, 10 South, where the most dangerous prisoners are held."
"Four men sentenced for child pornography, DOJ says they used bitcoin and Tor to cover their tracks",https://www.cnbc.com,['Kate Fazzini'],08-12-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/12/doj-sentences-four-for-child-porn-used-bitcoin-tor-to-cover-tracks.html,"Four men from across the U.S. and Canada were sentenced to decades in prison for running what the Justice Department called a ""highly sophisticated"" encrypted underground network for trading child pornography.

The Justice Department said the four convicted men ran a ""global child exploitation enterprise"" called ""The Giftbox Exchange"" on the open-source Tor Network, which uses an overlay network for directing internet traffic, obfuscating the details, locations and identities of those using it.

The website was paid for through bitcoin transactions, and the men ""used other advanced technological means to thwart law enforcement efforts, including file encryption and cryptography.""

Patrick D. Falte, 29, of Franklin, Tennessee, was sentenced to 35 years in prison for engaging in a child exploitation enterprise, three counts of advertising child pornography, and three counts of distributing child pornography. Benjamin A. Faulkner, 28, of Ontario, Canada, was sentenced to 35 years in prison; Andrew R. Leslie, 24, of Middleburg, Florida, was sentenced to 30 years in prison; and Brett A. Bedusek, 35, of Cudahy, Wisconsin, was sentenced to 20 years in prison, for their roles in the scheme.

Three of the men had already been sentenced for child sex crimes, according to the DOJ.

The case was aided by the Justice Department's Project Safe Childhood, and the Department of Homeland Security's Investigation and High Technology Investigative Unit, which have been tasked with investigating crimes against children that involve the use of encrypted communications, anonymizers and other sophisticated technologies.

The FBI has increasingly called on technology companies to help break various encryption methods to help find online criminals, including sex offenders. Christopher Wray highlighted several cases at an FBI cybersecurity conference in July in which he said companies helped the bureau find and rescue abused children through their cooperation.

""The guy's actually dissembling a little bit, and he's sounding more and more nonsensical,"" Scaramucci said on ""New Day."" ""And, you know, we're sort anesthetized to it.""

In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!

""To those asking, 'what took so long?' You're right. I tried to see best in @realDonaldTrump based on private interactions and select policy alignment. But his increasingly divisive rhetoric - and damage it's doing to fabric of our society - outweighs any short-term economic gain.""

Scaramucci is entitled to his own opinion. But not his own facts. And the facts simply do not line up with the idea that Trump's rhetoric is getting worse or more divisive -- particularly of late. The facts suggest that Trump has always been exactly the person he is today. There's no meaningful change -- for the better or the worse -- in his behavior. Trump is, quite simply, just being Trump.

Consider this: Two years ago today, white nationalist marchers in Charlottesville, Virginia, created a riot that left a woman -- Heather Heyer -- dead. In the wake of that incident, Trump blamed ""both sides"" -- the white supremacists and those who organized a counter-protest to them -- for Heyer's death.

""You had a group on one side that was bad and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent. Nobody wants to say it, but I will say it right now,"" Trump said at the time.

Not enough for you? How about these:

* Trump attacked a Gold Star family that spoke at the Democratic National Convention in 2016

* Trump mocked and impersonated a disabled New York Times reporter

* Trump said Mexico was purposely sending rapists and criminals to the United States

* In an audio recording of an "" Access Hollywood "" interview, Trump made a series of misogynistic comments about women

* Trump said the late Sen. John McCain wasn't a war hero because he had been captured by the North Vietnamese

* Trump said that there was "" blood coming out of her wherever "" in reference to then-Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly's treatment of him in a 2015 debate

* Trump said an American-born judge of Mexican descent had a conflict of interest in a case related to Trump University because the President had pushed for a wall to be built on our southern border.

* Trump alleged, without proof, that 3 to 5 million illegal votes had been cast in the 2016 election

There's more. So much more. But you get the idea.

What Scaramucci is doing is trying to soothe his own conscience. Trump wasn't always this bad! Therefore, supporting him for as long as I did was OK! Something has changed now! Something big!

Trump responded Monday to his former staffer's recent media appearances this way on Twitter: ""Scaramucci, who like so many others had nothing to do with my Election victory, is only upset that I didn't want him back in the Administration (where he desperately wanted to be). Also, I seldom had time to return his many calls to me. He just wanted to be on TV!""

The cold reality, of course, is that nothing has changed. Trump is who he has always been. There is no meltdown. There is no ""he's getting worse.""

Scaramucci knows that. He also should know better."

Wisconsin man among 4 sentenced for child exploitation on Tor network,https://www.wbay.com,[],,,,https://www.wbay.com/content/news/Wisconsin-man-among-4-sentenced-for-child-exploitation-on-Tor-network-537962191.html,"A Wisconsin man is among four sentenced to federal prison for their roles in an anonymous network sharing photos and videos of children being sexually abused.

The U.S. Department of Justice says Patrick Falte, 29, of Tennessee, created the ""Giftbox Exchange"" website on the Tor network which makes users' network addresses anonymous. Users who wanted to join Falte's website had to share photos or videos of preteen children being sexually abused to become members.

The DOJ says when the Giftbox Exchange was shut down, it had 72,000 users.

Prosecutors say Brett Bedusek, 35, of Cudahy was not only a VIP member of the website but also a moderator -- at the same time he was on supervised release for his conviction on federal charges of receiving child pornography.

Friday, Bedusek was sentenced Friday to 20 years in prison.

Falte and an administrator of his website, Benjamin Faulkner, 28, of Ontario, Canada, were sentenced to 35 years in federal prison. But both men are already serving life sentences in Virginia for repeatedly sexually abusing a toddler.

Andrew Leslie, 24, of Florida, who was a member of the Giftbox Exchange and ran his own anonymous network for sharing sexual abuse photos, received a 30-year sentence. He's also serving 60 years in prison for Florida in connection with sexual abuse and production of child pornography.

The DOJ says in addition to use the anonymity network, Falte and the co-conspirators used file encryption, cryptography and other technology to hide their crimes from law enforcement. The case was investigated by the U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement's High Technology Investigative Unit and Homeland Security Investigations."
Watchdog report says Trump's State Department hiring freeze impacted safety,https://thehill.com,[],08-12-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/457178-inspector-general-report-says-trumps-state-dept-hiring-freeze,"A 16-month hiring freeze at the State Department hurt both safety and morale within the department, according to a report released Friday by the State Department’s Office of Inspector General (OIG).

The watchdog found 96 percent of embassies and consulates and 95 percent of domestic offices and bureaus said the hiring freeze ""had a somewhat negative or very negative effect on overall operations.""

A full 100 percent of bureaus and offices responding to a survey told the OIG the freeze, imposed by President Trump Donald John TrumpHarris campaigns off of NRA attack Help wanted: American ambassador in Moscow Goldman Sachs CEO dismisses 'impending economic crisis' amid rising recession fears MORE in January 2017 and ended in May 2018, hurt employee welfare and morale. Only slightly fewer embassy and consulate respondents — 97 percent — said the same thing.

""Several bureaus charged with protecting security, health, and life safety reported to OIG that the hiring freeze had significant detrimental effects on their operations,” the report said.

For example, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security said it was unable to fully staff its command center, which is responsible for monitoring potential threats against U.S. diplomats and American citizens abroad, during the freeze, according to the report.

""DS said that even staffing the center with the minimum staff needed to operate contributed to employee burnout and fatigue and led to coverage gaps that could have significantly affected its ability to respond to overseas security crises,"" the report states.

The survey results found the hiring freeze also hurt State Department operations domestically, with the Bureau of Medical Services telling the OIG that due to staffing shortages it was less prepared to provide services for children of overseas employees with special needs or process medical clearances for staffs, and was also hindered in mental health operations such as determining suitability for law enforcement officers authorized to carry weapons."
Connecticut to sue to block Trump ‘public charge’ immigration rule,https://www.theday.com,[],08-13-2019,2019,8,https://www.theday.com/article/20190813/NWS12/190819828,"Connecticut on Monday said it will try to stop a new Trump administration policy that will make it harder for immigrants who rely on government social programs, such as food stamps, to obtain permanent legal status.

Calling it part of a “cruel and racist campaign,” Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said he intends to join other states in a challenge to the new rule. That rule is part of a of a far-reaching policy aimed at slowing the flow of legal immigration and reducing the number of poor immigrants by forbidding admittance into the United States those deemed at risk of becoming “public charges.”

“The Trump Administration’s illegal and unconstitutional new scheme is a direct attack on access to the American dream,” Tong said “This country was built by immigrants like my parents who worked themselves up from poverty. This rule is the latest chapter in this Administration’s cruel and racist campaign to intimidate and punish immigrants of color.”

Tong said he is “in close coordination with partner states and am prepared to take imminent legal action to block this unlawful and hurtful rule.”

Under the new Trump administration policy, wealth, education, age and English-language skills will take on greater weight in applications for a green card, or permanent residency.

Meanwhile, the new rule will broaden the definition of a public charge to include not just those primarily dependent on public financial assistance programs, but also anyone who uses a public benefit such as Medicaid, food stamps, other nutrition-related programs, or housing assistance.

The rule change will take effect Oct. 15, 2019. It defines a public charge as an individual who receives one or more designated public benefits for more than 12 months within any 36-month period.

Ken Cuccineli, acting director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, announced the “Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds” rule during a press briefing at the White House on Monday.

“President Trump is enforcing this longstanding law to prevent aliens from depending on public benefit programs,” said a White House press release on the subject. “The Immigration and Nationality Act makes clear that those seeking to come to the United States cannot be a public charge. For many years, this clear legal requirement went largely unenforced, imposing vast burdens on American taxpayers. Now, public charge law will finally be utilized.”

He said the new policy would encourage “self-reliance and self-sufficiency for those seeking to come to or to stay in the United States.”

Immigration activists are concerned that the new rule would have a chilling effect on legal immigrants and stop them from using public benefits they are otherwise eligible for.

They also say permanent residents and naturalized citizens may also be afraid of applying for public benefits, thinking it may impact their ability to remain in the United States."
Newark hands out bottled water amid growing lead crisis following EPA rebuke,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/newark-bottled-water-epa-crisis-lead-flint-vulnerable-communities-1cdc6e5f8436/,"One of New Jersey’s major cities is offering bottled water to its residents after the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) raised glaring concerns over dangerous lead content in the area’s drinking supply.

The growing crisis in Newark comes after years of resident concerns over lead in drinking water, leading many people last fall to start using water filters on their taps. That change hasn’t gone far enough, the federal government says, and now the city is facing water issues reminiscent of other areas, like Flint, Michigan.

Both cities are majority black with many residents living below the poverty line — groups that tend to suffer environmental crises disproportionately.

New Jersey Gov. Philip Murphy (D) and Newark Mayor Ras Baraka (D) said Sunday that beginning Monday, bottled water would be available to city residents concerned about water quality.

“Access to safe drinking water is critically important to our administrations and we take health risks associated with lead in drinking water very seriously,” the officials said in a joint statement.

The move comes amid growing controversy over lead in Newark’s drinking water, a problem that stretches back several years. Some of the city’s lead service pipes are around a century old, sparking concern among public health experts. And since at least 2018, inadequate corrosion treatment at the Pequannock water plant has led to high lead levels in some residents’ tap water, breaching 15 parts per billion, the standard set by the EPA.

After downplaying the city’s water issues for over a year, Newark in October 2018 gave away 38,000 water filters to address the problem. But residents say they still have lead in their drinking water. On Friday, the EPA sent a letter to the city and state advising bottled water usage for residents in homes with lead pipes.

“[W]e are unable at this time to assure Newark residents that their heath is fully protected when drinking tap water filtered through these devices,” the EPA wrote, after testing water at two residences in Newark.

Under President Donald Trump, the EPA has repeatedly said that water issues are the country’s top environmental problem, above climate change. But Newark’s crisis reflects ongoing contamination trends across the country. And it’s not just lead that’s leaching into the water.

Toxic “forever chemicals” found in non-stick pans and many other everyday items have appeared in water around the country, including in Michigan. And in states like Iowa, agricultural runoff is polluting well water. In both instances, health and environmental advocates have argued the EPA is not doing enough to address the problem.

But the agency indicated it might assert its authority if Newark’s situation does not improve. The EPA said it “is prepared to take appropriate action” to protect public health in the city.

Contact with lead can result in growth development problems, neurological issues, and occasionally fatalities. Lead in public drinking water can be especially problematic given the universal nature of water consumption.

In Flint, a drinking water crisis that began in 2014 affected around 100,000 people after the city switched its water source. Multiple deaths are associated with lead pollution there and residents have repeatedly accused public officials of lying to them about the extent of the issue. Litigation over responsibility for Flint’s tragedy remains ongoing.

EPA data has repeatedly shown that communities of color and low-income areas disproportionately suffer from environmental problems, like air and water issues. And while Newark, like Flint, is heavily black with a high poverty rate, the city has so far worked to avoid comparing the two situations, even as Newark’s public health crisis grows.

Mayor Baraka has previously called on Trump to help Newark address its water issues. In January, Baraka told the White House the cost would likely be around $70 million. Prior to that, the city had historically argued that its water was safe to drink, despite concerns.

Now, the city is advising residents to run their taps for five minutes before using the water. Bottled water is only being distributed to certain residents who had previously received filters, although pregnant people and young children are advised to drink bottled water. Baraka has insisted that the bottled water is only a “preliminary precaution.”

But advocates argue the city still isn’t doing enough. The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and Newark Education Workers Caucus (NEW Caucus) sued city and state officials in 2018, arguing that systemic failures had allowed the lead contamination to occur. Both groups greeted the city’s move towards bottled water for impacted residents but expressed continued concern.

“We are deeply troubled by the City’s announcement [confirming the lead issues],” NRDC’s Senior Director of Health and Food Erik Olson said in a statement, going on to express hope that both NRDC and NEW Caucus “can work cooperatively with the City to address this serious public health crisis.”"
"3 Big Things Today, August 12",https://www.agriculture.com,[],08-12-2019,2019,8,https://www.agriculture.com/news/3-big-things-today-august-12,"1. Soybeans, Grains Lower Overnight Ahead of WASDE

Soybeans and grains were lower in overnight trading ahead of today’s World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) Report.

The USDA report is due out at noon in Washington.

Soybean area is pegged at about 81 million acres while yield is seen at around 47.6 bushels an acre, leaving production at about 3.8 billion bushels, according to a Reuters survey. Last month, the USDA said it expected planted acreage at 80 million, yield of 48.5 bushels an acre and total output of 3.845 billion bushels.

Corn acres are pegged at around 88 million with yield of 164.9 bushels an acre, resulting in production of 13.193 billion bushels, the survey showed.

The USDA in July forecast corn planted area of 91.7 million acres, yield of 166 bushels an acre, and output of 13.875 billion bushels.

Soybean inventories in the marketing year that ends on August 31, 2020, are expected to come in around 821 million bushels, while corn stockpiles are forecast at about 1.62 billion bushels, the company reported.

Soybean futures for November delivery fell 5¾¢ to $8.86 a bushel overnight on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soy meal lost $1.30 to $302.40 a short ton, while soybean oil dropped 0.24¢ to 29.71¢ a pound.

Corn futures for December delivery declined 3¢ to $4.14¾ a bushel overnight.

Wheat for September delivery fell 4¢ to $4.95½ a bushel, while Kansas City futures lost 3½¢ to $4.30 a bushel.

2. Speculative Investors Slash Net Longs in Corn, Increase Bearish Positions in Beans

Speculative investors cut their net-long positions, or bets on higher prices, in corn to the lowest level in more than two months while raising their bearish bets on soybeans.

Money managers held net-long positions of 68,086 corn futures contracts as of August 6, down from 105,907 contracts a week earlier and the smallest amount since the seven days that ended on May 28, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

In soybeans, investors increased their net-short positions, or bets on lower prices, to 76,318 futures contracts last week, the CFTC said in a report.

That’s up from 55,160 contracts the previous week and the largest bearish position in beans since the seven days that ended on June 11.

Investors are less bullish on corn and more bearish on beans amid an ongoing trade war with China that has no end in sight.

Speculators also increased their bearish positions in hard red winter wheat, bumping their net shorts to 22,942 futures contracts from 16,283 contracts a week earlier. That’s the biggest bearish holdings in hard red winter futures since mid-June.

Investors cut their net-long positions in soft red winter wheat to 7,121 futures contracts last week, about half the previous week, the CFTC said.

The weekly Commitment of Traders Report from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission shows trader positions in futures markets.

The report provides positions held by commercial traders, or those using futures to hedge their physical assets; noncommercial traders, or money managers (also called large speculators); and nonreportables, or small speculators.

A net-long position indicates more traders are betting on higher prices, while a net-short position means more are betting futures will decline.

3. Heat Blasts Much of South-Central U.S., Flood Warnings Issued in Missouri, Illinois

A heat wave is blasting much of the south-central U.S. as excessive heat warnings and advisories are in effect in several states.

In eastern Oklahoma, most of Arkansas, and parts of northern Louisiana, an excessive heat warning is in effect starting at 1 p.m. this afternoon until 8 p.m. Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service.

Temperatures will be in the upper 90s today and tomorrow with heat indexes of about 115˚F., the NWS said in a report early this morning. Outdoor activity is not advised.

In several counties in eastern Missouri and western Illinois, meanwhile, a flash flood warning is in effect after thunderstorms dropped several inches of rain in the region.

As much as 3 inches of rain fell in an hour this morning, with another 3 inches possible in the area, the NWS said in its report.

“Thunderstorms north of a warm front will train and create flash flooding across parts of central and east-central Missouri as well as south-central Illinois,” the agency said. “Flash flooding may cause road closures and lead to very rapid rises in smaller creeks and streams.”"
"State Department hiring freeze undermined safety and gutted morale, report finds",https://www.cnn.com,['Jennifer Hansler'],08-12-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/12/politics/state-oig-report-hiring-freeze/index.html,"(CNN) The State Department's 16-month-long hiring freeze had broad and negative impacts on the agency, including its ability to ensure the safety and wellbeing of personnel domestically and abroad, according to a report from the department's watchdog.

According to the Office of Inspector General's report released Friday, 96% of embassies and consulates and 95% of domestic bureaus and offices who responded to OIG's surveys said the hiring freeze ""had a somewhat negative or very negative effect on overall operations."" Some 97% of embassies and consulates and 100% of bureaus and offices told OIG that the freeze negatively impacted employee morale and welfare.

President Donald Trump instituted the hiring freeze upon taking office in January 2017. The Office of Management and Budget lifted the freeze in mid-April of that year, but the State Department continued the freeze for another 13 months under the tenure of former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Mike Pompeo resumed hiring in May 2018, after becoming secretary of state.

The OIG report, which was ordered by Congress and based on responses from 38 bureaus and offices and 151 overseas posts, found that ""several bureaus charged with protecting security, health, and life safety reported to OIG that the hiring freeze had significant detrimental effects on their operations.""

The Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS), for example, reported a number of adverse repercussions as a result of the freeze. Among those were the inability to staff its command center -- which ""operates 24 hours a day to monitor and report information regarding threats against US diplomatic missions, the Secretary, and American citizens abroad"" -- at the recommended levels.

Editorial: Jailhouse suicides aren’t theories,https://triblive.com,[],08-12-2019,2019,8,https://triblive.com/opinion/editorial-jailhouse-suicides-arent-theories/,"TribLIVE's Daily and Weekly email newsletters deliver the news you want and information you need, right to your inbox.

Jeffrey Epstein’s apparent suicide has prompted a rash of conspiracy theories about how a wealthy man in an infamous criminal case could have been left to kill himself.

There are the theories that the government had him killed. Or maybe it was the Clintons. Or maybe it was the even wealthier people who could have been implicated in his case should it go all the way to trial. Maybe it was the Russians. Maybe it was criminals.

Epstein’s death seems poised to be the new Kennedy assassination or Marilyn Monroe overdose. It is the death no one will ever accept at face value.

For just a moment, let’s ignore the rich, famous players alleged to be involved in Epstein’s wicked games. Let’s strip everything away but the demographics.

A man in jail awaiting trial appears to have died at his own hand. While it is the money and sex and politics that have drawn the public’s attention and focused on all of the reasons his suicide shouldn’t have happened, let’s focus on something else.

Suicides happen in jail. They happen a lot.

A 2015 report from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics called the number of people killing themselves in local jails “a national crisis.” The BJS numbers show people in jail — often awaiting a trial rather than serving a sentence — are more than three times more likely to commit suicide than those sentenced and incarcerated in a prison.

A Pennsylvania Post article showed the state had 81 county jail suicides between 2015 and 2018. Seven were in Allegheny County, four in Beaver, three in Washington, two in Westmoreland, one in Somerset. The 10-county region had 65 attempted suicides.

There have been more in 2019.

The National Institute of Mental Health recognizes incarceration as a “main risk factor for suicide.”

Epstein had at least two others — a prior attempt and being over 60.

When the very act of being brought into jail checks a major box on the list, caution and attention would seem to be good ideas in all county correctional facilities, especially when so many of those behind the bars are still supposed to be presumed innocent.

A jail is just the first step in a criminal court journey. It might just be for a few hours or a few days. At worst, it might be a couple of years. It isn’t supposed to be where a life ends.

Maybe the focus on Epstein’s death could result in just a little attention given to the national crisis of jailhouse suicides. Most of them are facts, not theories."
"DOJ to craft bill to speed up executions for mass shooters, cop killers: AG Barr",https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-introduce-bill-speed-executions-mass-shooters-cop/story?id=64926894,"The Department of Justice will craft a new bill aimed at speeding up death penalty proceedings for mass shooters and cop killers, Attorney General William Barr announced Monday.

""There will be a strict timetable for judicial proceedings that will allow the imposition of the death sentence without undue delay,"" Barr said of the legislation during remarks to law enforcement in New Orleans. ""Punishment must be swift.""

Barr said he expects the proposed legislation to be ready by the end of the Labor Day holiday.

President Donald Trump first made note of this directive to the Department of Justice last Monday in his statement on the El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, mass shootings.

""Today, I’m also directing the Department of Justice to propose legislation ensuring that those who commit hate crimes and mass murders face the death penalty, and that this capital punishment be delivered quickly, decisively, and without years of needless delay,"" Trump said a week ago.

Opponents of the death penalty, however, have noted that there's little evidence to suggest that quicker executions would amount to a deterrent in the cases of mass shooters -- who often mount their attacks with plans to take their own life or to be killed by law enforcement at the scene.

The El Paso shooter, for instance, carried out his attack in Texas, where far more prisoners have been put to death by execution than any other state.

The announcement from Barr follows his move last month ordering the Bureau of Prisons to resume federal executions, beginning in December, which is expected to face significant legal hurdles.

Trump has long advocated for expanding use of the death penalty in the U.S. against cop killers and drug traffickers, even as several states have moved in recent years to ban or place a moratorium on executions. A majority of states, however, still allow for the death penalty."
Kamala Harris on ICE raids: Trump administration conducting a 'campaign of terror',https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-11-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/kamala-harris-on-ice-raids-trump-administration-conducting-a-campaign-of-terror,"2020 presidential candidate and California Sen. Kamala Harris on Sunday called the Trump administration's decision to carry out immigration raids in the wake of two mass shootings a ""campaign of terror.""

In an interview on NBC's Meet the Press, Harris noted the round-up of 680 suspected undocumented workers at several food processing plants in Mississippi on Wednesday. She believed that Hispanics were specifically targeted because the majority of detained workers were Latino.

""This administration has directed DHS to conduct these raids as part of what I believe is this administration's campaign of terror, which is to make whole populations of people afraid to go to work,"" Harris said. ""Children are afraid to go to school for fear that when they come home, their parents won’t be there.”

Immigration officials called the raids the ""largest single-state enforcement action in [the] nation's history.""

Pro-immigration leaders condemned what they perceived as poor management by the administration to execute the raids just days after a shooting in El Paso, Texas, where the perpetrator declared in his alleged manifesto that he was specifically attacking ""Mexicans.""

They also noted that families affected by the raids will be traumatized, pointing to videos circulating on social media that have shown children crying after their parents were sent to Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities around the country.

""We must point out and never condone anyone who uses their power in a way that fans it,"" Harris said. ""But the reality is that these are forms of hate that are not new to our country, which have in the history of our country taken lethal proportion, and, still today, take on lethal proportion."""

It was a half hour before noon when a federal agent showed up at IHOP and showed Rachel Yoakum his badge.

“I honestly thought it was the health department or something,” said Yoakum, the general manager of the newly opened IHOP on 151st Street in Overland Park.

But it turned out the International House of Pancakes would be getting a visit from the nation’s top diplomat and the agent was there for a security sweep.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo soon arrived at the restaurant with his family and a team of agents from the Bureau of Diplomatic Security.

“You don’t normally see stuff like that in IHOP, so it was like what the heck?” said Yoakum, who recalled six SUV’s pulling up to her store at noon exactly. “Everybody in the whole store, even customers, were like is that who I think it is?”

SHARE COPY LINK U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke at the Road to the Global Entrepreneurship Summit (GES) Heartland in Overland Park Monday, Mar. 18, 2019. Pompeo answered questions about entrepreneurship, Trump, and Kansas.

Yoakum said that some customers thought that Pompeo was going to deliver a speech. Instead, he ordered two scrambled eggs, two pancakes, two strips of turkey bacon and a Pepsi, Yoakum said.

It’s the former Kansas congressman’s second visit to the state this year. He’ll be there again next month to deliver a speech at Kansas State University as part of the prestigious Landon Lecture Series.

Pompeo’s August visit and upcoming speech have helped reignite speculation about Pompeo’s political future in the wake of Sen. Pat Roberts’ retirement announcement.

Pompeo has repeatedly downplayed his interest in the open Senate seat, but he remains the top choice of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Sources close to Pompeo have stressed that this month’s visit was purely personal.

The reason for the visit to Kansas — and to IHOP — was to celebrate his mother-in-law’s birthday. Yoakum said Pompeo’s mother-in-law was treated to a birthday sundae and song.

The secretary of state posed for photographs with employees, shook the hands of customers and even signed books before departing from the restaurant.

In a letter sent to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan and ICE acting Director Mark Morgan on Monday, the lawmakers said the timing of the raids left communities in chaos and argued the agencies left children at risk by failing to provide sufficient warning to school districts.

“This raid, which is the largest ICE raid in our nation’s history, is a continuation of the Trump Administration’s politically driven immigration agenda and efforts to target Latino families. It is also not lost on us that this operation occurred just days after one of the most horrific mass shooting targeting Latinos in America,” they wrote.

The raids took place Wednesday, less than a week after a gunman killed 22 people in a mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, that officials said targeted the Hispanic community. McAleenan said Sunday the timing was ""unfortunate,"" but added, ""This is a criminal investigation with 14 federal warrants issue by a judge. ICE had to follow through with it. It was already planned and in motion.""

“Acting Secretary McAleenan, your recent statement noting that timing of these actions ‘was unfortunate’ is a significant understatement that does not convey the pain many in our communities are experiencing now,” members wrote.

The group noted they voiced concerns over the administration’s announcement last month it planned to move forward with immigration raids, adding they believe they can lead to “inhumane family separations” and anxieties for both migrants and U.S. citizens.

“ICE raids of this scale are not conducted for the purpose of immigration enforcement; instead, their purpose is to instill fear in Latino and immigrant communities at a time when Latinos are already living in terror. These workplace raids decimate communities and target law-abiding immigrants who are just trying to earn an honest living,” they continued.

“Indeed the law enforcement effectiveness of mass-raid events like these have long been questioned. Instead of targeting undocumented workers with long-standing ties to communities, the Department of Homeland Security should use its resources to target nefarious and serious national security and public safety threats.""

The lawmakers are asking the agencies to provide information on the costs and source of funding for the raids and the preceding investigation; whether the funding from the recently passed DHS supplemental appropriation bill is expected to be used toward “any ICE worksite enforcement investigation and operation (including the one in Mississippi) planned for or ongoing as of July 1, 2019;” and the personal information of individuals taken into custody on Aug. 7.

Other questions include descriptions of any ICE requests “for assistance or support for at-large enforcement operations” from state and local law enforcement or additional agencies for the raid in Mississippi and what plans have been made to house detainees and whether there is a process in place to verify the conditions of temporary facilities.

The lawmakers are calling for the information to be provided by Aug. 30."

"Man With Assault Rifle Opens Fire At VA Hospital, No Injuries",https://patch.com,[],08-12-2019,2019,8,https://patch.com/illinois/westside/no-injuries-after-active-shooter-hospital-taken-custody,"CHICAGO, IL — Police shut down the Jesse Brown Veterans Affairs Medical Center Monday after a report of an active shooter in the building. No injuries were reported and a man believed to be the lone suspect was taken into custody. The shooting was reported around 2:18 p.m. at the Taylor Street entrance to the hospital at 820 S. Damen Ave., authorities said.

Witnesses evacuated from the building said the shooting began outside before the man entered the hospital. He was arrested inside by Veterans Affairs police. Police were seen placing evidence markers along Taylor Street near the entrance to the hospital. The suspected gunman was taken to Chicago Police Department's Area Central headquarters.

Jeff Sallet, special agent in charge of the Chicago field office, said the man was ""carrying an assault rifle and began firing."" VA police inside took him into custody without firing a shot within 30 seconds, he said.

""We avoided tragedy here in the city of Chicago today,"" Sallet said, thanking officers with VA hospital police. ""As those shots and the call came, they ran to the shots, resulting in a quick mitigation of the threat.""

Lori Lohar, acting director of the VA medical center, said the gunman was not believed to be a veteran.



""The heroic efforts of law enforcement resulted in the individual being taken into custody with no reported injuries or loss of life,"" she said.

Because the hospital is a federal facility, any criminal charges connected to the incident will be filed in federal court by the U.S. Attorney's Office, according to the FBI. The shooters motive was not immediately known.

""We have, obviously, mass acts of violence happening in this country on a regular basis,"" Sallet said. ""Here in the partnership with the Chicago Police Department — state, local and federal — we are working together on a regular basis to negate these threats.""

Deputy Chief Christopher Kennedy of Chicago police said VA officers ""averted what could have been something very tragic.""

Active shooter response Taylor and Damen now secure. CFD has no patients. No one reported hit. Suspect in custody. Cfd leaving scene.

US Department of Commerce Offering 6-Figure Salary to Crypto Expert,https://cointelegraph.com,"['Marie Huillet', 'Masao Akimoto']",08-12-2019,2019,8,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-department-of-commerce-offering-6-figure-salary-to-crypto-expert,"The United States Department of Commerce is looking to hire a computer scientist specializing in blockchain and identity management.

According to a job listing from Aug. 9, the federal agency is seeking someone with at least one year of specialized experience in developing blockchain infrastructure and conducting research into blockchain technologies, crypto ledgers and crypto contracts.

Focus on identity management and crypto tokens

The Department of Commerce’s listing hints at the future hire’s duties and responsibilities in general terms, revealing only that they will be tasked with research and development into potentially disruptive technologies at the department’s Information Technology Laboratory.

It notes that the candidate’s role will include a focus on the cybersecurity capabilities and requirements necessary for the successful implementation of emerging technologies.

Yet in its outline of the experience required of candidates, the listing indicates that identity management in connection with blockchain will apparently be of particular importance for the role.

Applicants should have experience with:

“National and global identity management programs and identity tokens” and in “standards and national and international standards bodies developing identity management, blockchain and identity token interoperability standards.”

The appointment is for a short-term vacancy — not to exceed one year — at a salary of up to $166,500.

Federal agencies step up blockchain activity

This April, Cointelegraph reported that the U.S. federal government is expected to raise its blockchain spending to $123.5 million by 2022 — an over 1,000% increase as compared with the $10.7 million it spent in 2017.

In June, the U.S. National Telecommunications and Information Administration — which forms part of the Department of Commerce — reached out for feedback on blockchain policy, as officials forecast an increasing focus on the technology in coming years.

The Department of Commerce has been responding to developments in the blockchain sector since 2016."
Biden's verbal mistakes pile up as he campaigns in Iowa,https://www.aol.com,"['Aol Staff', 'Dylan Stableford', 'Christopher Wilson', 'Yahoo News']",08-12-2019,2019,8,https://www.aol.com/article/news/2019/08/12/bidens-verbal-mistakes-pile-up-as-he-campaigns-in-iowa/23792014/,"Months before launching his 2020 presidential campaign, Joe Biden acknowledged that he is a “gaffe machine,” prone to misstatements and embarrassing mistakes.

He lived up to that reputation this past weekend on a campaign swing in Iowa, renewing fears among some Democrats that the 76-year-old former vice president and current frontrunner in the race for the Democratic nomination may not have the stamina for what would likely be a brutal campaign against President Trump.

At a gun violence forum on Saturday, Biden recalled meeting with survivors of the high school shooting in Parkland, Fla., as vice president — a meeting that could not have taken place, as the attack occurred more than a year after he left office.

He repeated the account while talking to reporters after the event.

“Those kids in Parkland came up to see me when I was vice president,” Biden said, adding that Republican members of Congress refused to meet with the shooting survivors.

He did meet with some Parkland students following the shooting in 2018, just not as vice president. An official with the Biden campaign told Bloomberg News that Biden was thinking of the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., when he misspoke.

Speaking at the Iowa State Fair on Thursday, Biden suffered a minor slip of the tongue, saying: “We choose truth over facts.” He also briefly confused the late British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Biden had previously conflated Thatcher with one of her successors, Theresa May.

Thursday night, while speaking to the Asian & Latino Coalition in Des Moines, Biden accidentally said that “poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids” before correcting himself.

“Vice President Biden misspoke and immediately corrected himself during a refrain he often uses to make the point that all children deserve a fair shot, and children born into lower-income circumstances are just as smart as those born to wealthy parents,” Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s communications director, said in a statement.

Biden’s stumbles came a week after his lackadaisical performance in the second round of Democratic debates where he misstated the cost of Medicare for All, confused an insurance deductible with an insurance co-pay and was unable to accurately direct viewers to text support for his campaign. He also recently misstated the locations of the mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, placing them in Houston and in Michigan, respectively.

Democratic officials took notice.

“The problem is that he is a part of a field of a number of extremely articulate people,” former Iowa Lt. Gov. Patty Judge told Vice News over the weekend. “He and his campaign are going to have to work hard to try to articulate their message without those kinds of gaffes [and run] a vigorous campaign in order to counter the idea that he’s too old.”

“But that’s just part of Joe,” she added. “We’ll see how it all shakes out.”

The Trump campaign has tried to paint Biden as having lost a step, as has the president — whose own misstatements, exaggerations and untruths have alarmed some psychiatrists.

“Welcome to the race Sleepy Joe,” Trump tweeted after Biden announced his presidential bid. “I only hope you have the intelligence, long in doubt, to wage a successful primary.”

“I’d rather run against Biden rather than anybody,” Trump said of Biden in June. “I think he’s the weakest mentally.”

In December, Biden acknowledged that his history of bumbles could come into play should he seek the Oval Office. But the former vice president also said his shortcomings paled in comparison to those of its current occupant.

“I am a gaffe machine,” Biden said. “But, my God, what a wonderful thing compared to a guy who can’t tell the truth.”

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to price, was lower at around 1.63%, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was also lower at around 2.127%.

The spread between 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields narrowed to about only 5 basis points on Monday, near its lowest level since 2007.

""Persistently low inflation in developed economies should constrain nominal yields, and tariffs are more likely to weigh on prices via demand destruction,"" Michael Reynolds, investment strategy officer at Glenmede Trust Company. ""Overall, these factors are holding back aggregate demand for both consumer spending and business investment, culminating in lower bond yields that reflect diminished growth expectations.""

Market focus is largely attuned to simmering trade tensions between Washington and Beijing.

On Friday, President Donald Trump said he was not ready to make a deal with China and called into question the next round of trade talks. It comes after the U.S. president said he would impose a 10% tariff on the remaining $300 billion worth of Chinese imports on September 1. China responded by halting its purchases of U.S. agricultural products.

Last week, the U.S. accused China of being a currency manipulator after Beijing allowed the yuan to dip below the 7-per-dollar level for the first time in more than a decade.

On Monday, the People's Bank of China set its daily midpoint for yuan trading — which determines the limits for its onshore movement — at 7.0211 per dollar. That was weaker than Friday's session, but stronger than market expectations.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Treasury is set to auction $42 billion in 13-week bills and $42 billion in 26-week bills."
EPA drops protection for wild salmon Alaska Bristol Bay,https://www.cnn.com,"['Scott Bronstein', 'Curt Devine', 'Drew Griffin', 'Ashley Hackett']",08-09-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/09/us/epa-alaska-pebble-mine-salmon-invs/index.html,"(CNN) The Environmental Protection Agency told staff scientists that it was no longer opposing a controversial Alaska mining project that could devastate one of the world's most valuable wild salmon fisheries just one day after President Trump met with Alaska's governor, CNN has learned.

The EPA publicly announced the reversal July 30, but EPA staff sources tell CNN that they were informed of the decision a month earlier, during a hastily arranged video conference after Trump's meeting with Gov. Mike Dunleavy. The governor, a supporter of the project, emerged from that meeting saying the president assured him that he's ""doing everything he can to work with us on our mining concerns.""

The news came as a ""total shock"" to some top EPA scientists who were planning to oppose the project on environmental grounds, according to sources. Those sources asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution.

The copper-and-gold mine planned near Bristol Bay, Alaska, known as Pebble Mine, was blocked by the Obama administration's EPA after scientists found that the mine would cause ""complete loss of"" the bay's fish habitat.

EPA insiders tell CNN that the timing of the agency's internal announcement suggests Trump was personally involved in the decision.

Dunleavy met with Trump aboard Air Force One on June 26, as the President's plane was on the tarmac in Alaska. The President had stopped there on his way to the G20 summit in Japan.

A controversial mining project in Bristol Bay, Alaska, that was all but killed by the Obama administration is now moving forward under President Trump's EPA.

Four EPA sources with knowledge of the decision told CNN that senior agency officials in Washington summoned scientists and other staffers to an internal videoconference on June 27, the day after the Trump-Dunleavy meeting, to inform them of the agency's reversal. The details of that meeting are not on any official EPA calendar and have not previously been reported.

Those sources said the decision disregards the standard assessment process under the Clean Water Act, cutting scientists out of the process.

The EPA's new position on the project is the latest development in a decade-long battle that has pitted environmentalists, Alaskan Natives and the fishing industry against pro-mining interests in Alaska.

In 2014, the project was halted because an EPA study found that it would cause ""complete loss of fish habitat due to elimination, dewatering, and fragmentation of streams, wetlands, and other aquatic resources"" in some areas of Bristol Bay. The agency invoked a rarely used provision of the Clean Water Act that works like a veto, effectively banning mining on the site.

Some current and former EPA officials say the decision to remove the Clean Water Act restriction ignores scientific evidence. The decision follows a series of regulatory rollbacks and political appointments within the Trump administration's EPA that have been criticized by former EPA administrators as favoring industry interests over the environment.

Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy met with President Trump aboard Air Force One on June 26.

The June 26 meeting between Trump and Dunleavy marked the fourth time the two had met since December.

Dunleavy has publicly supported the mining project and wrote a letter to Trump in March protesting the EPA's prior handling of the matter. He had dinner with Tom Collier, the CEO of Pebble Limited Partnership, the project's developer, in February and spoke to him on the phone in May, according to copies of Dunleavy's calendar reviewed by CNN. A member of Dunleavy's administration used to work on the Pebble project in public relations.

In response to CNN's question about whether Dunleavy asked Trump to direct the EPA to lift the restriction during the June meeting, Dunleavy's press secretary said the two discussed mining and a public land order, but he declined to provide specifics of the conversation.

Dunleavy said in a statement, ""This project, like all projects, should be scrutinized and examined under a fair and rigorous permitting process prescribed by law. That was not the case under the EPA's unprecedented preemptive veto.""

Neither the White House nor the EPA responded to CNN's question on whether the White House directed the EPA to lift the restriction on the mine.

The same day Trump and Dunleavy met in June, the EPA publicly announced that it would begin reconsidering whether to withdraw the Clean Water Act restriction on the Pebble Mine. EPA scientists and staff believed that they would then have weeks or months to reassess previous findings and potentially permanently stop the project, according to the sources.

Instead, immediately after Trump met with Dunleavy, EPA officials received an invitation from EPA headquarters to attend the video conference the next day, June 27.

During that video conference, EPA General Counsel Matthew Leopold said that a decision had been made to lift the restriction on the Pebble Mine proposal and that no further consideration of the matter was needed, sources said.

""I was dumbfounded,"" an EPA insider said. ""We were basically told we weren't going to examine anything. We were told to get out of the way and just make it happen.""

Leopold took over EPA responsibility for the Pebble Mine proposal since EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler, who previously worked for a law firm that provided services to Pebble, recused himself.

When CNN first asked about the June 27 meeting, EPA spokesman Michael Abboud said that Leopold told him he did not attend any meeting involving Pebble on that day, and therefore any announcement at any such meeting would lack authority.

After CNN told the EPA on Friday that evidence showed that Leopold organized and attended the June 27 meeting, Abboud contradicted his prior statement and said Leopold participated in an internal meeting that day to discuss an EPA memo as well as comment letters related to the project. Abboud said an EPA regional office decided to withdraw from the restriction on July 30.

The Bristol Bay watershed is one of the world's most valuable wild salmon fisheries.

This is the second time the EPA under the Trump administration has sought to remove the Clean Water Act restriction and clear the way for the Pebble Mine project.

In 2017, as CNN previously reported , top EPA officials directed staff to withdraw that protection and allow the project to move forward. That decision was made within hours of a meeting between then-EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and Pebble CEO Collier. However, in January 2018, Pruitt flip-flopped and announced that the protections would stay in place as the EPA gathered more information. The EPA said at the time that the Pebble project could still apply for a permit, but ""their permit application must clear a high bar, because EPA believes the risk to Bristol Bay may be unacceptable.""

When the EPA publicly announced the decision to withdraw from the Obama-era restriction on July 30, the EPA's Chris Hladick, an administrator who presides over Alaska, said the preemptive veto that previously blocked the project ""does not account for the full record and does not grapple with differing conclusions"" about the mine's potential environmental impacts.

EPA spokesman Abboud said in a statement to CNN, ""The previous administration's preemptive veto of this project, without a permit even being submitted, was a departure from regular order and the Trump administration is seeking a return to the correct process.""

Abboud added that the decision to withdraw the restriction does not guarantee that the mine will receive a permit but said the EPA will now focus on the permit-review process.

Pebble Limited Partnership praised the decision in a news release last week that said the EPA's previous objections to the project were based on ""'hypothetical mining scenarios' prepared by EPA itself, and assessed in an 'alleged' scientific study."" The company also said that its most recent permit application has a ""substantially smaller development footprint and enhanced environmental safeguards"" and that the project would employ about 2,000 people in Alaska.

The company's CEO, Collier, also ""expressly thanked Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy for his leadership in encouraging EPA to withdraw"" its earlier decision.

Christine Todd Whitman, who served as an Environmental Protection Agency administrator during the George W. Bush administration, said the EPA's decision to lift the restriction on the mine before the agency's scientists fully reviewed the matter could violate the Clean Water Act.

""It's politics trumping policy and good science,"" said Whitman, who in 2017 joined two other former EPA administrators who served under Republican presidents in opposing the mine due to its estimated environmental impacts. ""If this goes forward now with all the holes and the insufficiencies ... there'll be a lawsuit, no question about that.""

Bristol Bay-area tribes have protested the mine and say it would not only harm the environment, it would ruin their way of life.

""If that mine gets put in, it would ... completely devastate our region,"" said Gayla Hoseth, second chief of the Curyung Tribal Council and a Bristol Bay Native Association director. ""It would not only kill our resources, but it would kill us culturally."""
Minneapolis housing authority leads county in evictions,http://www.startribune.com,"['Marissa Evans', 'Marissa.Evans Startribune.Com']",,,,http://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-housing-authority-leads-county-in-evictions/535664982/,"The Minneapolis Public Housing Authority has gone to court to evict tenants more than 1,500 times in the past five years, making the county’s largest landlord also its biggest user of housing court, according to data compiled by Hennepin County.

The housing authority oversees more than 6,000 units across Minneapolis, providing homes for low-income residents who are often people with disabilities, older adults or people of color.

While emphasizing that it takes action only against a small number of its tenants, the housing authority is rethinking its approach to evictions amid a larger conversation in the city and across Minnesota over the fairness of the process and the long-term damage an eviction filing has for a prospective renter.

Public housing residents pay up to 30% of their income toward rent. But even with lower rent payments, housing authority officials and tenant advocates have found residents often fall behind due to job loss, reduced work hours or a health emergency.

The agency does not dispute the county’s data, but the numbers do not consider how officials work with residents until “practically at the very last minute to make sure that they stay housed,” said Tracey Scott, interim executive director for the Minneapolis Public Housing Authority. “It doesn’t show the whole story about how we do workouts and how we do everything we can to support our residents in keeping their housing.”

Between 2014 and 2018, the agency obtained 462 eviction judgments against tenants and 1,070 that ended with a noneviction judgment, according to a Hennepin County website that tracks these court actions. The county data show the second-largest eviction filer is Huntington Place Apartments, a property in Brooklyn Park that has 834 units.

A noneviction judgment means a landlord may not have shown up for a hearing, the landlord and resident came to an agreement on paying the back rent, or a tenant may have successfully fought off eviction after withholding rent because of maintenance issues.

Tarnishing tenants’ history

Part of the problem with evictions is how long they stay on tenants’ records and how often landlords can use that against them, said Ellen Sahli, president of the Family Housing Fund, an organization focused on housing access and affordability in the Twin Cities.

While state law allows residents to pursue eviction expungements, tenant advocates say that process can be costly and time-consuming for low-income households, forcing them to forgo it altogether. Sahli said that’s why it’s important for landlords and tenants in financial distress to know in advance that assistance exists and agencies are there to make sure that help is readily available.

“Our goal is to eliminate eviction filings, which means we have to have the services and support in place before so that the family gets the kind of help they need to avert the filing completely,” Sahli said.

Luke Grundman, a managing attorney for housing issues at Mid-Minnesota Legal Aid, said that his public-housing clients are often confused by the housing agency’s letters or unclear about where to go for help. The organization talked to the housing authority about changing the wording of the letters, sending texts and reaching out to emergency contacts to communicate with residents.

“Many times people who are in housing court facing a [Minneapolis Housing Authority] eviction are genuinely surprised,” Grundman said. “They didn’t even realize it was happening. They didn’t realize they were at the stage where they could be homeless in a matter of days.”

The housing authority says residents are given plenty of notice before action is taken. It does not file an eviction against residents until the second month after they’re late and even then always offers a settlement during the court appearance. Residents are sent two letters before an eviction is filed. While residents may reach a settlement with the agency, they’ll also be responsible for paying back the $297 eviction filing fee. The agency allows residents to pay the fee over three months.

Residents’ monthly statements include numbers to call for rent assistance and information about talking to property managers about hardships, said Mary McGovern, a tenant at the Elliot Twins apartments and president of the Minneapolis High Rise Representative Council, which advocates for the 5,000-plus tenants living in the housing authority’s high-rise apartments.

“It’s not like 1, 2, 3 and you’re out the door; they don’t work that way,” McGovern said.

She said tenants “would be lost” without the social workers from Volunteers of America who help residents with family problems, money issues, food assistance, clothing and paying their utilities.

“A lot of people struggle to afford housing and they manage to pay the rent, but we’re talking about incomes that are so low … you have to wonder whether they can even afford that rent,” said Andrew Aurand, vice president of research for the National Low-Income Housing Coalition.

Looking for solutions

The housing authority’s Scott said the agency formed an internal task force on eviction preventions to find solutions. The agency realized that tenants receiving benefits checks were not always getting them at the beginning or end of the month, often causing them to be late on rent.

In addition, the agency worked with the Hennepin County emergency-assistance fund so that tenants could apply for help using their initial notice of late rent instead of having to wait for an eviction notice for their application.

The housing authority also conducted a survey this spring of 150 residents. It found that 75% said they had a late rent payment, with the top reasons including the due date, medical problems, family problems, lack of income and that they forgot. The survey also found that less than half of the respondents agreed or strongly agreed that they “know where to get help with rent.”

“I think we’re getting better at working through the needs of residents, working with policy issues, working with partners at the county to facilitate residents keeping their housing,” Scott said. “We’re on that path and we’ll continue to refine it as best as we can.”"
The administration said it was moving these agencies for efficiency. Now the truth comes out.,https://www.washingtonpost.com,['Editorial Board'],08-10-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-administration-said-it-was-moving-these-agencies-for-efficiency-now-the-truth-comes-out/2019/08/10/854ccd10-b91a-11e9-b3b4-2bb69e8c4e39_story.html,"“WHAT A wonderful way to streamline government,” said acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney at a gala last week, referring to the Agriculture Department’s plan to move two of its science agencies out of the D.C. area to the Kansas City region. In celebrating this controversial decision, Mr. Mulvaney laid bare the thinly veiled motivations behind uprooting researchers: not efficiency, but to drive talented workers out.

Since the relocation announcement in June, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has defended the controversial proposal, arguing that relocation will bring researchers closer to the subjects of their research and save the agency millions in employment costs and rent. But the haste and amateurishness of the process raised suspicions about true motives. And, now, Mr. Mulvaney has confirmed those suspicions by celebrating the gutting of the Economic Research Service, a federal statistics agency, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which oversees grant money for agricultural research. The motivation fits with the administration’s broader hostility toward experts, science and honest data.

In June, a Politico analysis found that the Trump administration barred dozens of climate-change-related investigations from being publicized. Politico also discovered that the research service issued news releases on only two studies directly related to climate change — both of which were favorable to the meat industry.

Even if relocation were justifiable, the USDA’s handling of the process has, so far, been deplorable. The more than 500 agency employees affected by the move were given 33 days to decide between their career and the lives they had established in the District. Approximately two-thirds chose resignation over reassignment. The loss of talent and institutional knowledge creates an irreparable tear in the fabric of the agency — and an entirely foreseeable one. If the USDA’s plan was to “drain the swamp,” as Mr. Mulvaney put it, then it certainly is succeeding — if by swamp, as Post columnist Catherine Rampell wrote, they mean civil service expertise. But if the department wants to carry out its true mission of helping rural America, it should rethink this move.

Research by the USDA is vital to farmers. As economic challenges mount with the ongoing trade war with China, and as climate change poses a growing threat to farmlands worldwide, the work by the ERS and NIFA is indispensable. They not only help farmers improve efficiency and productivity but also help smooth access to international markets.

The relocation is not a done deal. The USDA’s watchdog, the Office of Inspector General, published a report this month that challenges the relocation, which is meant to be completed by Sept. 30. By acting without budgetary approval from Congress, the USDA may have violated the 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act. Rather than waiting for a judicial rebuke, the department should cancel the relocation now."
DC lawyer's trial to serve as test for Justice Department's foreign lobbying enforcement work,https://www.cnn.com,"['Katelyn Polantz', 'Erica Orden']",08-11-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/11/politics/greg-craig-trial-justice-department-foreign-lobbying/index.html,"(CNN) One of Washington's most well-known and accomplished lawyers, the former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig, goes to trial Monday in Washington in a case likely to be seen as a litmus test for the Justice Department's efforts regarding foreign lobbying.

Craig is accused of concealing material information in connection with work he performed for Ukraine after he left the Obama administration and joined the Skadden firm as a partner. According to his charges, he cut a deal in 2012 to earn $4 million from a Ukrainian client for the law firm by producing a supposedly independent report on the jailing of a political rival of the then-Ukraine president.

Craig had been caught up in the expansive federal probe of Ukrainian influence in American politics tracked by special counsel Robert Mueller and now led by the Justice Department's National Security Division and US Attorney's Office in DC.

The trial will discuss the influence efforts by Mueller defendants Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, both former Trump campaign leadership, who allegedly had tapped Craig to help with pushing a slanted report on Ukrainian politics among American media, according to court records.

The trial will also be, in many ways, a defining moment for the Justice Department's foreign lobbying enforcement efforts.

In March, the department said it would boost its pursuit of foreign influence operations, in part by appointing a prosecutor who worked on special counsel Mueller's team to lead a revamped unit intended to crack down on unregistered foreign agents.

In making the announcement, the department's national security division head, John Demers, specifically cited a settlement involving Craig's former law firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, over the work at issue in Craig's trial as spurring the department's interest in enforcement regarding foreign lobbying under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, also known as FARA.

The overhauled unit at Justice now has 11 prosecutors, an increase from years prior. The Craig trial -- with its high profile witnesses and recognizable defendant -- poses a test of the Justice Department's stepped up efforts.

""Disregard for truth undermines our political discourse and it infects our policymaking. If the people don't have the facts, democracy can't work,"" US District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson , who is overseeing the Craig trial and presided over the Manafort case in Washington, said about these types of alleged lobbying violations at Manafort's sentencing.

Major trials regarding foreign lobbying violations have been few since the law was enacted in the 1930s.

This year alone, there have been two foreign lobbying cases stemming from Mueller's work: the Craig case and another recent trial in Virginia, where Bijan Kian, a former lobbying partner of Michael Flynn's, was convicted for working as a foreign agent of Turkey . A judge is still considering whether prosecutors presented enough evidence at Kian's trial for the conviction to stand.

""Every law firm and lobbyist who does this stuff has woken up,"" said Andrew Herman, a defense lawyer who counsels clients on foreign lobbying registration. ""Nobody would wish what's happening to Craig on anyone. I think he will be the poster child regardless of the result.""

A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment on the potential impact the Craig trial will have for FARA enforcement.

While coordinating with Manafort's operation, Craig also allegedly reached out to American reporters to shape news coverage of the report -- and, through it all, hadn't disclosed to the Justice Department he was working for Ukrainians, according to prosecutors. Federal law requires those who work on public relations or lobbying efforts in the US to register with the Justice Department under FARA.

Manafort and Gates both admitted to working illegally on the report on behalf of Ukrainian politicians as part of their guilty pleas in the Mueller investigation last year.

In some ways, the Craig case has already imposed significant hurdles for the Justice Department, having bounced between numerous prosecutors' offices before being charged, CNN has reported. After the investigation of Craig was opened by Mueller in 2017, the special counsel's office referred the case to the US Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, which devoted significant resources to the investigation.

But that office, despite its aggressive reputation, declined to bring charges, determining that they didn't have sufficient evidence. In January of this year, the case was transferred yet again, this time to US Attorney's office for the District of Columbia.

But by the time Craig was finally charged in April by the DC office, the statute of limitations for the initial matter for which he was investigated -- failure to register as a foreign agent -- had expired.

Craig was charged at the time with two crimes: making false statements and concealing material information in connection with work he performed for Ukraine. He pleaded not guilty.

But in recent weeks, the Justice Department faced another setback: the judge threw out the charge over making false statements.

If found guilty of the remaining charge, Craig faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison. It is unlikely he would have a sentence so steep, however. Craig was released on a personal recognizance bond following his arraignment in April.

Craig is the highest-profile Democrat to be indicted in connection to Mueller's work. He's so well connected in Washington that the list of people who may be mentioned or who may testify at his trial, according to court records, reads like a who's who list of power and influence inside the Beltway.

Aside from the obvious names of Mueller defendants like Manafort and Gates, jurors will be asked if they've known former congressmen like Jim Slattery, journalists like David Sanger of the New York Times, longtime Clinton adviser Cheryl Mills, lobbyist and political analyst Doug Schoen, prominent white collar lawyers like Brendan Sullivan or the Atlanta judge Clinton Deveaux. The list even includes two Kennedy family members: Victoria Reggie Kennedy, the widow of Sen. Ted Kennedy; and Timothy Shriver, the chairman of the Special Olympics and nephew of the former President. It's unclear if they would be mentioned or testify, either by presenting evidence or speaking about Craig's character as part of his defense.

Gates is expected to testify as a witness for the prosecution, though what he will say on the stand, especially about his interactions with Manafort, will be limited, prosecutors told the court.

Soon after the Mueller investigation began, defense lawyers in Washington realized how Mueller was spooking lawyers and lobbyists engaged in foreign work, and began pitching their advice on foreign lobbying registration to clients."

Trump administration says it won't approve Roundup cancer-warning labels,https://www.cbsnews.com,[],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/roundup-labels-trump-administration-says-it-wont-approve-glyphosate-warning-labels/,"The Trump administration has told companies not to warn customers about products that contain glyphosate, a decision targeted at a California regulation that requires labels to warn consumers that the Roundup ingredient is potentially cancer-causing.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says it will no longer approve labels warning glyphosate is known to cause cancer. The chemical, marketed as a weed killer by Monsanto under the brand Roundup, is currently the focus of lawsuits from thousands of consumers alleging it caused their cancers.

Such labels are ""irresponsible,"" EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a statement. He cited the EPA's conclusions that the chemical doesn't represent a cancer risk.

The decision from the EPA highlights the growing debate over the safety of glyphosate, with scientific research often reaching contradictory conclusions. The World Health Organization's cancer agency has said that the chemical is ""possibly carcinogenic to humans,"" yet on the other side of the debate are studies that refute reports of glyphosate's risks, such as a long-term study of agricultural workers that didn't find a link between Roundup and cancer.

What you need to know about glyphosate, the cancer-linked chemical found in Cheerios

Since Bayer bought Roundup maker Monsanto in June 2018, the company has lost lost three high-profile court cases that alleged the chemical caused cancer.

""It is critical that federal regulatory agencies like EPA relay to consumers accurate, scientific based information about risks that pesticides may pose to them,"" Wheeler said in the statement. ""EPA's notification to glyphosate registrants is an important step to ensuring the information shared with the public on a federal pesticide label is correct and not misleading.""

California's law

California requires warning labels on glyphosate products because the International Agency for Research on Cancer has said it is ""probably carcinogenic.""

Monsanto has sued to block California's warning label requirements. A federal judge blocked California from enforcing the labels while the lawsuit continues."
Labor Department sends White House proposal for limited overtime expansion,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-12-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/labor-department-sends-white-house-proposal-for-scaling-back-overtime-expansion,"The Labor Department sent a proposed rewrite of the federal regulations covering overtime to the White House Monday for final approval, according to Trump administration officials.

The regulations are expected to expand the number of workers covered by the rule by an estimated 1.2 million, fewer than the 4 million envisioned in an attempt to rewrite the rule by the Obama administration.

""I can confirm the rule has been submitted for review,"" said a senior administration official. A Labor Department official also said it had been sent over to the White House Office of Management and Budget. The proposed draft of the rule will be posted online Tuesday. There is no scheduled date for when the administration will complete its review of the proposal. Liberal groups are expected to challenge the change once it becomes official.

The Fair Labor Standards Act says employees must be paid time-and-a-half once they work more than 40 hours in a week. However, businesses may exempt workers from the requirement if their duties are ""managerial"" in nature and they reach a certain salary threshold.

The Trump administration's proposed revamp would set that salary threshold at those earning up to $35,000 annually, up from the current level of $23,000. The Obama administration attempted to set the threshold at $47,000 in 2014, but its rule change was struck down in federal court before it could go into effect. The matter was unresolved when the Trump administration took office, and it opted to rewrite the overtime rule itself, announcing its version in March.

Former Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta argued during his Senate confirmation that while the rate should be increased, the Obama administration set the threshold too high and created problems for smaller businesses that needed more flexibility.

The Trump administration's move has drawn criticism from labor groups for rolling back the prior administration's changes and praise from the business community for loosening the regulations."
Health organization calls DHS migrant welfare rule potentially 'catastrophic',https://www.upi.com,[],08-12-2019,2019,8,https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2019/08/12/Health-organization-calls-DHS-migrant-welfare-rule-potentially-catastrophic/6241565631805/,"Aug. 12 (UPI) -- The American Heart Association has called a new decision to keep illegal immigrants from receiving publicly-provided healthcare benefits ""catastrophic.""

The public charge policy, finalized Monday by the Department of Homeland Security, is a new rule that will allow immigration officials to deny green cards to illegal immigrants who rely on food stamps, housing vouchers, Medicaid and other types of public assistance.

The 800-page rule change, which will be published Wednesday in the Federal Register, will take effect in October.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services will now be able to evaluate an applicant's age, education level, financial resources, as well as the need for welfare benefits before granting permits to work in the United States.

""This rule allows our government to discriminate against individuals based on their health status or the health of a member of their family,"" the AHA said in a statement. ""Simply put, implementation of this rule will harm the health and well-being of immigrants, their families, and the communities in which they reside.""

The AHA says programs like Medicaid, Medicare, SNAP and Section 8 were intended for the most at-risk legal immigrants who otherwise couldn't afford to gain access to healthcare, nutrition and housing. This new rule, the organization says, would hurt the health and well-being of these vulnerable immigrants and their families.

This change is a part of an overall push from President Donald Trump to deny illegal immigrants access to federal programs.

""For over a century, the public charge ground of inadmissibility has been part of our nation's immigration laws. President Trump has delivered on his promise to the American people to enforce long-standing immigration law by defining the public charge inadmissibility ground that has been on the books for years,"" said Ken Cuccinelli, the acting director at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, in a news release.

National Immigration Law Center, a Los Angeles-based advocacy group, has announced plans to file a lawsuit opposing the new rule.

""We look forward to seeing Trump in court -- again -- and to seeing justice prevail as we defend immigrant families and our democracy,"" said Marielena Hincapié, executive director of the NILC, in a news release.

RELATED Heart deaths declined after Obamacare went into effect

A recent report estimated this rule change could prevent 1.9 million children from receiving public healthcare and food assistance.

A Centers for Immigration Studies reported about 63 percent of non-immigrant households currently receive welfare benefits.

""We continue to oppose this change to public charge policy. The restrictions it places on access to critical support services, and the health consequences that will occur as a result, are short-sighted and not in our nation's long-term best interest,"" the AHA said."
Trump's DOJ hid shocking report on growing terror threat from white supremacists,https://www.salon.com,[],08-09-2019,2019,8,https://www.salon.com/2019/08/09/trumps-doj-hid-shocking-report-on-growing-terror-threat-from-white-supremacists/,"The Justice Department suppressed a report showing that suspected white supremacists were responsible for all race-based domestic terror incidents last year.

The report by New Jersey’s Office of Homeland Security Preparedness was distributed throughout DHS and to federal agencies like the FBI earlier this year before it was obtained by Yahoo News. The document includes data Congress has sought from the Trump administration but the Justice Department has been “unable or unwilling” to provide.

The report shows that 25 of 46 suspects in 32 domestic terrorism incidents were identified as white supremacists. The 25 suspected white supremacist suspects were responsible for all “race-based” incidents while others were deemed “anti-government extremists” and “single-issue extremists.”

“This map reflects 32 domestic terrorist attacks, disrupted plots, threats of violence, and weapons stockpiling by individuals with a radical political or social agenda who lack direction or influence from foreign terrorist organizations in 2018,” the report said.

The map and data in the document were circulated through the DOJ and law enforcement agencies in April, which is around the time that the Senate Judiciary Committee requested the DOJ provide data showing the number of white supremacists involved in domestic terrorism.

Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., told Yahoo News that the committee still has not received the data.

“I’m troubled by the lack of transparency, given that we haven’t received this critical information after several requests to the FBI and DOJ,” Booker said. “They cannot and should not remain silent in the face of such a dangerous threat.”

An aide to Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., who also sits on the committee, told the outlet that the DOJ and FBI both told the panel they were “unable or unwilling to provide precise data on white supremacist terrorism, and neither agency has responded to our repeated follow-up questions since the briefing.”

The request to the DOJ came after the Trump administration consolidated 11 categories it used to identify domestic terrorism to four. One of the categories was a catch-all “racially-motivated violent extremism.”

“This new category inappropriately combines incidents involving white supremacists and so-called ‘Black identity extremists,’ a fabricated term based on a faulty assessment of a small number of isolated incidents,” the committee’s Democrats said in a letter to Attorney General Bill Barr and FBI Director Christopher Wray. The letter said the senators were “deeply concerned that this reclassification downplays the significance of the white supremacist threat.”

The letter also noted that the senators were not provided with data they had requested at earlier hearings and briefings.

Durbin’s aide accused the Trump administration of trying to make it more difficult to track violence by white supremacists by obscuring it under the “race-based extremists” label.

“The Trump administration’s irresponsible decision to stop tracking white supremacist incidents as a separate category of domestic terrorism obfuscates the extent of this threat,” Durbin’s aide told Yahoo News. “This highlights the problem with not specifically tracking white supremacist attacks. If we do not understand the scope of this problem, we cannot effectively combat it.”

Obfuscation appears to be the game plan. Asked what he would do to combat white supremacy on Wednesday, Trump both-sided the issue like he did after Charlottesville. “I don’t like it,” he said,” whether it’s white supremacy, whether it’s any other kind of supremacy. Whether it’s antifa.”

Advertisement:

It isn’t just rhetoric. The Trump administration has taken numerous steps to roll back efforts to combat white supremacist groups while pushing for increased legal action against Antifa by labeling them a terrorist group.

Under Trump, the Department of Homeland Security has redirected resources away from fighting far-right and white supremacist groups. The Los Angeles Times reported that DHS had slashed its office handling domestic terrorism from $21 million and 41 full-time or contracted employees to just $2.6 million and 10 full-time employees in 2017.

The Trump administration also declined to renew an Obama administration Countering Violent Extremism Grant Program and canceled the only grant specifically aimed at combating white supremacism. Since Trump took over, 85 percent of the DHS “Countering Violent Extremism” have instead targeted Muslims and other minority groups, according to an analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice.

“While white supremacy is not a new phenomenon in America, it’s incredibly troubling the way the movement has been emboldened,” Sen. Booker told Yahoo News, “and the administration’s efforts to obfuscate the data on these terrorist incidents simply defies logic.”"
USDA tried to cast doubt on UW-linked study about climate effects on nutrients in rice,https://www.seattletimes.com,"['Hal Bernton', 'Seattle Times Staff Reporter']",08-11-2019,2019,8,https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/science/usda-made-behind-the-scenes-effort-to-discredit-uw-assisted-study-looking-at-climate-change-impacts-on-rice/,"U.S. Department of Agriculture officials made a behind-the-scenes effort last year to cast doubt on a study co-authored by two University of Washington researchers about how climate change would affect the nutrients in rice.

The UW scientists were part of an international team that included two federal agricultural scientists. They studied how increased levels of carbon dioxide forecast for the end of the century could diminish the nutritional value of rice, and joined together to co-author a peer-reviewed study accepted by a journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

In May 2018, weeks before the scheduled publication, findings in the rice study became a source of concern for program leaders of the USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS).

“The narrative isn’t supported by the data in the paper,” wrote Sharon Durham, a department public affairs specialist in a May 7, 2018, email to a Jeff Hodson, communications director for the UW School of Public Health.

Durham noted the USDA had decided not to send out a news release to publicize the study. “Please let me know how you will proceed with your own press release.”

A statement Durham released to Politico and later to The Seattle Times said the concerns had nothing to do with the study’s focus on climate change. They came from career scientists, Durham wrote, adding that no political appointees viewed the draft news release before the decision was made not to send it out.

“The nutrition program leaders at ARS disagreed with the implication in the paper that 600 million people are at risk of vitamin deficiency,” the statement said.

But a veteran researcher with a lead role in the study thinks the politics of climate change in the Trump administration’s USDA factored into what he views as an attempt to discredit the findings.

“It was a very bizarre set of circumstances. I had been at USDA, altogether for 26 years, and nothing like that had ever occurred to me,” Lewis Ziska said.

The Agricultural Research Service where Ziska worked — and recently resigned from — has a long history of high-quality science that stretches back through decades of Democratic and Republican administrations.

But under President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly questioned the science linking fossil-fuel pollution to rising global temperatures, Ziska said researchers who focus on sensitive topics such as climate change have become more cautious. Some worry their funding may get cut or they could get reassigned if their work comes to the attention of higher-level officials.

“There is basically a miasma of fear,” Ziska said.

Academic freedom

The USDA 2018 criticism of the rice study, first reported by Politico, did spur a response at the UW, which receives grants from the agency. The interim dean of the School of Public Health at that time was Joel Kaufman. He reviewed the study and reached out to the two UW researchers — Kristie Ebi and Adam Drewnowski.

In a May 15, 2018, email to Vice Provost Mary Lidstrom, Kaufman wrote that the methods and results seem straightforward, and the UW researchers involved in the study “stand behind the scientific content…I’m bringing you into the conversation on the possibility that you would be concerned about the potential risk of irritating the USDA or other potential funders. Do you want or need to be involved in considering this issue?”

“For academic freedom aspects, if the authors are supporting the press release, the university will not interfere,” Lidstrom wrote back.

One week later, the UW sent out its news release.

The multiyear study looked at what happens to a range of rice strains when grown under carbon-dioxide concentrations at end-of-the-century levels, which are forecast to be markedly higher due to the combustion of fossil fuels. The study involved eight researchers from the U.S., Japan, Australia and China. In test plots, some rice was grown with the higher levels of carbon dioxide, while control plots received no additional carbon dioxide.

The UW news release noted the study showed how rice grown at the century’s end is expected to have lower levels of four B vitamins as well as less protein, zinc and iron, and it noted that the impacts will have a disproportionate impact on poor countries where rice is a dietary mainstay.

The study had a much rockier path through the USDA bureaucracy.

Initially, Ziska said, the study appeared to be moving smoothly through an internal department review in the early months of 2018.

The paper also completed an independent peer review organized by editors of Science Advances that involved scrutiny from at least two independent experts, according to a statement from the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

But in early May, shortly before the scheduled publication, Ziska said, he unexpectedly received a fresh round of questions from within the department’s Agricultural Research Service and he then found that a USDA news release he had helped to prepare about the study had been spiked.

Durham, in a statement to The Seattle Times, said all research service papers follow the same review and clearance process. “This paper was no exception.”

Media interest

Despite the lack of USDA support for the study, promotional efforts by UW and the editors of Science Advances helped stir media interest, with The Washington Post, The New York Times and other outlets in the U.S. and internationally reporting on the findings.

The USDA did make Ziska available for interviews. But after the splash of publicity for the study faded, Ziska, disillusioned, decided the time had come to leave. Now at Columbia University, he will continue his research on the impacts of a warming world on agriculture.

Ebi, his UW colleague, said Ziska’s departure is a significant loss for the department at a time when it’s important to follow through on research to determine what can be done to counteract the impacts of the declining nutritional values of rice on the global poor who depend on this food.

“We need to understand the breadth and depth of these problems, and what the solutions are,” Ebi said. “It is critically important science, and USDA should be involved.”"
State Department foreign service officer resigns in blistering criticism of Trump,https://www.cnn.com,['Jennifer Hansler'],08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/08/politics/fso-resigns-washington-post-op-ed/index.html,"(CNN) A foreign service officer resigned from the State Department effective Thursday, writing in a blistering op-ed in The Washington Post that he could no longer serve in ""The Complacent State,"" particularly in the wake of the El Paso mass shooting.

Chuck Park wrote in the op-ed that during his almost 10 years in the foreign service he ""worked to spread what (he) believed were American values: freedom, fairness and tolerance.""

""But more and more I found myself in a defensive stance, struggling to explain to foreign peoples the blatant contradictions at home,"" he wrote.

Park said that after the election of President Donald Trump, he had remained ""complacent"" and had ""let career perks silence (his) conscience.""

""I let free housing, the countdown to a pension and the prestige of representing a powerful nation overseas distract me from ideals that once seemed so clear to me. I can't do that anymore,"" Park wrote.

""My son, born in El Paso on the American side of that same Rio Grande where the bodies of Óscar Alberto Martínez Ramírez and his daughter were discovered, in the same city where 22 people were just killed by a gunman whose purported 'manifesto' echoed the inflammatory language of our President, turned 7 this month. I can no longer justify to him, or to myself, my complicity in the actions of this administration. That's why I choose to resign,"" he said.

In an email to CNN, Park clarified that he made the decision to resign before the El Paso shooting, ""though it certainly reaffirmed it.""

Writing in the Post, Park noted that he has not seen an ""organized resistance from within"" to the Trump presidency, but rather ""The Complacent State.""

""Among my colleagues at the State Department, I have met neither the unsung hero nor the cunning villain of Deep State lore,"" he wrote.

""One thing I agree with the conspiracy theorists about: The Deep State, if it did exist, would be wrong,"" he said, noting that foreign service officers pledge to serve at the pleasure of the President -- or else they should quit.

Park told CNN that the reception to the piece has been ""almost uniformly positive"" with ""some mea culpas from personal friends still in the service; some offers of support as I transition to whatever is next.""

Asked why he chose to highlight his resignation in such a public way, Park said, ""I meant the piece more as allocution than a call to action or challenge to people in a similar situation, though most have read it as the latter.""

""Though we are keeping the metaphorical lights on, we are not the heroes that some make us out to be. The real 'resistance' must come from American voters in 2020,"" he said.

Park's cutting public rebuke is the latest by a former diplomat of the sitting President.

John Feeley, the former US ambassador to Panama, retired in March 2018. He wrote in The Washington Post that he made his decision shortly after the deadly rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, noting ""The President's failure to condemn the white supremacists and neo-Nazis who provoked the violence made me realize that my values were not his values.""

""I resigned because the traditional core values of the United States, as manifested in the President's National Security Strategy and his foreign policies, have been warped and betrayed. I could no longer represent him personally and remain faithful to my beliefs about what makes America truly great,"" Feeley wrote.

Roberta Jacobson, who resigned as US ambassador to Mexico in May 2018, told NPR shortly after that Trump's ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policies were ""draconian and frankly un-American.""

She said ""part of the impetus"" for her departure ""was the increasing difficulty I had in trying to defend some of these policies and in trying to work with a Mexican government that was quite keen to work with us, only to see that sort of blown up periodically by tweets or rallies about the wall or about, you know, characterizing Mexicans, which was not what I experienced.""

Jacobson also penned a New York Times op-ed later that year detailing the ""disorder"" of working under the Trump administration and warning of deteriorating trust between Mexico and the US.

James Melville stepped down as US ambassador to Estonia in 2018 because he ""could no longer support President Trump's policies and rhetoric regarding NATO, our European allies and Russia."""
"Gillibrand pledges to direct Justice Department to ""infiltrate"" white supremacist groups",https://www.cbsnews.com,['Camilo Montoya-Galvez'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kirsten-gillibrand-on-face-the-nation-pledges-to-instruct-justice-department-to-infiltrate-white-supremacist-groups/,"In the wake of the anti-immigrant and anti-Latino massacre in El Paso last week, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, one of seven Democratic senators running for president, vowed to carry out a concerted crackdown on white supremacist groups if elected, saying she would order federal investigators to penetrate racist organizations and thwart potential violent attacks.

""As president I would direct my Department of Justice to investigate white supremacy and other domestic terrorist groups,"" Gillibrand said on ""Face the Nation"" Sunday. ""To infiltrate them, to make sure we know if they're planning attacks and to actually combat white supremacy in society because these groups are domestic terrorists.""

The New York Democrat said domestic terrorism should be a federal crime and expressed support for a bill spearheaded by her colleague Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois that would bolster the government's efforts to combat domestic terrorist movements.

According to court documents unsealed Friday, the 21-year-old white man suspected of killing 22 people inside a Walmart in El Paso last Saturday admitted to police that he targeted Mexicans. A manifesto he purportedly authored that federal investigators are scrutinizing denounces the growing Latino community in Texas as an ""invasion.""

Like other high-profile Democrats, Gillibrand drew a direct link between President Trump's rhetoric on immigration and the apparent motives of the gunman.

""His words have consequences, and the words he has been using have been hateful and divisive and racist and has truly emboldened white supremacy and hate crimes across this country,"" she said Sunday.

Asked if singling out the president for his rhetoric in the aftermath of two mass shootings might ratchet up tensions in the country, Gillibrand said Mr. Trump is the one making matters worse.

""He is not leading us in the right direction,"" she said. ""He has used words like 'infestation.' He's used words like 'invasion.' That is creating a climate where people are literally today fueled by anger and hate. They are hunting down other people using weapons of war. That's what we're up against right now."""
Editorial: An EPA decision reviving Alaska’s Pebble Mine endangers Bristol Bay and a vibrant fishing economy,https://www.latimes.com,[],08-09-2019,2019,8,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2019-08-09/epa-alaska-pebble-mine-bristol-bay-salmon-trump,"Just five years ago the Environmental Protection Agency determined that a proposal to dig a massive open-pit copper and gold mine near southwest Alaska’s Bristol Bay — one of the world’s most important salmon fisheries — threatened an environmental disaster. So it issued rules to severely curtail the potential project.

What a difference an election makes. Shortly after President Trump’s appointee, Scott Pruitt, took over the EPA in 2017 he met with the chief executive of Pebble Limited Partnership, owned by Canada-based Northern Dynasty Minerals, and then just hours later rescinded the Obama administration directive to protect the sensitive wetland area from mining activities. Pruitt later backed off and sent the action for a fuller regulatory review — and then quit his job under a storm of criticism about ethical lapses.

But the EPA has continued Pruitt’s campaign to loosen environmental restrictions and greenlight controversial projects, and on Tuesday the agency announced that it would not use its veto authority under the Clean Water Act to block the mine. That frees the Army Corps of Engineers to decide whether or not to approve the project. (Interestingly, the Army Corps’ preliminary environmental analysis of the project was criticized as insufficient by a Seattle-based EPA official — the same one who, apparently under pressure from superiors in Washington, D.C., rescinded the Obama-era directive. Yes, it can make your head spin.)

Environmentalists, including Natural Resources Defense Council attorney Joel Reynolds, accuse the EPA of abandoning its own findings and opening the door for the Trump administration to deliver a “gift to a foreign mining corporation at the expense of Bristol Bay’s fish, aquatic resources and community.” We would add that the EPA has also abandoned common sense. Mining is an exceedingly messy endeavor which historically has ravaged landscapes and caused significant environmental degradation — just the kind of thing the EPA is supposed to protect against. The agency’s absurd decision to reverse itself and let the Pebble Mine permitting process proceed must be undone either through an unlikely reconsideration by the EPA, legal challenges, or, best yet, rejecting Trump and his cockamamie and dangerous approaches to economic development in the 2020 election .

What’s at stake in Alaska? The proposal is for an open-pit mine and support operations with a potential footprint as large as Manhattan, and a pit descending nearly three-quarters as deep as the Grand Canyon, according to an EPA analysis (which the developers have disputed). Even if it were only half that size, that is an extraordinary amount of environmental degradation at the mine site itself, which would include massive pits to hold millions of tons of mine waste and other leftovers of the mining process — much of it laden with toxic chemicals.

And the site is near two rivers that empty into Bristol Bay, which means that not only would the project destroy thousands of acres of near-pristine habitat and wetlands at the mining site, but it would also imperil the environmental health of Bristol Bay itself — something the Obama EPA recognized. As have the people of Alaska: 65% approved a measure in 2014 that gives the state Legislature veto power over future projects in the Bristol Bay watershed if it determines that the salmon fishery is at risk , a veto it ought to keep handy should federal regulators allow this mine to proceed.

There’s the friction point. Bristol Bay supports a vibrant, long-running economy based on a sustainable fishery — 14,000 jobs in a $1.5 billion-a-year economy, according to some estimates — as well as tourism and other non-extractive businesses. Allowing the mine to go forward would sacrifice the existing and more environmentally friendly economy for gold and copper extraction that could be disastrous for the environment.

The Trump administration is playing favorites here. Its affection for extractive industries has already put hundreds of thousands of acres of public lands in the West in play for invasive mining leases for oil, gas, uranium and just about anything else of value the mining industry can find. And yes, many of these materials are vital to economic development, but the Trump administration has earned the nation’s skepticism over whether, in adopting policies and weighing proposed projects, it can be relied upon to shepherd our natural resources in a balanced, sustainable and sensible manner."
