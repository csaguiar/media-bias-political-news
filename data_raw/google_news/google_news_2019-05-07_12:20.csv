Trump pardons ex-Army lieutenant convicted of killing suspected Al Qaeda terrorist in 2009,https://www.foxnews.com,['Samuel Chamberlain'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/michael-behenna-pardon-donald-trump-iraq-war-al-qaeda,"President Trump has pardoned a former Army lieutenant who was convicted in 2009 of killing an Iraqi prisoner suspected of being an Al Qaeda terrorist, the White House announced Monday evening.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders cited ""broad support"" for Michael Behenna, of Edmond, Okla., ""from the military, Oklahoma elected officials, and the public"" -- including 37 generals and admirals, along with a former Pentagon inspector general -- as the reason for Trump's clemency grant. Sanders also said Behenna had been a ""model prisoner"" while serving his sentence.

""In light of these facts, Mr. Behenna is entirely deserving of this Grant of Executive Clemency,"" Sanders concluded.

A military court originally sentenced Behenna to 25 years for unpremeditated murder in a combat zone. However, the Army's highest appellate court noted concern about how the trial court had handled Behenna's claim of self-defense, Sanders said. The Army Clemency and Parole Board reduced his sentence to 15 years and paroled him in 2014, as soon as he was eligible.

Behenna acknowledged during his 2008 trial that instead of taking prisoner Ali Mansur home as he was ordered, he took the man to a railroad culvert, stripped him, and then questioned him at gunpoint about a roadside bombing that had killed two members of Behenna's platoon.

Behenna, who was 24 at the time, said he acted in self-defense when Mansur threw a chunk of concrete at him and reached for the lieutenant’s handgun. Army prosecutors said the argument didn’t stand up because Behenna was already pointing his weapon at the prisoner.

In 2018, Behenna's parents told Fox News the prosecution failed to disclose that their own expert's analysis supported their son’s version of events. The expert felt so strongly that he reached out to the Behennas about his findings.

Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter initially requested a pardon for Behenna in February 2018 and renewed his request last month. Hunter said he believed Behenna's conviction was unjustified because of erroneous jury instructions and the failure of prosecutors to turn over evidence supporting a self-defense claim. The White House statement said that former Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin and ""numerous members"" of Oklahoma's congressional delegation had also expressed support for Behenna.

U.S.-China Trade Talks to Resume Despite Trump’s Tariff Threat,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Keith Bradsher', 'Ana Swanson']",05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/07/business/china-us-trade-talks-liu-he-.html,"China’s top trade negotiator is heading to Washington for two days of trade talks, despite President Trump’s threat to impose new tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of Chinese goods.

China’s Commerce Ministry announced on Tuesday that Vice Premier Liu He, one of the country’s leading economic policymakers, would join a delegation of Chinese officials who will hold further trade talks on Thursday and Friday with the Trump administration. Mr. Liu is a close adviser and confidant of President Xi Jinping, China’s top leader, and his participation could improve the changes of striking a deal.

Still, the atmosphere surrounding the trade talks has shifted dramatically since a week ago, when this week’s discussions were seen as a possible last round before the two sides halted a trade war that has made world markets shudder and thrown a damper on the global economic outlook.

Mr. Liu’s participation was thrown in doubt after Mr. Trump announced in two tweets on Sunday that he would raise American tariffs on Friday to 25 percent from 10 percent for $200 billion a year in Chinese goods. The Trump administration cited what it called backpedaling by Chinese officials during talks held last week in Beijing."

Cooper began a panel discussion by speculating whether or not President Trump would accept the results of the 2020 election if he narrowly loses that quickly shifted to whether or not an ""attempted coup"" took place to oust the president.

""There absolutely was an attempted coup against him,"" CNN commentator Steve Cortes said.

""Wow... wow,"" Cooper reacted.

Cortes shot back, claiming Cooper and ""many people on the left"" of accusing Trump of ""authoritarian tendencies.""

""Hey, I'm not on the left,"" Cooper told Cortes.

Well, shortly after he suggested he was an unbiased anchor, Cooper blasted Trump for tweeting about the Kentucky Derby.

Cooper ripped ""President Seabiscuit"" for turning the Kentucky Derby ""into a whole frickin thing"" and for ""keeping with his practice of having nothing better to do.""

""The president of the United States seems to have a lot of time on his hands,"" Cooper told his viewers. ""And he can't even stand some horses getting uninterrupted airtime. He's got to be a part of every frickin news cycle. He can't help himself!""

The CNN anchor went on to mock President Trump for expressing that Maximum Security, who he referred to as the ""best horse,"" should have one and referred to the disqualification as ""political correctness.""

""Let me get something straight: President Trump is upset because the more popular candidate, or horse, the one everyone expected to win, didn’t win because of an old-timey rule?” Cooper continued. “Is it just me or does this all sound vaguely familiar and like something the president actually supports in other non-equine situations?”

He later added that Trump's reference to ""political correctness"" must have meant ""rules are for losers."""
Inaugural Official Disputes White House Account of Her Departure,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Maggie Haberman', 'Ben Protess']",05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/06/us/politics/trump-inauguration-stephanie-winston-wolkoff.html,"Ms. Winston Wolkoff said she could not discuss the inaugural spending, saying that she had signed a nondisclosure agreement with the committee that had no expiration date. If the committee “were to release me from this obligation, I would be able to speak freely without the fear of legal or financial repercussions,” she said. “Otherwise, I am regrettably unable to provide any substantive comment.”

But documents reviewed by The Times showed that she had personally received about $500,000, a figure first reported by Vanity Fair. The documents show that a further $425,000 went to three producers, two of whom are associated with Mark Burnett, the creator of the reality-television show “The Apprentice,” which brought Mr. Trump fame over 14 seasons. And $2 million of the WIS money was used to cover costs related to the events-planning firm Hargrove, the committee’s second-largest vendor, the documents show.

The bulk of the $26 million to WIS, which handled a range of production issues including the broadcasting rights, was spent on an entity created by two of the three producers, called Inaugural Productions, the documents show. Other top vendors were David Monn, a New York-based events planner, who received nearly $4 million. He worked with Ms. Winston Wolkoff on the first Governor’s Ball at the White House, according to a person close to her.

Another top vendor, PRG, was paid $2.7 million, a cost that merely covered the staging for a group of performers who worked with the casino magnate Steve Wynn, according to people briefed on the spending.

After the initial round of articles in The Times and elsewhere about Ms. Winston Wolkoff and the money received by WIS, senior administration officials privately said she had been ousted from her job, primarily because the president and the first lady were angry over the spending and because officials at both the White House and the inaugural committee had found her difficult to work with.

Yet in private communications with Ms. Winston Wolkoff on Feb. 20, 2018, a deputy White House counsel, Stefan Passantino, told her that the administration was terminating all types of “gratuitous service agreements,” the type of employment agreement she had with the White House, around the same time amid a controversy over security clearances involving other officials.

She was assured by Mr. Passantino that “you didn’t do anything wrong, and there’s nothing wrong with this kind of contract, and I don’t want you to think that this has anything to do with” the inaugural spending, she recalled. “So this is not personal.”"

CNN reported in April that US President Donald Trump had been privately eying the possibility of a new pact with Russia and China , after previously describing the New START nuclear agreement with Moscow as a ""bad deal.""

Multiple White House officials told CNN that Trump's team was looking into options for a new nuclear treaty after New START expires in 2021 which would involve China and ""include all the weapons, all the warheads, all the missiles.""

Trump said on Friday he had spoken to both Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Chinese government about a potential three-way agreement , a move which administration officials said could be one of his signature foreign policy achievements.

""China, I've already spoken to them. They very much would like to be a part of that deal. In fact, during the trade talks, we started talking about that,"" Trump said at the time.

Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-proposes-overhauls-to-measuring-poverty-cutting-americans-from-social-welfare-programs-report,"The Trump administration is weighing changes to the way poverty is measured in the United States, a move critics say would break with decades of precedent and threaten social welfare recipients, according to a Monday report.

Under the new proposals outlined by the White House Office of Management and Budget on Monday, poverty would be measured using a “chained consumer price index.” The new method, contrary to a formula that has been used since the 1960s, assumes that consumers will opt for less-expensive items as the cost of living rises. The office says that the chained CPI would reflect slower inflation growth.

In a notice published to the federal register, the Office of Management and Budget said the proposed changes to the guidelines may affect eligibility for social welfare programs like Medicaid and food stamps, Bloomberg reported.

The move is the latest effort by the Trump administration to overhaul social welfare qualifications. Last year, the president signed an executive order that directed federal agencies to toughen work requirements for social welfare recipients.

Steven Mnuchin Refuses to Release Trump’s Tax Returns to Congress,https://www.nytimes.com,['Alan Rappeport'],05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/06/us/politics/trump-tax-returns-mnuchin.html,"WASHINGTON — The Treasury Department said on Monday that it would not release President Trump’s tax returns to Congress, defying a request from House Democrats and setting up a legal battle likely to be resolved by the Supreme Court.

Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, wrote in a letter to Representative Richard E. Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, that Mr. Neal’s request for the tax returns “lacks a legitimate legislative purpose” and that he was not authorized to disclose them. The decision came after weeks of delays as Mr. Mnuchin said that his department and the Justice Department needed to study the provision of the tax code that Democrats were using to seek six years’ worth of the president’s personal and business tax returns.

The request for Mr. Trump’s taxes is the latest instance of the Trump administration rebuffing congressional oversight efforts.

“As you have recognized, the committee’s request is unprecedented, and it presents serious constitutional questions, the resolution of which may have lasting consequences for all taxpayers,” Mr. Mnuchin wrote in the one-page letter."

The House Judiciary Committee will proceed with a vote to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress on Wednesday, Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) confirmed late Monday, as the Justice Department attempts to fend off the effort ahead of a negotiating session with the Democratic-led committee on Tuesday.

Nadler's firm stance comes as he seeks punitive actions against the attorney general for defying a subpoena for special counsel Robert Mueller’s unredacted report on the Russia investigation and its underlying evidence. It also comes hours after the Justice Department put forward a last-ditch plea to negotiate with the panel, offering a Wednesday meeting but later agreeing to Nadler’s demand for a Tuesday sit-down.

Story Continued Below

“At the moment, our plans to consider holding Attorney General Barr accountable for his failure to comply with our subpoena still stand,” Nadler said in a statement. “My hope is that we make concrete progress at tomorrow’s meeting towards resolving this dispute. The committee remains committed to finding a reasonable accommodation.”

In a letter to Nadler earlier Monday, Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd invited the chairman to a negotiation session on Wednesday to discuss an “acceptable accommodation” that would potentially give more lawmakers access to a less-redacted version of the report, in addition to “possible disclosure of certain materials” cited in Mueller’s report.

Boyd’s letter came hours after the committee took its first formal step toward holding Barr in contempt of Congress for defying the panel’s subpoena for Mueller's unredacted report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, when Nadler announced that it planned to consider a contempt citation against Barr on Wednesday morning.

A vote of approval from the Democrat-led committee would send the measure to the full House for consideration later this month. Nadler said he would put the contempt proceedings on hold if the Justice Department engages in a “good-faith” effort to give Democrats access to the requested information.

“The attorney general’s failure to comply with our subpoena, after extensive accommodation efforts, leaves us no choice but to initiate contempt proceedings in order to enforce the subpoena and access the full, unredacted report,” Nadler said in a statement before the DOJ released its letter.

Democrats have argued that the redacted version Barr made public last month is insufficient to consider a potential congressional response to Mueller's findings, particularly his evidence that President Donald Trump attempted to thwart the investigation.

The committee launched its own obstruction of justice investigation against the president earlier this year. The contempt citation explicitly mentions that probe, which is also centered on allegations of “public corruption and other abuses of power” by the president.

“Attorney General Barr failed to comply with the committee’s request for these documents and thereby has hindered the committee’s constitutional, oversight, and legislative functions,” the citation states.

The contempt citation also references the Justice Department’s long-standing policy against indicting a sitting president, noting that Mueller accepted those guidelines in declining to charge Trump with obstruction of justice.

“Congress is therefore the only body able to hold the president to account for improper conduct in our tripartite system, and urgently requires the subpoenaed material to determine whether and how to proceed with its constitutional duty to provide checks and balances on the president and executive branch,” the citation states. “Otherwise, the president remains insulated from legal consequences and sits above the law.”

The Justice Department said last week it would not comply with the committee’s subpoena for the unredacted report and the underlying evidence, arguing that it amounts to illegitimate congressional oversight. Nadler gave Barr until Monday morning to respond to an augmented offer; the Justice Department did not respond to that offer, and has maintained that it would be violating the law if it complied with the Democrats’ request.

Boyd slammed Nadler for refusing to view the less-redacted version of Mueller’s report, which still includes redactions of grand-jury information. Boyd said Nadler’s refusal “naturally raises questions about the sincerity of the committee’s interest in and purported need for the redacted material.”

All six House and Senate Democrats declined to read the less-redacted version of the report offered to a select group of senior lawmakers, arguing that the offer should have included dozens more members of the committees investigating matters connected to Mueller's findings.

In response to the formal contempt notice on Monday, the committee’s top Republican, Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, called Nadler’s move “illogical and disingenuous” because the Justice Department is still negotiating with the panel.

“Democrats have launched a proxy war smearing the attorney general when their anger actually lies with the president and the special counsel, who found neither conspiracy nor obstruction,” Collins said in a statement.

Democrats have been demanding Mueller's complete report and underlying evidence for months, a call that intensified after Mueller submitted his findings to Barr in late March. But Barr held on to the report for a month while he reviewed and redacted it for several categories of sensitive information. The public version of the report he released contained limited redactions but included none of Mueller's underlying material — evidence Democrats say they need to determine whether Trump committed impeachable offenses.

Though Mueller concluded that he lacked sufficient evidence to prove any Americans aided the vast Russian effort to interfere in the 2016 election, he described repeated efforts by Trump to sideline the investigation altogether and to encourage witnesses to refrain from full cooperation.

Mueller did not formally conclude that Trump obstructed justice — a determination he said was largely a result of the DOJ restrictions against indicting a sitting president — but Barr has since used Mueller's evidence to absolve Trump of the potential crime.

Barr testified for five hours to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and described sharp disagreements with the legal theories undergirding Mueller's findings — including whether Trump's tweets can be persuasive evidence of obstruction and suggesting Mueller told him privately, despite not indicating it in his report, that his obstruction decision was not based on the longstanding DOJ restriction.

Barr skipped a hearing House Democrats had called last Thursday after his aides objected to Democrats' request to allow committee lawyers from both parties to question Barr for 30 minutes each. Democrats previously authorized Nadler to subpoena Barr a second time to compel his appearance before their committee, though he hasn't issued it yet.

The impact of a contempt citation could be simply symbolic. Republicans held Barack Obama’s attorney general, Eric Holder, in contempt of Congress for failing to turn over documents. Some Democrats have floated the possibility of using punitive enforcement mechanisms against Barr for defying their subpoena, including levying fines against the attorney general.

DOJ releases second redacted version of Mueller report over FOIA lawsuits,https://thehill.com,[],05-06-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/442400-doj-releases-second-redacted-version-of-mueller-report-over-foia,"The Department of Justice on Monday released a second redacted version of the Mueller report, but the document doesn’t appear to make public new details about the special counsel’s investigation and findings.

This redacted version of the report was released in response to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuits filed by the privacy group Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) and BuzzFeed News reporter Jason Leopold.

Leopold noted on Twitter that while the lengthy report itself doesn’t seem to provide new public information, it does shed more light on why certain information was withheld.

It appears the version of the report is identical but clearly identifies what info was withheld in response to ongoing investigations, etc. — Jason Leopold (@JasonLeopold) May 6, 2019

While the initial version of the Mueller report released last month labeled redactions in categories such as “harm to an ongoing matter” and “grand jury information,” redactions in this version of the document are aligned with certain FOIA regulations.

Leopold also tweeted out a letter the Justice Department sent him that explains the redactions made to the report under FOIA.

The letter points to FOIA exemptions pertaining to national security, grand jury proceedings and ongoing law enforcement actions. It also cites exemptions that would reveal law enforcement tactics as well as information that could violate individuals’ right to privacy and right to a fair trial or other legal processes.

Attorneys for EPIC and Leopold said in court last week that they intended to challenge each redaction made under the FOIA law.

Justice Department attorneys argued that both parties should wait until they see this newly released version of the report, suggesting that they believed it was unreasonable for each redaction to be challenged, as some would not be overturned.

District Judge Reggie Walton, who is overseeing the case, has set a series of deadlines in the lawsuits that stretch into the summer, indicating that the case will not be fully resolved for several more months.

Walton, who was nominated by former President George W. Bush, said during last week's hearing that both parties have to make challenges to the redactions ""in good faith,"" noting that the government has the right to withhold information such as grand jury matters.

He has also said that he understands the desire to quickly move forward with the case.

EPIC is also suing under FOIA for the Justice Department to release the underlying evidence used to draft the Mueller report.

The privacy group reiterated in a blog post after the second version of the report was released on Monday that it still plans to challenge each redaction made to the document.

Scott Applewhite/AP Photo Agriculture Economists flee Agriculture Dept. after feeling punished under Trump Reports showing farmers hurt by the president’s policies have drawn the ire of top officials.

Economists in the Agriculture Department's research branch say the Trump administration is retaliating against them for publishing reports that shed negative light on White House policies, spurring an exodus that included six of them quitting the department on a single day in late April.

The Economic Research Service — a source of closely read reports on farm income and other topics that can shape federal policy, planting decisions and commodity markets — has run afoul of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue with its findings on how farmers have been financially harmed by President Donald Trump's trade feuds, the Republican tax code rewrite and other sensitive issues, according to current and former agency employees.

Story Continued Below

The reports highlight the continued decline under Trump’s watch in farm income, which has dropped about 50 percent since 2013. Rural voters were a crucial source of support for Trump in 2016, and analysts say even a small retreat in 2020 could jeopardize the president’s standing in several battleground states.

“The administration didn’t appreciate some of our findings, so this is retaliation to harm the agency and send a message,” said one current ERS employee, who asked not to be named to avoid retribution.

For example, two ERS researchers presented a paper at an economic conference in early 2018 that indicated the GOP tax overhaul would largely benefit the wealthiest farmers — generating negative press coverage that staff members said irked senior officials at USDA.

Then, in August, Perdue stunned members of the roughly 300-member research service by announcing plans to bring ERS under the control of USDA’s chief economist, who reports more directly to the secretary. Equally significant, he said the USDA would move the agency out of Washington to a location closer to the U.S. heartland.

Members of the agency were also caught off-guard last summer when Perdue’s office issued an internal memo directing ERS and other research branches to include disclaimers in their peer-reviewed publications stating that the findings were “preliminary” and “should not be construed to represent any agency determination or policy” — seen as a way of watering down any unflattering data from the department’s own experts.

The move to uproot the agency has led to a brain-drain of experienced researchers. So far in fiscal 2019, non-retirement departures from the agency have more than doubled on an annualized basis compared to the previous three-year average, according to data collected by employees.

Six of the economists — made up of specialists in the agricultural economy, farm taxation and food programs with more than 50 years of combined experience at ERS — left the agency at the end of April, out of frustration with the relocation process or in some cases suspicion about Perdue’s efforts to reshape USDA’s research wing, according to coworkers. More are planning to leave in the coming months.

For his part, Perdue has said the relocation was motivated by his desire to save taxpayer dollars, bring the research service closer to major farming regions, and help attract economists who could be deterred by Washington’s high cost of living.

“I really have been a little surprised with the naysayers on this,” he said last month at a Senate Appropriations hearing, touting the move as a common-sense, cost-cutting measure.

Perdue’s office declined to provide information on the numbers of employees who’ve quit or respond to allegations of political interference in the research service.

But the secretary alluded to frustrations with the quality of USDA research in comments to POLITICO on April 30, saying that all decision-making in the department must be “fact-based.”

“In USDA, we want good scientific discovery,” Perdue said, when asked about the mandated research-disclosure language. “We want peer-based evidence there. We know that research, some has been found in the past to not have been adequately peer-reviewed in a way that created wrong information, and we’re very serious when we say we’re fact-based, data-driven decision makers. That relies on sound, replicatable science rather than opinion. What I see unfortunately happening many times is that we tried to make policy decisions based on political science rather than on sound science.”

Perdue and Trump made clear in their budget request in March that they wanted to reduce the scope of the ERS, eliminating “low priority research” into such politically sensitive areas as food stamps and environmental issues.

The White House blueprint called for slashing ERS staff levels by more than 50 percent, cutting the total number of positions from about 329 to 160.

The budget is unlikely to be approved by Congress, but members of the service say they’ve already seen the effects of Trump’s and Perdue’s preferences.

“Things like conservation, rural development, food assistance, have just been de-emphasized” in favor of the administration’s preferred topics, said one economist who left ERS because of the relocation plan.

Former ERS Administrator Susan Offutt, who oversaw the service under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, said the agency’s studies showing how USDA’s farm-subsidy programs disproportionately benefit wealthier farmers have been a “perennial irritant” to influential lobbying groups, but an “over-the-top reaction” to clamp down on such reports would be unprecedented.

“Of course, this is not the story the farm lobby wants to tell about struggling farmers,” said Offutt. “Controlling ERS would stop unflattering news about federal farm subsidies favoring high-income, high-wealth farm households from reaching the public.”

Lawmakers have complained that USDA has yet to provide a full cost-benefit analysis of its plan to move the office closer to the heartland. Republicans have increasingly supported the relocation plan, while House Democrats have filed legislation to block the move.

On Friday, the USDA announced three finalists for the new headquarters of the service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which is also being moved out of Washington. The finalists are Kansas City, the North Carolina research triangle region and multiple locations in Indiana.

Perdue’s office has promised to release further data justifying the move when he announces a final site recommendation this month.

Within the service, skeptical employees view the secretary’s rationale for the move and the months-long site selection process carried out by accounting firm Ernst & Young as a smokescreen.

“The message we’ve been getting is, ‘The cost-benefit analysis doesn’t matter. Being close to stakeholders doesn’t matter. The only thing that matters for you is the fact that the secretary wants you to move, thinks it’s in your best interest, and that’s what we’re doing,’” said another senior ERS economist who declined to use his name for fear of retaliation.

Brian Stacy, a former ERS economist who left in February, said he thinks the move is a way for the administration to force out staff members and reduce the size of the ERS without congressional approval.

“Part of me wonders whether this relocation is just a way to get at that staff reduction,” Stacy said, referring to the president’s budget request. “I don’t know how else to read some of the moves being made.”

ERS employees are planning to vote on unionization on Thursday.

USDA intends to keep 76 ERS employees in Washington and relocate 253 positions to the new location, USDA senior adviser Kristi Boswell told a House Appropriations panel in March.

“This is the spiraling down of the fantastic work that the ERS has done for years,” said Sonny Ramaswamy, who headed the National Institute of Food and Agriculture under the Obama and early Trump administrations. “It’s one way to drain the swamp, as it were.”

"As EPA stalls, 43 states have water sites contaminated with toxic chemicals",https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/water-toxic-chemicals-pfas-states-2f68b1c6b7f3/,"Toxic chemicals found in nonstick cooking pans and other household items have contaminated more than 600 water sources across at least 43 states, according to a new report, with Michigan by far the most impacted.

The findings underscore the wider water crisis facing the United States and are likely to increase pressure on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to enact stricter limits on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), toxic chemicals that can increase the risk of cancer and other severe health problems.

New analysis published Monday by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) and Northeastern University finds that 610 water sources across the country contain PFAS. The water systems include drinking water sources that serve upwards of 19 million people, along with military and industrial sites, dumps, and airports. PFAS itself is found in everything from firefighting foam to rain jackets.

Using data from sources including the federal Safe Drinking Water Information System and the Pentagon, the authors mapped the nationwide prevalence of PFAS. The version released Monday reflects an updated map — the last version was released in July 2018 and found 172 contaminated sites in 40 states. And it is likely that the new report still doesn’t account for many contaminated sites around the country.

“We believe the locations shown on our map may be only the tip of a toxic iceberg,” said Bill Walker, EWG vice president and editor in chief, in an email to ThinkProgress.

Michigan, a state grappling with ongoing water crises, stands out as the most severely impacted state. The updated map identifies 192 contaminated sites in Michigan alone, the vast majority of which are drinking water sources.

An ongoing lead contamination crisis in Flint, Michigan, is the state’s most well-known water problem. The city’s residents say that five years after their water first became contaminated, they are still experiencing health impacts associated with Flint’s water, like rashes and headaches. But PFAS has also become a problem in the state — last July, two communities in Kalamazoo County were given bottled water after their drinking source was found to contain dangerously high levels of the chemicals.

Under scrutiny over water issues in the aftermath of Flint, state officials have been hard at work testing the water for chemicals in an effort to identify the scope of the PFAS problem. That work has been critical; EWG credited a multi-agency effort overseen by the state as helping to identify impacted areas. Michigan environmental officials have said there may be as many as 11,000 PFAS-contaminated sites in the state.

According to the new report, California comes in second after Michigan with 47 known sites, while New Jersey is third with 43 sites. But Walker of EWG told ThinkProgress that without efforts like those underway in Michigan, gauging the full scale of the problem is a challenge.

“Most other states have not conducted the kind of comprehensive multi-agency detection effort that Michigan has,” he said.

For years, communities in states like West Virginia and Pennsylvania have struggled with staggering cancer rates and other health problems, trends residents now link to PFAS exposure. They have repeatedly lobbied for the EPA to act and several told ThinkProgress in March that they feel the agency is not doing enough — even as EPA officials argue the agency is taking the crisis seriously.

In February, then-Acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler unveiled an “action plan” to tackle PFAS following more than two decades of alarm from impacted communities. But Wheeler’s announcement failed to establish a Maximum Containment Level (MCL) for PFAS in drinking water, something advocates say is critical to addressing the crisis. Currently, the agency has a non-enforceable health advisory level of 70 parts per trillion that applies to only two types of PFAS: PFOA and PFOS. Health experts have said that PFAS chemicals could pose a risk to humans at much lower levels.

Moreover, a draft of interim recommendations for PFAS cleanup released in April was panned by EWG and other groups as “woefully inadequate,” in no small part because it relies on the 70 parts per trillion guidance. The recommendations also do not legally require the Pentagon or the chemical industry to clean up contaminated sites. According to the Defense Department, at least 126 military bases have reported possibly harmful PFAS levels, and EWG identifies 117 military sites on its map. Chemical companies like DuPont are meanwhile associated with mass-PFAS contamination in areas like Parkersburg, West Virginia.

EPA testing has also historically set a level for detection that EWG says is too high. According to Walker, “more than 100 million Americans could have PFAS in their water supplies” if the detection level reflected the lower points at which studies have show averse health effects to occur.

It is unclear when or if the EPA will address such discrepancies. Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-PA) last week introduced a bill that would require the agency to create a drinking water standard for all PFAS chemicals. But the bill would give the EPA two years to do so — a timeline unlikely to appease communities currently struggling with contamination."

"Water contamination found at military bases, in 43 states",https://www.kansas.com,"['Jocelyn Noveck', 'Ap National Writer']",,,,https://www.kansas.com/news/nation-world/national/article230009434.html,"What is PFAS? Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of man-made chemicals that have been linked to birth defects and cancers. Up Next × SHARE COPY LINK Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a group of man-made chemicals that have been linked to birth defects and cancers.

More than 610 drinking water sources in 43 states contain potentially unsafe levels of chemical compounds that have been linked to birth defects, cancers, infertility, and reduced immune responses in children, according to a new database compiled by the Environmental Working Group and Northeastern University.

Using Pentagon data released last year and recently obtained public water utility reports, the researchers now estimate that more than 19 million people are exposed to water contaminated with per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances, known as PFAS.

The new research shows the broad extent of the problem, that the harmful chemical compounds found concentrated in military water sources across the United States have also been reported hundreds more public drinking water systems than was previously known.

“This is a national crisis and it requires a national response,” said Bill Walker, vice president of the Environmental Working Group, a non-profit organization focused on health and the environment.

While PFAS are found in everyday items such as teflon and fast-food wrappers, the chemicals are concentrated in the fire-fighting foam that military bases, ships and commercial airports have used for decades.

A new database compiled by the Environmental Working Group and Northeastern University shows that PFAS contamination of public and military water drinking sources is more pervasive than previously reported. Based on public water utility reports and DOD data, the groups report that 610 locations in 43 states have PFAS contamination, impacting an estimated 19 million people. PFAS chemical compounds have been linked to cancers and birth defects. Copyright Environmental Working Group, www.ewg.org. Reproduced with permission.

Military bases and the communities surrounding them report some of the highest levels of contamination -- much higher than the Environmental Protection Agency’s 2016 recommendation of a maximum exposure level of 70 parts per trillion.

Naval Air Station Whidbey Island in the state of Washington reports some water sources have levels as high as 58,000 parts per trillion and forner Myrtle Beach Air Force Base in South Carolina reports some water sources contain as much as 264,000 parts per trillion of the compounds. Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake in California reports one of the highest levels across the military, at 8 million parts per trillion.

The contamination was not just discovered on military bases. The Pentagon tested off-base wells and public water sources near each facility. In cases where the water source reported PFAS levels higher than 70 parts per trillion, the Pentagon provided filters or alternate drinking water supplies.

The new data shows a broader picture that includes non-military base communities. For example it includes data from Miami Dade Water and Sewer Authority, finding that Miami has previously reported up to 43 parts per trillion of PFAS in its water samples.

“We believe that is way too high,” Walker said. The EWG has argued that exposure levels as low as 1 part per trillion could lead to adverse health effects, and would like to see a national standard set lower than 70 parts per trillion.

For now, without an enforceable standard, there is no requirement for the military to clean up the groundwater or wells to the EPA standard or any other. The Pentagon estimates cleanup at the known contaminated sites could cost more than $2 billion.

And Miami’s data, although only recently obtained, dates back to 2015 and doesn’t give residents the tools they need to know if their water supply now is safe, the researchers said.

“Because there is no legal requirement to continue monitoring for these chemicals, the residents of Miami don’t know if the PFAS contamination has remained the same, gotten better or gotten worse over the last three years,” said Alexis Temkin, an EWG toxicologist.

A bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced legislation in late April that would require the EPA to set an enforceable standard, known as a minimum contaminant level, for PFAS within the next two years.

Chairman of the House Oversight subcommittee on the environment, Rep. Harley Rouda, D-California, held the first congressional hearing on the issue earlier this year and said additional legislation is possible.

“All options for future oversight action remain on the table,” Rouda said."

The additional visas come on top of the visas already made available for the year.

The work visas, which allow employers to hire foreign workers for temporary, non-agricultural jobs, will only be available to workers who already received H-2B status in the past three fiscal years. Availability is also restricted to businesses who would ""suffer irreparable harm"" without the additional workers, US Citizenship and Immigration Services announced on Monday.

The increase was expected, as USCIS alerted Capitol Hill in April that it intended to make this decision and the rule would be forthcoming.

In March, a group of senators asked Homeland Security to raise the number of available visas above the 66,000 statutory annual cap. The demand for seasonal workers was ""so extreme"" this year that the Labor Department's website almost crashed, according to a letter sent to then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.

Devin Nunes: Clinton 'dirt' tipster Joseph Mifsud has ties to State Department,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-05-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/devin-nunes-clinton-dirt-tipster-joseph-mifsud-has-ties-to-state-department,"Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said Maltese academic Joseph Mifsud — the man who told former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos the Russians had thousands of Hillary Clinton's emails — likely has links to ""U.S., British, and Italian intelligence services"" and the State Department where Clinton served as the country's top diplomat.

Mifsud, a London-based professor and former Maltese diplomat, has long been suspected of deep ties to Russian intelligence. He is an elusive figure who has stayed out of the spotlight and is the subject of a letter Nunes, the House Intelligence Committee ranking member, sent to U.S. intelligence agencies and the State Department on Friday seeking relevant documents.

Nunes told Fox News on Sunday there were many questions that arose from special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, which his letter said “omits any mention of a wide range of contacts Mifsud had with Western political institutions and individuals,"" that still need to be answered.

""They can't even tell us who Joseph Mifsud is,"" he told host Maria Bartiromo, adding, ""We believe he has ties to the State Department."" He noted how in 2017 Mifsud attended an event at the U.S. Capitol hosted by Global Ties U.S., a nonprofit group that partners with the State Department and featured ambassadors and U.S. congressmen at the event.

Nunes' letter also photographs of Mifsud in close proximity to Western officials at events hosted by Rome-based Link University Campus, where Mifsud taught.

Mueller's 448-page report, released last month with redactions, states that Mifsud traveled to Moscow in April 2016, after which he met Papadopoulos in London. It was at this meeting that Mifsud informed Papadopoulos that during his trip he learned that the Russians had “dirt” on Clinton, who served as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 and was President Trump's Democratic rival in the 2016 election. Papadopoulos later repeated this claim to Australian diplomat Alexander Downer, who informed the FBI and prompted the original counterintelligence investigation into Trump's campaign in July 2016.

Although Mueller's team portrayed Mifsud as a Russian asset with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Nunes said the team decided to""cherry pick"" information from news reports, leaving out that he was described as a Western intelligence asset. ""It seems like Mifsud has an awful lot of ties to U.S., British, and Italian intelligence services,"" Nunes said.

The FBI spoke with Mifsud in early February 2017, and believe he left the U.S. on Feb. 11. The FBI accused Papadopoulos of misleading the bureau about his communications with Mifsud in January 2017, which they alleged ""undermined investigators’ ability to challenge the Professor [Mifsud] or potentially detain or arrest him while he was still in the United States.""

As part of Mueller’s Russia investigation, Papadopoulos pleaded guilty in October 2017 to making false statements to the FBI about his contacts with Russians and served 12 days in prison late last year.

Papadopoulos, who also was contacted by FBI assets during the 2016 campaign, including informant Stefan Halper, now feels he could have been the target of entrapment.

Appearing on Fox News before Nunes, he said he got caught in a ""perjury trap."" He also said he is ""pretty sure there are a lot of recordings and transcripts between myself and a lot of these assets and I'm very hopeful that these are going to get public soon.""

Nunes said his letter to U.S. intelligence agencies and the State Department seeks ""all of the underlying information,"" adding, ""so if the FBI does in fact have transcripts of Papadopoulos talking to anyone, whether it's Mifsud, or Downer, or whoever, I think Congress and the American people have the right to know this.""

In his letter, Nunes asks Central Intelligence Agency Director Gina Haspel, FBI Director Christopher Wray, National Security Agency Director Paul Nakasone, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to hand over all documents they have on Mifsud by May 10."

USA TODAY

Jim Ferguson wanted answers.

How was his 91-year-old father, who served in the U.S. Navy in World War II, fatally injured in a Veterans Affairs nursing home, the institution Ferguson had entrusted to care for him?

Huddled around a computer monitor with managers at the VA in Des Moines, Iowa, Ferguson watched a hallway surveillance video that depicted a chilling blow to his father's head.

“I lost it,” Ferguson told USA TODAY. “I broke down.”

In the video, James “Milt” Ferguson Sr., who had dementia and was legally blind, appears confused. He opens a hallway door, rolls his wheelchair into another resident’s room, then wheels back out. No staff members are visible. He circles around and heads back into the room.

Halfway through the door, his chair flips over backward. Milt Ferguson crashes to the floor, landing on the back of his head. Ferguson said he was told the chair was pushed over by the resident in the room, who can't be seen in the video. As staff members rush to assist him, Ferguson is able to turn over and sit up, but the impact causes a massive brain bleed that will kill him within days.

What later would turn the son’s despair into outrage was what he learned about events leading up to his father wheeling around unsupervised last December, and what happened after he smashed into the floor.

“It’s like my dad died at their hands,” Ferguson said.

Serious problems with resident care have occurred in many VA nursing homes across the nation, including the one where Ferguson was being cared for.

USA TODAY reported in March that inspections by a private contractor hired by the VA found deficiencies that caused ""actual harm"" to veterans at more than half of the 99 VA nursing homes reviewed. The inspections found inadequate supervision or hazardous conditions at 53 of them.

In Des Moines – which received the lowest one star out of five in the VA's own ratings, based on surprise inspections – inspectors found managers did not ensure staff treated residents with dignity or followed basic infection-control and prevention measures.

The story of what happened to James Ferguson in Des Moines provides a deeper picture of the care one elderly veteran received. Medical records provided to USA TODAY by his son and legal guardian outline what specialists say was a concerning series of decisions by VA staff, before and after his deadly head injury.

Nine days before, VA caregivers determined Ferguson was a danger to himself and others because his dementia caused him to wander around, agitated. They had him on continuous one-on-one observation with an aide, but took him off the strict monitoring when he entered the VA nursing home. There, staff didn't reinstate the heightened observation, despite his repeatedly straying dangerously into other residents' rooms.

After his injury, staff put him back in his wheelchair but did not report the incident to a supervisor for 40 minutes, the records and surveillance video indicate. Ferguson wasn't transported to an emergency room for two hours after that. Then, it took 2½ hours more to send him to a trauma hospital. The time stamp on the video showed the fall occurred at 3:49 p.m. and it wasn't until just before 9 p.m. that Ferguson was transported to the trauma facility.

'A disaster waiting to happen'

Specialists who reviewed Ferguson's medical records at the request of USA TODAY expressed concern about the quality of his care.

""It was definitely a disaster waiting to happen, and it did,"" said Robyn Grant, director of public policy and advocacy at The National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care, a Washington-based nonprofit advocacy organization.

""I just am really struck by the predictability with his repeated episodes of going into other people's rooms,"" she said. ""They should have had some intervention so they could provide him with adequate supervision and address the wandering.""

Grant said the length of time it took afterward to adequately evaluate and diagnose the severity of his injury and get him to a trauma facility also raises questions. ""What was happening there, in terms of those delays?"" she said.

VA nursing homes: Feds find 'blatant disregard' for veteran safety

Richard Mollot, executive director since 2005 of the Long Term Care Community Coalition, a New York City-based nonprofit advocate of nursing home care improvement, said the shortfalls indicate there was ""very likely"" a lack of skilled or adequately trained staff to meet his needs.

""The point of being in that environment is that you have skilled nursing care and monitoring,"" he said.

Mollot said the reporting delay is particularly concerning. ""How often does this happen that no one's looking at? That's what is so upsetting.""

'All staff acted properly'

A spokesman for the Des Moines VA, Timothy Hippen, said in a statement that a review after the ""untimely death"" concluded ""all staff acted properly.""

""Any time an unexpected death occurs, VA Central Iowa Health Care System reviews its policies and procedures to see if changes are warranted,"" he said. ""We did that here, finding that all staff acted properly.""

In response to questions about the case, national VA spokesman Curt Cashour accused USA TODAY of focusing on ""isolated complaints"" and ""cherry-picking the experiences of a handful of veterans to create the impression of a broad problem.""

Cashour maintained that, overall, VA nursing homes ""compare closely"" with non-VA facilities. More than 40,000 veterans rely on care at the agency’s 134 nursing facilities each year.

USA TODAY reported last year that about 70% of VA nursing homes scored worse than non-VA nursing homes on a majority of quality indicators tracked by the agency, which include rates of infection, serious pain and bed sores.

Hippen declined to respond to detailed questions about Ferguson's case.

""We will not be addressing the specifics of this case publicly, but we have been in direct contact with the veteran’s family to discuss their concerns,"" he said.

Jim Ferguson said he remains upset even though VA officials shared the surveillance video with him and said they were sorry about what happened to his father.

He wants VA staff held accountable. He wants to make sure policies are in place so it doesn't happen to anyone else.

“No one should live their life like that and have what happened to him in the end,” he said. “I want this to be the last person this happens to.”

A gambler called ‘booger’

Even as his dementia worsened, Milt Ferguson flashed glimmers of his younger self.

The former deckhand on the heavy cruiser U.S.S. Pensacola was affectionately known as “booger” at the Des Moines Register, where he worked bundling newspapers for 23 years before retiring in 1995. He loved to play the slots and the horses.

On a note in his medical record, a nurse practitioner wrote: “Patient laughs when his nickname is mentioned.” Jim Ferguson had come for a visit that day, as he did most days. “He was smiling and appeared to be enjoying his son’s company,” the medical record said.

The decision to place him in a nursing home had been a gut-wrenching one, Ferguson said. He had moved in with his parents and cared for them for three years. But in April 2018 his mother died. He said a VA social worker told him his father needed more intensive, round-the-clock care and supervision.

“They made it sound like, well, if he got hurt, I could be charged with a crime,” Ferguson said. “So that’s when I decided to place him in a nursing home.”

‘His dementia was acting up’

Ferguson moved his father to Bishop Drumm Retirement Center, a private facility just outside Des Moines, where his mother worked as a nursing assistant in the Alzheimer’s unit for more than 20 years before retiring.

The center took in Milt Ferguson last August. But three months later, his condition worsened.

""The day before Thanksgiving, I got a call from Bishop Drumm – his dementia was acting up,"" his son said.

He hit two staff members, was “agitated all day” and was “wandering into other residents room(s), causing distress,” a nurse later noted in his medical record. “He is generally ‘sweet’ so this is a departure from his usual behavior.”

Ferguson was taken by ambulance to the Des Moines VA Medical Center, where he was admitted to the acute psychiatry ward. He was put on one-on-one observation with a sitter – an aide tasked with intervening if he lashed out or tried to stray into other patients’ rooms.

They adjusted his medications, and, after a few aggressive outbursts, he appeared calm enough after three weeks to transfer into the VA nursing home on the medical center’s campus.

But there was a catch, a psychiatric nurse wrote in his record: ""Veterans are not put on sitter status over there.""

‘Help me, help me’

After a 22-hour trial period without a sitter, Milt Ferguson moved in to the VA nursing home.

Problems began within hours.

He hardly slept, he hallucinated, he called out ""help me, help me"" over and over again. He was agitated and again, he ""wandered into and out of peers rooms"" day after day, nursing staff wrote in his record.

They gave him medication. Sometimes he calmed down. Sometimes he didn’t.

A psychiatrist was managing his case remotely. According to public records, the doctor worked at a VA facility a few hours away in Lincoln, Nebraska. Through virtual appointments, the psychiatrist advised changes to Ferguson's medication.

On December 19, a week after Ferguson moved in, nursing home staff noted he was still restless and anxious, pacing and screaming and yelling. His care team – psychiatrist, primary care doctor, nursing staff and social workers – met to discuss the case.

The psychiatrist said a review of his records showed ""increased confusion with wandering"" during the past week. The doctor prescribed higher dosages of a mood-stabilizing drug and a sedative. There was no discussion of closer supervision or reinstatement of one-on-one observation, the records show.

“Will ask RN to contact this MD in one week with update,” the psychiatrist wrote.

By then, Ferguson would be dead.

‘A golf ball-sized lump’

On December 20, when two aides rushed to help Milt Ferguson, his head on the floor and legs crumpled to the side, the time stamp on the hallway surveillance video reads 3:49 p.m. But in a report filled out an hour later, a nurse recorded the time of the accident as 4:30 p.m.

His records do not indicate what the staff did with Ferguson during the 41 minutes in between, aside from putting him back in his wheelchair.

By that time, he had a “golf ball-sized lump on the back of his head.” The nurse notified the manager on duty, a nurse practitioner, who wrote at 5:06 p.m. that he had ordered an immediate CT scan of his head.

That didn’t happen until about 6:30 p.m., when Ferguson arrived in the emergency department of the medical center on the Des Moines VA campus, on a bed wheeled by a nursing home aide. The aide said Ferguson had earlier been taken for a CT scan but was uncooperative.

An emergency room doctor quickly had a sedative administered and the scan was completed. By that point, the World War II veteran had a “large bleed” in the back right side of his brain that was so acute, the CT report says his brain had shifted to the left inside his skull.

Sent 'to scanning’

The doctor notified MercyOne Des Moines Medical Center, a trauma hospital, at 7 p.m. For nearly two hours, the doctor tried to keep Ferguson comfortable and his blood pressure under control until an ambulance arrived and took Ferguson to Mercy at 8:55 p.m.

The doctor also kept calling Ferguson’s son, leaving voicemails.

But Jim Ferguson had himself been admitted to a hospital and had provided the VA nursing home with a consent form authorizing staff to contact a close friend if anything happened to his father. That form had been sent ""to scanning” that morning.

When Jim Ferguson retrieved all the voicemails, he rushed to Mercy the next morning.

""He was not responsive. He was laying on his bed, making this horrible noise as they sucked saliva out of his mouth,"" he said. ""I never even got to say any last words to my dad.""

He died the next day.

Specialists who reviewed the case at the request of USA TODAY singled out multiple shortfalls in his care at the VA that may have affected the outcome.

Grant, the policy director at The National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care, said the 22-hour trial of having no sitter was ""not enough time to establish how he was doing.""

When he then acted out day after day, in agitation and confusion, they should not have allowed him to wander into other residents' rooms, she said. Such situations can cause the other residents to lash out in fear or distress and ""lead to an altercation or violence or striking out.""

""One would argue that could have been prevented,"" she said. ""There should have been somebody, somewhere who could have seen that this happened and – particularly when he wheeled himself – to have gone in and intervened, 'Let me help you, let's go to your room.'""

Mollot, the executive director at the Long Term Care Community Coalition, said meeting the standards of care means staff identifies risks and needs and ways to meet them and mitigate them and then does so consistently.

""This is exactly the kind of thing that happens when those standards are not followed,"" he said.

'A safe place'

The spokesman for the Des Moines VA, while declining to answer detailed questions about what happened, said that in general, ""caring for nursing home residents involves balancing patients’ independence with the need for supervision, as appropriate.""

""While tight scrutiny and strict limits on residents’ activities and freedom of movement could possibly lower the risk for adverse events, it would also severely degrade patients’ quality of life, which is precisely what we are trying to preserve for as long as possible,"" he said.

Jim Ferguson still has his father’s wheelchair in the garage. He keeps the sweatshirt his father was wearing when he last used the chair. Ferguson has retained a lawyer, Brad Biren, to help him figure out next steps and how to hold the VA accountable.

“Somebody didn’t watch my dad and let him die,” he said. “It’s supposed to be a safe place.”

Kamala Harris asks DOJ IG to probe whether Trump asked Barr to investigate political opponents,https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-doj-ig-bar-trump-political-opponents,"Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., on Friday sent a letter to the Department of Justice’s inspector general demanding he investigates whether the White House had urged Attorney General William Barr to investigate President Trump’s political opponents.

“In response to my questions during the [Senate Judiciary] hearing, Attorney General Barr proved unable or unwilling to state whether he had been directed to open investigations at the request or suggestion of the President or other White House officials -- an alarming response that strikes at the very heart of the rule of law and threatens to undermine the longstanding independence of the Justice Department,” she said in a letter to Inspector General Michael Horowitz.

“I request that the Office of the Inspector General investigate whether the Attorney General has received or acted upon such improper requests,” she said.

The letter comes days after Harris questioned Barr Tuesday at the Senate hearing over details in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia report that noted instances where Trump had either suggested or called for the Department of Justice to investigate Hillary Clinton.

Harris quizzed Barr whether Trump or anyone at the White House had asked him to investigate anyone -- an exchange it detailed in its letter to Horowitz.

In that exchange, Harris asked: “Has the President or anyone at the White House ever asked or suggested that you open an investigation of anyone?”

“I’m trying to grapple with the word ‘suggest.’ I mean, there have been discussions of, of matters out there that, uh—they have not asked me to open an investigation,” Barr said.

When Harris asked if anyone had hinted, suggested or inferred, Barr said he didn’t know. Harris’ letter describes Barr as “unable or unwilling to answer the question.”

“There must be no doubt that the Department of Justice and its leadership stand apart from partisan politics, and resist improper attempts to use the power of federal law enforcement to settle personal scores,” she wrote.

The letter is the latest pushback from Democrats against Barr since the release of the Mueller report. In particular, they have zeroed in on Barr’s handling of the report’s release, alleging that he is biased toward the president in his presentation of the report in his initial four-page summary of its conclusions.

Harris criticized Barr’s decision not to personally review the underlying evidence before concluding that there was not enough evidence to establish that the president had committed obstruction of justice. She joined a number of Democrats saying that Barr should resign.

""This Attorney General lacks all credibility and has I think compromised the American public's ability to believe that he is a purveyor of justice,"" she told reporters after the hearing.

Mnuchin refuses to turn over Trump taxes to House Democrats,https://www.cnn.com,"['Donna Borak', 'Lauren Fox']",05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/06/politics/tax-returns-trump-congress-showdown/index.html,"(CNN) Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Monday denied a request from House Democrats for access to six years of President Donald Trump's personal tax returns.

""I am informing you now that the Department may not lawfully fulfill the Committee's request,"" Mnuchin wrote in his one-page letter, written in consultation with lawyers from the Department of Justice.

Mnuchin added that the Department of Justice would issue a formal legal opinion.

The denial comes after two missed deadlines by the Treasury secretary, who again in his letter said the request by House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal under an obscure statute of tax law is ""unprecedented,"" arguing it raises ""serious constitutional questions"" that could have dire consequences for taxpayer privacy.

Trump has refused to release his tax information, first as a candidate and now as president, breaking a precedent going back to Watergate.

The fight over Trump's tax returns is escalating just as the President has made increasingly clear that he expects his administration officials to fight requests from the opposing party Attorney General William Barr declined a Democratic request to testify last week in the House about special counsel Robert Mueller's report, a day after appearing in the Republican-controlled Senate.

An administration official familiar with the matter said the Trump administration is not backing down in the fight over the President's tax returns.

""It appears the Justice Department is prepared to litigate"" the matter in the courts if Neal goes that route, the official said.

Neal said in a statement Monday that he was still determining next steps.

""Today, Secretary Mnuchin notified me that the IRS will not provide the documents I requested under Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code,"" Neal said. ""I will consult with counsel and determine the appropriate response.""

The committee chairman could issue a subpoena on top of his request, or Democrats could move to hold the Treasury Secretary or IRS Commissioner for whom the original request was addressed to in contempt of Congress.

Some Democrats made clear Monday that they are eager to escalate, citing the Mueller report as well as the conviction of Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen.

""On a day when his former fixer heads to jail and his current fixer heads the Department of Justice, President Trump obstructs both Mueller and his tax returns from speaking for themselves,"" Texas Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett said in a statement. ""We need immediate legal action. We cannot allow this bad president to set bad precedent.""

The top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, Texas Rep. Kevin Brady, applauded the decision not to turn over Trump's returns.

""After consulting with the Justice Department the Treasury Department has come to the firm conclusion that we have known since day one: this request from House Democrats to weaponize the tax code for purely political reasons is illegitimate and should be treated as such,"" Brady said in a statement. ""This politically motivated abuse of the law violates our Constitution -- and serves no legislative purpose. Abusing the tax writing Committee's authority to go after a political enemy sets a dangerous precedent, and the Administration is right not to go along with it.""

Democrats initially directed their request to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig , the only person with the legal authority to turn over the returns, but Mnuchin has interceded twice in the matter, citing his role overseeing the federal tax collector.

Mnuchin said in April he would deliver a response by May 6.

The Justice Department has declined to comment on the matter.

The fight over the request may ultimately to lead to a court fight -- which would be a rare example of Congress suing the executive branch for information. The Trump administration is already stonewalling other Democratic committee chairman on everything from the Mueller report to interviews with former White House counsel Don McGahn.

Neal made his initial ask for Trump's tax information on April 3 after a months-long deliberation with staff, committee members and House lawyers.

He also sent a follow-up letter demanding that Treasury comply with the request no later than April 23. But Treasury missed the deadlines, a strategy Democrats have argued was an effort to delay the process

Democrats on the tax-writing committee have argued that they have the ability to request Trump's personal tax information under an obscure statute that permits three people to request personal tax information of any individual: the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, the Senate Finance Committee chairman and the chief of staff for the Joint Committee on Taxation.

The statute says that the secretary of the Treasury ""shall furnish"" it.

The statute has been used by Congress before, including in the Republican investigation under President Barack Obama into whether the IRS was discriminating against conservative groups applying for non-profit status. Requests for information using the law are also made on a regular basis for research purposes.

Neal has argued that he needs Trump's taxes in order to conduct oversight of the IRS's presidential audit program to both understand how the IRS is using the program and to see if the program needs to be codified into law.

But Mnuchin has asserted the ""unprecedented"" request raises ""serious constitutional issues"" that could have dire consequences for taxpayer privacy and has consulted with the Justice Department on the matter.

The Treasury secretary has also raised concerns that setting such a precedent could be ""potentially weaponizing"" the IRS.

The Massachusetts Democrat has previously indicated that defying his request would be interpreted as noncompliance and lead to an escalation of a standoff between the Trump administration and House Democrats.

""It is not the proper function of the IRS, Treasury or Justice to question or second guess the motivations of the committee or its reasonable determinations regarding its need for the requested tax returns and return information,"" Neal wrote to Rettig in response to the missed deadline on April 23. ""Please know that if you fail to comply, your failure will be interpreted as a denial of my request.""

In interviews last month, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney told Fox News that there was no world in which Democrats would get the President's tax returns.

Democrats are up against a barrage of denied requests from the administration, forcing leadership into tough decisions about what oversight priorities are worth pursuing in court.

House Democrats are lodged in an all-out-battle with the Department of Justice after the agency refused to hand over an unredacted Mueller report by Wednesday's deadline. That was despite a subpoena from House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler. Nadler has said he plans to hold the Attorney General in contempt of Congress if the report is not turned over in upcoming days.

Trump's personal lawyers also sued last week to block banks and an accounting firm from turning over Trump's financial records to the House Financial Services, House Intelligence and House Oversight Committees, a move that has led some Democratic chairs to question what the President has to hide.

""Whether it is refusing to sit down in an interview with Mueller or whether it is constantly obstructing justice by trying to stop testimonies and stop people from cooperating, whether it is filing a lawsuit, he obviously has something to hide,"" House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters said last week.

Waters's committee has subpoenaed at least 9 financial institutions with ties to the President.

""He's obviously afraid that we are going to learn more about his relationships with Deutsche Bank, more about his bank records, perhaps, more about whether or not there is money laundering that has been involved in some ways. We have enough information and we have enough to help us to guide us moving forward to help us with these subpoenas,"" Waters said."

Teenagers, known for their immaturity, need stable adult guidance. The Department of Homeland Security is no different.

But like children shuffled among a succession of foster parents, the department, still in its teens, has been hampered by a chronic lack of steady leadership. Currently, numerous top positions — including secretary, deputy secretary and three of four undersecretary slots — have no confirmed appointees.

Vacancies among the political appointees who set policy for the third-largest department is an old and continuing story. What a House hearing revealed is just how damaging the many openings can be for the department’s work and its employees.

Just 47 percent of key department slots are filled with confirmed appointees, according to the Political Appointee Tracker published by The Washington Post and the Partnership for Public Service. Only Interior is worse, at 41 percent, among Cabinet-level agencies.

The Department of Homeland Security started as a jumbled mess when it began operations in 2003, in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. It was forged from 22 separate agencies “into a unified, integrated Department,” at least according to its website.

A more realistic view comes from John Roth, the department’s former inspector general. As the 2014-2017 independent watchdog within the agency, Roth had a prime perch to observe the department’s workings and inefficiencies.

“In the best of times, DHS is an unruly and difficult-to-manage organization,” Roth told the House Committee on Homeland Security on Wednesday. “We are not in the best of times. The nature and extent of senior leadership vacancies in the department is cause for concern, as such pervasive vacancies significantly hamper the department’s ability to carry out its all-important mission.”

Chairman Bennie G. Thompson (D-Miss.) called the session to examine the question in the hearing’s title: “Trouble at the Top: Are Vacancies at the Department of Homeland Security Undermining the Mission?”

Comments by Roth and others left no doubt that the answer is yes.

After examining the root causes of the department’s “persistent shortfalls,” Roth pointed to poor unity of effort.

“DHS has demonstrated an inability to mesh divergent components, with different histories, cultures, and missions, into a single agency with a unity of effort,” he said. “Too often, the components operated as stand-alone entities or, worse, in competition with each other. Knitting together a unified DHS with all components pulling together to protect our homeland security is a top challenge of the department and requires strong and committed leadership and oversight. This goal is thwarted by the pervasive senior leadership vacancies.”

The shortfalls are widespread, he said, touching “nearly every area of the department,” including:

· Personnel management and morale — Since inception, “DHS has suffered poor employee morale and a dysfunctional work environment.” While morale has improved, the department ranks last among large agencies in employment engagement scores calculated in the Best Places to Work in the Federal Government report.

· Acquisition management — “Most of DHS major acquisition programs continue to cost more than expected, take longer to deploy than planned, or deliver less capability than promised.”

· Grants management, particularly at the department’s Federal Emergency Management Agency, which “does a fairly poor job of ensuring that the money is not wasted. We believed the cause to be a failure of leadership within and oversight over FEMA, in addition to structural and systemic issues inherent in the program.”

These and other problems are exacerbated by “a lack of personnel within the departmental leadership offices to focus on and address overarching issues,” Roth said.

Despite a bevy of problems, Gene L. Dodaro, who directs the Government Accountability Office (GAO) as comptroller general of the United States, said DHS “has made important progress in strengthening its management functions.” On April 19, however, he sent DHS a 19-page letter, including an enclosure, “detailing 26 open recommendations that GAO believes warrant the highest priority personal attention from the department and its components.”

But personal attention from whom? The letter was sent to Kevin K. McAleenan, the acting secretary, who is surrounded by other temporary actors.

“Current vacancies in top leadership positions could pose a challenge to addressing high-risk areas and priority recommendations that span DHS’s diverse missions,” Dodaro said, “which include preventing terrorism and enhancing security, managing our borders, administering immigration laws, securing cyberspace, and responding to disasters.”

Despite the claim of “a unified, integrated Department,” Roth said the department’s “vast law enforcement enterprise … does not work together as a unified organization … time and again we saw the law enforcement agencies operating independently without the necessary oversight and no real effort to compel coordination.”

In a well-functioning bureaucracy, officials in the secretary’s office and the deputy secretary’s office would corral problems like these. Unfortunately, Roth said those offices “are simply too thinly staffed to be able to even be aware of, much less effectively manage, the significant and varied issues that face DHS.”

Thompson blamed the White House for the current lack of department leadership, saying President Trump “has decimated the leadership ranks of his own Department of Homeland Security.""

“In recent weeks alone, President Trump has: dismissed Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen; circumvented the law by forcing Acting Deputy Secretary and Undersecretary for Management Claire Grady to resign so he could install Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan as acting secretary; asked Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Administrator David Pekoske to serve as deputy secretary while also running TSA; and pulled the nomination of Ronald Vitiello for Immigration and Customs Enforcement director, prompting his resignation,” Thompson said in his opening statement.

“In addition to the secretary and deputy secretary vacancies, at least 12 other critical positions across the department’s key components and offices are operating without permanent leadership. The president has failed to nominate anyone to fill most of these vacancies, even though many have been held by acting officials for the entirety of the Trump administration. Moreover, there are another 50 senior leadership positions vacant throughout the department, including those tasked with overseeing the daily operations of DHS.

“This chaos appears to be by design,” Thompson added, “orchestrated by a president who wants to be able to remove the department’s leadership on a whim.”

The White House and DHS did not respond to requests for comments. Rep. Mike D. Rogers (Ala.), the committee’s ranking member, and other Republicans on the panel pointed out that the department also had vacancies during the Obama administration. The big difference, of course, is Obama’s Democrats did not run the Senate for most of his administration. Republicans now control the White House and the Senate, which confirms presidential nominees.

“Management vacancies, mismanagement and poor employee morale have plagued the Department of Homeland Security since it was created … ” Rogers said. “Every day, DHS employees do an exceptional job carrying out their critical missions. No one should blame the men and women of DHS for problems Congress has allowed to fester.”

What William Barr misses about presidential accountability,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Bradley D. Hays', 'Bradley D. Hays Is An Associate Professor Of Political Science At Union College. His Scholarship Is On Constitutional Politics', 'History']",05-05-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/05/05/what-william-barr-misses-about-presidential-accountability/,"

Attorney General William P. Barr testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee about the special counsel report on Wednesday, May 1, 2019. (J. Scott Applewhite)

Bradley D. Hays is an associate professor of political science at Union College. His scholarship is on constitutional politics, history and development.

Last week, Attorney General William P. Barr testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on his apparent attempt to whitewash special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s findings, particularly those related to potential obstruction of justice by President Trump. In the course of his defense, Barr said, “We have to stop using the criminal justice process as a political weapon.”

His statement echoed language that President George H.W. Bush used when announcing a controversial pardon in the final weeks of his presidency — after consultation with Barr, who was serving his first stint as attorney general. These statements make plain Barr’s view that prosecutorial investigations of executive officials are inherently partisan and, therefore, illegitimate under the rule of law. But this idea calls into question one of the central principles of the American constitutional system: executive accountability.

In Federalist 70, Alexander Hamilton trumpets the advantages of a unitary executive, that is, the notion that all executive branch authority rests with the president, rather than being divided up among different executive officers, as states such as Texas and New York do.

One of Hamilton’s central arguments was that a unitary executive increases accountability: The buck stops with the president. In a divided executive, it could be unclear whether the president or another executive officer should be held to account for unpopular, unscrupulous or unlawful actions. By making the president accountable for all such action, the people will know how to vote in future elections.

Notably, Hamilton’s ideas on accountability extend beyond the president paying at the ballot box for unpopular action. In Federalist 65, he clearly states that a president impeached for misconduct is also “liable to prosecution and punishment in the ordinary course of law.” In other words, the presidency was not designed to be free from prosecutorial inquiry.

Holding the president and other, subordinate executive branch officials to account was central to our constitutional design and the rule of law, part of the delicate compromise between those at the constitutional convention who wanted a weak executive and those who wanted a strong one.

Hamilton’s reasoning on executive accountability has featured prominently in the development of the concept over time. For example, the United States Supreme Court ruled unanimously in Clinton v. Jones that the president is not immune from civil litigation due to the constitutional mandate of executive accountability. Indeed, such accountability was not only allowed, but may well have been necessary to protect the rule of law.

Barr, however, rejects this notion — and did so long before Donald Trump entered the political arena. On Christmas Eve 1992, Bush issued a pardon to former secretary of defense Caspar Weinberger for his role in the Iran-contra affair during the Reagan administration. In violation of U.S. law, Weinberger had allegedly facilitated the sale of American missiles to Iran to help fund the contras in Nicaragua. An independent counsel was appointed to investigate the scandal and a grand jury brought indictments on two counts of perjury and one count of obstructing justice. Weinberger protested the fairness of the indictments, but the evidence of wrongdoing was substantial. (Bush, who was vice president during the Iran-contra affair, was implicated but ultimately not indicted.)

When Bush explained his rationale for the pardon, he did not contest Weinberger’s likely guilt. Instead he praised Weinberger’s long record of service to the nation and his role in bringing down the Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union.

Bush went further, though, not resting on Weinberger’s meritorious service alone. He pivoted to attack the prosecutions — 14 people associated with the Reagan administration were indicted, and 11 convicted — themselves as inconsistent with law’s necessary neutrality. Bush argued that the prosecutions represented “the criminalization of policy differences” and that “[t]hese differences should be addressed in the political arena, without the Damocles sword of criminality hanging over the heads of the combatants.” Reports at the time indicated that Bush worked closely on the pardon with Barr, which is unsurprising given the views Barr espoused last week.

Indeed, when reading this pardon in conjunction with Barr’s testimony, it's clear that Barr holds a narrow understanding of executive accountability. In both the cases of Weinberger and Trump, prosecutors statutorily shielded from partisan influences found substantial evidence that the figure in question obstructed justice.

Yet because the targets of the investigations were political actors and, ostensibly, the opposition party would benefit from a successful prosecution of them, Barr considers any such prosecution inherently partisan and ill-suited for the courts. In other words, any attempt to investigate whether presidential action was unlawful must be partisan and, therefore, is inappropriate for nonpartisan legal institutions. Instead, as Bush identified in the Weinberger pardon, “the proper forum” for executive accountability was the “voting booth, not the courtroom.”

But this essentially gives the president (and other executive officials) a blank check: Unless misconduct rises to the level of impeachment, or if the partisan realities in Congress render impeachment an impossibility, the president is essentially immune from sanction for breaking the law, at least until leaving office.

This is not how Hamilton and his fellow Founders envisioned the system working. Worried about an out-of-control executive, they aimed to create checks and balances — and accountability. Checks and balances and the rule of law are not just formal institutional arrangements, they are norms of governance that invigorate principles central to the American system of government. Accountability is even more crucial in 2019 than it was in 1787, given how much more power the president wields today than in the 18th and 19th centuries.

When an ideology like Barr’s undermines those norms, the system of accountability carefully crafted by Hamilton and his fellow Founders and developed over two centuries threatens to become unbalanced. The result is a president unmoored from the norms that tether the executive to lawful behavior. That risks the entire American constitutional structure crashing down, as the president asserts himself with little to fear until at least the next election. While executive power has advanced steadily throughout the 20th century, what Barr envisions would be another leap, putting the United States on dangerous ground. It is not too much to ask our presidents not to violate the law. And when they fail to meet that standard, the consequences should be swift and assured."
Tesla Begins Shipping Parts To Nearest Service Center When Vehicle Fault Is Detected,https://cleantechnica.com,['Kyle Field'],05-06-2019,2019,5,https://cleantechnica.com/2019/05/06/tesla-begins-shipping-parts-to-nearest-service-center-when-fault-is-detected/,"Tesla Begins Shipping Parts To Nearest Service Center When Vehicle Fault Is Detected

Tesla’s Vehicles Self-Diagnose Then Self-Medicate When Faults Are Detected

Tesla will now start shipping any required parts to the nearest Service Center when the vehicle detects a fault, according to a tweet from the company earlier today.

The parts ordering process must be getting much better. I placed a service call on the 29th and had the part installed today. — David (@d0cdave) May 6, 2019

Tesla has defied the norms and pains of many service center visits with its over-the-air diagnostic capabilities, but this takes that to the next level by eliminating the next barrier to getting the issue fixed. When an issue is detected by the in-car diagnostic system, a popup message appears in the car notifying the owner of the issue and requesting that they make an appointment at the nearest Tesla Service Center.

An unexpected condition has been detected with the Power Conversion System on your Model 3 & replacement part has been pre-shipped to your preferred Tesla Service Center. Please use your Tesla Mobile App or your Tesla Account to schedule a service visit appointment now.

Improving Service for owners continues to be a focal point for Tesla CEO Elon Musk as the number of Teslas roaming the roads of the world continues to grow at an exponential rate. Enabling vehicles to both self diagnose and to order any required parts gives Tesla that much more of an advantage in getting a jump on finding and shipping the parts needed for a repair.

Parts supply is an area that the company has historically, and to this day, continues to struggle with. Stories of owners waiting not just weeks, but upwards of nearly 6 months in some cases, for the required parts to arrive litter the internet. Seeing a story here and a story there about the issue makes it hard to put the scale of the problem into context, but there is enough evidence to make it clear that parts supply continues to be an opportunity for the company.

The new functionality is an impressive step towards the future that will require vehicles to be more self-aware as Tesla ramps up its preparations for its fully autonomous Tesla Network of robotaxis. These vehicles will need to know when they need service and be able to not only get the parts ordered, but also schedule their own service appointments without owner intervention.

In related news, Tesla’s twitter account has been given new life in the last few days, with a new bite of personality and responsiveness that has many wondering if the Securities and Exchange Commission’s restrictions on Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s tweets simply pushed him to use the company’s official Twitter account for his snide, snarky, insightful, playful tweets and replies. Oh, SEC, when will you learn? Don’t mess with the genius in the corner. Just leave him alone with his toys so he can get back to transforming the world for the better.

'He’s just a loyalist': Trump's ICE pick Mark Morgan blasted by former DHS officials,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/hes-just-a-loyalist-trumps-ice-pick-mark-morgan-blasted-by-former-dhs-officials,"Former officials who served at the top of the Department of Homeland Security are worried Mark Morgan, President Trump’s new pick to lead Immigration and Customs Enforcement, is better suited to Fox News than leading the agency.

Two top Homeland Security officials who spoke with the Washington Examiner Monday described Morgan as a career FBI employee with less than one year of experience working in any Homeland Security entity, who likely got the job because he used TV stints to woo Trump.

“What he does is he goes on Fox News and shoots his mouth out — how he was in charge of Border Patrol for three months?” said the first official, who has led two Homeland Security agencies and asked to speak on background to avoid upsetting clients. “People look at that as an expert. He’s far from an expert. He’s just a loyalist, OK? He gets on Fox and talks about how good the president is. The president loves it: ‘Why don’t we hire this guy?’”

Morgan emerged on Fox last year and has since made a name for himself by endorsing Trump's policies, including transporting asylum-seekers to sanctuary cities. One official the Examiner heard from said he may hurt his ability to lead ICE if he steps on the toes of other Homeland Security officials who have more say on border policies than he does as the head of an agency tasked with homeland security investigations and deported unauthorized immigrants.

“Trump may expect him to continue to be an outspoken advocate, but Morgan will step on a lot of toes within Homeland Security if he continually strays outside his lane. Becoming head of ICE will give him a lane he hasn’t had since he left the Obama administration,” a second official wrote in an email. “I think it will be a bit harder for Morgan to 'push the Trump agenda' as head of ICE (if confirmed), especially more so than as he has been able to from outside the system.”

Morgan is slated to take over an agency he has no experience working for. After an 11-year stint in the Marine Corps and 20 years in the FBI, he was tapped in 2014 for assistant commissioner of Customs and Border Protection. In that role, he oversaw the Border Patrol.

But Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council, railed against Obama’s pick of Morgan in late 2016 because it marked the first time in the agency’s 93 years a nonagent had been tapped to lead the 20,000 agents. Shortly after assuming office in early 2017, Trump fired the Obama holdover.

Because of Morgan’s reputation as uninterested in working with the Border Patrol union, the second official said he may face problems if he does not work with ICE’s union president, Chris Crane.

ICE has not had a confirmed director since January 2017. Trump’s first pick, Tom Homan, retired after waiting to be confirmed. Last summer, Trump picked Customs and Border Protection Assistant Commissioner Ronald Vitiello to oversee ICE, but let him go in early April to hire someone “tougher.”

But for all Trump has done to find nominees who support his agenda and are willing to serve, the first official said he has made no progress on implementing meaningful changes to immigration and border policies.

“Think about Trump — the only thing Trump has done, he’s raised this issue … But everything he’s tried to do has failed,” the official said. “He has not made a single dent in this whole thing. Matter of fact, it’s worse than ever. He’s hoping this Morgan will bring his enforcement background to this, but he’s going to run up against the same buzz saws.”

For all of the concerns, the same official said he hopes Morgan is confirmed if only so the agency has permanent leadership.

Vitiello wouldn’t comment on how he expects Morgan to perform as director or whether he will be able to get confirmed, he said.

“I wish Mr. Morgan the best as he takes the helm,” Vitiello wrote in an email. “The men and women of ICE, and their loved ones, deserve our never ending support. They work each day to protect the homeland, secure our border and ensure integrity of the U.S. immigration and trade systems. Despite the crisis at our border, exacerbated by congressional inaction, they perform their tasks with Integrity, Courage and Excellence.”"

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had a testy exchange with Fox News host Chris Wallace on Sunday about the administration's response to Russian election interference.

""You are looking at the administration that has been tougher on Russia than any of its predecessors, and yet you continue to be fixated on something that Robert Mueller wrote down,"" Pompeo told Wallace during an interview on ""Fox News Sunday.""

Pompeo grew frustrated after Wallace shared a quote from special counsel Robert Mueller's 448-page report that said Russia ""interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion."" Wallace followed the quote with two clips of President Donald Trump answering questions Friday about a recent telephone conversation that he had with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

In the first clip, Trump implied he agreed with Putin's assessment that special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation – which he again referred to as the ""Russia hoax"" – ""started off as a mountain and it ended up being a mouse."" In the second clip, Trump was asked whether he told Putin not to interfere in the next election. Trump shrugged and said, ""we didn't discuss that.""

""Why doesn't the president get tough with Putin about what everyone seems to agree is clear: meddling in 2016 and the threat of meddling in 2020?"" Wallace asked Pompeo.

""Chris, this administration has been tougher on Russia than any of its predecessor administrations,"" the secretary of state said. ""I could go through the list but there's not time in the show to talk about all the things we've done.""

Pompeo cited increased defense spending and the administration's effort to ""make sure that every election is as safe as they can possibly be."" He said the Department of Homeland Security and U.S.intelligence agencies are ""all working"" to ""ensure"" that ""2020 will continue to be successful.""

""I take your point, because in terms of specific policies the U.S. ... "" Wallace responded before Pompeo cut him off.

""So, Chris, I don't get your point. I'm confused,"" he said, before calling Wallace ""fixated on something that Robert Mueller wrote down.""

""I'm not fixated about Robert Mueller, I'm fixated on the president's conversation with Vladimir Putin, and the fact that in a conversation he doesn't even mention meddling in 2020,"" Wallace replied. ""And the question I'm asking – I think it's a legitimate one, a lot of people are asking it, sir – is, 'Why not?'""

Pompeo explained that as someone who often speaks to foreign leaders, he understands that ""sometimes conversations just aren't long enough to include every issue that might be brought up.""

""But no one should misunderstand from your question today, your viewers should not be misled, this administration has taken seriously the threat of election interference and will continue to do so.""

Before that exchange, Wallace had asked Pompeo about an apparent discrepancy between Trump and Pompeo, as well as national security adviser John Bolton, about Putin's role in Venezuela's political and economic crisis.

Bolton said last week that Russia ""would love to get effective control of a country in this hemisphere."" And Pompeo said last week that President Nicolas Maduro has been prepared to step down before ""the Russians indicated he should stay.""

But on Friday, Trump told reporters that Putin ""is not looking at all to get involved in Venezuela, other than he’d like to see something positive happen."" Several commentators compared the discrepancy to the president's news conference last year with Putin in Helsinki where he appeared to accept the Russian president's denial of election interference over the conclusions of his own intelligence agencies.

When asked about the president's comment, Pompeo said Trump ""has been very clear on this"" and referred to a previous statement from Trump that Russia needs to ""get out"" of Venezuela.

Wallace asked Pompeo what he plans to tell Russia Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov when he meets with him in Finland on Monday.

""I'm going to tell him the same thing the president told the world: that every country must get out, including the Russians,"" Pompeo said. ""We don't want anyone messing around with Venezuela, because we want them to be an autonomous, independent, sovereign state.""

Wallace referred to their testy exchange later in the interview when he asked Pompeo about comments from North Korean officials who said the secretary of State has a ""mean character"" and that he should be replaced by someone more ""careful and mature.""

""The immaturity thing I'm not so sure about. The rest of it, I'll let the world decide,"" Pompeo said.

""There were some moments in this conversation where I thought 'mean' might be correct,"" Wallace said with a grin and a chuckle.

Both men signed a pledge to recuse themselves from dealing with former clients, but Whitehouse and Carper think those pledges may have been violated.

Clients at Hunton included the Air Permitting Forum, a coalition based at the firm that may include former clients of Wehrum and Harlow. Though the men have recused themselves from clients, they do not appear to have recused themselves from dealing with the forum.

“These groups are just another avenue for industry to surreptitiously exert its influence over EPA,” the senators wrote in a release. “Clearly there is a systemic issue at the EPA Office of Air and Radiation. There appears to be no end to the sham associations housed at Bill Wehrum and David Harlow’s former law firm that now have a direct line to power.”

That is apparent, they argue, because of a 2017 EPA memo that was issued just months after then-Administrator Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott PruittOvernight Energy: Dems challenge Trump UN nominee on climate change | Senators seek probe into head of EPA air office | UN report warns 1 million species threatened by extinction Dem senators call for probe into EPA officials over memo language The Hill's Morning Report - Biden, Trump vie for Rust Belt voters MORE called for input on what EPA regulations should be repealed.

The Air Permitting Forum responded to that call, arguing that companies should only be held responsible for pollution for which they are the predominant cause.

Identical text was used just a few months later in a memo that reversed the EPA’s position in litigation against DTE Energy Company, one of Harlow’s clients while employed at Hunton.

Wehrum was similarly accused of borrowing language from industry when he worked at the EPA under the George W. Bush administration.

EPA brushed off Whitehouse and Carper’s continued calls for investigation.

“Bill Wehrum and David Harlow are not aware of billing any hours to Air Permitting Forum. The Air Permitting Forum is not a former client of either Mr. Wehrum or Mr. Harlow. Neither Mr. Wehrum nor Mr. Harlow were involved in the development of the Air Permitting Forum’s May 15th comments,” an EPA spokesman said in a statement. “Since Mr. Wehrum and Mr. Harlow started at EPA they have both been recused from all particular matters where DTE is a party.”

Nearly 2,300 teachers have just had a mountain of student loan debt lifted off their backs, according to previously unreleased figures from the U.S. Department of Education. The move follows reporting by NPR that exposed a nightmare for public school teachers across the country.

In exchange for agreeing to work in low-income schools, aspiring teachers could get federal Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants from the department to help pay their way through college. But those grants were often unfairly turned into loans that teachers had to pay back.

In December, the Education Department proposed a fix. Now, that fix has been expanded, and thousands more teachers are likely to get help.

""We've put teachers who didn't deserve this stress, this pressure, this financial burden in a position that is frightening and confusing,"" says Education Department acting undersecretary and acting assistant secretary Diane Auer Jones. ""I can't give them back those years, and I can't take away the gray hairs and I can't take away the stress. It seems like a small thing to do to say, 'I'm sorry,' but I'm very sorry. And we want to work to fix it and correct it.""

Kaitlyn McCollum is one of the teachers who lost her grant money unfairly and, like many of them, her story began with a letter that sent her reeling.

The mailbox

Enlarge this image toggle caption Stacy Kranitz for NPR Stacy Kranitz for NPR

Two years ago, the high school teacher in Columbia, Tenn., walked to the mailbox, pregnant with her first child, and opened an official-looking letter from the Education Department.

""I remember going out to the mailbox — I even opened it up at the mailbox — and sheer panic just set in,"" McCollum says.

Her federal TEACH Grants had been turned into more than $20,000 in loans. The reason: McCollum had narrowly missed a deadline for mailing in some annual paperwork.

She walked inside, sat at the family table beside her husband, A.J., and sobbed.

Not only was this sudden, crushing debt unfair, McCollum later argued to the Education Department, she couldn't afford to pay it on her meager teacher's salary. And she didn't understand why the department wouldn't turn the loans back into grants since she could prove she was teaching, just as she'd promised. She appealed but was told her loans could not possibly be turned back into grants.

McCollum was not alone. NPR's reporting over the past year found that the same thing was happening to thousands of other public school teachers.

The problem at the heart of the TEACH Grant story is that small paperwork issues often triggered this catastrophic consequence. In order to qualify for a grant, aspiring teachers agreed to teach for four years in a low-income public school. But the rules also required that teachers send in a form every year to prove they were actually teaching.

The forms were often due over the summer when teachers and principals, who had to sign them, were away on vacation. And if teachers sent in this annual form even one day late, missing a signature or date, or with any other little problem, their TEACH Grants would be turned into loans, with interest. And this process was irreversible. Teachers were told their loans could not be converted back to grants.

For two years, the debt haunted McCollum and her young family. They went into forbearance — a brief reprieve but with interest accruing. They even moved to a smaller, less expensive house to prepare for what now seemed inevitable. No one was listening. Fair or not, the debt was growing and would need to be repaid.

And then, just a few Saturdays ago, another letter arrived in the mail. McCollum opened it in the car, her husband driving, their young son Louther chirping in the back seat. A much-needed spring break vacation lay ahead.

""Do you see that word, 'Congratulations!'?"" McCollum said, smiled and laughed. It was official: That debt, now $24,000, had finally been turned back into grants.

""You're free baby,"" her husband, A.J., said.

""Two years of us fighting this,"" McCollum said. ""We won,"" she tells NPR. ""We raised our voices and they finally heard us. Disbelief followed by a relief like I have not felt before.""

The scale of the problem and the fix

The federal TEACH Grant program was created in 2007 with the best of intentions: to help aspiring teachers, who committed to teach high-need subjects in low-income schools, pay for college. And the program succeeded in attracting bright young teachers to work in some of the nation's most underserved schools. According to the most recent data, roughly 21,000 teachers have successfully completed the program's four-year teaching requirement.

But that compares to 94,000 recipients who have had their grants turned into loans. Many of those conversions were justified — young students who later decided teaching was not for them and didn't complete their required service. But many others were undoubtedly like Kaitlyn McCollum: They have taught as promised but were trapped in the program's administrative quicksand.

In December, after multiple NPR reports on the depth of the TEACH Grant problem, the Education Department announced it would offer relief for any teacher who could prove they had fulfilled — or could still fulfill — their teaching service. Grants that had unfairly become loans because of these minor paperwork problems would, at last, become grants again. The irreversible became reversible.

""From internal reports, from the work that [NPR] did, it was abundantly clear to us that there was a problem with TEACH Grants,"" says the Education Department's Jones, who served in the same role in 2007, when the TEACH rules were first written. ""We realized that there were certain things that seemed like a good idea when we wrote the [regulation], but they were just too cumbersome for students. And unfairly so.""

The number of teachers getting help is likely to rise. According to the department, since it rolled out its fix in January nearly 6,000 teachers have applied for relief. So far, nearly 2,300 have been approved for the fix and are getting their loans turned back into grants and fewer than 20 teachers have been denied. In short, the vast majority of teachers who apply for the fix are getting their grants back.

Expanding the fix

In addition to the department's current relief efforts, advocates have also pushed for an overhaul of the TEACH Grant's rules. That process, known as negotiated rulemaking, recently concluded with something of a surprise: The department agreed to expand its fix to reach even more teachers and to make the program much easier to navigate.

Once these new rules go into effect, TEACH Grants can no longer be turned into loans just because of late or incomplete annual paperwork. So that draconian penalty for such a small infraction will disappear.

The department is also committing to help teachers who had their credit hurt when they defaulted on these loans.

But hanging over this process has been one thorny question: what to do about teachers who lost their grants and, as a result, decided to change schools or quit teaching altogether. In other words, they lost their grants, were told there was nothing they could do, and so they moved on with their lives.

""On the phone, honestly, I cried at one point. [Because] I was like, this isn't right. You know, it's not fair,"" remembers Victoria Libsack, who taught for three years in a low-income Phoenix school. But after she narrowly missed a paperwork deadline and her grants were converted to loans, Libsack eventually moved to a different state and took a job at a school that doesn't meet TEACH requirements.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Beth Nakamura for NPR Beth Nakamura for NPR

The problem for Libsack and teachers like her is that the program requires four years of teaching within an eight-year window. Even with the department's initial fix, Libsack would have very little time to quit her current job, potentially move again, and find a new job in a qualifying school to complete her required service. And some teachers have no time left at all.

In February, Libsack flew to Washington, D.C., to share her story with the government committee that has been tasked with rewriting the rules.

""Living on a teacher's salary at a low-income school, I had just enough to live,"" Libsack told the committee. ""I loved teaching, but I felt overwhelmed and defeated when my TEACH Grant was converted.""

That rules committee heard Libsack and voted to expand the department's fix to include teachers like her. They agreed to go back and pause the eight-year clock at the time when a teacher's grants were first converted.

For Libsack, that means she should now have five more years to complete her final year of service. She'll still need to change schools to qualify. That's not ideal, she says, but it will mean she won't have to pay upward of $20,000 in loans. Libsack says she's now feeling ""hopeful"" because her government finally listened.

""For me, as a teacher, it's awesome,"" she says, ""because then I can convey that to the students and say, 'Hey, you do have a voice. You are citizens. You do have a role in our government.' ""

The department's fix has not been entirely smooth. Many teachers have told NPR that some call-center staff seemed unfamiliar with the new rules — and that the paperwork they were sent, even after they got approved, was really confusing.

Some advocates argue the department should do even more for teachers like Libsack. Patrick Llewellyn, an attorney at Public Citizen Litigation Group, says the government should be more flexible with teachers who lost their grants unfairly many years ago. He says it should reduce the number of years they're required to teach in order to satisfy the program's requirements and keep their grants.

""For people who were converted eight, nine, 10 years ago, it is a lot to ask of them [to quit their current job and find another one] if they are doing something completely different,"" Llewellyn says, especially since they are in this position because of how the program has been mishandled.

But on this point the department is holding firm with the original terms of the deal: Teachers have to teach for four years.

Perhaps the biggest challenge remaining for the Education Department is one of outreach and communication.

""There is relief available for teachers,"" says Llewellyn, ""but they need to know about it.""

Some teachers who were hit with these unfair debts still may not realize they qualify to have them forgiven or refunded if they've already paid them. Many have changed addresses, both physical and email, and may be difficult to find. The department says it is reaching out, to make sure those who need the help know that it's finally there. It also encourages any teachers who think they might qualify to proactively ask for help."
Arizona Democrats urge DHS to send FEMA to southern border,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/arizona-democrats-urge-dhs-to-send-fema-to-southern-border,"Five House Democrats from Arizona on Monday asked the Department of Homeland Security to consider deploying Federal Emergency Management Agency resources and personnel to help respond to the ""humanitarian crisis"" at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Reps. Ruben Gallego, Raúl Grijalva, Ann Kirkpatrick, Tom O’Halleran, and Greg Stanton told acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan in a letter they would be supportive if he chose to activate FEMA to help handle the tens of thousands of families and children coming into federal custody at the southern border each month.

“[D]o you believe that FEMA has the authority to provide additional resources to reduce the burden on other DHS agencies, localities, and local groups who are overwhelmed by this crisis? If so, we strongly urge you to leverage these resources,” the lawmakers wrote.

Sen. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., told reporters at a press conference in Yuma, Ariz., last month she opposed taking money from FEMA and instead wanted to address asylum protocols.

The Trump administration began warning of a “crisis” at the border late last year. Since then, the number of people apprehended for illegal entry has spiked from 70,000 to 92,000 in March.

Although FEMA workers are typically sent to areas where major natural disasters have hit, sending people and resources to the southern border would not be unprecedented. At the height of the unaccompanied minors surge in June 2014, former President Barack Obama called in FEMA to oversee the federal response to the more than 5,000 children arriving at the border.

In March, nearly 9,000 unaccompanied children showed up and another 60,000 people taken into custody were families.

The group of Democrats told McAleenan they are disappointed with the department’s attempt to set up a cell to oversee the federal effort to deal with the ""humanitarian crisis.""

Five weeks ago, then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen tapped its Joint Task Force West director, Manuel Padilla, to oversee an interagency border emergency cell. Padilla’s job was to improve the sharing of information and coordinating support among DHS agencies, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement, CBP, and Citizenship and Immigration Services.

But the lawmakers said since Nielsen’s sudden departure in mid-April, DHS has not shared any information about the cell’s work or how it is assisting agencies.

“At the moment, it appears that this cell is insufficient to adequately coordinate the response to the humanitarian crisis. Please explain what Mr. Padilla’s role will be moving forward and what resources you will provide him to do his job,” the letter states. “It is imperative that the federal coordinator gather and analyze information from local officials to resolve logistical, personnel, and capacity issues as well as coordinate with and leverage state, local, tribal, and non-governmental resources. This is a complex, multi-jurisdictional problem that requires a centralized command and coordination structure.”

The Democratic coalition wants to see DHS appoint a new federal crisis coordinator or enhance Padilla’s responsibilities so that not only the government response is understood and being carried out swiftly, but nongovernmental organizations can better coordinate with DHS agencies.

In early April, the White House was reported to be considering naming an immigration czar to his staff, though no announcements have been made.

Padilla was temporarily reassigned to the Federal Emergency Management Agency's National Response Coordination Center in Washington. He was previously the chief of Border Patrol's busiest sector on the southern border, the Rio Grande Valley in Texas."

President Donald Trump's job-approval rating is holding steady, even though most Americans don't believe he has been honest in dealing with the investigation into election tampering by Russia headed by special counsel Robert Mueller, a new survey shows.

Forty-six % of Americans approve of Trump's job performance, about the same as the 43 % who approved a month ago, and 51 % disapprove, according to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Sunday

Sixty percent of Americans say Trump has not been honest and truthful in dealing with the Russia investigation while 37 % say Trump has been honest and truthful. The partisan breakdown on this question is stark, with 92 % of Democrats saying Trump hasn't been truthful while only 23 % of Republicans feel this way. Sixty-three % of independents believe Trump hasn't been truthful in handling the investigation.

The investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign ""has done very little to shake Americans out of their partisan viewpoints,"" said Republican pollster Micah Roberts, who helped to conduct the survey with Democratic pollster Peter Hart. Hart said, ""The American public has reached a hung jury. Not innocent, not guilty, and they haven't reached a consensus.""

Forty-nine percent say Congress should immediately begin impeachment hearings against Trump or continue investigations into possible impeachment to study the issue further, while 48 percent oppose all impeachment hearings and say Trump should finish his current term as president..

Fifty-one percent approve of Trump's handling of the economy, a bright spot for the president in the polling.

U.S. 'gravely concerned' by human rights abuses in North Korea: State Department,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-usa-rights/us-gravely-concerned-by-human-rights-abuses-in-north-korea-state-department-idUSKCN1SC1WI,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - North Korea’s government has subjected its people to “egregious violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms” and the United States remains “gravely concerned and deeply troubled” by the abuses, the U.S. State Department said on Monday.

William Barr’s Justice Department Just Filed the Most Nakedly Political Brief in the Agency’s History,https://slate.com,['Mark Joseph Stern'],05-02-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/william-barr-doj-obamacare-brief-partisan-hack.html,"Attorney General William Barr testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday in Washington. Win McNamee/Getty Images

On Wednesday afternoon, after Attorney General William Barr finished his truculent and mendacious testimony before the Senate, the Department of Justice filed perhaps the most embarrassing, illogical, and nakedly political brief in the history of the agency. With Barr’s assent, the DOJ argued that the entire Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional because Congress zeroed out the individual mandate’s penalty in 2017. The timing couldn’t be worse. After obliterating his own credibility at the Senate hearing, Barr scorched the Justice Department’s legitimacy, deploying fatuous pseudo-legal arguments to further the Trump administration’s partisan goals. The DOJ will not soon recover from Wednesday’s body blow.

Texas v. United States, the latest assault on the ACA, is built upon a series of sophistries. The case was brought by a coalition of conservative states, led by Texas, which recruited two consultants to serve as plaintiffs. They assert that when Congress reduced the ACA’s penalty to zero dollars, it inadvertently destroyed the whole law—the tax credits, the exchanges, protections for preexisting conditions, Medicaid expansion, everything. According to Texas’ theory, the Supreme Court only upheld the ACA because it interpreted the penalty as a tax. But, they claim, a tax that collects zero dollars is not a true tax. So the individual mandate can no longer be viewed as a tax, rendering it unconstitutional. And because Congress never intended the ACA to function without the individual mandate, the rest of the law must be struck down too.

This leap in logic makes no sense. It is true that taxes typically collect revenue, so perhaps the mandate cannot fairly be called a tax anymore. It could even be true that the zeroed-out penalty is now unconstitutional. But that does not matter, because if the penalty is illegal, it should be severed from the rest of the law. As the Supreme Court recently explained, when one provision of a statute is invalidated, courts should preserve the remainder of the law unless it is “evident” that Congress “would not have enacted those provisions … independently.” In other words, courts that strike down part of a law should not eviscerate the rest of it without evidence that Congress would’ve wanted that extreme result.

Here, congressional intent is about as clear as it can get. In 2017, Congress declined to repeal the entire ACA but chose to zero out the individual mandate’s penalty in the tax bill. By doing so, it declared its belief that the law could function without an operative penalty, a lawful exercise of its legislative powers. But Texas claimed that by amending the ACA, Congress inadvertently demolished it, because the law cannot function without a penalty—even though Congress decided that it could. Thus, according to the plaintiffs, courts should simply sweep aside this legislative intent and invalidate the law top to bottom.

Congressional intent is about as clear as it can get.

In an opinion panned by liberals and conservatives alike, U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor embraced this theory late last year and ruled that the entire ACA is unconstitutional. This view was too militant even for Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ Justice Department, which opted for a compromise position: It alleged that the mandate was unconstitutional but that only a few other provisions must fall with it. This half-measure was still a big deal, because the DOJ urged the courts to kill a centerpiece of the law: its bar on discrimination against people with preexisting conditions. And the DOJ’s brief at the time reflected, as University of Michigan law professor Nicholas Bagley put it, “enormous contempt for the rule of law.” It was, as other scholars noted, “excruciatingly stupid.” But at least the DOJ did not go whole hog, adopting Texas’ radical position that courts should reject Congress’ authority to amend its own law.

Until now. After Barr took control of the DOJ, the agency changed its position and has now told the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that Texas is right—the full ACA is now unconstitutional. With a straight face, the Justice Department argues that, by reducing the mandate to zero dollars, Congress gave Americans a “legal command” to buy health insurance. The Supreme Court has said that such a direct command would be unconstitutional because the mandate could only be justified as a tax. Moreover, the justices who discussed severability said that the ACA cannot function without the mandate. In sum, the DOJ wrote, the mandate is now illegal, it cannot be severed, and so the whole law is unconstitutional.

Where to begin with this lunacy? Start with the DOJ’s framing of the mandate as it stands now. As a factual matter, the ACA currently gives Americans a choice between buying health insurance and paying nothing. There’s no real dispute here; if you forgo insurance, you will suffer no legal consequences. Yet the DOJ interprets the mandate as a “command” that gives Americans “no choice” but to purchase insurance. And its brief insists that Congress created this command in its 2017 tax bill—even though legislators surely knew that the Supreme Court already ruled that such a command would be unconstitutional in 2012’s NFIB v. Sebelius.

It requires willing suspension of disbelief to surmise that by giving Americans a choice not to buy insurance by zeroing out the mandate, Congress actually gave them a “command” to insure themselves. And it taxes credulity to believe that Congress would create this “command” after the Supreme Court stated that such a rule would be unconstitutional.

But imagine for a moment that the DOJ is right—that the Republican-led Congress of 2017 didn’t actually relieve Americans of their duty to buy health insurance but forced them to do so (without any enforcement mechanism). If the courts must strike down this new “legal command,” why should the remainder of the law fall with it? After all, Congress obviously thought the ACA could function without a mandate that raises revenue. To square this circle, the DOJ repeatedly cites the dissent in NFIB, which proclaimed that the mandate could not be severed from the remainder of the law. The Justice Department seems to think that the view of four dissenting justices (in a 2012 case) can override the view of Congress (in 2017 legislation). It appears to have forgotten that a dissent is not law.

The zaniest portion of Wednesday’s brief, however, has to be its effort to salvage the few provisions of the ACA that the current administration likes. It does so by selectively raising the problem of standing. Now, in reality, the individual plaintiffs in this case—two consultants who don’t want to buy health insurance—shouldn’t have standing to sue at all. That requires an injury, and these plaintiffs have none, because they pay no penalty for forgoing insurance. The DOJ casts this problem aside by asserting that they are injured by the “legal command” to insure themselves. And its brief argues that the plaintiffs have standing “to challenge the numerous provisions of the ACA that work together to cause” this injury.

But in a puzzling paragraph, the DOJ adds that the plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge several provisions of the ACA that criminalize health care fraud. Why? The real answer is that the Justice Department is already prosecuting people under these provisions, and those prosecutions would be thwarted if the full law were struck down. But the DOJ avows that while the plaintiffs have standing to challenge almost the entire ACA, they can’t challenge these provisions because they do not “actually injure the individual plaintiffs.” Oh, really? So the rule that insurers not discriminate against people with preexisting conditions, and the tax credits for lower-income Americans, and the expansion of Medicaid in states other than Texas—all these provisions “actually injure” the plaintiffs? But prohibitions on fraud somehow do not? The DOJ makes no effort to defend this evanescent distinction, because it is indefensible.

Barr reportedly opposed adopting this preposterous position but caved to President Donald Trump’s demands. He deserves no credit for his feeble resistance. Barr owns this brief, and it will live on as a testament to his craven lawlessness long after the Supreme Court rejects its casuistry. The Justice Department’s reputation will take years to recover from this nadir, if it ever does. Barr marched his agency to the brink of illegitimacy."
Trump official names former Secret Service head to top DHS post,https://thehill.com,[],05-03-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/442096-trump-official-names-former-secret-service-head-to-top-dhs-post,"Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan has named Randolph “Tex” Alles, the former head of the Secret Service, to a top Homeland Security post.

McAleenan announced Friday that Alles, who stepped down as Secret Service director this week, will take over as acting Deputy Under Secretary for Management at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

ADVERTISEMENT In his role, Alles ""will oversee all aspects of the Department’s management programs, including financial, human capital, information technology, procurement, security, and asset management,"" according to the DHS statement.

The post has been held by Chip Fulghum, who stepped up to fill the position following the departure of Claire Grady. Grady, who served as DHS's acting deputy secretary, resigned last month amid a shakeup at the department.

""Mr. Fulghum has served the men and women of DHS with distinction since first joining in 2012, and we are forever grateful for his service. I wish him the very best in the years ahead,"" McAleenan said in the statement Friday.

The White House announced last month that Alles was being replaced as Secret Service director by James Murray, the former deputy assistant director of the Office of Protective Operations.

Alles departed the agency amid reports that his relationship with Trump had soured for months. Trump reportedly made fun of the Secret Service director’s appearance, calling him “Dumbo” because of his ears.

Infected blood scandal: key files overlooked by Department of Health,https://www.theguardian.com,['Owen Bowcott'],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/may/07/infected-blood-scandal-key-files-overlooked-by-department-of-health,"The titles of 139 key files about HIV and infected blood transfusions that were missed by a supposedly thorough Department of Health internal search have been revealed through a freedom of information request.

The extraordinary oversights highlight, at the very least, the chaotic state of the department’s filing systems and will reinforce campaigners’ claims that there has been a cover-up to withhold embarrassing documents.

The full list of papers includes, for example, those labelled “Costing the care of HIV infections in haemophiliacs”, “Screening blood for high-risk donations” and “Blood screening for Aids”.

The potentially revelatory material has now been handed over to the infected blood inquiry, which began its hearings in London last week into a scandal that is estimated to have claimed more than 3,000 lives. Before effective screening was introduced, NHS patients were given transfusions and blood products in the 1970s and 1980s containing HIV and hepatitis C viruses.

As preparation for the inquiry, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) carried out what was meant to be a comprehensive trawl through its records for anything that might be relevant. That exploration was then double-checked by the Government Internal Audit Agency (GIAA), which discovered a further “139 files likely to be directly relevant to the inquiry”.

In its report, the GIAA said: “It is our understanding that the [DHSC’s research management] team’s methodology should have identified these files … Therefore it is likely that the additional files identified in the searches we conducted were not filed with the correct prefixes, or were not initially identified due to pre-existing inconsistencies in the filing system.”

Jasons Evans, the founder of the campaign group Factor 8, submitted a freedom of information request asking for details about what the missed files covered. The titles released show that rather than relating to marginal issues, they cover the central questions being addressed by the inquiry.

The previously ignored files date back the 1970s and were evidently not available to earlier investigations such as the Penrose inquiry. Some are from as recently as 2009. A number are “defence litigation documents”, others transfusion service records.

One, from 1988, is entitled “Submission to the law officers on the lawfulness of certain types of anonymous testing for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)”. A few are records of the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens.

The files also include documents from the 1980s on the link between Aids and blood factor products, as well as investigations into the transmission of hepatitis C through transfusions. A series of files are labelled “Port screening – review of imported infection”.

Evans said: “Are we really supposed to believe the Department of Health accidentally missed 139 clearly relevant files? It really is one thing after another with them as they desperately cling on to their denial of liability for the contaminated blood scandal.

“The important thing here is that a number of these files that they apparently missed relate directly to litigation matters and legal advice. These are the files where we are likely to get a serious insight into the government’s legal thinking on these issues and so they are absolutely crucial.”

The infected blood inquiry, which resumes its hearings on Tuesday, is now assessing the significance of the files. Health experts and former ministers are not due to be called to answer questions until next year at the earliest.

A DHSC spokesperson said: “We are committed to being open and transparent with the inquiry and have waived the usual legal privileges to assist the process. We have already sent thousands of documents to the inquiry, and will continue to send more when necessary. The inquiry has always been free to request any files they wish to review and we will ensure these are shared as soon as possible.”"

The U.S. Agriculture Department cut five Iowa cities from its short list of possible homes for two major agricultural research headquarters.

USDA chopped Ames, Ankeny, Council Bluffs, Des Moines and West Des Moines from contention to become its Economic Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture headquarters.

In March, USDA whittled the list of cities competing for the headquarters in half to about 70. USDA wants to move the operations from Washington, D.C.

Dozens of former federal leaders and scientific and agricultural groups have written to lawmakers to oppose Perdue's plan to move the agencies.

They're concerned about losing highly skilled workers who are unable or unwilling to make the move; loss of collaboration with agencies located in Washington; and no clear cost-benefit analysis, among other concerns.

VA Comes Out Against Bills on Medical Marijuana for Veterans,https://www.military.com,['Patricia Kime'],05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.military.com/daily-news/2019/05/02/va-comes-out-against-bills-medical-marijuana-veterans.html,"The Department of Veterans Affairs opposes three legislative proposals that would expand research on medical marijuana at the VA and give veterans access to the drug in states where it is legal.

During a hearing Tuesday on eight VA health-related bills under consideration by Congress, VA officials told House lawmakers that as long as marijuana is illegal under federal law, the department cannot support legislation that promotes its role at the VA.

""[The House Veterans Affairs Committee] can make strong proposals for us to move forward with recommendations of filling out forms and such but, in the end, we need to go back to the [Drug Enforcement Agency] and [Justice Department] for their opinion,"" said Larry Mole, chief consultant for population health at the VA.

Three of the bills before the House Veterans Affairs health subcommittee relate to medical marijuana. One, the Veterans Equal Access Act, H.R. 1647, sponsored by Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Oregon, would allow VA health providers to recommend medical marijuana to their veteran patients and fill out the necessary paperwork for them to enroll in state marijuana programs.

Related content:

Blumenauer, who has introduced the bill in every Congress since 2014, said that, for some veterans, marijuana and cannabis derivatives are lifesavers that keep them from using addictive medications such as opioids to treat post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic pain, seizures and glaucoma. Yet VA health care providers are not allowed to recommend it.

""Opioids steal the lives of 115 Americans every day ... as veterans with PTSD, chronic pain and any number of ailments are looking for relief, lethal opioid overdoses among VA patients are almost twice the national average. We are doing something wrong,"" he said.

Another bill, the VA Medicinal Cannabis Research Act, H.R. 712, would direct the VA to conduct a large-scale clinical trial on the effects of cannabis on conditions such as PTSD and chronic pain.

Bill sponsor Rep. Lou Correa, D-California, said the research would examine the effectiveness of cannabis on various health conditions, as well as delivery methods.

""It's time to do research. It's time for veterans to know what cannabis is good for and what cannabis is not good for,"" Correa said.

A third, the Veterans Cannabis Use for Safe Healing Act, H.R. 2192, would protect veterans' benefits by prohibiting the VA from denying health care and compensation for veterans participating in a state medical marijuana program.

Keita Franklin, the VA's national director of suicide prevention, said that while the department supports medical marijuana research and is currently involved in a trial for treating PTSD, it opposes the bills.

According to Franklin, VA doctors would be subject to criminal prosecution if they recommended medical marijuana or made referrals to state agencies, as specified by DEA guidance.

And Correa's bill, she said, would not follow standard practice in medical research.

""Typically, a smaller early-phase trial would advance our knowledge and the benefits and risks regarding cannabis before moving to the expansive approach described in this legislation,"" she said. ""Any trial involving human subjects must include an evaluation on the risks and the safety, and include the smallest number of participants to avoid putting the subjects at increased risk unnecessarily. For these reasons, we don't support this legislation.""

She added that the third piece of legislation is unnecessary because VA policy states that the department cannot deny benefits based on marijuana use, although VA physicians are allowed to tailor a patient's prescription medications based on whether they are using cannabis.

Veterans advocates who testified expressed varying levels of support for the bills.

Carlos Fuentes, director of national legislative service for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, said the VFW does not support the Veterans Equal Access bill because it doesn't think the VA should recommend unproven medical treatments, nor should it authorize a treatment for a veteran that would require the former service member to get it outside the VA, where they would be responsible for finding a quality product and paying for it.

The VFW does, however, support VA research on cannabis.

""VA's overreliance on opioids to treat chronic pain and other conditions has led to addiction and even deaths. To its credit ... VA has reduced the number of patients to whom it has prescribed opioids by 22 percent. Now, VA must expand research on the efficacy of nontraditional alternatives to opioids,"" Fuentes said.

Joy Ilam, national legislative director for Disabled American Veterans, agreed.

""We want to make sure there is no harm done. Research is the first step in doing that,"" Ilam said.

Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America research director Stephanie Mullen said the IAVA supports cannabis research and access to it.

""It's past time for VA to catch up,"" Mullen said. ""Veterans are suffering from their injuries today.""

Among the other bills and draft bills discussed at the hearing was one that seeks to expand complementary and alternative therapies and treatments at VA medical facilities, and another that would require the VA to report suicides and attempts that occur on VA campuses within a week of them happening.

Franklin said the VA supports both proposals.

"EPA Seeks Public Comment on Use of Monsanto’s Weedkiller, Glyphosate on Oats Used in Foods Marketed to Kids",https://www.ewg.org,[],,,,https://www.ewg.org/release/epa-seeks-public-comment-use-monsanto-s-weedkiller-glyphosate-oats-used-foods-marketed-kids,"WASHINGTON – The Environmental Protection Agency is formally requesting feedback on a petition submitted by EWG and food companies seeking to significantly limit the use of glyphosate, the active ingredient in Bayer/Monsanto’s weedkiller Roundup, on oats that are used to make a wide array of children’s foods, like breakfast bars and cereals.

EPA announced today that it will open up a 30-day public comment period beginning Monday, May 6.

Two rounds of laboratory tests commissioned by EWG found glyphosate in nearly every sample of oat-based cereal and other breakfast products at levels higher than what EWG considers protective for children’s health.

“No parent should worry whether feeding their children healthy oat-based foods will also expose them to a chemical linked to cancer,” said EWG Legislative Director Colin O’Neil.

“If EPA ultimately supports this petition, it could be the beginning of the end for one of the primary sources of glyphosate exposure in the diets of both children and adults,” said O’Neil. “We can be sure that the pesticide/agrichemical lobby won’t sit on the sidelines, though. Over the next month, it will be paramount that EPA hear from as many Americans as possible in order to build the necessary pressure to finally prohibit this needless use of Monsanto’s cancer-causing weedkiller.”

“For far too long, millions of Americans have been getting a dose of this toxic herbicide along with their breakfast,” said EWG Senior Science Advisor for Children’s Environmental Health Olga Naidenko, Ph.D. “If the EPA really cares about children’s health, it should cut off the largest source of glyphosate exposure from foods that children eat daily.”

The EPA’s legal limit on glyphosate residues is 30 parts per million, or ppm. The petition, joined by 18 industry leaders, asks the EPA to set a more protective standard of 0.1 ppm, which was the legal limit in 1993.

Over the past 25 years, the EPA has increased the amount of glyphosate residue allowed on oats 300-fold. The first increase, to 20 ppm, was granted in response to a 1997 petition from Monsanto, when farmers around the world first began using glyphosate widely as a late-season drying agent. It was increased to the current 30 ppm level in 2008.

Since then, scientists have linked glyphosate to cancer, and researchers around the world have called for stricter limits on glyphosate exposures.

In 2015, 17 of the world’s top cancer researchers convened by the International Agency for Research on Cancer reviewed hundreds of studies on glyphosate and voted unanimously to classify the weedkiller as “probably carcinogenic to humans.” In 2017, California added glyphosate to its official list of chemicals known to cause cancer.

A new analysis of glyphosate, released in April by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, gives weight to studies connecting glyphosate and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and recommends monitoring children’s exposure to this toxic weedkiller.

The petition, first filed in September by EWG, now includes MegaFood, Ben & Jerry’s, Stonyfield Organic, MOM’s Organic Market, Nature’s Path, One Degree Organic Foods, National Co+op Grocers, Happy Family Organics, Amy’s Kitchen, Clif Bar & Company, Earth’s Best Organic, GrandyOats, INFRA, KIND Healthy Snacks, Lundberg Family Farms, Organic Valley, Patagonia Provisions and PCC Community Markets.

Code Pink refusing to leave Venezuela’s DC embassy as State Dept. slams ‘trespassers’,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Alex Pappas', 'Alex Pappas Is A Politics Reporter At Foxnews.Com. Follow Him On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/code-pink-refusing-to-leave-venezuelas-dc-embassy-as-state-dept-slams-trespassers,"Liberal activists from the anti-war group Code Pink are refusing to leave the abandoned Venezuelan embassy in Washington, vowing to protect the building from a “hostile takeover” as the U.S. State Department labels them “trespassers” and calls on them to leave.

About 50 pro-regime activists have been living inside the building for several weeks in support of embattled socialist President Nicolas Maduro. In recent days, they’ve clashed outside the embassy with supporters of opposition leader Juan Guaido, who has called for a military uprising in Venezuela and has the support of the Trump administration.

VENEZUELANS CLASH WITH PRO-MADURO CODE PINK ACTIVISTS IN TENSE SCENE OUTSIDE DC EMBASSY

“We feel that the elected government and the government that holds power and the government that’s recognized by the United Nations is the Maduro government, and they deserve to have their embassy here,” Code Pink co-founder Medea Benjamin told Fox News in an interview outside the embassy in D.C.'s Georgetown neighborhood, as rain drenched the activists outside. “That’s why we’ve been here.”

The United States and others countries believe Maduro's most recent election was fraudulent and have said he's not the legitimate president of Venezuela. But Benjamin has repeatedly said activists are there to prevent a “hostile takeover” of the embassy. Benjamin said the group has the permission of the Maduro government to stay in the embassy.

A State Department spokesperson in a Thursday statement called for the activists to leave, saying, “Any unauthorized individuals on the property are trespassers.”

“The Venezuelan government, led by interim President Juan Guaido, has legal authority over the Venezuelan Embassy in Washington, D.C.,” the spokesperson said, adding, “We encourage the remaining unauthorized individuals to vacate the building and to conduct any future protest peacefully and through legal means.”

On Tuesday, flag-waving and national-anthem singing demonstrators, many of whom were born in Venezuela, quickly outnumbered those from Code Pink. They gathered outside the embassy to protest Code Pink members' presence, demanding they leave.

“This group – the Code Pink – has taken the embassy,” one pro-Guaido protester, Giuliano Gandullia, 40, told Fox News outside the embassy. “We want to enter. We want to take over. And demonstrate that it belongs to us.”

The gathering of protesters on Tuesday forced city police in Washington to close down 30th Street, as uniformed Secret Service officers stood between the Maduro and Guaido protesters.

ILHAN OMAR FACES BACKLASH AFTER COMPLAINING ABOUT US 'BULLYING' IN VENEZUELA

But while law enforcement has been on the scene during protests, the activists inside have not been arrested or forced out.

Alaina Gertz, a spokeswoman for the D.C. police, said any police “involvement would be on public space and not diplomatic property.”

A Secret Service spokesman official said the Secret Service Uniformed Division’s Foreign Missions Branch patrols diplomatic locations in Washington’s embassy district, and officers have been on scene to public safety during ongoing demonstrations.

Two Code Pink protesters standing at the door of the embassy this week held a sign that said: “Hands off Venezuela.” Another sign hanging from the building read, “Nicolas Maduro is the president.”

VENEZUELA SEES UNREST AS GUAIDÓ SEEKS POWER

On Thursday afternoon, amid a downpour, Benjamin said the group isn’t afraid of being evicted and wouldn’t contemplate what the activists would do if Maduro leaves the country.

“I think it’s a silly question,” Benjamin said. “Because Maduro is not going to leave.”

Code Pink refers to the group's presence as the “Embassy Civilian Protection Collective” and says the pro-Guaido protesters are stopping new people, food and supplies from getting inside the building. Until recently, the group said, they were enjoying themselves.

“Inside it’s a very good collective – until this very aggressive mob showed up,” Benjamin said. “We were having events every single night. We were doing educational activities. We had over 100 hundred people coming into the events.”

Meanwhile, the pro-Guaido protesters are outside the embassy holding signs like “Venezuela wants Democracy, not another Cuba.” In interviews, these protesters emphasized that they are from Venezuela – unlike many of the Code Pink protesters.

“Those people right there, they’re not Venezuelan. They don’t have a passport. They don’t have our IDs,” said 32-year-old Clemente Pinate, who said he is from the country and came to the United States when he was 12.

The Guaido protesters are using bullhorns to call on Code Pink to the leave the embassy, which was officially closed by Maduro earlier this year.

“We’re here today to denounce the trespassing of Code Pink,” said Carla Bustillos, 39. “This is a property of the people of Venezuela. It’s an asset of the nation, and the nation is now facing a transition -- a transition to democracy.”"
Did the Department of Justice Give the Mueller Letter to the Post to Screw the Times?,https://www.vanityfair.com,"['Joe Pompeo', 'Vanity Fair', 'Bess Levin', 'Alison Durkee']",,,,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/05/did-the-department-of-justice-give-the-mueller-letter-to-the-post,"It was a familiar one-two in the age of Trump. On Tuesday, the day before Attorney General William Barr’s Senate testimony, The Washington Post published a staggering scoop, one that’s driven the news ever since: Robert Mueller had written a letter to Barr complaining that his initial summary of the Mueller report “did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance” of the special counsel’s work.

Minutes later, The New York Times published a story with almost precisely the same reporting. “I felt a flashback to the days of 2017 and 2018 when the Times and the Post published dueling scoops the way fighters trade blows,” CNN’s Brian Stelter remarked in his newsletter that night.

The Times and the Post are both well sourced and are often in pursuit of the same stories. In this instance, however, the Times has been left with the distinct impression that the Department of Justice intentionally screwed it by helping its competitor get the scoop. “We’ll certainly be more cautious going forward when we deal with D.O.J.,” a Times reporter familiar with the matter told me. (A D.O.J. official likewise told me the department will do the same when dealing with the Times.)

Here’s what happened, as far as I’ve been able to piece it together from multiple sources with direct knowledge of how things went down: the D.O.J. learned on Sunday that the Times was working on a story about the letter, which Mueller sent to Barr on March 27. The Times believes it was the first news outlet to nail down reporting on the letter and reach out to the D.O.J. On Tuesday, the D.O.J. confirmed the letter not to the Times, but to Devlin Barrett of the Post, and also allowed him to review it. Barrett and Matt Zapotosky broke the story for the Post just after 7 P.M. The Times immediately rushed out a story by Mark Mazzetti and Michael Schmidt, followed by other news outlets. By the next day, Times reporters had heard from contacts within the D.O.J. that the department had wanted “to teach Schmidt a lesson.” Here’s where the plot thickens: It turns out the Post had its first conversations about the letter with the D.O.J. the previous week, and from its perspective, it got the story fair and square.

In recent days, within the club of journalists who report on federal-law enforcement, there’s been a lot of chatter about how the Mueller letter leaked, and depending on who you talk to, the D.O.J. either laid some dark arts on the Times, or played ball with the Post in a respectable way. But the one thing that’s abundantly clear, based on hours of conversations I had about the episode on Friday, is that the tiff has only inflamed tensions between the D.O.J. and at least some of the Times reporters who cover it. (The Times and the D.O.J. declined to comment, as did the Post.)

Even before this, it’s safe to say there was no love lost between the D.O.J. and the Times, which by now has logged a deep backlist of stories—many carrying Schmidt’s byline—that have triggered conniptions at 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, such as last year’s article about Deputy A.G. Rod Rosenstein reportedly suggesting that he might secretly record President Donald Trump, or that piece from April 3 reporting that some members of Mueller’s team thought Barr “failed to adequately portray the findings of their inquiry.” At least one D.O.J. official has communicated to Times reporters that the department believes the Times sits on stories, only to drop them at crucial moments—say, immediately before a high-profile congressional hearing. As a journalist from another news outlet observed, “In general, there’s a lot of bad blood at this point.”

At the same time, the truth is that reporting can be a film-noir activity, filled with horse-trading and dirty tricks and black eyes. As another Times reporter familiar with the situation put it, “If you’re gonna play in this sandbox on a big story, shit like this happens. But the game goes on.”

Interior Dept. Loosens Offshore-Drilling Safety Rules Dating From Deepwater Horizon,https://www.nytimes.com,['Coral Davenport'],05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/climate/offshore-drilling-safety-rollback-deepwater-horizon.html,"Want climate news in your inbox?

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Thursday made public its rollback of a major offshore-drilling safety regulation, significantly weakening an Obama-era rule that was put in place after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion in the Gulf of Mexico, which killed 11 people and sent 4.9 million barrels of oil gushing into the sea, causing the worst oil spill in American history.

Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, a former oil lobbyist who was confirmed by the Senate last month to head the agency that oversees the nation’s public lands and waters, announced the plan Thursday afternoon in Port Fourchon, La., the vast industrial hub that serves as the onshore base for most companies that drill in the Gulf of Mexico.

The oil industry praised the move. Environmental groups warned that the rollbacks could pave the way for similar crises to happen again.

The weakened safety rules come as the Trump administration has also sought to vastly expand offshore drilling in the nation’s waters. Last year the Interior Department proposed opening almost the entire United States coastline to drilling, although Mr. Bernhardt recently said the administration may delay those plans while court challenges are addressed."

These poll results suggest that most Americans -- and Democrats in particular -- are open to electing him president, so long as he meets other qualifications.

Yet, it seems like Buttigieg may run into electability concerns for the simple reason that Democrats don't think (perhaps wrongly if you believe this poll) the country is ready. It's also possible that some voters are not willing to admit to homophobia, while signaling it by saying essentially, ""I'm ready, but others may not be.""

Either way, this poll suggests that Buttigieg might hit a wall in a Democratic primary in which voters are placing a high emphasis on the ability to beat President Donald Trump.

I should note that polling on whether the country is ready for a gay president differs significantly from polling on whether Americans thought the country was ready for a black president in 2007 or a woman president in 2015.

Fox News poll taken after then-Sen. Barack Obama declared in February 2007 found that 69% of Democrats and 69% of voters thought the country was ready to elect a black president. In other words, electability was less of a problem for Obama then than Buttigieg now.

Voters were even more sure that the country was ready to elect a woman president after former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declared a second bid for the presidency in April 2015. A CBS News poll conducted in the spring of that year showed that 89% of Democrats and 78% of all Americans said the country was ready for a woman president.

Interestingly, in all three instances, more voters said they were ready for a black, female or gay president than thought the country was ready for one.

But even if Americans are more tolerant of gay Americans than voters think they are, more are prejudiced against gay Americans than they were against black Americans in 2007 or women in 2014. Today, about a quarter of all voters (including 10% of Democrats) told Quinnipiac that they weren't open to vote for a gay man for president. Back in 2007 and 2015, 5% or less of Americans and Democrats said they weren't willing to vote for a qualified black person and woman to be president, respectively.

Prejudice against gay Americans is evident in other polling as well. About 35% of Americans openly admitted in the 2018 General Social Survey that they thought ""homosexual sex relations"" were almost always or always wrong. Even more than 25% of Democrats said it was almost always or always wrong.

Now, Americans have certainly become more comfortable with the idea of a gay president than they used to be. The percentage of Americans who say they would vote for a gay person for president is up 15-20 points since 2007 , depending on the poll you look at. The percentage of Democrats who say they would vote for a gay person for president is up around 25 points.

Further, it's possible that if Buttigieg becomes successful on the campaign trail, then Americans may become even more open to the idea of a gay president.

Still, it's pretty clear from the numbers that there is still a portion of the electorate for whom Buttigieg's sexuality is an issue."
EPA reaches $21 million deal with Ford and Ringwood on controversial Superfund project,https://www.northjersey.com,"['Scott Fallon', 'Published P.M.

Federal environmental officials reached a $21 million settlement late Monday with Ford Motor Co. and Ringwood on a controversial cleanup of the borough's sprawling Superfund site that will leave tons of polluted soil in place under a barrier.

The agreement filed in U.S. District Court is another step toward affirming a plan that would keep 166,000 tons of contaminated soil at the O'Connor Disposal Area despite the objections of residents who live nearby, including many members of the Ramapough Lenape tribe.

""The fight is not over,"" Vincent Mann, chief of the Ramapough's Turtle Clan, said of the settlement. ""We are going to try everything we can to stop this, because that pollution is going to sit there forever and affect our people, the land, the plants and the animals.""

The pollution dates back a half-century to when contractors for Ford Motor Co. began taking toxic paint sludge from its Mahwah factory and dumping it in the forests and old iron mines of Upper Ringwood next to a low-income neighborhood. At the time, Ringwood officials gave permission to Ford, which is why the borough is also on the hook for the cleanup.

The EPA had originally planned to have Ford and the borough pay $32.6 million to remove the contamination at O'Connor, off Peters Mine Road. But at the last minute, Ringwood officials introduced plans to build a new recycling center — paid for by Ford — on an asphalt barrier atop O'Connor.

The move lowered the cleanup's cost by $27.2 million to $5.4 million, drawing both outrage from many who want the pollution removed and support from some residents who fear that a costly cleanup would significantly raise their property taxes.

The $21 million settlement would also pay to cap Cannon Mine and Peters Mine at the site where Ford contractors dumped waste. In addition, contaminated soil and other material will be removed from around the opening of the pit near Peters Mine.

Although high levels of lead, benzene and arsenic have long contaminated the 500-acre site, it wasn't until spring 2015 that scientists found a new chemical that made them pause in their plans to cap. It was 1,4-dioxane, a colorless solvent that health officials believe causes cancer.

Subsequent tests over the next 18 months found high amounts of 1,4-dioxane in the groundwater and brooks that run from the Ringwood Superfund site to the northern reaches of the Wanaque Reservoir. The chemical has not been detected in the reservoir.

The chemical's discovery prompted some residents to push for a question on the 2016 municipal ballot about the cleanup, in an attempt to overturn the borough's decision on the recycling center. But a state judge ruled against supporters of the measure.

In a news release issued late Monday, EPA officials said they expect to propose a long-term plan to address groundwater contamination, including 1,4-dioxane, later this year.

Under the terms of Monday's settlement, Ford and the borough will pay an estimated $17.6 million for site work and $3.6 million to reimburse the EPA for ""past costs at the site.""

“This important agreement ensures that the responsible parties will perform the work needed to address contamination at Ringwood Mines,” EPA Regional Administrator Pete Lopez said in a statement.

Lopez also said the EPA ""appreciates the dedication and passion of the community members and the members of the Community Advisory Group, whose active engagement on this site has greatly informed our work.”

Mann said the concerns of his people and many others in the community have fallen on deaf ears.

Longtime resident Vivian Milligan had dropped to her knees during a community meeting and pleaded with EPA officials to excavate O'Connor.

Mann said he has tried twice to request a meeting this year with the state Attorney General's Office because Gov. Phil Murphy has spoken passionately about supporting environmental justice initiatives.

No meeting has been scheduled, Mann said Monday.

""I don't expect there will be one after this,"" he said.

Idaho still in running for Western headquarters of Interior Department | Idaho Statesman,https://www.idahostatesman.com,"['Dan Elliott', 'Kyle Green', 'Joe Mcdonald', 'Ap Business Writer']",,,,https://www.idahostatesman.com/article230039514.html,"Boise is among the potential sites for a new Western headquarters of the Interior Department. A decision is expected by September. kgreen@idahostatesman.com

The U.S. Interior Department said Tuesday it plans to choose a Western city as the new headquarters for its vast public lands holdings by the end of September.

The department also said it may move the headquarters of its U.S. Geological Survey — best known for monitoring earthquakes and publishing detailed topographical maps — to the Denver area.

Both agencies currently have their headquarters in the Washington area.

The department wants to move the Bureau of Land Management to the West to be closer to the land it oversees. The bureau manages nearly 388,000 square miles (1 billion square kilometers), and 99% is in 12 Western states.

Officials said previously that Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, New Mexico and Utah are in the running for the new bureau headquarters.

The proposed moves are part of a far-reaching Interior Department reorganization launched by then-Secretary Ryan Zinke. The plan includes consolidating 49 regional boundaries of eight sub-agencies into 12 unified regions.

Zinke — who stepped down in January amid ethics allegations — and current Interior officials have said the reorganization will make the department more efficient and bring policy makers closer to the people most affected by their decisions.

Skeptics, including some Democrats in Congress, say the plan is a waste of money and suggested it was a way to get rid of employees by forcing them to move or quit. Department officials dispute those claims.

Scott Cameron, a deputy assistant secretary at the department, appeared before the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Oversight Investigations Tuesday to defend the plan. In testimony and a written statement, he said the department is still drawing up the details, including what the directors of the newly created regions would do.

Cameron said about 40 Bureau of Land Management positions would be moved West this year. He said the bureau would ask employees to move voluntarily rather than forcing them.

He said the department hopes to decide on the location for the new bureau headquarters by the end of the fiscal year, which is Sept. 30.

Cameron said the Geological Survey does not have money in this year’s budget to move many employees. He noted the agency already has a big presence in the Denver area, including the National Earthquake Information Center .

He said the Interior Department would ask Congress for another $27.6 million next year to continue the reorganization. Lawmakers approved $17.5 million for this year."
