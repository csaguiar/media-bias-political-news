Cuomo Signs a Bill to Allow Release of Trump’s State Tax Returns,https://www.nytimes.com,['Jesse Mckinley'],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/nyregion/trump-ny-taxes-cuomo.html,"As the battle over President Trump’s federal taxes intensifies in Washington, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York signed a bill on Monday to allow congressional committees to access the president’s state tax returns.

The bill requires state tax officials to release the president’s state returns for any “specified and legitimate legislative purpose” on the request of the chair of one of three congressional committees: the House Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Finance Committee and the Joint Committee on Taxation.

It is effective immediately, though it is unclear whether it would be challenged by the Trump administration, or used by the congressional committees; the Ways and Means Committee, for instance, has said previously that it remains focused on pursuing Mr. Trump’s federal tax information.

Still, the state tax documents from New York — the president’s home state and business headquarters — would likely contain much of the same information as the contested federal returns, tax experts say."
World Cup winners paint President Trump into a corner,https://www.cnn.com,['Analysis Stephen Collinson'],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/08/politics/world-cup-women-team-donald-trump/index.html,"(CNN) Megan Rapinoe and her team did what Donald Trump told them to do — they finished the job. Now the question is, how will the President honor World Cup winners who have carved out a remarkable political and societal legacy?

USA's win over the Netherlands in the World Cup final in France on Sunday did not just spark celebrations among their fans. It validated the team's status as icons whose willingness to go beyond soccer soundbites inspired youngsters, created critics who chafed at their politics and challenged perceptions of how athletes should behave.

A public feud between Rapinoe and Trump during the tournament pulled her team into the political storm that constantly rages around the President.

But the star forward's success in leading her team to glory made a statement that resonated far beyond partisan politics. The USA team is driving the evolution in women's soccer -- which lacks the support and attention in the game's traditional heartlands in Europe and South America that it has in the US but is beginning to catch on.

And in the United States, the national team is fighting a lawsuit to be paid the same as their male counterparts , becoming an emblem of the wider movement to end the gender wage gap.

The team's triumph also comes as other female athletes, like 15-year-old Coco Gauff at Wimbledon and the five-time world champion USA women's hockey team break their own sporting barriers and confirm the promise of Title IX non-discrimination for female athletes.

Megan Rapinoe of the US celebrates with teammates Alex Morgan and Samantha Mewis after scoring her team's first goal during the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup France Final yesterday at Stade de Lyon on July 7 in Lyon, France.

Its outspoken members also connect with an era of shifting societal attitudes that led to the #MeToo movement which exposed generations of sexual harassment in business, the media, the arts and Hollywood -- as Democratic women candidates are lining up for the chance to take on Trump in 2020.

On the face of it, the USA World Cup winners ought to be the kind of cause the President can quickly embrace, since they are the epitome of one interpretation of his motto, ""America First.""

But while other key political figures from all sides of the ideological spectrum quickly tweeted rapturous praise, it took Trump several hours to offer his congratulations.

""Congratulations to the U.S. Women's Soccer Team on winning the World Cup! Great and exciting play. America is proud of you all!"" Trump tweeted from his golf club in New Jersey.

The President made no mention of an invitation to the White House for the team — the root of his original showdown with Rapinoe — or of the possibility of other honors for the back-to-back World Cup winners. The US delegation to the final in France also lacked a bit of firepower, given that it was led by a comparatively junior official, Karen Dunn Kelley, the deputy Secretary of Commerce.

Trump told reporters Sunday that he would look at a visit by the team but hadn't really thought about it, but he again congratulated the US players.

Trump in a corner

The World Cup winners have long refused to let their results do all the talking.

""You can't win a championship without gays on your team. It's never been done before, ever,"" Rapinoe said, according to several media outlets including the Guardian in the UK last week.

Rapinoe's confidence to voice her political views put her at odds with Trump after Rapinoe said she wouldn't attend a White House celebration if the team won the World Cup.

It led to the extraordinary spectacle of a sitting President publicly remonstrating with the captain of the team wearing US colors at a tournament overseas -- an episode that helps to encapsulate the exposed political nerves of the Trump era and turned into a dividing line between conservatives and opponents on cable TV.

Trump responded to Rapinoe on June 26 in the traditional manner he reserves for his critics.

""Megan should never disrespect our Country, the White House, or our Flag, especially since so much has been done for her & the team,"" Trump said.

The spat might seem a personal matter, but the World Cup winners captured America's heart in a way that suggests his political antennae might have failed him.

""He has basically painted himself in a corner of being against Megan Rapinoe,"" USA TODAY columnist Christine Brennan said on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

""I think we will see more of this because these women are empowered as never before and they are speaking out against a President that they don't respect.""

Rose Lavelle of the US team celebrates after scoring her team's second goal during the match between the US and the Netherlands.

Rapinoe made no excuses for the willingness of her team to engage in issues beyond wins and losses at a news conference following the World Cup final.

""We say what we feel. All of us really, I know that my voice sometimes is louder, but in meal rooms, in conversations, everybody is in this together,"" Rapinoe said, with her medal around her neck. ""We are such a proud and strong and defiant group of women.""

Melania Trump and Barack Obama weigh in on win

Leading political figures, including first lady Melania Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, 2020 Democratic hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former President Barack Obama all beat Trump to Twitter to congratulate the team.

Obama quickly tweeted: ""Congrats to the record breakers on the @USWNT, an incredible team that's always pushing themselves—and the rest of us—to be even better. Love this team,"" Obama tweeted.

Trump's tweeted lecture on the nature of patriotism was similar to his comments about NFL players who took a knee during the national anthem to protest police-involved killings of black males, a societal issue that the President leveraged into a base play and turned into a huge political controversy.

The US team's defender, Becky Sauerbrunn, celebrates after the final whistle during the France 2019 Women's World Cup football final match between the US and the Netherlands yesterday.

""You just cannot shake that girl. She's going to do her thing, at her own damn speed, to her own damn rhythm, and she's going to apologize to exactly NO ONE for it,"" Bird wrote.

A White House welcome for championship winning teams has usually been one of the least controversial, unifying moments of a presidential term. However, during previous administrations some athletes refused invitations on political grounds.

But it has become a rising issue since Trump became President, as a growing list of invitees, especially minorities, decline to show up because they disagree with Trump politically.

Win boosts equal pay fight

The comportment of the USA team in France has not been to the taste of every fan. Their aggressive approach and goal scoring celebrations struck some opponents as disrespectful.

But the political legacy of the USA World Cup winners may eventually go beyond lifting their sport to new credibility and a fight with the President that will eventually be forgotten.

Before the World Cup started, the team lodged a gender discrimination class action lawsuit against the US Soccer Federation . They argued that they did the same job as their male counterparts and got lower wages and worked in worse conditions.

Megan Rapinoe scores her team's first goal from the penalty spot past Sari Van Veenendaal of the Netherlands.

They could not have made a more eloquent case for themselves and they've done more to sell international soccer in the US than the men's national team which has never won the World Cup.

Cries of ""Equal Pay, Equal Pay,"" rang around the stadium in Lyon, directed at FIFA officials, before the US team got their hands on the iconic golden World Cup trophy.

""I mean we put on as all players ... every player at this World Cup ... put on the most incredible show that you can ever ask for,"" Rapinoe said. ""We can't do anything more.""

Some female politicians have taken up the cause the players, including New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ,who tweeted Sunday: ""At this point we shouldn't even be asking for #EqualPay for the #USWMNT - we should demand they be paid at least twice as much.""

Defenders of the status quo say that men's soccer is far more popular and makes more money, suggesting higher salaries for male stars are justified. Trump referred to such arguments on Sunday.

""I would like to see that but you also have to look at numbers,"" he said. ""You have to see year round what is the attendance for women's soccer outside of the women's World Cup. But I would like to see it."""
Tom Steyer tells staffers he plans to announce 2020 presidential bid,https://www.cnn.com,"['Paul Leblanc', 'Dan Merica']",07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/08/politics/tom-steyer-2020-presidential-bid-staffers/index.html,"(CNN) Billionaire Tom Steyer has told staffers he plans to announce a 2020 presidential bid, a turnaround from January when he said he would not enter the race.

Steyer, who has teased political bids before without ever launching a campaign, never fully ruled out a 2020 run despite his January announcement, according to a source familiar with the situation.

The source said Steyer began planning an announcement in June and told staffers from the two organizations he funds, Need to Impeach and Next Gen, that he plans to launch a 2020 bid.

A spokesperson for Steyer did not respond to CNN's request for comment on the billionaire's plans, which were first reported by The Atlantic.

"“A nasty, brutal fight”: what a US-Iran war would look like",https://www.vox.com,['Jul'],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.vox.com/world/2019/7/8/18693297/us-iran-war-trump-nuclear-iraq,"A deadly opening attack. Nearly untraceable, ruthless proxies spreading chaos on multiple continents. Costly miscalculations. And thousands — perhaps hundreds of thousands — killed in a conflict that would dwarf the war in Iraq.

Welcome to the US-Iran war, which has the potential to be one of the worst conflicts in history.

Washington and Tehran remain locked in a months-long standoff with no end in sight. The US has imposed crushing sanctions on Iran’s economy over its support for terrorism and its growing missile program, among other things, after withdrawing from the 2015 nuclear deal last year; Iran has fought back by violating parts of the nuclear agreement and downing an American military drone.

To hear President Donald Trump tell it, that last incident brought the US within 10 minutes of launching warplanes and dropping bombs on Iran. Had Trump gone through with the planned strike, it’s possible both nations would now be engaged in a much more violent, much bloodier struggle.

Importantly, both country’s leaders say they don’t want a war. But the possibility of one breaking out anyway shouldn’t be discounted, especially since an Iranian insult directed at Trump last month led him to threaten the Islamic Republic’s “obliteration” for an attack on “anything American.” In other words, Tehran doesn’t have to kill any US troops, diplomats, or citizens to warrant a military response — it just has to try.

....Iran’s very ignorant and insulting statement, put out today, only shows that they do not understand reality. Any attack by Iran on anything American will be met with great and overwhelming force. In some areas, overwhelming will mean obliteration. No more John Kerry & Obama! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 25, 2019

Which means the standstill between the US and Iran teeters on a knife edge, and it won’t take much to knock it off. So to understand how bad it could get, I asked eight current and former White House, Pentagon, and intelligence officials, as well as Middle East experts, how a war between the US and Iran might play out.

The bottom line: It would be hell on earth.

“This would be a violent convulsion similar to chaos of the Arab Spring inflicted on the region for years,” said Ilan Goldenberg, the Defense Department’s Iran team chief from 2009 to 2012, with the potential for it to get “so much worse than Iraq.”

How the US-Iran war starts

US-imposed sanctions have tanked Iran’s economy, and Tehran desperately wants them lifted. But with few options to compel the Trump administration to change course, Iranian leaders may choose a more violent tactic to make their point.

Iranian forces could bomb an American oil tanker traveling through the Strait of Hormuz, a vital waterway for the global energy trade aggressively patrolled by Tehran’s forces, causing loss of life or a catastrophic oil spill. The country’s skillful hackers could launch a major cyberattack on regional allies like Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates.

Israel could kill an Iranian nuclear scientist, leading Iran to strike back and drawing the US into the spat, especially if Tehran responds forcefully. Or Iranian-linked proxies could target and murder American troops and diplomats in Iraq.

That last option is particularly likely, experts say. After all, Iran bombed US Marine barracks in Lebanon in 1983 and killed more than 600 US troops during the Iraq War. Taking this step may seem extreme, but “Iran could convince itself that it could do this,” Goldenberg, now at the Center for a New American Security think tank in Washington, told me.

At that point, it’d be nearly impossible for the Trump administration not to respond in kind. The recommendations given to the president would correspond to whatever action Iran took.

If Tehran destroyed an oil tanker, killing people and causing an oil spill, the US might destroy some of Iran’s ships. If Iran took out another US military drone, the US might take out some of Iran’s air defenses. And if Iranian-backed militants killed Americans in Iraq, then US troops stationed there could retaliate, killing militia fighters and targeting their bases of operation in return. The US could even bomb certain training grounds inside Iran.

It’s at this point that both sides would need to communicate their red lines to each other and how not to cross them. The problem is there are no direct channels between the two countries and they don’t particularly trust each other. So the situation could easily spiral out of control.

Messaging “is often more important than physical action,” Jasmine El-Gamal, formerly a Middle East adviser at the Pentagon, told me. “Action without corresponding messaging, public or private, could most certainly lead to escalation because the other side is free to interpret the action as they wish.”

Which means the initial tit-for-tat would serve as the precursor to much more bloodshed.

“What are we going to be wrong about?”

You may have heard the phrase “the fog of war.” It refers to how hard it is for opposing sides to know what’s going on in the heat of battle. It’s particularly difficult when they don’t talk to one another, as is the case with the US and Iran.

Which means that the way the US and Iran interpret each other’s next moves would mainly come down to guesswork.

Eric Brewer, who spent years in the intelligence community before joining Trump’s National Security Council to work on Iran, told me that’s when the Pentagon and other parts of the government rely heavily on their best-laid plans.

The problem, he noted, is that wars rarely play out as even the smartest officials think they will. A guiding question for him, then, is “what are we going to be wrong about?”

Here’s one scenario in which the US might get something wrong — and open up the door to chaos: After America launches its first set of retaliatory strikes, Iran decides to scatter its missiles to different parts of the country.

Now the Trump administration has to figure out why Iran did that. Some people in the administration might think it’s because Tehran plans to attack US embassies, troops, or allies in the region and is moving its missiles into position to do so. Others might believe that it was merely for defensive reasons, with Iran essentially trying to protect its missile arsenal from being taken out by future US strikes.

Messaging “is often more important than physical action” —Jasmine El-Gamal, former Middle East adviser at the Pentagon

Without a clear answer, which interpretation wins out comes down to which camp in the Trump administration is the most persuasive. And if the camp that believes Iran is about to launch missile strikes wins, they could convince the president to take preemptive action against Iran.

That could be a good thing if they were right; after all, they’d have made sure Iran couldn’t carry out those planned attacks. But what if they were wrong? What if the other camp guessed correctly that Iran was merely moving its missiles around because it was scared the US would strike once more? In that case, the US would have bombed Iran again, this time for essentially no reason — thus looking like the aggressor.

That could cause Iran to retaliate with a bigger attack, setting off a spiral that could end in full-scale war.

Iran could make a grave error too. Imagine Trump sends thousands of troops, say 25,000, along with advanced warplanes to the Middle East in the hope that they’ll deter Iran from escalating the conflict any further.

Tehran could just as easily read that buildup as preparation for a US invasion. If that’s the case, Iranian forces could choose to strike first in an effort to complicate the perceived incursion.

Of course, cooler heads could prevail in those moments. But experts say the political pressures on both Washington and Tehran not to be attacked first — and not to be embarrassed or look weak — might be too strong for the countries’ leaders to ignore.

“Unintended civilian casualties or other collateral damage is always possible, and it is not clear that this administration — or any administration — understands what Iran’s own red lines are,” El-Gamal, now at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, told me. “As such, the greatest risk of a full-blown war comes from one side miscalculating the other’s tolerance” for conflict.

If that proves true, and the US and Iran officially escalate their fighting to more than a few one-off attacks, it’s war.

What the US-Iran war might look like

At this point, it’s hard to be very precise about a hypothetical full-blown conflict. We know it would feature a series of moves and countermoves, we know it’d be very messy and confusing, and we know it’d be extremely deadly.

But unlike with the path to war, it’s less useful to offer a play-by-play of what could happen. So with that in mind, it’s better to look at what the US and Iranian war plans would likely be — to better understand the devastation each could exact.

How the US might try to win the war

The US strategy would almost certainly involve using overwhelming air and naval power to beat Iran into submission early on. “You don’t poke the beehive, you take the whole thing down,” Goldenberg said.

The US military would bomb Iranian ships, parked warplanes, missile sites, nuclear facilities, and training grounds, as well as launch cyberattacks on much of the country’s military infrastructure. The goal would be to degrade Iran’s conventional forces within the first few days and weeks, making it even harder for Tehran to resist American strength.

That plan definitely makes sense as an opening salvo, experts say, but it will come nowhere close to winning the war.

“It’s very unlikely that the Iranians would capitulate,” Michael Hanna, a Middle East expert at the Century Foundation in New York, told me. “It’s almost impossible to imagine that a massive air campaign will produce the desired result. It’s only going to produce escalation, not surrender.”

It won’t help that a sustained barrage of airstrikes will likely lead to hundreds of Iranians dead, among them innocent civilians. That, among other things, could galvanize Iranian society against the US and put it firmly behind the regime, even though it has in many ways treated the population horribly over decades in power.

There’s another risk: A 2002 war game showed that Iran could sink an American ship and kill US sailors, even though the US Navy is far more powerful. If the Islamic Republic’s forces succeeded in doing that, it could provide a searing image that could serve as a propaganda coup for the Iranians. Washington won’t garner the same amount of enthusiasm for destroying Iranian warships — that’s what’s supposed to happen.

Trump has already signaled he doesn’t want to send ground troops into Iran or even spend a long time fighting the country. That tracks with his own inclinations to keep the US out of foreign wars, particularly in the Middle East. But with hawkish aides at his side, like National Security Adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, there’s a chance they could convince him not to look weak and to go all-in and grasp victory.

But the options facing the president at that point will be extremely problematic, experts say.

The riskiest one — by far — would be to invade Iran. The logistics alone boggle the mind, and any attempt to try it would be seen from miles away. “There’s no surprise invasion of Iran,” Brewer, who is now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington, told me.

Iran has nearly three times the amount of people Iraq did in 2003, when the war began, and is about three and a half times as big. In fact, it’s the world’s 17th-largest country, with territory greater than France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, and Portugal combined.

The geography is also treacherous. It has small mountain ranges along some of its borders. Entering from the Afghanistan side in the east would mean traversing two deserts. Trying to get in from the west could also prove difficult even with Turkey — a NATO ally — as a bordering nation. After all, Ankara wouldn’t let the US use Turkey to invade Iraq, and its relations with Washington have only soured since.

“It’s almost impossible to imagine that a massive air campaign will produce the desired result. It’s only going to produce escalation, not surrender.” —Michael Hanna, a Middle East expert at the Century Foundation

The US could try to enter Iran the way Saddam Hussein did during the Iran-Iraq war, near a water pass bordering Iran’s southwest. But it’s swampy — the Tigris and Euphrates rivers meet there — and relatively easy to protect. Plus, an invading force would run up against the Zagros Mountains after passing through, just like Saddam’s forces did.

It’s for these reasons that the private intelligence firm Stratfor called Iran a “fortress” back in 2011. If Trump chose to launch an incursion, he’d likely need around 1.6 million troops to take control of the capital and country, a force so big it would overwhelm America’s ability to host them in regional bases. By contrast, America never had more than 180,000 service members in Iraq.

And there’s the human cost. A US-Iran war would likely lead to thousands or hundreds of thousands of dead. Trying to forcibly remove the country’s leadership, experts say, might drive that total into the millions.

That helps explain why nations in the region hope they won’t see a fight. Goldenberg, who traveled last month to meet with officials in the Gulf, said that none of them wanted a US-Iran war. European nations will also worry greatly about millions of refugees streaming into the continent, which would put immense pressure on governments already dealing with the fallout of the Syrian refugee crisis. Israel also would worry about Iranian proxies targeting it (more on that below).

Meanwhile, countries like Russia and China — both friendly to Iran — would try to curtail the fighting and exploit it at the same time, the Century Foundation’s Hanna told me. China depends heavily on its goods traveling through the Strait of Hormuz, so it would probably call for calm and for Tehran not to close down the waterway. Russia would likely demand restraint as well, but use the opportunity to solidify its ties with the Islamic Republic.

And since both countries have veto power on the UN Security Council, they could ruin any political legitimacy for the war that the US may aim to gain through that body.

The hope for the Trump administration would therefore be that the conflict ends soon after the opening salvos begin. If it doesn’t, and Iran resists, all that’d really be left are a slew of bad options to make a horrid situation much, much worse.

How Iran might try to win the war

Retired Marine Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart left his post as the No. 2 at US Cyber Command earlier this year, ending a decorated four-decade career. Toward the end of it, he spent his time at the forefront of the military intelligence and cybersecurity communities.

If anyone has the most up-to-date information on how Iran may fight the US, then, it’s Stewart.

“The Iranian strategy would be to avoid, where possible, direct conventional force-on-force operations,” he wrote for the Cipher Brief on July 2. “They would attempt to impose cost on a global scale, striking at US interests through cyber operations and targeted terrorism with the intent of expanding the conflict, while encouraging the international community to restrain America’s actions.”

In other words, Tehran can’t match Washington’s firepower. But it can spread chaos in the Middle East and around the world, hoping that a war-weary US public, an intervention-skeptical president, and an angered international community cause America to stand down.

That may seem like a huge task — and it is — but experts believe the Islamic Republic has the capability, knowhow, and will to pull off such an ambitious campaign. “The Iranians can escalate the situation in a lot of different ways and in a lot of different places,” Hanna told me. “They have the capacity to do a lot of damage.”

Take what it could do in the Middle East. Iran’s vast network of proxies and elite units — like the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps — could be activated to kill American troops, diplomats, and citizens throughout the region. US troops in Syria are poorly defended and have little support, making them easy targets, experts say. America also has thousands of civilians, troops, and contractors in Iraq, many of whom work in areas near where Iranian militias operate within the country.

US allies would also be prime targets. Hezbollah, an Iran-backed terrorist group in Lebanon, might attack Israel with rockets and start its own brutal fight. We’ve heard this story before: In 2006, they battled in a month-long war where the militant group fired more than 4,000 rockets into Israel, and Israeli forces fired around 7,000 bombs and missiles into Lebanon.

About 160 Israelis troops and civilians died, according to the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and about 1,100 Lebanese — most of them civilians — perished, per Human Rights Watch, a US-headquartered advocacy organization. It also reports about 4,400 Lebanese were injured, and around 1 million people were displaced.

But that’s not all. Iran could encourage terrorist organizations or other proxies to strike inside Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and other Gulf nations. Its support for Houthis rebels in Yemen would mostly certainly increase, offering them more weapons and funds to attack Saudi Arabia’s airports, military bases, and energy plants.

Experts note that the Islamic Republic surely has sleeper cells in Europe and Latin America, and they could resurface in dramatic and violent ways. In 1994, for example, Iranian-linked terrorists bombed the hub of the Jewish community in Argentina’s capital, Buenos Aires, killing 85 people and injuring roughly 300 more.

That remains the largest terrorist attack in Latin America’s history, and the possibility for an even bigger one exists. Last year, Argentina arrested two men suspected of having ties with Hezbollah.

But Chris Musselman, formerly the National Security Council’s counterterrorism director under Trump, told me the US and its allies may have the most trouble containing the proxy swarm in Western Africa.

“We could see a conflict that spread quickly to places the US may not be able to protect people, and it’s a fight that we are grossly unprepared for,” he told me, adding that there’s a strong Hezbollah presence in the region and American embassy security there isn’t great. Making matters worse, he continued, the US isn’t particularly good at collecting intelligence there, meaning some militants could operate relatively under the radar.

“This isn’t really a law enforcement function that US can take on a global scale,” he said. It would require that countries unwittingly hosting proxies to lead on defeating the Iranian-linked fighters, with US support when needed.

The chaos would also extend into the cyber realm. Iran is a major threat to the US in cyberspace. Starting in 2011, Iran attacked more than 40 American banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. The attack made it so the banks had trouble serving its customers and customers had trouble using the bank’s services.

In 2012, Iran released malware into the networks of Saudi Aramco, a major oil company, which erased documents, emails, and other files on around 75 percent of the company’s computers — replacing them with an image of a burning American flag.

In the middle of a war, one could imagine Tehran’s hackers wreaking even more havoc.

“I would expect them to have begun selected targeting through socially-engineered phishing activities focused on the oil and gas sector, the financial sector and the electric power grid in that order,” Stewart wrote. “There may be instances now where they already have some persistent access. If they do, I expect they would use it, or risk losing the access and employ that capability early in the escalation of the crisis.”

“We could see a conflict that spread quickly to places the US may not be able to protect people, and it’s a fight that we are grossly unprepared for” —Chris Musselman, formerly the National Security Council’s counterterrorism director under Trump

Recent reports indicate that Iranian cyberwarriors have stepped up their online operations, with a particular emphasis on preparing to attack US firms. Among other moves, they’re aiming to trick employees at major businesses to hand over passwords and other vital information, giving them greater access to a firm’s networks.

“When you combine this increase with past destructive attacks launched by Iranian-linked actors, we’re concerned enough about the potential for new destructive attacks to continue sounding the alarm,” Christopher Krebs, a top cybersecurity official at the Department of Homeland Security, told Foreign Policy on July 1.

All of this — proxies striking around the world, cyberattacks on enterprise — would happen while Iran continued to resist conventional American forces.

In the Strait of Hormuz, for instance, Iranian sailors could use speedboats to place bombs on oil tankers or place mines in the water to destroy US warships. The Islamic Republic’s submarines would also play a huge part in trying to sink an American vessel. And the nation’s anti-ship missiles and drones could prove constant and deadly nuisances.

Should US troops try to enter Iranian territory on land, Iranian ground forces would also push back on them fiercely using insurgent-like tactics while the US painfully marches toward Tehran.

Put together, Brewer notes succinctly, a US-Iran war would be “a nasty, brutal fight.”

Aftermath: “The worst-case scenarios here are quite serious”

Imagine, as we already have, that the earlier stages of strife escalate to a major war. That’s already bad enough. But assume for a moment not only that the fighting takes place, but that the US does the unlikely and near impossible: It invades and overthrows the Iranian regime (which National Security Adviser Bolton, at least, has openly called for in the past).

If that happens, it’s worth keeping two things in mind.

First, experts say upward of a million people — troops from both sides as well as Iranian men, women, and children, and American diplomats and contractors — likely will have died by that point. Cities will burn and smolder. Those who survived the conflict will mainly live in a state of economic devastation for years and some, perhaps, will pick up arms and form insurgent groups to fight the invading US force.

Second, power abhors a vacuum. With no entrenched regime in place, multiple authority figures from Iran’s clerical and military circles, among others, will jockey for control. Those sides could split into violent factions, initiating a civil war that would bring more carnage to the country. Millions more refugees might flock out of the country, overwhelming already taxed nations nearby, and ungoverned pockets will give terrorist groups new safe havens from which to operate.

Iran would be on the verge of being a failed state, if it wasn’t already by that point, and the US would be the main reason why. To turn the tide, America may feel compelled to help rebuild the country at the cost of billions of dollars, years of effort, and likely more dead. It could also choose to withdraw, leaving behind a gaping wound in the center of the Middle East.

In some ways, then, what comes after the war could be worse than the war itself. It should therefore not be lost on anyone: A US-Iran war would be a bloody hell during and after the fighting. It’s a good thing neither Trump nor Iran’s leadership currently wants a conflict. But if they change their minds, only carnage follows.

“The worst-case scenarios here are quite serious,” Hanna told me."

This is tantamount to a public declaration (repeated and amplified by smugglers in Central America) that our borders are effectively open to all; this will increase the recent levels of monthly apprehensions at our southern border -- about or more than 100,000 -- by multiples,"" Johnson wrote in a Washington Post column.

""For the same reason, we cannot formally decriminalize unauthorized entry into this country, though first-time illegal border crossers are, in fact, rarely prosecuted for that misdemeanor (except for last year's disastrous ""zero-tolerance"" policy).""

TLAIB TO PELOSI: 'FOCUS' ON MCCONNELL INSTEAD OF BASHING PROGRESSIVES

Johnson, who served under Obama from 2013 to 2017, wrote that Americans deserve ""straight talk"" on the issue of illegal immigration, touting the previous administration's handling of the problem. He said the Obama administration ramped up assistance to Central American countries and prioritized the deportation of felons.

Johnson defended House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., against far-left critics who claimed she was defeated by Republicans after the House passed a more moderate bill to deal with the influx of migrants at the southern border.

""Give her a break. Those who govern in a democracy know that progress requires compromise, and the speaker made the obvious calculation that it was more important to deliver prompt help to those facing inhumane conditions on the border than it was to delay and hold out for everything House Democrats wanted,"" he wrote, pointing to an overall ""alarming trend"" on both sides of the aisle.

""To win support from a vocal and committed segment of a major party's base -- and simply for the sake of a good applause line -- candidates for office now espouse extreme policy proposals that are unworkable and have no hope of winning the broad support of Congress and the people they represent,"" he argued, adding those who put forth policies that have no chance of becoming law are ""doing a disservice to our democracy.""

""Here is a radical proposal: a presidential candidate who is willing to educate, enlighten and tell voters the hard truths. This trait has all but evaporated in U.S. politics, but it is the single best job qualification for those who aspire to lead. I'm a Democrat, and whoever among the current Democratic field of candidates demonstrates this profile in courage will earn my vote,"" he concluded.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez fired back Saturday night after Pelosi criticized her and other far-left freshmen congresswomen for voting against a $4.6 billion border bill that President Trump signed into law on Monday.

“All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world,” Pelosi said. “But they didn’t have any following. They’re four people and that’s how many votes they got.”

Ocasio-Cortez criticized the Democrats who decided to vote along with Republicans on the spending plan to address issues at the U.S.-Mexico border.

“I don’t believe it was a good idea for Dems to blindly trust the Trump admin when so many kids have died in their custody. It’s a huge mistake,” she wrote. “This admin also refuses to hand over docs to Congress on the whereabouts of families. People’s lives are getting bargained & for what?”"
DOJ abruptly replaces lawyers defending Trump census citizenship question,https://www.aol.com,"['Aol Staff', 'Nick Visser']",07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.aol.com/article/news/2019/07/08/doj-abruptly-replaces-lawyers-defending-trump-census-citizenship-question/23765795/,"The Justice Department abruptly announced Sunday it will replace the legal team that has represented the Trump administration in its efforts to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census.

“As will be reflected in filings tomorrow in the census-related cases, the Department of Justice is shifting these matters to a new team of Civil Division lawyers going forward,” DOJ spokesperson Kerri Kupec said in a statement. “Since these cases began, the lawyers representing the United States in these cases have given countless hours to defending the Commerce Department and have consistently demonstrated the highest professionalism, integrity, and skill inside and outside the courtroom.”

The department gave no reason for the switch, but the move is another dramatic shift in President Donald Trump’s effort to add the question to the census. The Washington Post on Sunday noted that a person familiar with the case said some of the department’s career attorneys were uncomfortable with the president’s insistence on the issue. The New York Times reported that no DOJ attorneys in the federal programs branch, which traditionally represents the government in court, will be on the census case as it advances in the courts.

“The Attorney General appreciates that service, thanks them for their work on these important matters, and is confident that the new team will carry on in the same exemplary fashion as the cases progress,” Kupec said.

Last week, government lawyers told a federal judge the White House would continue to move forward with its efforts to add the fraught citizenship question to the census, despite legal obstacles. Days earlier the Trump administration said it would drop the question after a Supreme Court decision temporarily barred the government from adding it.

The Census Bureau began printing forms for the tally after the decision, and had long noted that it needed a decision by June 30, the agency’s printing deadline.

But the administration reversed course a day later. Trump called reports he was abandoning the question “FAKE!” and said he was pressing ahead. Justice Department lawyers told a federal judge on Friday that they would continue argue the case, and Trump said he was mulling various strategies to get the question approved, including an executive order.

So important for our Country that the very simple and basic “Are you a Citizen of the United States?” question be allowed to be asked in the 2020 Census. Department of Commerce and the Department of Justice are working very hard on this, even on the 4th of July! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 4, 2019

“We’ll see what happens,” Trump told reporters on Friday. “We could also add an addition on. So we could start the printing now and maybe do an addendum after we get a positive decision. So we’re working on a lot of things including an executive order.”

Civil rights groups have vowed to fight the White House once again should it attempt to add the question. The ACLU has argued it is meant to intimidate people of color and immigrant communities and would result in a massive undercount of up to 6.5 million people.

The census, mandated by the Constitution to count everyone living in the U.S., is used to allocate federal resources and also to allot seats in the House of Representatives.

'Extraordinarily challenging situation' in CBP stations: Acting DHS secretary,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/extraordinary-situation-cbp-stations-acting-dhs-secretary-kevin/story?id=64168359,"Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said he did not accept reports of unsanitary conditions and limited food and water at U.S. Border Patrol stations, calling the situation at the border ""extraordinarily challenging"" for the department, in an interview on ABC's ""This Week"" Sunday.

""We have no evidence that children went hungry,"" McAleenan told ""This Week"" Co-Anchor Martha Raddatz. ""Police station cells are not a good place for children, as I've said dozens of times.""

""We had an overflow situation with hundreds of children crossing every single day,"" he added.

McAleenan, who previously served as the head of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said the agency has taken protective measures including building temporary processing facilities and ramping up medical staff. He also said the agency even overspent on such measures, hoping Congress would later provide the supplemental funds.

President Donald Trump recently signed off on a new funding measure, primarily for migrant detention and child care. Trump has praised Border Patrol agents and said the poor conditions in facilities should deter people from trying to enter the U.S.

""If Illegal Immigrants are unhappy with the conditions in the quickly built or refitted detentions centers, just tell them not to come. All problems solved!"" Trump wrote on Twitter this week.

For months, McAleenan has raised alarms about the potential for disastrous conditions on the southern border while maintaining his agency has upheld government standards for housing detainees, despite evidence to the contrary. He said on Sunday that the food and water at one facility in Clint, Texas, that has faced scrutiny were ""adequate"" and that migrants in holding centers had access to showers and clean living quarters.

""I'm not denying that there are challenging situations at the border, I've been the one talking about it the most,"" McAleenan said.

He said Homeland Security has reduced the number of children in their custody from 2,500 at the beginning of June to 350 children as of Saturday. McAleenan said the new funding to shelters run by Health and Human Services allowed them to move minors through the system more quickly, connecting them with case workers who will find approved sponsors to care for them upon release.

His remarks on Sunday cap another tumultuous week for Homeland Security as the agency has grappled with government watchdog reports of overcrowded and dangerous conditions at Border Patrol stations in the southwest.

Acting DHS Sec. Kevin McAleenan responds to reports of unsanitary and overcrowded conditions at CBP holding facilities: ""It's an extraordinarily challenging situation... we've been talking about this, we've been asking for help."" https://t.co/v1IBAtvDAr pic.twitter.com/JnruuhIUbG — This Week (@ThisWeekABC) July 7, 2019

Conditions were so severe at facilities in the Rio Grande Valley that one CBP manager described it to federal investigators as a ""ticking time bomb"" in the report made public this past week.

Government oversight authorities found that hundreds of children had been held in CBP custody well beyond the legal limit of 72 hours and most of them did not have access to showers or a change of clothes."
The Department of Defense needs Mark Esper — and a few policy changes,https://thehill.com,[],07-07-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/451617-the-department-of-defense-needs-mark-esper-and-a-few-policy-changes,"Just over halfway through the Trump administration’s first term, the military is getting its third secretary of Defense in Mark Esper. Although the U.S. military is the finest fighting force in the world, even the best need consistent leadership. Fortunately, the Department of Defense (DOD) is receiving a great leader in Esper. He is superbly qualified, by experience and temperament — a family man, combat veteran infantry officer, West Point graduate, defense industry and policy expert, and an intellectual with high-level Pentagon civilian leadership experience.

Esper understands the importance of civilian leadership and how to bring sustainable change in policy, strategy and modernization for the military. However, he does face significant challenges to defend, deter and defeat, if necessary, enemies of the United States — and some of those challenges are at home.

The U.S. focus on counterterrorism not only shifted resources away from modernization of military force planning, structure and technology, it enabled other nation states to challenge, if not close, the competitive edge of the U.S. military. The overemphasis of strategy and resources on Afghanistan and Iraq, President Obama’s withdrawal from Iraq (precipitated by an unnecessary invasion of Iraq), and a botched Libya plan enabled America’s adversaries to recognize the changes in the world order. In addition, America’s adversaries took advantage of the divisive state of U.S. politics. Bottom line, America was being outflanked by its competitors.

Chinese alternatives to American values of democracy, rule of law, human rights and a free-market economy are creating a new economic cold war that will face off the United States and its partners and allies against those of China. Through strategic diplomacy, China has extended its influence into Africa and Latin America, while using the People’s Liberation Army as a capitalist tool to strengthen Chinese influence. China’s “One Belt, One Road” initiative presents even deeper regional influence across the Middle East and into Europe.

Vladimir Putin Vladimir Vladimirovich PutinTrump's coarseness, Democrats' shrillness do US foreign policy no favors Biden: There will be 'no NATO' if Trump is reelected Putin says he's ready to start talks with US on arms control MORE, meanwhile, aims to return Russia to its legacy where governments must consider Russian perspectives or actions in any region. Russian influence continues to gain in Eastern Europe, where Putin sees NATO as his biggest threat to regional influence. Putin has inserted Russian diplomacy and military power in the Middle East, through Syria and Iran, in order to have a seat at the table. And, surprisingly, Russia returned to the table with the Taliban to counter U.S. influence in this region as well. Most concerning is that Russia and China increasingly are allying themselves diplomatically.

The Middle East could be spiraling toward regional war. Iran, with Russian support, presents the single greatest threat to any region’s stability because of its revolutionary rhetoric, desire for nuclear weapons, hatred of Israel and the historic Shia-Sunni divide. The violence and destruction caused by ISIS, the United States’s haphazard withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement, an unprecedented number of refugees, and belligerent rhetoric and actions, particularly involving the Strait of Hormuz, have created a powder keg.

So, what should the new secretary of Defense do?

First, American society needs robust dialogue on what it expects its all-volunteer force (AVF) to do and how big the military should be to protect the United States. The AVF is more professional and experienced in its purpose, but it is not completely positive. A large AVF is costly to taxpayers. Its personnel costs possibly crowded out necessary long-term defense spending on weapons, infrastructure and technology advances. It struggles to compete in a highly competitive labor market, and has created a warrior caste among Americans.

The United States should not take the position that it’s in a state of perpetual conflict, which has been expressed by military and political leaders. This perspective results in overuse of the military as an instrument of government power and stresses the AVF to points of concern for American society.

Second, the U.S. must get out of Afghanistan now. We should have left after destroying most of al Qaeda following 9/11. No one can predict with any certainty of intelligence that another terrorist attack will emanate from Afghanistan; there are plenty of ungoverned spaces and financiers in the world that can make that happen. We should instead put more resources and effort into developing an alliance with India and reinforcing the Indo-Pacific strategy.

Third, modernization and acquisition changes to policy and process must occur faster, while taking acceptable risk in current readiness. DOD must hedge its bets and focus on threats to the survival of the U.S. Constitution and its values, and not every emerging character of conflict in the world. Right now, the U.S. military is doing too much at one time. The United States must invest in high-end technological capabilities such as cyber offense and defense, advanced aircraft, hypersonic weapons, directed energy and 5G telephony to counter future threats. DOD must shed its propensity to make incremental changes if it is going to transform for the future.

Fourth, the U.S. must reinforce European states and NATO to confront emerging threats. The biggest threat emanates mainly from Russian aggression, evidenced by its actions in Crimea and Ukraine, disinformation operations through digital media, and its increased foreign military activity in places such as the Black Sea. NATO, however, faces other threats such as uncontrolled migration, cyber threats and attacks, and Chinese strategic competition.

Fifth, the Indo-Pacific region must remain a strategic priority in order to maintain U.S. regional balance of power because of China’s assertive posture and overall global trade. American isolationist policies are hampering the development and maintenance of U.S. alliances and partnerships in response to China’s rise. U.S. presence and interaction with India, Japan, South Korea, Australia and other Southeast Asia countries will hedge against China’s economic and military rise and reconstruct the regional order.

As secretary of Defense, Esper clearly will face a difficult set of circumstances for the next few years. He is a great choice — the right leader for the job. His partnership, however, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard PompeoFive things to know about Iran's breaches of the nuclear deal The Hill's 12:30 Report: Trump sparks confusion over census citizenship question The Hill's Morning Report - Sanders falters as rivals rise MORE, his West Point classmate, must remain a priority. If Pompeo keeps the State Department engaged and in the lead, he will give Esper the best chance to transform and rightsize a more technologically proficient, high-intensity fighting force that is utilized more appropriately in protecting the United States.

The department cannot continue to have temporary leadership when it has the blood and treasure of American fathers and mothers deployed in combat zones. A Senate-confirmed secretary must be present to make the critical decisions presented to our armed forces daily. Congress should step up now and immediately confirm Esper.

Rep. Rashida Tlaib: Migrants 'treated like cattle' in detention centers,https://www.freep.com,"['Niraj Warikoo', 'Published A.M. Et July']",07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2019/07/08/rashida-tlaib-migrant-detention-border-patrol-camps-texas/1635978001/,"When U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) entered a detention center in Texas for migrants, she saw the anxiety on their faces.

""Their eyes were glassy,"" Tlaib told the Free Press about her visit last week to two Border Patrol centers in El Paso and nearby Clint. ""They were exhausted, tired, scared. They've been through a long journey and you can tell ... that they're afraid.""

Tlaib said she recalled meeting a grandmother in detention who said she was separated from her grandson for 40 days and in need of medication; a 30-year-old pregnant woman named Bettys who said she hasn't been able to see a doctor while detained for 27 days; and a father who broke down crying as he worried about the fate of his family with him.

""He said he's been there for four days,"" Tlaib said of the father in the El Paso Border Patrol Station. ""He hasn't showered, he hasn't eaten anything but potato chips. He was very worried, he kept putting his hand up to say like, 'I don't know what's going to happen.' ... He got very teary eyed as he was gripping his children, and his wife was next to him.""

Tlaib was one of 14 members of Congress led by leaders with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus who visited the Border Patrol centers near the border with Mexico last Monday. In a separate trip the following day, another Michigan Congresswoman, U.S. House Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Southfield) joined several Reps. in visiting a migrant detention center in Florida.

On Tuesday, the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General released a report warning of what it called ""dangerous overcrowding and prolonged detention of children and adults in"" migrant centers in Texas.

The Congressional visits drew controversy as some conservatives blasted the delegations.

When Tlaib spoke at a press conference with other Congressmen after visiting the centers, she was heckled by Trump supporters shouting at her with bigoted remarks about Tlaib's Muslim faith and Arab ethnicity.

On a video posted by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, you can hear a man yell at Tlaib: ""We don't want sharia law here. We don't care about sharia law. We care about Jesus Christ. ... Go take care of your country.""

Someone shouted that Tlaib should try eating pork, which observant Muslims don't eat, Tlaib said.

Tlaib replied to the hecklers: ""I will outlove your hate. I will always put my country first. ... I will never stop speaking truth to power.""

Tlaib told the Free Press she feels ""saddened and hurt that people could be so openly hateful"" but added that her focus for the trip was on helping the migrants in detention.

""We got to go into facilities that many Americans will never be able to go in, and we came out even more horrified, more eager to fix this issue,"" Tlaib said. ""The Trump Administration has taken on a very horrific approach to immigration and immigrants.""

""We have asylum laws,"" Tlaib said. ""We have human rights laws, and processes that we're supposed to be following. Immigrants in detention 'cannot be denied medical care,' "" she said.

Trump: Detention sites are 'run beautifully'

In response to criticism of how migrants are being treated in the border facilities, Trump told reporters Friday: ""I've seen some of those places and they are run beautifully. They're clean. They are good. They do a great job. ... Many of them, not all of them, they're incredible, they're really well run.""

Trump also tweeted last week: ""If Illegal Immigrants are unhappy with the conditions in the quickly built or refitted detentions centers, just tell them not to come. All problems solved!""

In a statement to the Free Press, a spokesperson for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which oversees the centers toured by Tlaib and others, said: ""This visit offered an open, frank and transparent discussion regarding our facilities and the challenges we face regarding the continuing humanitarian and border security crisis.""

""They asked questions and heard directly from El Paso Sector leadership on how U.S. Border Patrol is managing the more than 650 percent increase in apprehensions in the sector,"" said the Border Patrol spokesperson. ""Representatives visited two locations (El Paso Station and Clint Station), where migrants in custody receive three meals a day and have access to clean drinking water.""

""Local leadership highlighted investments in additional restroom and shower facilities, hygiene products, increased medical support and expanded transportation capabilities,"" Border Patrol said in its statement. ""Even with these investments, El Paso officials emphasized to members of Congress that USBP (U.S. Border Patrol) facilities were not designed for long-term holding.""

""Officials also explained the critical challenges to USBP operations when"" other federal agencies such as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement ""are unable to move those in custody as quickly as they are processed,"" said the statement from Border Patrol.

The visit came on the same day of the release of a report by Pro Publica that alleged that some Border Patrol agents made derogatory remarks against migrants in a private Facebook forum.

During the visit, there were some tensions between some of the members of Congress, such as U.S. House Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), and some agents. Rep. Ocasio-Cortez had claimed that one agent tried to take a selfie of himself with her in the photo, Tlaib said.

A Border Patrol spokesperson said ""CBP takes allegations of mistreatment of individuals in our facilities seriously, and reports all allegations to both the DHS (Department of Homeland Security) Office of the Inspector General and the CBP Office of Professional Responsibility. Any employee found to have violated our standards of conduct will be held accountable.""

Migrants treated 'not as human beings'

Tlaib said her visit to the El Paso station ""was overwhelming.""

She said they went into a ""very small cell-like room with women...about 14 on the floor and a couple of on these long benches on the side.""

Tlaib said she recalled seeing in that cell ""a little girl slumping over a sleeping body.""

Toiletries were limited and there was little privacy for the detainees, she said.

The Detroit Congresswoman said the migrants were ""being treated like cattle, not as human beings, as mothers and fathers that are just looking for a better life for their children.""

Tlaib said that when she reached out to comfort them, they would get emotional and shed tears.

""What took me aback was the dehumanization, because as soon as we touch them, they'll break down. As soon as I touched the grandmother, she just smiled and we just held each other's hand. The woman who's pregnant, I put my hand on her shoulder and kind of gripped it and said, 'We're here to help, we're here to learn.'""

Tlaib said she saw little kids, ranging in ages four to 13, with older kids in some cases having to care for the younger kids. In the Clint center, there was ""a glass door I tried to communicate to some of the children there,"" she said. ""They wouldn't let us talk to them directly.""

Rep. Lawrence, who visited a center on Tuesday in Florida, also expressed concerns about conditions.

“I am simply appalled at the photos that are coming out of these detention centers that are holding migrant children,"" Lawrence said. ""The images of overcrowding, unhygienic and unsafe conditions these kids are forced to endure are simply deplorable.""

Tlaib said she spoke with Bettys, who is pregnant with her first child, asking about family members in the U.S. After finding out she has a family member in Florida, Tlaib got her phone number and said she told Bettys: ""I can talk to her for you. I'm going to make sure you get a doctor. I'm going to try and help you.""

Speaking with Border Patrol agents

Tlaib said she also spoke with Border Patrol agents even though she was told not to by detention center officials because she wants to understand their challenges and sympathizes with their struggles at work.

She said one agent she spoke with said he was from the New York border area and was sent to Texas border area about a week ago.

Tlaib said she told the border agent from New York: ""Look, you grew up in the northern border so it must be so different here. He goes, 'Yes it is very much.' And I said, 'Have you been trained?' And he didn't say anything.""

""That's the worry,"" Tlaib said. ""You're going to send"" agents to the southern border, ""you're going to send money, all this stuff. But there's no processing standards.""

Tlaib said another agent told her: ""We don't have the manpower nor the resources to handle this. We weren't trained to be social workers. We weren't trained to be medical workers, the folks that do medical care. We were here to secure the border.""

The incident with the agent allegedly trying to take a photo with Ocasio-Cortez upset the delegation, Tlaib said.

""We were told we couldn't use our phones"" inside the centers, Tlaib said.

But the agent tried to take a photo in front of his superiors, she said.

""They were not afraid to do something so unprofessional, completely out of protocol ... by the end, their tensions were really high"" between the Congressmen and the agents, she said.

During the trip, Ocasio-Cortez also had accused Border Patrol agents of telling the migrants to drink from the toilet since there wasn't any running water from faucets, a claim Trump supporters said wasn't true. A Border Patrol official told Fox News: “We don’t treat people that way. We provide fresh water.""

'Not going to look away'

Tlaib said the trip has made her ""more determined to reverse the separation policy"" of removing children from their parents in certain cases and sending them to foster care centers. The Trump administration maintains it ended the separation policy last year in June, but reports say that 700 more have been separated since then because of loopholes, such as if the parents have a criminal background.

Tlaib was one of the four House Democrats who voted against a bill signed by Trump last week that was supported by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to spend $4.6 billion in additional funding at the border for the increased flow of asylum seekers.

Tlaib said that more money is not the solution because it can still lead to child separations and mistreatment of the detainees. Two other Democrats who joined Tlaib in voting against the bill, Ocasio-Cortez and U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), were part of the delegation visiting the two centers.

""The whole point of the trip was the importance of not looking away,"" Tlaib said. ""A lot of people wanted to throw money and then look away. No, we're not going to look away. We're not going to continue the abuse of children and the abuse of mothers and grandmothers. ... When you look away, you're normalizing it. We really, really wanted to push back against this because it's not normal. What we're doing to children is not normal.""

The agency blamed cost cuts, CNN reported Saturday.

“The decision to suspend data collection … was necessary given available fiscal . . . resources,” the agency said.

"As Europe orders recall, EPA into Mercedes emissions drags on",https://www.detroitnews.com,"['Anna M. Phillips', 'Los Angeles Times', 'Published P.M. Et July']",07-07-2019,2019,7,https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/foreign/2019/07/07/epa-investigation-mercedes-emissions-drags-on/39657613/,"Three years after the Environmental Protection Agency began investigating alleged diesel emission cheating in Mercedes-Benz cars, vehicle owners and environmentalists say the Trump administration appears to be allowing the inquiry to stall.

Daimler, the German parent company for Mercedes, is among several automakers that have come under scrutiny since 2015 after Volkswagen admitted to equipping some of its diesel-powered cars with illegal software designed to hide excess emissions.

In 2016, federal and state regulators launched an investigation into whether Mercedes had used a similar scheme, enabling cars to pass emissions tests that they would have otherwise failed. German regulators also launched an inquiry.

In the intervening years, German regulators have found evidence of cheating by Daimler and hit the company with fines and forced recalls.

However, in the United States there have been no repercussions as the investigation crosses the three-year mark.

“Three years seems unusual,” said John German, a former official at the EPA and a senior fellow at the International Council on Clean Transportation, the environmental advocacy group that commissioned the study that uncovered Volkswagen’s cheating.

From start to finish, the government’s investigation into VW took about a year and a half, German said.

In April, consumer advocacy and environmental groups sent a letter to Congress asking that the investigation be expedited.

“It is past time for greater urgency and action from regulators and Congress on the allegations against Mercedes,” the advocates wrote. “Owners and lessees of Mercedes diesel vehicles have been left without answers or recourse while the illegally polluting vehicles remain on U.S. roads.”

American regulators’ inquiry into Daimler began in 2016 when the Department of Justice asked the company to conduct an internal investigation into its diesel exhaust emissions. Since then, the automaker has stopped selling diesel-powered passenger cars in the U.S.

“To me, that suggests that they had a problem and they’re trying to limit their exposure to that problem,” German said.

EPA officials declined to comment on the investigation, citing its ongoing investigation.

The Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment.

A spokesman for Daimler said the company continues to cooperate with American regulators but would not discuss the investigation.

Though Daimler has denied wrongdoing, the company has recalled 3 million diesel-fueled vehicles in Europe. In June, German regulators ordered the company to recall 60,000 more and said they were widening their inquiry.

The German luxury brand is currently being sued in the U.S. by people who purchased Mercedes diesel cars. In a class-action lawsuit, lawyers representing Mercedes diesel owners said the cars were marketed as “the world’s cleanest and most advanced diesel.” But engineers hired by the plaintiffs found that they “emit far more pollution on the road than in the emission certification testing environment.”

House panel chair asks watchdog for probe of Homeland Security leaders,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",07-06-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-congress/house-panel-chair-asks-watchdog-for-probe-of-homeland-security-leaders-idUSKCN1U102B,"FILE PHOTO - Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-MS) listens to testimony from Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen during a House Homeland Security Committee hearing on “The Way Forward on Border Security” on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., March 6, 2019. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chairman of a U.S. House panel asked an internal watchdog on Friday to investigate whether top officials at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the U.S. border service knew about a Facebook group where agents posted racist and misogynistic comments.

“Such vile and threatening behavior from agents of the United States government is entirely unacceptable” and “should be grounds for immediate dismissal,” Representative Bennie Thompson, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said in a letter to the DHS’s acting inspector general.

Noting that the issue was already being probed by the office of professional responsibility of the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) service, Thompson asked the inspector general to open a probe into what DHS and CBP leadership knew about the groups and what action they had taken to address it.

Thompson said it had been reported that recently named CBP Commissioner Mark Morgan “knew about the group as early as 2016, when he was chief of the Border Patrol.”

“If accurate, this report calls into question Mr. Morgan’s fitness to hold any office in the United States government,” Thompson said.

He also asked the acting inspector general to investigate whether Acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan knew about the Facebook groups. McAleenan has ordered a probe into the social media posts. He called them “disturbing & inexcusable” in a tweet on Wednesday.

The U.S. border service came under fire over the issue on Monday, when the non-profit news site ProPublica reported that offensive content had been posted on a private Facebook group for current and former CPB officers.

Posts included jokes about the deaths of migrants and sexually explicit comments referring to U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the news outlet said. Reuters did not independently confirm the report.

The report emerged as Ocasio-Cortez and other lawmakers visited a border patrol station in Texas and criticized conditions at the site. Ocasio-Cortez said migrants held at the station had been told to drink water out of toilets and were subjected to psychological abuse."
"Mark Esper begins third week on the job, with time running out on his tenure as acting defense secretary",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/mark-esper-begins-third-week-on-the-job-with-time-running-out-on-his-tenure-as-acting-defense-secretary,"ESPER’S UNCERTAIN JULY: Acting Defense Secretary Mark Esper begins his third week on the job with a giant question mark hanging over his head. The Pentagon has not said how it plans to handle the conditions of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 , which requires that once nominated, Esper must step aside until confirmed and also that the position cannot be filled by an acting secretary past the end of the month.

While President Trump has announced his intent to nominate Esper as his replacement for Jim Mattis, who resigned in December, the Senate Armed Services Committee has not yet received his nomination paperwork. Once that happens, the provisions of the vacancies law kick in, along with the rules of the Senate, which require a seven-day wait once the nomination is submitted.

THE PROBLEM: Under the 1998 law, a person working as “an acting officer” may serve in the office “no longer than 210 days beginning on the date the vacancy occurs” or from the date that the person’s “nomination is pending in the Senate.” The clock began running on January 1, the date Mattis left office. Once Esper’s nomination is submitted, he must step aside and perform no duties that would presume his confirmation to the post. Patrick Shanahan did not have to do this for two reasons: He was never formally nominated, and under the law he could serve as acting because as deputy defense secretary he served in a “position of first assistant“ to the secretary.

THE FINESSE: Here’s how things could play out this month to get Esper in place while staying within the law: Esper’s nomination is submitted before the end of the month. He steps aside and the Navy secretary, who is next in line, fills in while the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman, Oklahoma Republican Jim Inhofe, engineers a quick hearing and vote. And by next month, the Pentagon has a confirmed leader for the first time this year. But that’s going to require some legislative gymnastics.

INHOFE’S OTHER BIG WORRY: There are only 20 legislative days left before the Senate is scheduled to take its August recess. And not only does Inhofe have to get the Esper nomination through, he’s among a group of lawmakers increasingly worried about the lack of progress reaching agreement on a bipartisan deal to raise the budget caps.

Inhofe is one of 15 signatories to a letter sent last week to acting Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, urging them to reach a deal that would avoid a stop-gap continuing resolution that would once again hamstring the Pentagon, just as it is recovering from years of spending limits.

“As the world continues to become more dangerous, the American people rightfully expect their representatives in Washington to put aside political differences and do their jobs. Simply put, our adversaries do not handcuff their militaries with funding gimmicks like continuing resolutions — nor should we,” the letter concludes.

FOUR-STAR SHOCKER: Vice Chief of Naval Operations Adm. William Moran will retire instead of taking over as the Navy’s top admiral Navy Secretary Richard Spencer announced last night, citing poor judgment regarding a professional relationship.

“Adm. Bill Moran recently brought to my attention that over the past two years he maintained a professional relationship with an individual who was held accountable and counseled for failing to meet the values and standards of the Naval profession,” Spencer said in a written statement reported by the Associated Press. “While I admire his faithful service and commitment to the Navy, this decision on his part to maintain that relationship has caused me to call his judgment into question. Therefore, today I accepted Adm. Moran’s request to retire.”

HAPPENING TODAY: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will deliver remarks to the media at 9:15 a.m. in the State Department briefing room. Streamed live at www.state.gov .

ALSO TODAY: The Pentagon will make full use of its River Entrance parade field today as it stages a full armed forces salute to honor the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani this afternoon. Acting Defense Secretary Esper will preside.

HAPPENING THIS WEEK: The summer of change that will see the turnover of five of the seven members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff begins this week when retiring Gen. Robert Neller steps down and hands over the reins to Gen. David Berger, who was just confirmed by the Senate Friday as 38th commandant of the Marine Corps. With the sudden resignation of Adm. William Moran, the current chief of naval operations, Adm. John Richardson is expected to remain in the top job past his planned September retirement.

Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein and National Guard Bureau Chief Gen. Joseph Lengyel both began their terms in 2016 and would normally serve until 2020.

ALSO THIS WEEK: Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley, President Trump’s choice to be his new chairman of the joint chiefs, gets his Senate confirmation hearing Thursday, and the House is set to consider the fiscal year 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, taking the week to work through more than 300 amendments as Republicans seek to restore $17 billion Democrats cut from the $750 billion topline, including funding for low-yield nukes and money for border barrier construction.

WHERE THINGS STAND: Daily on Defense was on vacation last week and will take another summer break the first week of August. So as we return from a long Fourth of July weekend, here’s a quick recap of where we stand in the world’s top hot spots.

KOREA: After President Trump’s historic impromptu third summit at the end of June with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un — where Trump became the first U.S. president to step foot on the north side of the DMZ — the work begins to show some tangible progress toward denuclearization.

Secretary of State Pompeo said after the meeting between Trump and Kim that teams from both countries would gather in another week or two in a place to be determined to “start exchanging ideas.”

“The president, by getting together with Chairman Kim,” Pompeo said, “broke through and was able to get us the opportunity to get back to the negotiating table, which I'm excited about.”

IRAN: While the potential for war with Iran was averted when Trump called off a strike on the country in the eleventh hour, tensions continue to simmer, with Iran declaring it will begin enriching uranium above the 3.67% limit agreed to in the 2015 nuclear deal. That level of enrichment is still below bomb grade.

In making the announcement, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said Iran was invoking a provision of the agreement that allows it to take “remedial steps” if any or all of the parties to the deal are not living up to the terms. Trump withdrew from the agreement last year.

“Today, Iran is taking its second round of remedial steps under Para 36 of the JCPOA. We reserve the right to continue to exercise legal remedies within JCPOA to protect our interests in the face of US #EconomicTerrorism,” Zarif said on Twitter . “All such steps are reversible only through E3 compliance.”

Speaking to reporters late yesterday in New Jersey, Trump issued a cryptic warning. “Iran better be careful because you enrich for one reason — and I won't tell you what the reason is, but it's no good. They better be careful,"" he said before boarding Air Force One.

“Iran’s latest expansion of its nuclear program will lead to further isolation and sanctions,” tweeted Pompeo yesterday. “Nations should restore the longstanding standard of no enrichment for Iran’s nuclear program.”

Britain, one of the countries still in the agreement, issued a statement through its foreign office saying that while Iran has broken the terms of the agreement, “the UK remains fully committed to the deal.” It called on Iran to “immediately stop and reverse all activities inconsistent with its obligations.”

AFGHANISTAN: While U.S. diplomats are touting “substantive progress” in peace talks with the Taliban, the group continues to carry out deadly attacks in Afghanistan targeting civilians, including children. For the second time in a week, a suicide bomber inflcited heavy casualties, this time on Ghazni province, where 12 people were killed and more than 170 wounded. Last week, an attack in Kabul killed 6 and wounded more than 100 others, including as many as 50 children.

While condemning both strikes, U.S. special representative Zalmay Khalilzad tweeted the horrific attacks show that “Peace has never been more urgent and is the only path to ending terror and violence.”

On Saturday he had tweeted , “The last 6 days of talks have been the most productive session to date. We made substantive progress on ALL 4 parts of a peace agreement: counter-terrorism assurances, troop withdrawal, participation in intra-Afghan dialogue & negotiations, and permanent & comprehensive ceasefire.”

The Taliban met yesterday for the first time with Afghan officials. The talks are set to resume today in Qatar.

TURKEY: President Trump continues to send mixed messages about Turkey’s refusal to give up its purchase of Russian S-400 air defense missiles, which the Pentagon insists is incompatible with operating and helping to build the U.S. F-35 and could compromise the Joint Strike Figher’s classified stealth technology.

“If Turkey procures the S-400, it will mean they will not receive the F-35. It's that simple,” said acting Defense Secretary Esper at NATO last month.

But at the G20 summit, President Trump lavished praise on Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and blamed President Obama for the problem. “The president was not allowed to buy the Patriot missiles,” said Trump at a joint appearance with Erdogan in Osaka, Japan. “So he buys the other missile, and then, all of a sudden, they say, ‘Well, you can now buy our missile.’ You can't do business that way. It's not good. It's not good.”

For the record, both the Obama and Trump administrations tried to sell Patriot missiles to Turkey, but the deals always fell apart over Turkey’s demands for technology transfers.

With Russia set to deliver the S-400 as soon as this week, the United States could impose sanctions against Turkey under a 2017 law that bars cooperation with U.S. adversaries. “We're looking at different solutions. It's a problem, there's no question about it. We're looking at different solutions,” Trump said in Japan.

Michael Morell was the deputy director of the CIA from 2010 to 2013 and twice its acting director. He is a contributing columnist for The Post.

From his very first day in office, President Trump has had a strange and, at times, strained relationship with the U.S. intelligence community. The president and his political aides have often challenged the honesty and integrity of the community, damaging morale, undercutting its mission and making the already difficult challenge of uncovering threats to our nation even harder.

But, by putting the CIA’s analytic judgment (that one of Russia’s objectives in interfering in the 2016 election was to help then-candidate Trump) into the crosshairs of the Justice Department, as reported by several news organizations , the president and Attorney General William P. Barr are crossing another line.

I see no problem with a Justice Department review of whether the CIA and other intelligence agencies lived up to their legal and regulatory responsibilities as to how they handled any information related to U.S. persons — U.S. citizens and U.S. nationals. There are strict rules in this regard — the most important promulgated by multiple attorneys general over time — and, in our divisive political environment, it would be beneficial to our democracy for the country to know whether the rules were followed or not.

Nor am I arguing that CIA analytic judgments should be beyond review, but that has already happened in this case. Both the Senate and the House intelligence committees have done reviews of the analysis, with the bipartisan Senate committee calling the overall analysis a “sound intelligence product.” The partisan House committee split on the question of the specific judgment about Russian President Vladi­mir Putin’s intent to help Trump.

What I am arguing is that the Justice Department has no standing to review the CIA’s analytic judgment. The whole idea is inappropriate and dangerous. It is certainly unprecedented, and there are good reasons it has never been done before.

I have great respect for John H. Durham , the U.S. attorney for the District of Connecticut tapped by Barr to do the review. But, while Durham is familiar with the CIA from previous investigations, he and his team have no experience with, or knowledge of, the process of intelligence analysis itself. He and his team could well impose a hard-to-meet law enforcement standard on the analysts’ conclusions. That would create a burden of proof that might be right in a court of law but would be risky and unwise in the assessment of intelligence for real-time decision-making.

A similarly dangerous consequence of a Justice Department review of analysis is the chilling effect it may have on analysts and analysis. Out of prudence, any analyst asked to submit to an interview with Durham’s investigators will want to have a personal lawyer nearby — likely a first for many, if not all, of the analysts. This will all be watched closely inside the intelligence community: The prospect that Justice Department prosecutors could ask questions about how an analyst came to a specific conclusion — along with the thought that there may be legal consequences for having done so — could lead analysts to withhold their judgments or even decide that this profession is not for them. We lose as a nation with either outcome.

If the shoe were on the other foot — if a senior intelligence community official were asked to review decisions made by the FBI and career prosecutors — how do we think the attorney general, or career prosecutors, would react? With loud protests, no doubt.

There seems to be an erroneous belief among some that if the analysts had not come to the conclusion that Putin was trying to help Trump, there would not have been an FBI counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign. This belief is misplaced; there was likely never a link between a judgment by the intelligence community analysts and a decision by the FBI on whether to open a counterintelligence case. The two were most likely completely separate. And, further, it seems that the analytic judgment about Russian intent came after the opening of the counterintelligence investigation. If so, it could not have been a predicate for the investigation.

A Justice-led review of the quality of intelligence analysis represents yet another weakening of the intelligence community as an institution. The country could be paying for these kinds of decisions for years to come."
"After nearly two years, State Dept. responds to inquiry over alleged alcohol poisonings of US tourists",https://www.cnn.com,"['Michelle Kosinski', 'Zachary Cohen']",07-03-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/03/politics/state-department-tainted-alcohol-mexico/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Nearly two years after receiving an inquiry from Senate Homeland Security Committee chairman Ron Johnson, the State Department is finally revealing details about its investigation into multiple deaths and illnesses that occurred shortly after Americans drank alcohol at Mexican resorts , CNN has learned.

The response, obtained by CNN, said that two bars were ultimately shut down by Mexican authorities after the State Department pressured them to inspect a number of establishments.

It was sent to Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, last month by the State Department's Office of Inspector General. Johnson first wrote to enquire about the cases involving allegations of tainted alcohol in October 2017.

The timing of the OIG's response coincides with a more recent string of mysterious tourist deaths in the Dominican Republic

In several of those cases, families have alleged that the victims became ill just after consuming alcohol, leading the FBI to look into whether tainted alcohol might be a factor there as well.

While there is no indication of a link between the incidents that occurred in Mexico and the more recent cases in the Dominican Republic, the response to Johnson's 2017 letter highlights several concerns related to the US government's handling of inquires involving American tourists abroad.

Johnson sent his letter to the State Department just months after the death of a 20-year-old woman from Wisconsin named Abbey Conner in January 2017.

She and her brother Austin lost consciousness soon after consuming alcohol at the pool bar in the Iberostar Paraiso del Mar on the first day of their family's vacation. Abbey was found face-down in the shallow end of the pool, nearly drowned, and died days later after being airlifted to a hospital in Florida.

""According to Ms. Connor's family, and other victims who have since come forward, the consumption of allegedly tainted alcohol at Mexican resorts has led to violence, physical abuse and even death,"" Johnson's letter to the State Department states. ""I respectfully ask the Office of the Inspector General to examine how the Department monitors, records and reports overseas incidents involving physical abuse or death after the consumption of potentially tainted alcohol.""

'Formal report would not be appropriate'

Despite prompting a wide-ranging probe into the issue, which included reviewing every complaint made to the State Department about possible bootleg alcohol, interviewing the people involved and significant coordination with the Mexican government, the Inspector General ultimately concluded that a ""formal report would not be appropriate.""

The response explains, ""OIG faced several challenges in completing this review, including the fact that victims often did not report incidents of unregulated alcohol to the department, which significantly limited the number of cases on which OIG could base any generalizable findings,"" it states.

""In addition, OIG's review was complicated by the fact that the guidance for consular personnel who face these types of situations is general and sometimes advisory, mainly because of the complex and variable nature of the incidents themselves.""

However, the lengthy response does detail the inner workings of how this inquiry was handled as a result of pressure on the State Department, and details some of the actions that were taken as a result of the review.

Ultimately, the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs did provide OIG with a list of 15 complaints that it has received since 2017 related to the consumption of unregulated alcohol by Americans in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo, the most visited by tourists from the US.

Two bars shut down

The State Department pressured the Mexican government to inspect 30 bars, restaurants and hotels. Two bars -- including one that served Abbey and Austin Conner -- have been shut down as a result. Raids were conducted by Mexican authorities that did end up finding ""a significant amount of alcohol of 'undetermined origin'"" and led to the identification of one supplier of questionably-sourced alcohol.

Ten thousand gallons of this alcohol was seized -- although according to the OIG, none tested positive for any dangerous substances.

And the State Department's work led to the Mexican government opening an office staffed with bilingual attorneys to help American tourists file police reports.

The response makes no mention, however, of multiple incidents reported in various media outlets that Mexican officials had, in other raids, seized hundreds of gallons of alcohol allegedly tainted with methanol, a toxic form of alcohol that is used in fuel, antifreeze, windshield wiper fluid and solvents. It can cause blindness and death.

Those findings are included in the Conner family's wrongful death lawsuit against Iberostar, filed last year.

The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, which has reported extensively on the Mexican cases, reports that it has heard from more than 200 people who believe they encountered tainted alcohol in Mexico, and the paper cites a 2017 Mexican government-spearheaded study that found that as much as 36% of all alcohol consumed throughout Mexico is produced illegally and unregulated.

The OIG's response did detail some of the difficulties American families of victims faced in getting help from the State Department while in Mexico, which some families described as ""insensitive,"" ""bureaucratic,"" or virtually nonexistent. At times families were told by State officials that they could not help them navigate the Mexican law enforcement or healthcare process.

The family of one woman who died was told the State Department couldn't help them at all submitting a police report when the Mexican government refused to let them file one.

In one case, a man had to wait until the next day for assistance filing a police report, despite reporting he was drugged and sexually assaulted after drinking tainted alcohol.

Yet despite recording the summaries of various reported cases, OIG did not express an opinion as to whether extensive handling of alleged cases of tainted alcohol in Mexico falls under the State Department's area of responsibility.

""OIG cannot draw definitive conclusions about any individual consular officer's compliance with Department policies in these cases,"" their response to Johnson's letter says, since State Department guidance on this issue remains vague.

An official with the inspector general's office told CNN their investigation is now closed.

""We were really limited by our jurisdiction, in what we could look at,"" the official said. ""We mostly had to focus on the actions of the State Department. And it did put a lot of pressure on the Mexican government to do thorough inspections.""

The official said the Mexican government was receptive to the US's urgings to do something about‎ the problem, but added, ""Mexico doesn't want to lose tourist dollars. It's a huge source of revenue.""

Gary Davidson, an attorney for the family of Abbey Conner, continues to seek answers and compensation for the family's loss. ""There is basically homemade liquor down there, circulating in the community of hotels -- and a lot of the hotels are buying it,"" he told CNN."

The Justice Department in Washington in May 2013. (J. David Ake/AP)

Contributing columnist

Pity the poor Justice Department lawyer who draws the short straw these days.

On Wednesday, only 24 hours after assuring a federal district judge that the government would not try to add to the 2020 Census the citizenship question the Supreme Court had blocked, the department suddenly reversed ground.

That left it to a sheepish and bewildered career Justice Department lawyer, Joshua Gardner, to tell Judge George M. Hazel of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland that he was backing away from firm representations he had made to the court on behalf of the federal government just a day earlier.

The sole provocation for this humiliating situation: a tweet from President Trump on Wednesday morning asserting “we are absolutely moving forward” on the citizenship question,” notwithstanding the Supreme Court’s decision.

You read that right: a tweet. Nothing more.

Gardner had no choice but to inform the court, “The tweet this morning was the first I had heard of the president’s position on this issue. . . . As you can imagine, I am doing my absolute best to figure out what’s going on.""

And, in short order, Gardner found himself backpedaling and doing his best to defend his own credibility, pleading to the court that, “I’ve been with the United States Department of Justice for 16 years through multiple administrations, and I’ve always endeavored to be as candid as possible with the court.""

Translation: I’m a career employee and not a Trump toady; I recognize that the department looks lawless and untrustworthy right now, but please try not to hold it too much against us going forward.

Career Justice Department lawyers are used to working in anonymity and with the winds of their credibility and that of the department as a whole at their backs. This is very far from the way Gardner would like to have seen his name in the national news.

Likewise for Sarah Fabian, the career lawyer forced to the front lines to draw the fire of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit — and public humiliation — for defending the proposition that denying immigrants soap and toothbrushes complies with the statutory mandate of “sanitary” detention facilities.

The fault here — beyond the obvious erratic lurching of the president and his l’etat-c’est-moi disregard of the rule of law — rests with Justice Department leadership.

Administrations change positions. That is understood and legitimate. But they do it with care, circumspection and due regard for the need to respect the law as objective and continuous, and for their duty of candor to the courts.

So the true eyebrow-raising feature of the department’s abrupt U-turn on the census is its absence of deliberation. The assistant attorney general for the civil division, Jody Hunt, who joined the conference before the court, conceded that the tweet was the sole impetus for the reversal.

That demonstrates an undue, if not ridiculous, solicitude for the whims of the mad king. The indication that Trump wanted to find a way around the ruling of the Supreme Court should have been (at most) a trigger for a reasoned process involving department leadership — in particular, the solicitor general, the client (in this case, the Commerce Department) and, perhaps, the White House counsel.

And voices within those discussions needed to be ready push back against political caprice, or measure it against the government’s longer-term responsibility to safeguard its credibility with the court and display fidelity to the rule of law. That is ultimately a service to the president, as well as to the department and the courts.

Yes, time is very short, but there is no indication of any such process having taken place here. Trump tweets; the department disposes.

The backwards somersault was all the more ill-considered given the severe credibility problems that the department and administration have created in this very case. The Supreme Court’s decision took the very unusual step of essentially rejecting as pretextual the proffered reason for including the citizenship question. Even before that, Hazel had taken the unusual step of reopening the case based on new evidence suggesting that the true reason for the question was to increase the political power of Republicans and non-Hispanic whites.

Finally, the solicitor general had made repeated representations to the Supreme Court that June 30 was a drop-dead date after which the census question could not be added. Now that the administration seems to believe otherwise, it leaves him with egg on his face.

The department seems relatively indifferent to the institutional cost of defending the imperial presidency, including the potential erosion in public confidence that the government is constrained by law. But this latest episode is a new indication that the federal courts at least are taking notice. The 9th Circuit on Wednesday handed the administration its latest setback, rejecting its request to stay a District Court ruling blocking the diversion of military funds to pay for Trump’s border wall.

If the department continues to jump at the president’s every hiccup — candor and consistency be damned — it may find that the courts are more likely to deny it the traditional benefit of the doubt and reject its litigating positions. That is more than an embarrassment for the front-line lawyers; it is a body blow to the department’s institutional interests and, potentially, the public’s confidence in a government of laws, not of men.

EPA works to gets the lead out at N.J. site | Editorial,https://www.nj.com,"['South Jersey', 'Egoldberg Southjerseymedia.Com', 'South Jersey Times Editorial Board']",07-07-2019,2019,7,https://www.nj.com/opinion/2019/07/epa-works-to-gets-the-lead-out-at-nj-site-editorial.html,"As President Donald Trump pursues downright scary policies at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, it’s a relief to see localized toxic site cleanups moving forward without disruption.

The same agency that whose policies suggest polluting, coal-belching electricity plants are the clean energy of the future, is on a roll, rolling out plans to root out neighborhood nasties on the Superfund list.

There has been notable recent site activity in EPA’s Region 2, which includes New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The latest example was last week’s announcement of an ambitious $72.2 million effort to clean up a West Deptford Township property that stockpiled old lead-acid vehicle battery casings and extracted the salable, but often hazardous, chemicals and heavy metals inside.

If you purchased a replacement car battery some time ago and the attractive price had an asterisk stating “with trade,” you surely didn’t think that your old casing would end up at a rudimentary, environmentally insecure place like Matteo & Sons on Crown Point Road, near U.S. Route 130.

Feds hatch $72M plan to clean up N.J. Superfund site tainted by cancer-causing chemicals The EPA has announced a plan to remediate the site of a former battery recycling facility in West Deptford.

Across a sprawling 82.5 acres, the state Department of Environmental Protection says, Matteo & Sons began an unlicensed landfill in 1961, with a “lead sweating” operation from 1968 through 1984. But, it wasn’t just lead that started popping up along with the buried battery carcasses. There are polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), suspected of causing cancer, and who knows what else leaching out of cars and trucks scraps. The location is not far from West Deptford High School and dozens of neighborhood homes.

While smaller enforcement actions have taken place since 2006, it wasn’t until 2016 that the entire Matteo & Sons site went on the national Superfund list. Given this program’s history of cleanups that literally took decades, it’s reasonable for a comprehensive remediation plan to be issued three years later. And, EPA doesn’t seem to be skimping. It will dig up 92,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil and crushed casings, take it offsite for disposal, and replace it with clean fill or fresh asphalt. The agency also proposes monitoring effectiveness of the finished cleanup every five years.

Refreshingly, there’s no monkeying around with half-baked proposals to “encapsulate” the soil, or attempts to render the pollutants inert on-site with some kind of unproved alchemy that makes guinea pigs of nearby children, students and residents. The population deserves nothing less than a full cleanup, especially with the severe impact that lead poisoning can have on youngsters’ brains and nervous systems.

The schedule calls for starting the cleanup later this year, if the plan gets a final OK after a public comment period ending Aug. 2. An informational meeting is set for 6:30 p.m. July 17 in the RiverWinds Community Center in West Deptford.

The Trump administration deserves praise for advancing the West Deptford site work. At the same time, with Superfund sites, hindsight is often 20-20. Could 1970s and 1980s township officials have prevented future environmental damage if they knew what was going on at Matteo’s?

The irony with respect to the president’s broader national policies is inescapable. Trump signs on to robust cleanup programs for past hazards, but assumes Earth-unfriendly actions today have no effect on tomorrow. Keep using coal, because people haven’t ceased breathing yet. Call global warming a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese, since Americans in large numbers are not falling down in the street from heat stroke. If such logic was flawed in 1979, it certainly is flawed now.

Open the scrapbook Dorene Sherman has and you'll get a glimpse into a storied career. Page after page is filled with all sorts of photos. Pictures of Hollywood stars, presidents and photos of Sherman with everyone from former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to the first Russian generals ever to visit the United States following the Cold War.""Time goes by so quickly,"" Sherman said as she flipped through the pages of her scrapbook. It's filled with photos dating back to the late 1960s. ""I was asking my granddaughter this morning to tell me if she remembers some of the things that happened during my career. She said, 'Grandma, I was 7 years old when you retired,'"" Sherman said jokingly. Sherman never expected she'd meet some of the most notable people of the 20th century.""Bob Hope. I met him,"" she said. ""I met Rock Hudson, too."" And she has the photos to prove it. You'll find her scrapbook filled with photos showing Sherman alongside people ranging from author Tom Clancy and actor Bob Newhart to four star generals and commander in chiefs at Strategic Air Command.""They were all very wonderful people,"" Sherman said. And she has stories about almost all of them.""President Carter, when we met him at his airplane, he shook his hand and put his arm around me, and in his Southern accent said, 'Oh, gee, you sure are pretty,'"" Sherman recalled. Sherman met every U.S. president from Richard Nixon to Bill Clinton. She still has a signed name tag from Nixon.""I have jelly beans from Air Force One. Ronald Reagan always had jelly beans,"" she said.Sherman started as a receptionist at Offutt Air Force base in 1960. It wasn't long after that she was promoted, eventually becoming secretary to the commander in chief of Strategic Air Command. It was a front row seat during the height of the Cold War.""I heard lots of things,"" she said. ""There was a lot going on back then and it was all happening right there at SAC."" Sherman would also become deputy director of protocol. In that role, she'd arrange itineraries and serve as an escort for all VIP guests. ""I'd take them around the base and wherever they needed or wanted to go,"" she said.In that role, she became close to World War II hero Jimmy Doolittle. Doolittle made monthly trips to Omaha, Sherman said, when he served on the board of directors at Mutual of Omaha. ""He was such a nice man,"" Sherman said. ""I really liked him."" Flipping through her scrapbook, you'll come across personal messages from President George H.W. Bush and see photos of Sherman with his wife Barbara.""She was a real nice lady. They both were,"" Sherman said.You'll also see messages written by Four Star General and former United States Secretary of State Colin Powell. There are photos with Condoleeza Rice, Dick Cheney and the chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.""I've been on Air Force One a few times. I also had the chance to fly to places all over the world because of my job,"" Sherman said.In the early 1980s, Sherman recalled a telephone conversation. She took the call not knowing show was on the other line.""He said, 'Is there anyway we could refuel our airplane at Offutt? Because we're going back to England,' and it was the plane of Queen Elizabeth,"" Sherman recalled.And she has the photos from when the plane landed and Queen Elizabeth made a stop in Nebraska. It's the only time she'd ever been in the state.""You look through the book and you're kind of, like, 'wow',"" Austin Yates, Sherman's grandson said.Yates was there for the visit of Queen Elizabeth. ""My grandma tells the story of how the queen walked up and said that I was a beautiful baby,"" Yates said.Yates is now a father himself and takes pride showing his sons the people his grandmother met. The scrapbook now serves as a storybook for Sherman's family.""Lots of memories,"" Sherman said. ""Memories, memories, memories. I got real lucky."" Despite the impressive job, Sherman said the thing she is most proud of is her family. She has two children, eight grand children and 19 great grandchildren. Sherman retired in 1999. She is active in the Omaha metro as a volunteer. She's been honored by the Bellevue Chamber of Commerce for her community involvement and is one of the people featured in the book ""Notable Encounters."" It's written by Christopher S. Adams, a retired major general with the Air Force. It documents memorable people he had the opportunity of meeting during his professional career."
It's time to break up the Department of Homeland Security,https://www.cnn.com,['David Perry'],07-04-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/04/opinions/department-of-homeland-security-needs-dismantling-perry/index.html,"David M. Perry is a journalist and historian. He's the senior academic adviser to the history department at the University of Minnesota. Follow him on Twitter . The views expressed here are those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) Every day, it seems, we get another story about the horrible conditions in the US Customs and Border Protection detention facilities or Border Patrol officers behaving badly . This current crisis at the border and in the various immigration agencies is not just a byproduct of Trump and his advisers' virulent nativism, but a manifestation of the flaws built into the Department of Homeland Security. The DHS was never going to work. It's time to break it up.

The department was thrown together during George W. Bush's administration, forged in fear in the aftermath of 9/11. Today, it's a hodgepodge of diverse agencies -- including the TSA, FEMA, ICE, and many more -- often with conflicting missions, all of which have been subordinated beneath Trump's anti-immigrant agenda

I remember remarking to a friend in 2002, when the Homeland Security Act created the new department with broad bipartisan support, that ""Homeland Security"" sounded like something out of a dystopian novel. A year after 9/11, American politicians were afraid of another attack, they were being misled toward war in Iraq, compromising civil liberties in exchange for projecting a feeling of security, and making lots of mistakes, usually with wide margins of support from their constituencies.

As we head toward the 2020 election, and as horrific conditions in prison-like facilities run by the immigration agencies of DHS are headline news , it's long past time to take a sober look at the post-9/11 moment and find ways to fix some of those mistakes.

This week, as the Congressional Democrats were touring a Texas border facility run by Customs and Border Protection, ProPublica broke a story that described a secret Facebook group of some 9,500 current and former Border Patrol agents. Here, members ""joked about the deaths of migrants, discussed throwing burritos at Latino members of Congress visiting a detention facility in Texas on Monday and posted a vulgar illustration depicting Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez engaged in oral sex with a detained migrant."" The US Customs and Border Protection Agency has called the posts ""completely inappropriate"" and promised to investigate its officers

Examining these abuses shines a light on the folly of slamming immigration enforcement agencies (such as ICE and CPB) into a single department with agencies in charge of emergency management (FEMA), transportation (TSA), and energy (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency), all bound together by a counterterrorism mission statement.

As security expert Bruce Schneier often says , in the aftermath of terrorism, politicians feel desperate, rationalizing: ""Something must be done. This is something. Therefore, we must do it."" That's the kind of thinking that created the Department of Homeland Security.

Immigration police from throughout the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement division of DHS, which includes ICE and CPB, seem to feel free to act with impunity , knowing they can resist oversight by citing the counterterrorism mission of DHS. Any budgetary limit on one agency opens up the other components to plundering, such as when DHS transferred nearly $10 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to ICE, the funds at least partially used for immigration detention and deportation, in the midst of the 2018 hurricane season.

I'm far from the first to call for breaking up DHS and returning its components to other departments where they belong, back to pre-existing agencies like Transportation, Justice, and Energy. In 2006, not long after FEMA failed New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina, Yale sociologist Charles Perrow offered some ""dreary conclusions"" in Homeland Security Affairs, writing that DHS is not particularly adept at fulfilling its core mission of streamlining intelligence sharing among federal agencies while diverting funds from supporting first responders in the wake of natural disasters.

In 2011, David Rittgers, a legal policy analyst for the libertarian Cato Institute, made his case that ""the Department of Homeland Security should be abolished and its components reorganized into more practical groupings."" In 2012, Tulane scholar Kevin Gotham linked the 2002 Homeland Security Bill to an accelerated process of privatization of disaster relief at least partially responsible for the failures during Hurricane Katrina.

Former DHS counterterrorism official Matt Mayer, later a scholar of homeland security, wrote in 2015 , ""after twelve years of mediocre-to-poor operations and countless scandals ... the core functions overseen by DHS can be managed more effectively elsewhere, especially where territorial battles undermine operational efficacy.""

None of these authors are radicals. They are just looking at the mission of DHS, assessing its successes, condemning its many failures, and concluding that the agency can't be fixed.

DHS was a bipartisan mistake. It's made it harder for FEMA to respond to national disasters. It's enabled a culture of impunity and aggression among our immigration officers. It has a history emerging from a specific historical context and time. I believe that as the decades pass, historians like me will look back in sadness at the years after 9/11, when national unity was squandered in persuading Americans to abandon their civil liberties, plunging the nation into endless war, and laying the groundwork for our new regime of concentration camps (as some genocide scholars characterize them ) on the American border.

ENGLEWOOD, Colorado – Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen said that he has yet to be briefed on the potentially volatile inquiry into possible surveillance abuses by federal authorities in the early days of the Russia investigation.

Rosen, in an interview with USA TODAY this week, said that he was unaware of the investigation’s status and did not know whether it has since morphed into a criminal inquiry.

“I don’t know the answer to that. I’d have to check and get back to you. I hear it described as an inquiry. I don’t want to say something that won’t be accurate. So let me defer on that one. “

The Justice Department later declined to elaborate. But Rosen’s deference on such a high-profile matter underscored the extreme close-hold on an inquiry launched by Attorney General William Barr and now managed by Connecticut U.S. Attorney John Durham.

It also highlights how Rosen, more than a month following his confirmation, has so far assumed a role largely out of the public eye in a stark departure from his predecessor, Rod Rosenstein, whose rocky two-year tenure was defined by his management of the Russia investigation and former Justice special counsel Robert Mueller.

John Durham: Attorney general taps top Connecticut federal prosecutor for review of Trump-Russia inquiry

""It (the surveillance inquiry) started before I arrived,"" Rosen said, adding that he was ""not currently"" being briefed on it. ""I had some generalized awareness, but I'm not meeting regularly with Mr. Durham.""

In April, Barr startled some lawmakers when he disclosed that he was reviewing the FBI's use of surveillance involving associates of President Donald Trump during the presidential campaign as authorities sought to understand Russia's interference efforts. At the time, Barr said he did not know whether officials had done anything wrong, though the review's disclosure was instantly cheered by some Republicans and Trump who has long disparaged Mueller's work as a ""witch hunt.""

""Spying on a campaign is a big deal,"" Barr told a Senate panel then. ""I think spying did occur. The question is whether it was adequately predicated.""

In May, the attorney general injected new urgency into that review when he tapped Durham, a long-time federal prosecutor, to review the ""genesis and the conduct"" of the FBI's investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.

Durham's appointment came just three days before Rosen's confirmation as second-in-command at Justice.

The inquiry is proceeding, as Justice's inspector general is conducting its own review of how federal authorities obtained a warrant in 2016 to monitor former Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page and his possible links to Russia. The results of that investigation are expected to be disclosed soon.

While not briefed on the Barr-Durham inquiry, Rosen nevertheless characterized it as ""serious.""

""I'm not sealed out,"" the deputy attorney general said, explaining that the attorney general had already taken on the coordinating role with Durham.

Rosen, 61, arrived at the Justice as a largely unknown player, having served in the top ranks of the Transportation Department – but never at the sprawling Justice Department.

His lack of Justice experience drew criticism from some Democrats who have expressed concern for the department's independence from the White House in the aftermath of the Mueller investigation.

""At this critical moment, we need a deputy attorney general who knows the Justice Department, who has experience in criminal investigations and prosecutions, and who is committed to the department’s role of enforcing the law independently,"" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said after voting against Rosen's confirmation.

Acknowledging his role as ""the new guy,"" Rosen said the learning curve has presented few problems so far.

""You know it’s always risky to assume that you know what you don’t know,"" the deputy attorney general said. ""So, I’m sure there are things I don’t know. But it’s gone extremely well from my vantage point. I think some of the concerns that were raised about that (lack of experience) didn’t account for the fact that the Justice Department, in some ways, is like a big law firm. I spent a lot of time at a big law firm; there (are) tremendous resources available. And so the things that I need to get up to speed on, I have like the foremost experts in the world available to me to brief me on them.""

In his first month, Rosen has sought a fuller understanding of the opioid crisis in America and has taken a lead role in Justice's implementation of bipartisan criminal justice legislation aimed at easing sentences for non-violent drug offenders, reducing the federal prison population and assisting offenders' transition back into their communities.

Rosen said Justice is on schedule to deliver a critical tool to assess the needs and risks of future recidivism for federal prisoners. The program, required under the First Step Act, a sweeping measure intended to reduce the nation's prison population, is due by July 19.

On the same date, the federal Bureau of Prisons is set to recalculate the amount of so-called ""good time"" earned by federal offenders, an action that is expected to result in the release of 2,200 offenders to their home communities.

Rosen, who was touring the federal prison in Englewood, Colo., earlier this week in advance of the actions slated for later this month, said Justice was ""pushing hard"" to abide by the requirements of the new legislation.

Since the First Step Act was signed into law in December, Rosen said 1,093 drug offenders have been released from federal prisons as part of a provision that reconciled overly harsh sentences issued to crack cocaine offenders. Another 171 low-risk elderly inmates and 46 chronically-ill offenders also have been released under terms of the legislation.

""I’m putting my personal attention on that,"" Rosen said of the legislation. ""The attorney general is, too.""

Rosen's personal attention to a separate prison-related matter, however, captured the most public notice of his tenure so far.

In a letter to Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance earlier this month, the deputy attorney general weighed in on the question of where former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort should be confined during his prosecution on state financial fraud charges.

Citing Manafort lawyers' concern for their client's ""health and safety"" if moved to a state prison, Rosen directly raised the issue with Vance, noting that that lawyers preferred that Manafort remain in federal custody where he is serving a 7.5-year sentence on a financial conviction. Such issues are generally not raised to the highest levels of the Justice Department.

Manafort: Reports: Manafort not headed to Rikers Island after DOJ intervened

Rosen dismissed the suggestion he was intervening on behalf of Manafort. He said he was merely attempting to resolve a question raised by federal prison officials.

""To me that seemed pretty benign,"" Rosen said. ""Maybe…I have to adapt to a new environment, as someone who came from another department. But it didn’t seem like an extreme measure to me to ask the New York district attorney, 'What do you think we should do with this?'""

Going forward, Rosen said he expects to apply a simple rule of management.

""It’s not my job to do their jobs,"" he said of the department's more than 110,000 employees. ""It’s to ensure that everyone is doing their job.""

"Lots of DoD Small Launchers, But What Will They Launch?",https://breakingdefense.com,"['Theresa Hitchens', 'Leonardo Drs', 'Arie Egozi', 'Breaking Defense']",,,,https://breakingdefense.com/2019/07/lots-of-dod-small-launchers-but-what-will-they-launch/,"WASHINGTON: Small satellite launcher projects are all the rage at DoD, but there aren’t many actual small satellites for them to launch. While there are numerous experimental satellites being designed and flown, there is no officially funded program aimed at designing, building and using smallsats for DoD missions.

“I think there’s been a long chicken and egg problem between small launch and small satellites” says Steve Nixon, president of the aptly-named SmallSat Alliance. “The traditional way is to attack them at the same time: do a little bit of both consecutively. We would like to see the national security side move out more aggressively, because there is lot of agreement about the value of small satellites.”

Indeed, part of the mission of the SmallSat Alliance, formed last year, is to help DoD figure out how it can “go beyond just experiments and begin to use small satellites for true operations.”

A DoD official admitted this week that right now it would be impossible to name a “program of record” for small satellites within the military services.

Part of the problem is that Air Force leadership has sent mixed signals on the level of interest in small satellites. The Air Force accounts for about 90 percent of DoD space spending.

Former Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson waxed decidedly noncommittal in a speech at the annual Space Symposium in April. Wilson said that an internal Pentagon study on future space architectures found that “exquisite satellites” (that is, large, expensive, and highly capable) are still a key DoD focus. (That study has not been released publicly.)

Air Force Space Command Vice Commander Lt. Gen. David Thompson, however, told a New America conference here in May that the Air Force will “definitely be using” large constellations of small satellites.

“The external and internal communication regarding [DoD] smallsat strategy is not consistent and not clear,” Carissa Christensen, CEO of Bryce Space and Technologies, said somewhat wryly in a Tuesday interview.

Experiments Everywhere

At the same time, practically every space-related body within DoD seems to be experimenting with small satellites based in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) — or in Pentagonese, “proliferated LEO.”

One of the flagship programs underway is the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency’s (DARPA) Blackjack program, designed to test small satellite constellations based on a Lego-like model of standardized bus designs with switchable payloads. While the Air Force has been planning to transition technology proven successful from Blackjack — called CASINO for Commercially Augmented Space Inter Networked Operations — to its own LEO-based constellation of smallsats, funding for that is uncertain.

The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) at Wright Patterson AFB long has developed smallsat-based experiments, such as the Demonstration and Science Experiments (DSX) spacecraft studying the affects of the Van Allen radiation belts on spacecraft components. The DSX was launched last week on SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy, along with 24 other small satellites under Air Force Space and Missile System Center’s (SMC) Space Test Program-2 mission.

The DoD Space Test Program (STP) has been around for decades, working to orbit Army, Navy and Air Force space experiments that are chosen by the DoD Space Experiments Review Board (SERB), chaired by the head of Air Force acquisition, Will Roper. SMC manages the STP program.

The Army, which has long been interested in the promise of small satellites for its tactical needs, has its own programs as well. The most recent effort is the Gunsmoke-L program started last year with a two-year (plus an option for a third), $8.3 million contract with Dynetics, based in Huntsville, Ala., to develop, test, integrate and demonstrate two “tactical space support vehicles.” The Army has built a series of the classified Gunsmoke satellites, dating back to at least 2017.

Further, my colleague Vivienne Machi last week broke the news that the Army is developing its first “tactical space layer” strategy that could include satellites in LEO for communications; position, navigation, and timing (PNT) and battle management command and control (BMC2) missions.

The Navy, in November 2018, launched its ICE-Cap (Integrated Communications Extension Capability) nansosatellite to demonstrate the ability of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites to expand the coverage of its Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) narrow-band communications satellite network to the polar regions.

But none of these test projects are slated to transition to formal programs, with formal budgets, and formal military missions.

Proliferating Launch Initiatives

Meanwhile, there is enormous industry buzz in the small launch vehicle market, including about the potential for DoD contracts.

Christensen said one of the reasons small launch vehicle vendors around the world are increasingly looking at governments as potential customers is that the commercial market is simply not going to be able to support all of them. Based on market history and future trends, she explained, not all the thousands of smallsats being proposed (or even already licensed) will actually be deployed; even some of the companies that manage to orbit some smallsats will fail; and once a company actually manages to become economically viable, the size of its satellites is likely to grow.

But rather than being concerned about the disconnect between DoD’s eagerness to on-ramp commercial launch capability and the lack of real DoD smallsat programs, Christensen believes DoD is doing the right thing by moving out to try to harness the capability for responsive launch. (Responsive launch, the ability to launch practically on demand, has been a Holy Grail for the Pentagon for more than a decade. See Operationally Responsive Space.)

“I really feel like this slight disconnect of market dynamics is creating a really good opportunity to take advantage of emergent systems and determine if they have applicability to future military of IC [Intelligence Community] needs, for much cheaper than starting from scratch and building internal DoD programs.”

There are at least three significant DoD programs seeking to validate smaller launchers for future military use.

STP is partnering with the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) on the Rapid Agile Launch Initiative (RALI). RALI is designed to leverage DIU’s expertise in open sourcing by rapidly awarding DoD launch service agreements with non-traditional, venture-class companies.

Last week, the truly non-traditional startup SpinLaunch announced it has become the latest winner of a DIU contract under that initiative. The contract (for an unspecified amount) is to prototype SpinLaunch’s ground-based, kinetic energy launch system that functions as a kind of centrifugal force catapult to heave a small rocket carrying a satellite out of the atmosphere.

A SpinLaunch fact sheet explains that the launch system uses “existing technology and components from oil/gas/mining and wind turbine industries to construct an innovative mass acceleration system, which achieves very high launch speeds without the need for enormous power generation or massive infrastructure. After ascending above the atmosphere, a relatively small, low-cost onboard rocket will be used to “provide the final required velocity for orbital insertion.”

The RALI program’s first launch was in May, when New Zealand startup Rocket Lab successfully lofted three small experimental satellites into LEO. It included the Army’s Harbinger, a commercial small satellite built by York Space Systems in Denver, to “demonstrate the ability of an experimental commercial system to meet DoD space capability requirements.”

DARPA’s Launch Challenge in April awarded $400,000 to each of three companies chosen to demonstrate “flexible and responsive” launch of small payloads. Tucson-based Vector Launch, Virgin Orbit, and a “stealth” startup now are competing for prizes up to $10 million for proving they can successfully launch twice in a row — from any launch facility chosen by DARPA — within a short timeframe. As a next step, the competitors early next year will be asked to launch a payload to LEO within two weeks from one of eight predetermined sites — after receiving notice of the launch site only a few weeks prior, and exact details on the payload and intended orbit just days before. One of the goals is to demonstrate that DoD can contract backup launches if one of its few fixed launch facilities is put out of commission by either an accident or an attack.

Todd Master, the program manager for the DARPA Launch Challenge, told me that DARPA is busy with preparatory work in the run up to the actual launch-off planned for early next year. This includes, he says, working with the Federal Aviation Authority to ensure that the commercial licensing process is smooth, given the “challenges” the project presents to the FAA’s normal launch licensing process. “They’ve been a great partner,” he said, adding that DARPA sees the Launch Challenge as “hopefully laying the ground work for streamlined licensing processes that could work in the future” to help DoD acquire commercial space launch capabilities.

And yet another new Air Force small launch effort, called the Rapid Space Launch Initiative (RSLI), was kicked off in late May by SMC’s Rocket Systems Launch Program based at Kirtland AFB in New Mexico. The RSLI request for proposals says that the Air Force is “investigating the possible procurement of a capability to rapidly launch and deploy space payloads critical to national security in an ultra-responsive manner. The objective is 24 hours from “call up” notification to on-orbit capability.”

That project seeks to demonstrate rapid space launch capabilities to LEO “on a small scale,” with “the intended payload” an “Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle Secondary Payload Adapter (ESPA) class space vehicle or smaller with a mass up to 220kg.” The RFI, however, notes that “demonstrated solutions that can scale to orbits and payloads of national security value are also of great interest. The program intends to hold an industry day in El Segundo, Calif., July 29-30."
Justice Department watchdog to investigate decision to cancel FBI headquarters plan,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"[""Jonathan O'Connell"", 'Reporter Covering Economic Development With A Focus On Commercial Real Estate', 'The Trump Organization']",07-03-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/justice-department-watchdog-to-investigate-decision-to-cancel-fbi-headquarters-plan/2019/07/03/76971d76-9d85-11e9-9ed4-c9089972ad5a_story.html,"The Justice Department’s inspector general will investigate the FBI’s role in dropping plans a decade in the making to move its headquarters to the Washington suburbs, he told Congress in a letter Tuesday.

The inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, told House committee leaders that he is initiating a review of actions at the DOJ and FBI that led to the canceling of the plans in favor of building a smaller replacement for the J. Edgar Hoover Building downtown and dispersing other FBI staff elsewhere.

The review could produce new revelations about the Trump administration’s stunning reversal of bipartisan plans for the development of a new, highly secure campus that would have gotten the bureau out of the fast-deteriorating Hoover building.

Democratic leaders of two committees, Elijah E. Cummings (Md.) and Gerald E. Connolly (Va.) of the Oversight Committee and Peter A. DeFazio (Ore.) and Dina Titus (Nev.) of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, have pressed Horowitz to investigate. They redoubled their efforts after the head of the General Services Administration was found by her agency’s inspector general to have made potentially misleading comments to Congress about the White House’s involvement in the decision-making.

Democrats allege that Trump used the decision to put his own financial interests ahead of the needs of the FBI and taxpayers, which administration officials deny. The GSA is the landlord to Trump’s D.C. hotel, located just down the street from the Hoover building, and redeveloping the Hoover site could introduce a new hotel competitor. Trump also told The Washington Post before running for office that he was considering bidding for the FBI project as well.

Under Trump, the FBI and GSA have both resisted responding to document requests made by Democrats on the Hill, though in a statement GSA officials said the agency “has produced more than 90,000 pages in response to respective Congressional Committee requests on FBI and the Old Post Office building since 2017.”

In a statement, the House committee leaders said: “For months, our Committees have investigated the Administration’s sudden change of heart on a federal property across the street from the President’s namesake hotel, but because the FBI has withheld key decision-making documents from Congress, we have been left with many unanswered questions.”

In April testimony to Congress, FBI Director Christopher A. Wray defended the decision to keep the headquarters in downtown Washington and reaffirmed it as his preference. “It is absolutely the FBI’s view, the FBI’s choice, the FBI’s preference to build a new building . . . at our current location,” he said.

For a decade before Trump’s election, the FBI had been working with the GSA and Congress on the suburban headquarters plan. Citing security concerns with staying downtown and the lack of large development sites nearby, the FBI and GSA pursued large plots of land near the Capital Beltway and suburban Metro stations, ultimately narrowing its search to sites in Greenbelt and Landover in Maryland and Springfield, Va.

But six months into the Trump administration, the FBI and GSA ditched those plans and then last year announced they preferred to keep a smaller downtown headquarters and move 2,300 headquarters staff members out of the Washington area altogether — to Alabama, Idaho and West Virginia.

GSA chief Emily Murphy testified that Wray — not Trump or a White House official — asked that the FBI remain downtown if possible, downplaying any White House role in the decision-making.

The FBI backed her assertion, but the inspector general found that Murphy’s testimony was incomplete and possibly misleading about the White House’s involvement, including an Oval Office meeting with Trump about the project that she omitted. Murphy denied misleading Congress, maintaining that the decision about where to put the FBI was made before that meeting.

The GSA maintains that the government could see cost savings under the new plan, but federal real estate experts have said the government’s expectations of cost savings weren’t likely to come true based on unrealistic expectations on the administration’s part about how little its plan will cost. The GSA inspector general found that the Trump administration plan could cost hundreds of millions of dollars more and accommodate 2,300 fewer employees.

Correction: This story has been updated to correctly characterize the GSA inspector general’s findings about Emily Murphy’s testimony. The IG found that her comments may have been misleading but did not conclude that she actively misled Congress."

Acting DHS chief launches probe into 'disturbing & inexcusable' Border Patrol social media posts,https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mcaleenan-launches-probe-into-disturbing-inexcusable-border-patrol-social-media-posts,"Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said Wednesday that he has launched an “immediate investigation” into what he called “disturbing & inexcusable” social media posts from Border Patrol agents that purportedly included graphic and vulgar jokes about Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.

“Reporting this week highlighted disturbing & inexcusable social media activity that allegedly includes active Border Patrol personnel,” McAleenan said in a statement on Twitter. “These statements are completely unacceptable, especially if made by those sworn to uphold the @DHSgov mission, our values & standards of conduct.”

OCASIO-CORTEZ ACCUSES BORDER OFFICERS OF 'VIOLENT CULTURE' AFTER REPORT ON GRAPHIC FACEBOOK POSTS

“I have directed an immediate investigation, and as the @USBPChief has made clear, any employee found to have compromised the public’s trust in our law enforcement mission will be held accountable. They do not represent the men and women of the Border Patrol or @DHSgov.”

The website ProPublica posted a story Monday headlined “Inside the Secret Border Patrol Facebook Group Where Agents Joke About Migrant Deaths and Post Sexist Memes.” In addition to showing indifference toward the deaths of migrants, members made vulgar jokes about Ocasio-Cortez and other members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus ahead of their visit a Border Patrol facility in Texas on Monday, the story said.

In one post reported by ProPublica, a group member referenced the visits by Democrats and encouraged an officer to throw a “burrito at these b-----s.” Other posts included a vile, fake photo illustration of Ocasio-Cortez engaged in oral sex with President Trump.

Ocasio-Cortez blasted what she described as a “violent culture” within Border Patrol.

“They’re threatening violence on members of Congress,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. “How do you think they’re treating caged children+families?”

Matthew Klein, the assistant commissioner of the CBP’s Office of Professional Responsibility, said the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general opened its own investigation on Monday.

""Today, U.S. Customs and Border Protection was made aware of disturbing social media activity hosted on a private Facebook group that may include a number of CBP employees,"" Klein said. ""CBP immediately informed DHS Office of the Inspector General and initiated an investigation.""

Justice Department inspector general to review Trump decision not to move FBI headquarters,https://www.baltimoresun.com,['Pamela Wood'],07-05-2019,2019,7,https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-fbi-headquarters-20190705-story.html,"The inspector general at the U.S. Department of Justice plans to review the Trump administration's decision not to build a new headquarters for the FBI in the Washington suburbs, a project that could have brought thousands of jobs to Maryland.

Michael E. Horowitz told members of Congress that his office would review the planning process for the proposed move of the FBI from the District of Columbia.

Prince George’s County was in the running for the new headquarters, a process that was in the works for nearly a decade before Republican President Donald Trump pulled the plug in 2017. The Trump administration wants to keep many FBI employees in Washington, while moving thousands of others to Alabama, Idaho and West Virginia.

In a letter to congressional leaders, Horowitz did not offer a timeline for his review or details on its scope.

Top Democrats in Congress, including Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings of Baltimore, requested the investigation. The Democrats have questioned the administration’s decision and the motives behind it. Some have alleged the president has a conflict of interest in the matter because his Trump International Hotel is across the street from the current FBI headquarters, the J. Edgar Hoover Building on Pennsylvania Avenue.

“For months, our committees have investigated the administration’s sudden change of heart on a federal property across the street from the president’s namesake hotel, but because the FBI has withheld key decision-making documents from Congress, we have been left with many unanswered questions,” Cummings and other House leaders wrote in a statement. “We welcome the IG’s independent examination, which will supplement our ongoing effort to get to the truth.”

Cummings chairs the House Committee on Oversight and Reform. He had joined U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio, chairman of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, in May in asking for the inspector general’s review.

The FBI headquarters decision has been one of many Trump actions that Cummings and his committee have investigated, as the West Baltimore congressman has established himself as one of the most powerful and vocal critics of the president.

“We need to get to the bottom of why the Trump administration suddenly reversed years of planning to relocate the FBI headquarters at significant additional cost to taxpayers and housing far fewer employees,” Cummings said in a statement to The Baltimore Sun.

“We must determine whether this decision meets the needs of the FBI and is being made in the best interest of the taxpayer,” he said.

The federal government had narrowed its options for a new FBI headquarters to three sites: Greenbelt and Landover, both in Prince George’s, and Springfield in northern Virginia. Under the plan, the government would have sold the Hoover Building to a developer to help pay for some of the costs of the new suburban campus.

Cummings and DeFazio have questioned whether Trump wanted to buy and redevelop the Hoover Building himself, which he would be prohibited from doing while he is president. They wrote in an earlier letter that perhaps the president’s personal interest led to the “abrupt decision to abandon the long-standing relocation plan.”

Last year, the inspector general for the General Services Administration found that the agency’s head, when testifying before Congress, undersold the president’s involvement in the decision not to move the FBI. The GSA, which oversees government buildings, also underestimated the cost of the alternate plan of rebuilding the Hoover Building while moving thousands of employees to existing buildings in other states, according to that inspector general’s report.

The White House declined to comment.

With 11,000 employees, the FBI would have become one of Maryland’s largest employers if it had moved to Prince George’s. It would have spurred hundreds of millions of dollars in additional tax revenue to the county and the state by boosting commercial development around the site and from taxes paid by FBI employees who would move to the area.

In hopes of helping lure the FBI headquarters, the University System of Maryland proposed creating a national security training academy for students and professionals.

Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, was among many politicians who pushed to bring the FBI to Maryland, offering promises of state-funded infrastructure improvements.

“Our administration went the extra mile and then some to bring FBI headquarters to Maryland — including making our case directly to the White House — and we still believe that we are the best site,” said Hogan spokesman Mike Ricci. “We look forward to the inspector general’s review.”

Prince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, a Democrat, said in a statement that she remains convinced her county is the best location for the FBI.

“We are pleased that the DOJ inspector general has agreed to review exactly what led to the cancellation of the FBI headquarters relocation efforts,” Alsobrooks said, adding she is “excited and optimistic that we will have the opportunity to house the nation’s top intelligence agency.”"

DOJ says citizenship question being dropped from 2020 Census: NY attorney general's office,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-says-citizenship-question-being-dropped-from-2020-census-ny-attorney-generals-office,"The New York attorney general’s office said Tuesday the Justice Department has decided to print the 2020 Census without the citizenship question sought by the Trump administration, ending a contentious legal dispute over an issue that could soon affect the makeup of Congress and the Electoral College.

The Supreme Court ruled last week that the question couldn't be added for now, but left open the possibility that additional arguments could change its mind. Civil rights groups argued that the Trump administration's reasons for including the question were merely pretextual efforts to discourage illegal immigrants from responding to the Census.

Population counts from the Census are used to apportion House seats among the 50 states, and a new electoral map based on the Census will be in effect for the 2024 presidential election. States receive votes in the Electoral College equal to the number of members in their congressional delegation, counting both House and Senate seats.

In a tweet on Monday, Daniel Jacobson, who worked in the White House Counsel’s Office under President Obama, said a trial attorney at the Justice Department told him that ""the printer has been instructed to begin the printing process"" without the citizenship question.

""We won,"" Jacobson wrote.

In a statement to Fox News, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross tied the decision to the Supreme Court's ruling.

“I respect the Supreme Court but strongly disagree with its ruling regarding my decision to reinstate a citizenship question on the 2020 Census,"" Ross said. ""The Census Bureau has started the process of printing the decennial questionnaires without the question. My focus, and that of the Bureau and the entire Department is to conduct a complete and accurate census.”

For his part, House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., issued a less-than-celebratory statement calling for answers, even as he praised the decision to scrap the citizenship question.

""I am encouraged that Administration officials dropped President Trump’s unconstitutional plan to postpone the Census just because he lost the Supreme Court case,"" Cummings said. ""The Trump Administration put our country through more than a year of wasted time and squandered resources—all in the service of an illegal attempt to add a discriminatory question based on a pretext.""

Cummings continued: ""The Attorney General and the Secretary of Commerce must now turn over all of the documents our Committee has subpoenaed on a bipartisan basis.""

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y, added, ""The exclusion of the citizenship question from the census is a victory for our democracy and for fair representation of all communities in this country.""

President Trump had tweeted that he had asked lawyers if the count can be delayed until the Supreme Court can reevaluate the matter, based on additional evidence supporting the administration's justifications for adding the citizenship question.

The Supreme Court, in its ruling last week, did not prohibit a citizenship question out of hand but dismissed the administration's provided rationale as insufficient.

However, Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, told Fox News on Tuesday that the Supreme Court was unlikely to change its mind. Clarke's team successfully challenged the Trump administration on the use of the citizenship question in federal court in California, and was one of several groups to bring such lawsuits.

“The Supreme Court’s ruling left little opportunity for the administration to cure the defects with its decision to add a citizenship question and, most importantly, they were simply out of time given the impending deadline for printing forms,"" Clarke said.

Experts agreed that any delay could gum up the U.S. Census Bureau's finely calibrated timetable for the 10-year count. Monday was the deadline to start printing the 600 million documents that will be mailed to 130 million households for next April's census count.

CAL THOMAS: CENSORING THE CENSUS IS ABOUT POLITICS, NOT THE LAW

For months, the Trump administration had argued that the courts needed to decide quickly whether the citizenship question could be added to the 2020 census because of the looming deadline.

""I think it's very important to find out if somebody is a citizen as opposed to an illegal,"" Trump told reporters Monday. ""There's a big difference to me between being a citizen of the United States and being an illegal.""

Former President Barack Obama's administration didn't ask the citizenship question in the 2010 census. The citizenship question was last asked on the census in 1950, but beginning in 1970, a citizenship question was asked in a long-form questionnaire sent to a relatively small number of households, alongside the main census. In 2010, there was no long-form questionnaire.

""There is no credible argument to be made that asking about citizenship subverts the Constitution and federal law,"" Chapman University law professor and constitutional law expert John Eastman told Fox News.

From a logistical standpoint, any delay ""would be a nightmare,"" said John Thompson, who served as Census Bureau director during Obama's second term.

The bureau already has been in the process of signing almost 250 office leases across the U.S. and has hired 1,500 specialists partnering with community organizations to encourage people to participate in the census. More than 170,000 recruits already have filled out applications for the almost half-million positions being created for the count. The bureau has helped set up more than 1,500 committees nationwide working to get everyone to respond.

Furthermore, Congress would have to change the law for the count to be delayed because Title 13 of the U.S. Code mandates that it take place on April 1, 2020, Thompson said.

""I don't think there's any ambiguity, but I'm not a lawyer,"" Thompson said.

Fewer people are expected to fill out the questionnaires using paper than in years past because the bureau for the first time is relying on most respondents to use the Internet to answer questions. Still, printed postcards and letters are to be sent out next March reminding residents it's time to answer the questionnaire, and those who don't respond digitally are expected to be mailed paper questionnaires.

As recently as last week, the Trump administration's solicitor general wrote in court papers that the Census Bureau needed to finalize the questions by June. Any changes to the paper questionnaire after June would impair the bureau's ability to conduct the count in a timely manner, wrote the solicitor general, Noel Francisco.

More than two dozen Democrats in the U.S. Senate last week sent a letter urging Ross to drop any further pursuit of the citizenship question because it would delay the bureau's ability to conduct the count.

""The 2020 Census is less than half a year away, and any unnecessary delay in operations would impact the ability of the Census Bureau to count every person in our country,"" the letter read.

This past May, Montana Republican Sen. Steve Daines introduced legislation that would require the census to include a citizenship question.

""This is America,"" Daines told Fox News at the time. ""We are a sovereign nation. It's absurd that we don't know how many citizens and non-citizens are living in this country. That's why I'm introducing this bill to require a citizenship question on the census - and ensure that states harboring millions of illegal immigrants are not rewarded with additional taxpayer dollars.""

New figures from Labor Department show trucking employment upswing in recent months,https://www.ccjdigital.com,['Commercial Carrier Journal'],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.ccjdigital.com/new-figures-from-labor-department-show-trucking-employment-upswing-in-recent-months/,"CCJ‘s Indicators rounds up the latest reports on trucking business indicators on rates, freight, equipment, the economy and more.

New data released by the Department of Labor on Friday presents a rosier picture of trucking employment through the first half of 2019 than originally indicated by earlier, preliminary data. Instead of a lackluster 400 jobs added since January — compared to the nearly 50,000 between December 2017 and December 2018 — the DOL’s upwardly revised numbers indicate the for-hire trucking industry added 7,300 jobs on a seasonally adjusted basis in 2019’s second quarter and 11,700 jobs since the beginning of the year.

According to the DOL’s monthly Employment Situation Report, the second-quarter upswing was capped by a 4,300-job uptick in June. The U.S. economy as a whole added 224,000 jobs in June, and the unemployment rate climbed a tenth of a percent to 3.7 percent.

Employment in the for-hire trucking industry totaled 1.519 million in June — a gain of 36,800 jobs from the same month last year.

The transportation and warehousing sector as a whole in June added 23,900 jobs, according to the DOL, while major freight producing sectors like manufacturing and construction added 17,000 jobs and 21,000 jobs, respectively."
Buttigieg asks U.S. Justice Department for help after South Bend police shooting incident,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Congress', 'Campaigns', 'Health Policy', 'Pennsylvania Politics', 'Matt Zapotosky', 'National Security Reporter Covering The Justice Department']",07-03-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/buttigieg-asks-us-justice-department-for-help-after-south-bend-police-shooting-incident/2019/07/03/7278e274-9cef-11e9-b27f-ed2942f73d70_story.html,"South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg formally asked the U.S. Department of Justice to help him respond to the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man by a white police officer in his city, but he stopped short of asking for a federal investigation.

In the weeks since South Bend Police Sgt. Ryan O’Neill shot and killed Eric J. Logan, Buttigieg has faced criticism from an angry community that wants answers. Black activists have called on Buttigieg to ask the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division to weigh in.

“The tragedy has touched off a painful discussion in our community about race, policing, and violence,” Buttigieg wrote in his letter. “Many South Bend residents, concerned about racial issues and their impact on our department, believe that the Department of Justice could be of assistance.”

A Justice Department spokeswoman did not immediately return a message seeking comment.

[Buttigieg unveils national service plan with new climate and health programs]

It is not uncommon for local officials to request Justice Department civil rights investigations after incidents that strain relations between police and residents — as independent, federal inquiries often allay concerns of those who feel the police department or local prosecutor are not equipped to handle the cases themselves.

Sometimes, local officials request an investigation of a particular incident; other times, they seek a broader review of the patterns and practices of their police department. Such was the case, for example, in 2015 in Baltimore after riots erupted in the wake of a black man’s death in police custody.

Buttigieg’s request notably stops short of asking for any investigation, instead asking the department to tell him what resources it might be able to provide. Even if the mayor had asked for a broad review of his police department, it is unlikely the Justice Department would have obliged. While the Civil Rights Division in the Obama administration was aggressive about pushing police restructuring, President Trump’s former attorney general, Jeff Sessions, was much less amenable to getting federal law enforcement involved in such cases. Attorney General William P. Barr has maintained Sessions’s view.

[‘We don’t trust you!’: After fatal police shooting, black residents confront Buttigieg]

Buttigieg acknowledged this Tuesday when reporters asked him about involving the Justice Department.

“The reality is the DOJ in this administration has shown considerably less interest in civil rights than it did in the last administration,” Buttigieg said. “Still, I want to open a discussion about different ways in which federal support could make a difference.”

Buttigieg has striven to show the South Bend black community and African American voters that he is listening to their concerns.

Speaking to an audience of black business leaders in Chicago on Tuesday, Buttigieg promised that if elected president he would prioritize tackling the nation’s persistent systematic racism. “We have pain now that reminds us that our community lives around a chasm,” Buttigieg said, referring to the police shooting. “Black residents and white residents experience every facet of life differently.”

Buttigieg told the crowd he accepted responsibility for not doing enough to diversify the police force and cultivate a community where black residents do not fear the police. But he said the problem is not just his town’s alone and that racial injustice does not just occur within law enforcement, but infiltrates every aspect of life from education to housing to health care.

“This is deeper than politics. This is not just a political problem. It is not just a police problem. It is not just my problem and my city’s problem. And it is certainly not just a black problem,” Buttigieg said. “This is an American problem, and it requires nationwide American solutions.”

He made his remarks at the Rainbow PUSH Coalition’s annual convention, an organization founded by civil rights leader the Rev. Jesse Jackson.

Buttigieg met privately with Jackson ahead of his address, and the two men spoke to reporters after their chat. Asked to access Buttigieg’s handling of the police shooting in South Bend, Jackson commended the mayor.

“He’s handled an awful situation well by being transparent,” Jackson said."

On Aug. 3, 2016, Strzok wrote, ""I think we need to consider the lines of what we disclose to DOJ. For example, the last stipulation notes we will not disclose [the] identifies outside the FBI. I think you might argue the unauthorized disclosure might (reasonably) be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to US national security...""

In an earlier discussion on Aug. 2, 2016, Strzok reported he had a “good meeting.” Page warned, ""Make sure you can lawfully protect what you sign. Just thinking about congress, foia (Freedom of Information Act), etc. I'm sure it's fine. I just don't know how protection of intel-type stuff works in that context.""

Fox News has learned some of the words and names that were redacted in the string of Strzok-Page messages; they are included below.

[NOTE: 'OUTBOX' messages are from Page, 'INBOX' messages from Strzok]

The New York Times was first to report lengthy details about the 2016 meeting in question, when the FBI ""dispatched a pair of agents to London on a mission so secretive that all but a handful of officials were kept in the dark."" The report said this assignment included questioning Australian Ambassador Alexander Downer. Downer's information about then-Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos helped lay the foundation for the FBI’s counterintelligence probe – which later grew into former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.

House Republicans, continuing to probe the texts, have considered August 2016 a pivotal month. They have been looking closely at these exchanges, and how long before the August meeting Downer reported the Papadopoulos information.

Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz, meanwhile, has been conducting a separate investigation into alleged surveillance abuse during the 2016 campaign, with that case in its final phases. And, this past May, Attorney General William Barr asked U.S. Attorney John Durham to probe the origins of the FBI counterintelligence case which was opened in late July 2016 by then-agent Strzok.

Fox News also has learned what's behind some of the redactions for the texts during that period, revealing new details of the Strzok meeting which took place at the U.S. embassy in London inside a secure facility known as SCIF.

In the texts, Strzok said the meeting did not include the No. 2 State Department official in London known as the deputy chief of mission.

""Was DCM (deputy chief of mission) present for the interview?"" Page asked.

""No, two of them, two of us."" Strzok responded.

Other texts indicated then-Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was trying to reach someone named “Jeremy” and make multiple references to “Ben,” though it’s not clear if they worked within or outside the FBI.

Strzok and Page then discussed how widely the information needed to be shared within the bureau, including Strzok’s immediate supervisor Bill Priestap.

Page wrote on Aug. 3, 2016, ""New case. Information flow. Control."" The section that followed was heavily redacted, but Strzok responded, “...plan on telling Bill I'm obviously going to tell him anything he wants to know, but recommend we not tell him or [higher] … specific data so that he and higher can tell DOJ, even we don't know the admin details.""

Horowitz also has been investigating leaks from senior FBI officials as part of his probes. The expectation is that report will come after the surveillance abuse investigation.

In an apparent reference to bureau leaks, Strzok wrote, ""this is MUCH more tasty for one of those (redacted) aholes to leak. For the first time in a while I'm not worried about our side.""

Lineage Logistics Awarded by U.S. Department of Energy for Outstanding Accomplishments in Energy Efficiency,https://finance.yahoo.com,[],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lineage-logistics-awarded-u-department-120000571.html,"NOVI, Mich.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

Lineage recognized for its U.S. patented “flywheeling” energy optimization technology

Lineage to present its winning project during a special “Best of the Betters” session at the U.S. Department of Energy’s 2019 Better Builds, Better Plants Summit on July 10 in Arlington, VA

Lineage Logistics, LLC, the world’s most innovative provider of temperature-controlled logistics solutions, today announced it was named a winner of the 2019 Better Practice Awards by the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Better Plants Program (Better Plants). The DOE Better Plants designation is bestowed to organizations that are making outstanding accomplishments in implementing and promoting the practices, principles and procedures of energy management.

The DOE recognized Lineage for pioneering a new and innovative way to improve energy productivity using a process the company calls “flywheeling,” which proactively manages energy consumption using a proprietary machine-learning technology to reduce both cost and waste.

Last month, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) issued a utility patent to Lineage and primary inventor Dr. Alex Woolf, Principal Data Scientist at Lineage, covering the flywheeling technology (US 10,323,878 B1).

“This great honor from the DOE is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our talented team, and it is quite humbling to be recognized as a leader in energy conservation. Flywheeling is one of the many ways Lineage lives our purpose of transforming the food supply chain to eliminate waste and help feed the world,” said Greg Lehmkuhl, President and Chief Executive Officer of Lineage.

The temperature-controlled supply chain is energy-intensive by nature, making energy conservation a key priority for Lineage. On average, each of the company’s more than 200 facilities across North America, Europe and Asia can store approximately 24,000 pallets of inventory, the equivalent of approximately 770,000 home freezers. Lineage’s North American power consumption is approximately equivalent to that of a mid-sized US city.

“We are entrusted with ensuring that billions of pounds of food across the United States and the globe are kept at optimal temperatures throughout the supply chain, and we are obsessed with finding new ways to do this even more safely and efficiently than has ever been done before,” Said Michael J. McClendon President, Lineage Europe & EVP, Network Optimization.

“Better Plants partners such as Lineage are implementing innovative energy efficiency solutions in the industrial space that are cutting costs and energy-use and the Better Practice Awards honor their leadership,” said Valri Lightner, DOE Advanced Manufacturing Office Acting Director.

Lineage will be formally recognized at the upcoming Better Buildings, Better Plants Summit in Arlington, Virginia, on July 10-11. During the summit, Lineage will present its award-winning project as part of the “Best of the Betters” session.

About Lineage’s Patented “Flywheeling” Technology

Lineage’s flywheeling technology minimizes energy costs and increases utilization of renewable energy sources by precisely timing electricity consumption. It determines when peak demand for energy usage will occur and avoids the relevant periods by super-cooling the warehouse in advance. Lineage’s algorithms rely on advanced physics, mathematical optimization, large-scale sensor deployments and machine learning to accurately quantify how each building interacts with its environment and optimize accordingly.

Lineage piloted flywheeling at its Mira Loma, CA facility in 2018 with the goal of reducing the cost of refrigeration per pallet of goods. As part of this effort, Lineage deployed the flywheeling algorithms and also upgraded warehouse infrastructure, instrumentation and control equipment. In 2018, Lineage achieved a 39% reduction in normalized cost at Mira Loma as a result of this initiative, and has plans to roll it out to additional locations within the network in the coming year.

This flywheeling project is just one example of the innovative industry-leading technology work done by the Lineage Data Science Team – the only team of its kind in the industry. Comprised of some of Silicon Valley’s brightest physicists, mathematicians, marine biologists, engineers and technologists, the team uses thermodynamics, mathematics, AI/machine learning, robotics, statistics, oceanography, computer simulation and data visualization to disrupt the world’s food supply chain by optimizing costs, increasing energy efficiencies to build the warehouses of the future and eliminating waste.

Correspondence shows how climate change deniers got into EPA fuel economy rollback fight,https://electrek.co,"['Renogy Watts Volts Monocrystalline Solar Starter Kit', 'Chargepoint Home Wifi Enabled Electric Vehicle', 'Ev']",07-03-2019,2019,7,https://electrek.co/2019/07/03/climate-change-deniers-epa/,"In the ongoing saga of the Trump administration’s efforts to roll back fuel economy standards, it’s been known that automakers sought to ease the rising MPG requirements set by the Obama administration. But a new report reveals how a number of climate change deniers injected themselves into the conversation, pushing the administration to go “much further” than planned.

Recently released government emails show how these deniers even went so far as to call automakers “the opposition,” according to a new report from the New York Times.

Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute — described by the Times as “a free-market think tank in Washington that disputes that climate change is a problem” — did just that in a May 2018 email to an EPA official, among others.

Ebell, who leads the climate change-denying “Cooler Heads Coalition,” wrote that the administration should stick to the rollback. He was also, unsurprisingly, selected to lead the Trump administration’s EPA transition team in 2016.

As the administration finalizes its plan to roll back fuel economy standards, the automakers are concerned about a “split market” between California and states which plan to follow higher standards, and the other states. Last month, 17 automakers wrote a letter asking to stop the planned rollback.

Prior to that, in a letter sent to Trump this May, Ebell and his group wrote about the automakers’ pushback. From the Times:

“Their main concern is the expected legal battle with California,” they wrote. “In fact, what many liberal California politicians really want to do is ban gasoline-powered cars altogether.” Their letter went on to say: “You should dismiss this concern. We agree that in an ideal world, California would negotiate with you in good faith, but we all know that is not a reality in this current political climate.”

The administration still hasn’t shown any signs of pulling back.

As National Highway Traffic Safety Administration deputy administrator Heidi King simply told the Times, “In my experience, these rules tend to go to the courts regardless.” The NHTSA is making the new rules in conjunction with the EPA.

The Times also notes how another conservative group, American Commitment, generated “almost 1,600 public comments in support of the rollback, or 13 percent of the 12,000 comments received and posted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.”

Many of these particular comments came with the same boilerplate language accusing Obama and California as wanting to ban the internal combustion engine, and so forth.

Even the oil companies seem to want no part of these efforts. BP sent a letter to EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler in June that found the oil giant siding with the automakers, asking the administration to focus on improving fuel economy, the Times said.

Electrek’s Take

As unsurprising as any of this might be to anyone who’s been following what’s going on with the fuel economy rollback — or with the current EPA and administration in general — it’s still gross beyond belief. A group of people that has absolutely no business even being involved in these decisions instead has an incredible amount of influence.

We’ve reached a point where even BP — BP! — is pushing back against the administration’s efforts.

Automakers are still not without blame in their role here. Not by a long shot, not at all. They’re the ones who opened this Pandora’s box and pushed the EPA to reduce emissions standards the first chance they got.

But now, at this point in time, it seems clear that if it were just a discussion between automakers that have realized the error of their ways and an administration that actually cared about listening to their concerns about what might happen to the market… or an EPA that cared about reducing emissions… or improving the environment… things could be at least a little different. There could be some sort of “compromise,” at a minimum.

But it’s not.

If you’re looking for a glimmer of hope on this, look to King’s quote about how “these rules tend to go to the courts regardless.” California and 17 other states already filed suit against the EPA last year for its proposed rollback. Upon finalization of the plan, legal challenges against the rollback only seem set to increase.

States will be leading the way in that regard, but after all this, wouldn’t it be something if the automakers stepped up with a legal pushback of their own? If the rules are indeed finalized as expected, we’re curious to see what the next move will be from the industry as they face the dreaded “split market.” After all, there’s nothing stopping them from wanting to meet the Obama-era standards on their own.

Can T-Mobile and Sprint Meet the Justice Department's Demands?,https://finance.yahoo.com,"['Adam Levy', 'The Motley Fool']",07-04-2019,2019,7,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/t-mobile-sprint-meet-justice-130300504.html,"In an effort to gain approval for their proposed $26 billion merger, T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE: S) have agreed to a deal with Dish Network (NASDAQ: DISH). The deal, however -- which includes the sale of the Boost Mobile brand, spectrum licenses, and a long-term wholesale agreement to use the T-Mobile/Sprint network -- still might not be enough for the Justice Department, according to a report from CNBC.

The biggest point of contention is that the DOJ wants New T-Mobile -- as management is calling the company that would result from the merger -- to provide Dish unlimited access to its network. New T-Mobile wants to cap Dish Network's use to 12.5% of its total capacity. It also wants to put a limit on outside investments in Dish Network, capping strategic investors to owning a maximum of 5% in the satellite company.

T-Mobile CEO John Legere. More

T-Mobile CEO John Legere. Image source: T-Mobile

Why T-Mobile needs the caps

T-Mobile has very valid reasons for wanting to limit Dish Network's use of its network. The wholesale licensing agreement will last six or seven years according to CNBC's sources, and during that time T-Mobile plans to build out a fast nationwide 5G network. What's more, it plans to use excess capacity on that network to provide home broadband internet service, eventually reaching more than 50% of the population.

As part of its promises to the FCC, New T-Mobile agreed to certain benchmarks for providing home internet service. It said it will offer service to 9.6 million households within three years, and 28 million within six years. Providing Dish with unlimited access to its network during that same period could stymie New T-Mobile's ability to properly serve the number of households it's promised the FCC.

The cap on strategic investors in Dish is meant to keep Dish from raising a lot of capital and building out its own competing network as quickly. If Dish has to move more slowly with its network buildout, then it'll give New T-Mobile more time to adjust to revenue losses resulting from the planned sale of its Boost Mobile customers -- and reduce the number of mobile customers it could lose to Dish in the short run.

Dish will still have access to capital from debt markets and smaller investors, and its own TV service operations produced about $1.1 billion in free cash flow over the trailing twelve months. Combined, Dish should be able to build out a competitive network in the time frame allotted by the six-to-seven-year wholesale agreement, but probably not much sooner.

The Justice Department's high demands

T-Mobile and Sprint have shown a lot of commitment to getting the deal done. With their rough agreement with Dish, it seems very close to getting the Justice Department's blessing.

The DOJ may be more stringent than it has been with other recent merger proposals due to the response from the public. 14 states have jointly filed a lawsuit against the merger, saying it will result in less competition and higher prices. For the Department of Justice to uphold its decision to approve the merger, it needs to be sure competition and pricing won't see a major impact.

That means the DOJ needs to ensure a fourth competitor can establish itself in the market and compete for new customers, with a strong network to bring them in. Moreover, it needs to ensure the new competitor can do so in a way that's not cost-prohibitive in order to keep pricing pressure on the incumbents."
DOJ says new legal team will take over census case,https://www.katc.com,[],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.katc.com/news/national/doj-says-new-legal-team-will-take-over-census-case,"The Justice Department announced Sunday night a new legal team will take over the Trump administration's fight to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.

The department's spokesperson said in a statement that the DOJ is ""shifting these matters to a new team of Civil Division lawyers"" and it will be revealed in filings Monday.

The spokesperson did not give a reason for the change. Officials within the Civil Division's Federal Programs Branch had been lead on the census case up until now, but they are being replaced by a combination of career and political officials from the Civil Division's Consumer Protection Branch, a Justice official said.

""Since these cases began, the lawyers representing the United States in these cases have given countless hours to defending the Commerce Department and have consistently demonstrated the highest professionalism, integrity, and skill inside and outside the courtroom,"" DOJ spokesperson Kerri Kupec said in a statement.

""The Attorney General appreciates that service, thanks them for their work on these important matters, and is confident that the new team will carry on in the same exemplary fashion as the cases progress,"" the statement continues.

The Trump administration has been fighting to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census -- a question that hasn't been asked since 1950. The move could impact the balance of power in states and the House of Representatives, which are based on total population. Critics say adding the question could result in minorities being undercounted.

The Supreme Court recently ruled the evidence did not back up the claims of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Justice Department lawyers that the question is needed to better enforce voting rights."
"Obama DHS chief blasts Dems’ ‘open borders’ push, warns migration would explode",https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/obama-dhs-chief-blasts-dems-open-borders-push-warns-migration-would-explode,"An Obama-era Department of Homeland Security chief is warning Democratic presidential candidates to cool their push to decriminalize illegal border crossings, saying such a move would be tantamount to “open borders” policy and lead to hundreds of thousands more people flooding into the U.S. every month.

“That is tantamount to declaring publicly that we have open borders,” Jeh Johnson told The Washington Post.

DHS ACTING CHIEF PREDICTS UP TO 25 PERCENT DROP IN BORDER CROSSINGS AFTER NEW MEXICO AGREEMENT

“That is unworkable, unwise and does not have the support of a majority of American people or the Congress, and if we had such a policy, instead of 100,000 apprehensions a month, it will be multiples of that,” he said.

In May, authorities apprehended or encountered more than 144,000 border crossers, representing a stunning increase over the past several months. Current acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan said Friday that he anticipates the numbers decreased in June, amid new efforts to crack down both at the U.S.-Mexico border and Mexico's border with Central America.

Johnson’s warning that any gains could be reversed comes as 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls have lurched to the left on immigration, calling for health care for illegal immigrants and scrapping certain immigration enforcement measures.

At a Thursday night primary debate in Miami, candidates making up about half the field were asked if they support making crossing the border a civil, rather than a criminal, offense. Almost all the candidates, including former Obama Vice President Joe Biden, raised their hands.

The moment demonstrated how a once-fringe policy, pushed earlier this year by former Housing Secretary Julian Castro, has become mainstream among Democrats. Just days before the debate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., came out in favor of such a proposal.

OBAMA'S IMMIGRATION CHIEFS SPEAK OUT ON 'CRISIS' AT SOUTHERN BORDER

However, Castro on Thursday denied he supported open borders.

“Open borders is just a right-wing talking point,” he said. “It doesn’t matter what Democrats do on immigration.”

Since then Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J. announced on Tuesday a plan to “virtually eliminate immigration detention.”

“Without waiting for Congress to act, Cory will stop the treatment of immigrants as criminals, close inhumane DHS facilities, end the use of for-profit detention facilities and end unnecessary barriers for refugees and those seeking asylum to virtually eliminate immigrant detention,” a press release said.

Johnson, meanwhile, has also pushed back on the controversy surrounding the Trump administration's use of detention centers for migrants. On Friday, he said that chain link fences or ""cages"" weren't ideal, but were one of the ways authorities are forced to cope with the surge of migrants crossing the border, and that the alternative was putting them ""on the streets.""

""Chain link barriers, partitions, fences, cages -- whatever you want to call them -- were not invented on January 2017,"" Johnson said.

Justice Department shaking up legal team on census citizenship question case,https://bangordailynews.com,"['The Associated Press', 'Mike Balsamo']",07-08-2019,2019,7,https://bangordailynews.com/2019/07/08/national-politics/justice-department-shaking-up-legal-team-on-census-citizenship-question-case/,"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department is shaking up the legal team fighting for the inclusion of a citizenship question on the 2020 census but offered no specifics on why the change was being made.

The change announced Sunday comes days after the department vowed to continue to try to find a legal path forward to include the question on the census. The Trump administration has faced numerous roadblocks to adding the question, including a ruling from the Supreme Court that blocked its inclusion, at least temporarily.

President Donald Trump said last week that he was “very seriously” considering an executive order to get the question on the form. The government has already started to print the census questionnaire without the question.

The Justice Department is expected to file court papers Monday that show a new team of lawyers will take over.

“Since these cases began, the lawyers representing the United States in these cases have given countless hours to defending the Commerce Department and have consistently demonstrated the highest professionalism, integrity, and skill inside and outside the courtroom,” Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said in a statement.

A department spokeswoman declined to comment when asked whether the change had been ordered by Attorney General William Barr.

A Justice Department official told The Associated Press that the new team would consist of both career and politically appointed attorneys. James Burnham, a top lawyer in the department’s civil division, would no longer be leading the litigation team, said the official, who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity to discuss the matter ahead of the court filing.

The Trump administration has argued that the question was being added to aid in enforcing the Voting Rights Act, which protects minority voters’ access to the ballot box. But Chief Justice John Roberts joined the court’s four more liberal members in last month’s Supreme Court decision, saying the administration’s justification for the question “seems to have been contrived.”

The U.S. Census Bureau’s own experts have said a citizenship question would discourage immigrants from participating in the survey and result in a less accurate census that would redistribute money and political power away from Democratic-led cities where immigrants tend to cluster to whiter, rural areas where Republicans do well."
House Panel Sues Treasury for Trump Tax Returns,https://www.wsj.com,"['Richard Rubin', 'Richard.Rubin Wsj.Com']",,,,https://www.wsj.com/articles/house-panel-sues-u-s-treasury-for-trump-tax-returns-11562081358,"WASHINGTON—The House’s tax-writing committee sued the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service on Tuesday for access to President Trump’s tax returns, hoping federal judges will pry loose records that the administration has refused to hand over.

The lawsuit from the House Ways and Means Committee at last puts the clash into the courts, exactly where Committee Chairman Richard Neal (D., Mass.) and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have predicted for months that it would land.

U.S. reviews export requests to Huawei with 'highest scrutiny': Commerce Department,https://www.reuters.com,"['Alexandra Alper', 'Min Read']",07-03-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-huawei-tech-commerce/u-s-reviews-export-requests-to-huawei-with-highest-scrutiny-commerce-department-idUSKCN1TY2HA,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government said on Wednesday it was reviewing license requests from U.S. companies seeking to export products to China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd “under the highest national security scrutiny” since the company is still blacklisted.

In an email to Reuters, the Commerce Department said that as it reviewed applications, it was applying the “presumption of denial” standard associated with Entity Listed companies, meaning applications are unlikely to be approved.

President Donald Trump surprised markets on Saturday with an announcement that U.S. companies would be allowed to sell products to Huawei [HWT.UL], which was placed on the so-called Entity List in May over national security concerns.

U.S. chipmakers, which had been seeking a carve-out for exports of less sensitive technology to the world’s top telecoms technology maker, welcomed the news.

But four days after Trump’s announcement on the sidelines of the G20 in Japan, industry and government officials were uncertain what the new policy will be.

“It seems like nobody has made up their mind as to what the policy is and, as a result, nothing’s changing,” said Douglas Jacobson, an international trade lawyer.

“There’s even less change than we anticipated if we’re still applying the presumption of denial,” Jacobson added, noting that he’s advising clients not to even apply for a license because it’s not worth their time and money under that review policy.

In an email to enforcement staff on Monday, seen by Reuters, John Sonderman, deputy director of the Office of Export Enforcement in the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, sought to clarify how agents should approach license requests by firms seeking approval to sell to Huawei.

All such applications should be considered on merit, he wrote, citing regulations that include the “presumption of denial” licensing policy.

The Commerce Department spokesman said on Wednesday that the department intends to notify companies of decisions on export license applications once the review is complete.

White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said earlier this week that the government would allow “lower tech” chip sales that do not impact national security, echoing similar comments from National Economic Council Chairman Larry Kudlow.

The United States has accused Huawei of stealing American intellectual property and violating Iran sanctions.

It has launched a lobbying effort to convince U.S. allies to keep Huawei out of next-generation 5G telecommunications infrastructure, citing concerns the company could spy on customers. Huawei has denied the allegations."
