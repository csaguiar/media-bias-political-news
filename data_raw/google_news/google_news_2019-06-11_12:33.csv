Justin Amash leaves House Freedom Caucus after ‘impeachable’ comments,https://nypost.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Fox News', 'June']",06-11-2019,2019,6,https://nypost.com/2019/06/11/justin-amash-leaves-house-freedom-caucus-after-impeachable-comments/,"Michigan Repubican Rep. Justin Amash announced Monday evening he was leaving the influential conservative House Freedom Caucus, just weeks after he attracted the ire of his colleagues by arguing in Twitter posts that President Trump had committed impeachable offenses, Fox News has learned.

Amash, speaking at a Freedom Caucus board meeting, insisted his departure was voluntary. Amash said he did not want to continue to be a “further distraction” for the caucus, which is chaired by North Carolina GOP Rep. Mark Meadows.

Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, a member of the Freedom Caucus, told Fox News’ “Ingraham Angle” Monday evening that Meadows and Amash mutually came to the decision after several conversations.

Jordan said the Republican members of the group still consider Amash a friend, but that their disagreements were “sharp” and significant.

“Some of the president’s actions were inherently corrupt,” Amash, who said Trump had “engaged in impeachable conduct,” tweeted in May. “Other actions were corrupt — and therefore impeachable — because the president took them to serve his own interests.”

Amash also accused Attorney General Bill Barr of intentionally misrepresenting Mueller’s report through lawyerly sleights of hand.

President Trump responded by writing that Amash was a “loser” and a “lightweight” seeking to gain national name recognition.

At a town hall in Grand Rapids, Mich., late last month, some of Amash’s constituents excoriated him for pushing for impeachment, while several others commended him for breaking ranks with his party and standing on principle.

“You talk about the Constitution and how important that is, but yet nothing that Mueller came out within this report, nothing that has been said about him and President Trump is constitutional and has been a smear tactic because that’s how the Democrats work,” one Trump supporter told Amash. “How can you become a Democrat when we voted for you as a Republican because you’ve just drank the same Kool-Aid as all the Democrats.”

Amash then defended his record in Congress, telling the town hall attendees he has “one of the most constitutionally conservative and fiscally conservative” voting records of all sitting lawmakers and that he’s at the top “of nearly all the scorecards” of conservative groups.

Amash had a high 88 rating from the American Conservative Union (ACU) in 2018, up from 78 in 2017. Jordan scored 100 for both years, while Meadows notched 91 and 100, respectively. The group’s Federal Legislative Ratings scores members of Congress based on how they vote in line with conservative principles. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., by contrast, had a 4 rating in 2018.

Another woman at the town hall, Anna Timmer, criticized Amash for “grandstanding” and trying to raise his “national profile,” while arguing that an impeachment inquiry would “tear this country apart.”

She later told Fox News the town hall was “packed with Democrats” who were “shaking their fists” at her.

In May, another caucus member, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, echoed Timmer’s complaints. (McCarthy’s ACU rating was 80 in 2018.)

“This is exactly what he wants, he wants to have attention,” McCarthy said on “Sunday Morning Futures.” He went on to express doubt over Amash’s Republican leanings in general.

“You’ve got to understand Justin Amash. He’s been in Congress quite some time. I think he’s asked one question in all the committees that he’s been in. He votes more with Nancy Pelosi than he ever votes with me. It’s a question whether he’s even in our Republican conference as a whole.”

Amash criticized Republicans and Democrats for rushing to judgment over Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report, accusing his colleagues of speaking out based on which side of the political aisle they are on, and not the facts.

“Few members of Congress even read Mueller’s report; their minds were made up based on partisan affiliation,” Amash tweeted, “and it showed, with representatives and senators from both parties issuing definitive statements on the 448-page report’s conclusions within just hours of its release.”

McCarthy, meanwhile, accused Amash of simply being contrarian, saying, “You could have a bill with 400 votes all supporting it, there will always be one opposed and that is Justin Amash.”

Amash stated earlier this year that he was considering running against Trump in 2020 as a third-party candidate.

"Roger Stone calls John Dean's House testimony 'clickbait,' questions fellow Watergate figure's credibility",https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/roger-stone-calls-john-deans-house-testimony-click/story?id=63616905,"Decades before Roger Stone, the longtime adviser to President Donald Trump, became embroiled in special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian election meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, he was a part of an investigation into possible obstruction of justice committed by a different commander-in-chief: President Richard Nixon.

Stone -- a Nixon enthusiast known for a tattoo of the former president's face on his back -- took a swipe at former Nixon White House Counsel John Dean's credibility on Monday, as the pivotal figure from the Watergate scandal testified on Capitol Hill on the parallels between the investigations into Nixon and Trump.

""I'm not certain why [Dean] was asked to testify today as I don't know what his expertise is in the questioning. ... I kind of think he's clickbait,"" Stone told the ABC News podcast, ""The Investigation,"" of Dean, who famously turned on his former boss in a scathing manifesto read aloud to the Senate Watergate committee investigating Nixon in 1973.

Dean famously pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice in the cover-up of the Watergate scandal.

Stone -- who himself was the youngest person to testify in the same Senate hearings investigating the Watergate scandal -- added, ""[Dean's] obviously a media star. He's gotten a lot of airtime talking about the scandal based on his previous experience. So I assume he is testifying in order to bring attention to the hearings.""

Stone added that the House Judiciary Committee asked his attorneys for his own possible testimony before Congress, buthe maintained that he had to invoke his Fifth Amendment rights due to the ongoing legal proceedings he faces.

Stone served as an adviser to Trump’s 2016 campaign but left amid controversy in 2015, and his experience on the 2016 campaign trail was partially documented in the Netflix documentary, ""Get Me Roger Stone,"" which focused on Stone's eccentric political career.

In January, Stone was arrested in a pre-dawn FBI raid of his Florida home on a seven-count indictment in connection with Mueller's probe. Stone, who entered a plea of not guilty on all seven counts, faces charges including lying to Congress and witness tampering.

In Stone’s indictment, Mueller’s prosecutors wrote that after WikiLeaks began releasing internal Democratic National Committee emails in the summer of 2016, an unidentified ""senior Trump campaign official was directed to contact Stone about any additional releases and what other damaging information [Wikileaks] had regarding the Clinton Campaign.""

""Stone thereafter told the Trump Campaign about potential future releases of damaging material by [Wikileaks],"" prosecutors allege in the court documents. Stone has vehemently denied any alleged involvement with the Wikileaks disclosures, and was not charged with conspiring with them.

The federal judge presiding over Stone's case put him under a gag order in February that prevents him from speaking publicly about the case, and therefore could not comment on a number of matters ABC News asked him about during the interview.

Stone said he was underwhelmed by the ever-increasing pool of candidates vying for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. ""I don't see a winner or a particularly strong candidate in this pack of Democrats. I think Joe Biden is an extraordinarily flawed candidate,"" he said.

As for President Trump's Republican primary challenger, Fmr. Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, Stone -- a fan and friend of Weld's -- expressed skepticism about his viability as a Republican candidate powerful enough to unseat the president.

""I have a very high regard for Bill Weld,"" Stone said. I have a even higher regard for President Trump and the extraordinary job he is doing. I don't think he has any vulnerability in the Republican primary.""

When asked if he'd help Trump in his 2020 bid for re-election, Stone told ABC News, ""I certainly hope to be free to do so. As you know I have [pleaded] not guilty to all charges and I have vowed to fight for vindication at trial in November.""

Stone's next appearance in court is scheduled for July 19."
Help! Trump Spoke to CNBC and I Don't Understand Anything He Just Said,https://www.theroot.com,"['Stephen A. Crockett Jr.', 'About The Author', 'Senior Editor', 'The Root', 'Boxes Outside My Weight Class', 'When They Go Low', 'You Go Lower.']",,,,https://www.theroot.com/help-trump-spoke-to-cnbc-and-i-dont-understand-anythin-1835379561,"Photo: Win McNamee (Getty Images)

The president of the United States gave an interview to CNBC and he sounded like a man who doesn’t know what the hell is going on. But what was even more concerning is instead of his usual word-salad, this was more like a word Chipotle bowl that was dropped on the floor and then kicked around.



On Monday, Trump was asked about big tech companies needing to be broken up to prevent monopolies, and his answer...well if you understand it, please tell me in the comments.

According to RawStory, Trump not only went off topic, he started talking about the European Union and the way they treat American companies, which totally explains why big companies needed to scale down to create a competitive market.



“I’ll tell you this: The European Union, which is a fantastic group of negotiators, they actually, a very, very prominent person who you know well, who’s on your show a lot, said the person at the European Union that is in charge of taxation hates the United States more than any person anywhere in the world,” Trump began, RawStory reports. “But I really believe that’s true! Every week you see them going after Facebook and Apple and all of these companies that are great companies. There’s something going on.”

Then, because the president wasn’t done talking about the EU, he continued on his nonsensical rant claiming that they were suing American tech companies because they “hate” America.

“When they give European Union $7 billion and $5 billion and $2 billion, you know, Apple gets sued for $10 billion, and you know, right now it’s going on and they’ll end up settling, they get all this money,” he said, RawStory reports. “Well, we should be doing that! They’re our companies, so they’re actually attacking our companies. But we should be doing what they’re doing! They think there’s a monopoly, but I’m not sure that they think that, they just figure this is easy money, we’ll sue Apple for $7 billion and we’ll make a settlement or win the case. So I think it’s a bad situation but obviously there is something going on in terms of monopoly.”

Seriously, if you have any idea what the president is talking about and how any of this relates to big tech companies branching off into smaller companies, help me understand in the comments section."
"Opinion | Congratulations on Fixing the Border, Mr. President!",https://www.nytimes.com,['Michelle Goldberg'],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/opinion/trump-mexico-tariffs-trade.html,"Months ago, Mexico consented to expanding a program in which migrants seeking asylum in the United States wait in Mexico while their claims are adjudicated, and to deploying more of its national guard to block migrants. It looks as if negotiators of the deal made on Friday simply ramped up the scale of these agreements to give Trump a face-saving way to back down from tariffs that threatened the American economy as well as the Mexican one.

As it became clear — at least to those outside the Fox News bubble — how little Trump had achieved, he grew even more splutteringly incoherent than usual. “Mexico was not being cooperative on the Border in things we had, or didn’t have,” until the deal, he wrote in one tweet. Trump went on to claim that Mexico had made further, secret concessions that would be revealed at a later date, which Mexico’s foreign minister denied. (Some have reported that Trump was referring to a potential regional pact on asylum that would include Central and South American countries and the United Nations, which Mexico said it could be open to discussing.)

All this was just the latest demonstration that, personal branding to the contrary, the president is terrible at making deals. What he’s good at is what might be called deal theater — made-for-TV melodramas with self-generated crises, over-the-top demands, and suspenseful arbitrary deadlines. The point of these exercises isn’t to solve a problem, but to pacify Trump with the illusion that he is winning so that he doesn’t feel the need to break anything.

The question for everyone else is whether to play along, because Trump is less dangerous if he thinks Mexico has submitted. Until now, the president has regularly stoked his nativist base by treating the humanitarian emergency at the border as a security threat. Now he has an interest in exaggerating the degree to which the problem has been solved, just as he now plays down North Korea’s nuclear capabilities rather than admit his own failure.

Facing widespread mockery for his Potemkin deal, Trump tweeted on Monday that if Mexico’s legislature fails to enact the provisions of its purported secret agreement with the U.S., the tariffs will go into effect. There’s an implicit threat here: Don’t provoke him. If he doesn’t get the headlines he wants, there’s no telling what he might do."
Opinion | Donald and the Delusion Discount,https://www.nytimes.com,['Paul Krugman'],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/opinion/trump-trade-tariffs.html,"The events of the past few weeks destroyed whatever credibility Donald Trump may still have had on economic policy. And investors are celebrating. At this point, evidence that Trump tweets are sound and fury signifying nothing is, in effect, good news.

Let’s review what happened. First, having gone to great lengths to get a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada — an agreement that was very similar to the existing agreement, but one he could slap his own name on — Trump basically blew up his position by threatening to impose new tariffs unless Mexico did something about border issues that have nothing to do with trade.

This obviously weakens if it doesn’t destroy Trump’s ability to negotiate future agreements, on trade or anything else. After all, what’s the point of making deals with an administration that reneges on its promises whenever it feels like it?

But then, barely a week later, Trump called the whole thing off in return for a statement by Mexico that it would do … things it had already agreed to months earlier."

Justice Dept. Agrees to Turn Over Key Mueller Evidence to House,https://www.nytimes.com,['Nicholas Fandos'],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/us/politics/mueller-judiciary-committee.html,"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department, after weeks of tense negotiations, has agreed to provide Congress with key evidence collected by Robert S. Mueller III that Democrats believe could shed light on possible obstruction of justice and abuse of power by President Trump.

The precise scope, volume or usefulness of the material was not immediately clear, but the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, said it would include “interview notes, firsthand accounts of misconduct and other critical evidence” collected by Mr. Mueller from the White House and former officials.

The deal appeared to provide a rationale for House Democrats’ choice, announced last week, to back away from threats to hold Attorney General William P. Barr in contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena for the materials in question. Out of an abundance of caution, the House still planned move forward with a Tuesday vote to empower the Judiciary Committee to take Mr. Barr and other noncompliant witnesses to court to fully enforce their subpoenas if necessary.

And another panel, the House Oversight and Reform Committee, is to vote on Wednesday to recommend that the House hold Mr. Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt for defying subpoenas in a different case related to the Trump administration’s addition of a citizenship question on the 2020 census."
"‘That is f—ing frightening’: Treasury’s top brass is white, male and wealthy",https://www.politico.com,"['Nancy Cook', 'Andrew Restuccia', 'Kyle Cheney']",06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/11/trump-treasury-department-diversity-mnuchin-1359089,"Out of roughly 20 officials who routinely attend senior staff meetings led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, only three are women and one is a person of color. | Evan Vucci/AP Photo treasury department ‘That is f—ing frightening’: Treasury’s top brass is white, male and wealthy A lack of diversity in the highest ranks of the Trump-era Treasury Department is a microcosm of challenges across the administration.

When Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin postponed installing abolitionist Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill, critics viewed it as further evidence of the administration’s lack of sensitivity to race, gender and history.

Under the surface of that public backlash was another one brewing inside the Treasury Department: deepening tensions from the last two years over the diversity of the top staff.

Story Continued Below

Out of roughly 20 officials who routinely attend senior staff meetings led by Mnuchin, only three are women and one is a person of color. In fiscal year 2018, the hiring of minorities at Treasury fell to its lowest pace in five years, according to the department’s own statistics, while the number of women and minorities leaving the agency outpaced their hiring.

Treasury has fewer policy disagreements these days, said one former official, because the top decision-makers are overwhelmingly white, male and wealthy. That can make the debates less robust and also gives the department the feeling of “being disconnected from reality,” said one administration official.

“When you do not have diversity at an agency in terms of gender, race, ethnicity and financial perspective and those are the people driving our policy, that is f---ing frightening,” said another former administration official.

Treasury recently hired Monica Crowley as the incoming assistant secretary for public affairs to replace Mnuchin’s trusted aide, Tony Sayegh. Mnuchin wanted someone with on-air credentials, which Crowley brought as a longtime Fox News commentator, but her hiring also was meant to fend off criticism that the upper ranks of Treasury were becoming too male, according to four current and former administration officials. All three final contenders for that job were women with TV experience.

Treasury’s top-level homogeneity is a microcosm of diversity troubles across the Trump administration. The problem grabs headlines each time a senior White House official who’s a women or person of color exits the West Wing. The Trump Cabinet overall includes only a handful of racial or ethnic minorities and women holding some of the government’s highest jobs.

No single group tracks the number of women and people of color at the highest levels of government. But the types of people who staff the federal government matters, said Max Stier, founding president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit that studies government management.

“Our government is a public asset,” Stier said. “It is the tool we have to solve our biggest problems with taxpayer money, and how it looks to the American public has consequences.” Americans of all races and ethnicities feel inspired by seeing people who look like them holding the country’s highest offices, he added.

Treasury’s diversity woes have become a topic of great discussion within an agency that holds sway over some of the nation’s most consequential economic issues, from housing finance to taxes to household debt to bank regulation — policy areas that shape prosperity for all Americans.

Treasury officials readily acknowledge the agency is dominated by white men but say that is a problem with most finance-oriented institutions in the public and private sectors. As two examples, White men hold the majority of positions at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, according to annual diversity statistics given to Congress.

One Treasury official pointed to U.S. Treasurer Jovita Carranza — selected in April to run the Small Business Administration — and Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Sigal Mandelker as top female officials who have Mnuchin’s trust.

In an interview, Mandelkar praised Mnuchin’s leadership. “As a woman leader working for Secretary Mnuchin, I feel empowered and trusted. He has been a tremendous boss for me,” she said. “I have five primary leaders on my team and three out of the five of us are women. That is the first time we’ve had more than one woman on the team, and they are extraordinary leaders. Particularly in the national security space, it is great to have these women leaders as role models.”

The Trump-era Treasury Department has three women in Senate-confirmed top jobs. In contrast, the Obama administration in fiscal year 2011 had nine women serving in Senate-confirmed top positions — a record in the history of the agency, according to Treasury statistics. By fiscal year 2015, the Obama Treasury had seven women in Senate-confirmed and top appointed positions including the first-ever female deputy secretary of the department.

A Treasury spokesperson said the percentage of women in the agency’s overall workforce has not dramatically changed between administrations. In the Trump administration in 2018, 44 percent of Treasury’s permanent workforce were women, whereas 48 percent of the Treasury staff were women during the Obama administration in 2011 — the first year Treasury started tracking its own diversity stats as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Those figures cover all Treasury workers, including those in agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service.

Current and former administration officials attribute some of the diversity problems in Treasury’s top ranks to its early hiring practices. Mnuchin opted to make many of the top picks himself and he chose from the world he knew — New York finance. He refused to cede much control over the hiring of top appointees to the White House personnel office, which was much more involved in the Obama administration, said two former administration officials.

In interviews, more than a dozen current and former Trump administration and Treasury officials ticked off examples that openly highlighted the lack of diversity.

A recent photo one Treasury official posted to his LinkedIn page summed up for many the way Mnuchin has staffed the agency. In the private Treasury dining room, four white middle-aged men in dark suits — Craig Phillips, David Malpass, Justin Muzinich and Brent McIntosh — are sitting down for lunch at a corner table with a white tablecloth, white china and glasses of iced tea to celebrate Malpass’s promotion to run the World Bank.

That photo made the rounds among Treasury staffers because it showed, in such stark terms, who holds the power in the agency.

A Mad Men-esque reputation has followed Treasury officials throughout their day-to-day schedules, especially since Mnuchin tends to surround himself with an all-male posse. When President Donald Trump announced Jerome Powell as his next Federal Reserve chair in a Rose Garden ceremony in November 2017, for instance, a handful of white male Treasury officials attended and sat together side-by-side in the White House’s gold-painted chairs.

When asked during a congressional hearing in 2018 about the department’s mandated office of minority and women inclusion that goes by the acronym OMWI, Mnuchin stumbled. He could not muster the name of the person who ran it, or the number of times he’d met with her. One official said Mnuchin was confused because he typically thinks of that office by its full name.

Even some Republican women have not fared well at Treasury. A former Hill staffer, Shannon McGahn, left after less than one year in a top role as counselor to the secretary. McGahn was underutilized and unhappy, said former aides, because she was excluded from major policy discussions despite her extensive résumé as a political operative and former staff director for the House Financial Services Committee. McGahn was initially brought on board during the transition to help Mnuchin staff up the department, and she later went on to manage the tax reform coalition efforts and worked closely with the White House.

Former staffers said Mnuchin’s closest aide in the building, former chief of staff Eli Miller, did not always win over the staff with his actions. Early in his tenure, Miller moved out of the chief of staff’s office a longtime career executive assistant, veteran and African American named Anita Hunt who’d served in the department since the administration of George W. Bush.

Miller viewed Hunt as insufficiently loyal to the Trump agenda and wanted his own person in that job. Hunt was unhappy as well, said two different former administration officials. Miller replaced her with a young white woman, who’d been working for another top Mnuchin political appointee.

The optics of the move rankled many Treasury staffers — who still buzz about it today — and Hunt, in turn, became a symbol for how Miller would staff the building and whom he would trust. Hunt did not respond to a request for comment.

Miller left Treasury in April to work on public policy at the Blackstone Group, a firm run by one of Trump’s closest business confidants, Stephen A. Schwarzman.

Pushing off the redesign of the $20 bill just put a fine point on the department’s diversity problems. One former Mnuchin aide at Treasury described it as a political gaffe on the part of secretary, who may not have realized how poorly it would play in public and inside his own agency.

“I thought it was the secretary of the Treasury buying into the most divisive type of messaging that comes out of the Trump White House,” said Gene Sperling, a former top Treasury official and director of the National Economic Council during the Obama administration. “Out of all of the things you could spend your time on as secretary, Mnuchin is spending it reversing the decision to remove Andrew Jackson and to put Harriet Tubman on the $20. That seems like an unnecessary and divisive action.”

Mnuchin has said he postponed the redesign because he was focused instead on security and anti-counterfeiting measures.

Many of the department’s top political appointees are exiting the building this year for jobs in the private sector, or for positions at other agencies or the White House.

Ultimately, those departures will give Treasury the chance to hire a whole new crop of staffers, or bring in a more diverse set of candidates for interviews. Currently, the offices of domestic finance and international affairs have no Senate-confirmed officials.

One Republican close to the White House said Mnuchin does not think much about the department’s current diversity stats, even if he respects the few top female officials with whom he interacts.

“For women and people of color, there is just a general feeling when you walk in and there are all white men that it is not a comfortable environment,” said another former Treasury official."
Homeland Security watchdog retires early after his office was forced to retract ‘feel-good’ audits of disaster response,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Lisa Rein', 'Reporter Covering Federal Agencies', 'The Management Of Government In The Trump Administration', 'Kimberly Kindy', 'National Investigative Reporter', 'June At Pm']",06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/homeland-security-watchdog-retires-early-after-his-office-was-forced-to-retract-feel-good-audits-of-disaster-response/2019/06/10/a370f488-8b9d-11e9-b08e-cfd89bd36d4e_story.html,"A house on Staten Island that was heavily damaged during Hurricane Sandy, shown in 2012. (Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images)

John V. Kelly, the acting inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security, announced his retirement Monday following revelations that he directed his staff to whitewash audits of the agency’s performance after federal disasters.

Kelly, 64, a career auditor who rose to the top job in 2017, announced his retirement in a brief email Monday morning to hundreds of DHS employees and contractors.

“It has been an honor and privilege to serve the American citizens for over 40 years,” he wrote. “However, it is time for me to retire.”

Kelly, who had planned to retire after the confirmation of President Trump’s nominee for the position, wrote in an email to The Washington Post that he “accelerated my retirement because I feel it’s in the best interest of the organization and its employees.”

“As I told the staff, I have truly enjoyed my 11-year tenure with the DHS OIG, an organization with a very important mission and extraordinary staff and managers that successfully execute that mission on a daily basis,” Kelly wrote. “Nobody in DHS leadership or any member of Congress asked me retire.”

Kelly’s announcement follows The Post’s report last week that an internal review found that Kelly overrode auditors who had found problems with the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s response to various disasters.

When teams of auditors flew to local communities to assess how well FEMA was helping residents recover, Kelly — then in charge of the emergency management auditing staff — directed them to ignore most problems, according to the internal review and interviews. Instead, he told them to produce what the staff dubbed “feel-good reports.”

[How the DHS watchdog whitewashed audits of FEMA’s disaster response]

The practice was repeated over five years after hurricanes, floods, wildfires and other disasters, including Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and catastrophic flooding in Louisiana in 2016, the review found.

Under pressure from House Republicans, the inspector general’s office retracted 13 faulty reports and purged them from its website in 2017 and 2018. Officials acknowledged they did not comply with federal auditing standards.

The inspector general’s office then spent 14 months examining what occurred. Kelly was recused from the review.

Investigators found that Kelly had praised FEMA’s work ethic to his auditors, telling them they would see “FEMA at her best” and instructing supervisors to emphasize what the agency had done right in its disaster response

Kelly joined the inspector general’s office in 2008 from the Government Accountability Office, where his long career covered performance and financial audits and program evaluations at numerous federal agencies.

A graduate of the University of Scranton, he quickly rose through the ranks in the DHS inspector general’s office, which provides independent, fact-driven audits and investigations of the performance of the sprawling agency.

The flawed audits on his watch represented a tiny fraction of the watchdog’s oversight of FEMA. The internal review did not find that Kelly was influenced by a personal relationship with anyone at the emergency response agency.

However, Jennifer Costello, the deputy inspector general, told the head of the internal review team that the “retraction of publicly issued reports because they are not reliable” was “not an insignificant matter.”

The reports, Costello wrote, “represent millions of wasted taxpayer dollars and understandably cast doubt on our credibility.” She said the inspector general’s office needs to hold itself to “the same standards to which we hold the Department when conducting oversight of its programs and operation.”

When the internal review was made public on May 23, Kelly sent his staff an email of apology, writing, “I take responsibility for failing to set a tone that all of our products need to be fully objective.”

The office has agreed to an outside review of its performance by another federal inspector general’s office to ensure that it has improved its overall operations and oversight of FEMA.

Trump this spring nominated Joseph V. Cuffari, a policy adviser to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R), to lead the office. His nomination has not yet been voted on by the Senate.

Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, said that the situation underscored the need for Cuffari to be promptly confirmed. “Ensuring a department has an independent inspector general is vital to maintaining transparency and holding government agencies accountable,” Johnson said in a statement."

The European Sessile Oak originated from the site in France where more than 9,000 U.S. Marines died in battle during World War I. It was planted on the South Lawn of the White House on April 23, 2018 during Macron's state visit, but mysteriously disappeared five days later.

Just One Tiny Industry May Emit More Methane Than EPA Had Estimated for All of Them,https://earther.gizmodo.com,"['Yessenia Funes', 'About The Author', 'I Mostly Write About How Environmental Policy', 'Climate Change Intersect With Race', 'Class Though I Occasionally Write About Animals', 'Science', 'Art', 'Too.

People tend to equate methane with cow farts (though their burps are worse), but we may be pointing our fingers in all the wrong places, according to a new study. The production of ammonia for fertilizer may result in up to 100 times more emissions than has been previously estimated for this sector. And that alone is more than what the Environmental Protection Agency estimates all industries emit across the U.S.

The study, published May 28 in the journal Elementa, zooms into the ammonia fertilizer industry because it relies heavily on natural gas to run its production plants. Ammonia is a compound made of nitrogen, which is used across the agriculture sector to fuel the growth of crops. While the ammonia fertilizer industry’s emissions of carbon dioxide are better understood, emissions of methane—which has 25 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide over a century—were a huge question mark. Until now.

The team of authors from Cornell University and the Environmental Defense Fund had two sampling adventures in June 2015 and September 2016 that took them to six ammonia fertilizer plants in the Midwest, including Oklahoma, Kansas, and Iowa. They used their findings to estimate industry-wide emissions throughout the U.S. The team found that the fertilizer industry results in 29 gigagrams of methane emissions a year. The EPA, however, reports this industry emitted only 0.2 gigagrams of methane a year between 2015 and 2016. As for all industries (like waste, chemical, and metals production), the EPA estimates 8 gigagrams, which is still much smaller than this single industry’s.

A worst case scenario—where other plants are consuming more natural gas than the ones analyzed—resulted in methane emissions that reached 139 gigagrams a year. For context, that’s equivalent to the carbon emissions from 669,314 passenger vehicles driven in a year. Or more than the carbon emitted from 3 billion pounds of coal burned. Best case scenario, the emissions are just 2 gigagrams of methane a year, which is still a lot more than what the EPA currently estimates for this industry.

That is pretty wild, but this is an estimate based only on six plants. They make up more than 25 percent of the 23 plants operating in 2016 and are also of varying sizes to represent the different facilities throughout the U.S., so the six are a pretty good sample. But the authors would like to examine more plants to be sure.

The researchers drove downwind from the facilities in a Google Street View car decked out with a killer methane analyzer that recorded the methane levels in the air. That way, the team was able to capture the methane emissions near the facility in the areas where wind was likely to push it. This poses some limitations, though, because not every plant had the best road access. The authors recommend looking at airborne measurements next time, too. The team looked at samples over just a few days in a single month over these two years. Capturing a longer timeline of data could further verify (or disprove!) their analysis.

Methane emissions feel especially relevant these days. The Trump administration has been attempting to roll back methane regulations since President Awful took office. (The Department of Energy actually called natural gas “freedom gas” the other day.) A coalition of states and environmental groups like the Sierra Club pressed a judge Friday to stop Trump from rolling back these protections, reports E&E News.

Methane isn’t just dangerous for our planet because it’s worsening climate change; its emissions are often coupled with particulate matter and other air pollutants that pose threats to the health of communities closest to the facilities where it’s being emitted.

DOJ investigating 'non-governmental organizations and individuals' as part of 'broad' probe into surveillance abuses,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/durham-investigating-non-governmental-organizations-and-individuals-potentially-including-fusion-gps,"As part of its ongoing ""multifaceted"" and ""broad"" review into potential misconduct by U.S. intelligence agencies during the 2016 presidential campaign, the Justice Department revealed Monday it is also investigating the activities of several ""non-governmental organizations and individuals.""

Additionally, the DOJ announced that the probe, let by Connecticut U.S. Attorney John Durham, was looking into the involvement of ""foreign intelligence services."" Former Trump aide George Papadopoulos told Fox News last month that an informant who was likely ""CIA and affiliated with Turkish intel"" had posed as a Cambridge University research assistant in September 2016 and tried to ""seduce him"" to obtain information linking the Trump team to Russia.

The information was contained in a letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., who had inquired as to the scope of Durham's investigation. The letter could indicate that the DOJ is looking closely at work done during the campaign by Fusion GPS, the firm retained by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee (DNC) to conduct opposition research against the Trump campaign.

Fusion GPS, in turn, hired British ex-spy Christopher Steele to produce an unverified and largely discredited dossier that the FBI went on to cite in secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court applications to surveil former Trump aide Carter Page.

CARTER PAGE: FBI INFORMANT 'INTENSIFIED' COMMUNICATIONS JUST BEFORE FISA WARRANT OBTAINED

Last week, reports indicated Steele had agreed to talk with Durham if certain preconditions were met. Multiple sources familiar with the matter told Fox News, meanwhile, that Durham is “very dialed in” and “asking all the right questions."" Separately, sources within the Justice Department confirmed to Fox News that Barr has met “on multiple occasions in recent weeks” with Durham in Washington, D.C.

Numerous problems with the Steele dossier's reliability have surfaced, including several issues that were brought to the FBI's attention before it cited the dossier in its FISA application and subsequent renewals. Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report made plain, for example, that then-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen did not travel to Prague to conspire with Russian hackers seeking to access Democrat files, as the dossier alleged.

Mueller also was unable to substantiate the dossier's claims that Page had received a large payment relating to the sale of a share of Rosneft, a Russian oil giant.

FMR TRUMP AIDE ALLEGES BOMBSHELL INFORMANT TRIED TO 'SEDUCE' HIM IN 'BIZARRE' EPISODE FOR RUSSIA DIRT ON TRUMP

North Carolina GOP Rep. Mark Meadows told Fox News on Sunday he has seen ""additional documents"" that demonstrate that “prior to the first FISA application, Peter Strzok, Andy McCabe, and others at the FBI knew that Christopher Steele's dossier was not credible.” Internal FBI text messages obtained by Fox News in March showed FBI brass scrambling to respond to a concern from a senior DOJ official about the potential ""bias"" of a key FISA source.

Meadows, speaking to ""Fox News Sunday,"" pointed specifically to a report from The Hill's John Solomon, who found that Ukrainian businessman Konstantin Kilimnik, a key figure in Mueller's report, was actually a U.S. informant. In his report, Mueller linked Kilimnik to Russian intelligence, and did not mention Kilimnik's secretive ties to the U.S. in the report other court filings -- even as Mueller suggested former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's ties to Kilimnik were nefarious.

""The deeper the dive we take into the Mueller report, we're starting to find out some of the conclusions, and actually some of the facts they put forth in there, are a misrepresentation of what we actually know,"" Meadows said.

Meadows added that he expected DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigation into potential FBI and DOJ surveillance misconduct to come out later than June, when it was originally expected. Meadows said more information has come to light that might necessitate the delay.

Solomon, reporting for the Hill, also recently unearthed a documented conversation Steele had with a State Department contact -- which were relayed to the FBI -- in which Steele claimed the Russians were running a “technical/human operation run out of Moscow targeting the election"" and that ""payments to those recruited are made out of the Russian Consulate in Miami.""

There is no Russian consulate in Miami, a fact the State Department official, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec, emphasized in her notes. Additionally, Steele had suggested his client was ""keen"" to see his information come to light prior to Election Day. Kavalec forwarded her notes to the FBI and other government officials several days before the FISA warrant was issued for Page. Fox News has confirmed The Hill's reporting.

RUSSIAN-BORN UK ACADEMIC SAYS SHE'S BEING USED TO 'SMEAR' MICHAEL FLYNN

Further, in its original FISA application and subequent renewals, the FBI told the FISA court that it ""did not believe"" Steele was the direct source for a Yahoo News article implicating Page in Russian collusion. Instead, the FBI suggested to the court, the September 2016 article by Michael Isikoff was independent corroboration of the dossier.

But London court records show that contrary to the FBI's assessments, Steele briefed Yahoo News and other reporters in the fall of 2016 at the direction of Fusion GPS.

Carter Page has not been charged with any wrongdoing, even though the FBI called him an ""agent of a foreign power"" in its October 2016 FISA application. On Sunday, Page told Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that his actions had been ""completely spun in the fake Mueller"" report to help advance what he characterized as Democrats' ""ridiculous"" goal of impeachment.

Thompson’s announcement was made on the heels of the disclosure by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) that a subcontractor had suffered a data breach, compromising photos of travelers and license plates compiled by the border agency.

CBP told The Hill the subcontractor that had its network breached had not been given permission to transfer CBP photos to its system. CBP has not named the subcontractor, and told The Hill that as of Monday, none of the images involved in the breach has been discovered on the darknet.

Thompson criticized CBP and the Department of Homeland Security in general for allowing the data breach to occur, saying in a statement that the privacy of Americans can’t be compromised.

“Government use of biometric and personal identifiable information can be valuable tools only if utilized properly,” Thompson said. “Unfortunately, this is the second major privacy breach at DHS this year. We must ensure we are not expanding the use of biometrics at the expense of the privacy of the American public.”

A spokesperson for Thompson told The Hill that the committee “hopes to have government witnesses” at the hearings, but had no further details on dates in July the hearings will take place."
Why former Defense Secretary Ash Carter wouldn't work for Trump,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Emily Tillett'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ash-carter-former-defense-secretary-would-not-work-for-trump/,"While he previously swore he would stay outside of politics, former Secretary of Defense Ash Carter says he wouldn't work for President Trump. Carter describes the commander-in-chief and his administration in his new book ""inside the Five-Sided Box: Lessons from a Lifetime of Leadership in the Pentagon"" as ""offensive, racist and divisive.""

""It's not politics, it's personal conduct,"" Carter said on ""CBS This Morning"" on Monday. Carter explained that he used to tell officers and soldiers in the military that they ""needed to behave themselves"" and would have fired an officer for acting as the president has.

""It's not just the president, it's the kind of behavior and personal conduct that you see everywhere in Washington today is not the kind of thing we tolerated in the military. I fired people for doing that and subordinates fired people for doing even less,"" Carter said.

Carter, who first began working for the Department of Defense in 1981, said he would not work under Mr. Trump if asked because he ""wouldn't know how to help him."" The Obama-era Defense chief said Mr. Trump appears to not take the advice of his Cabinet secretaries. That lack of concern for expert opinion is exactly what led Carter's successor, former Secretary of Defense James Mattis, to step down from the post in December, who cited vast differences in viewpoints with Mr. Trump as a sticking point.

""Your first duty as a Cabinet secretary is to serve the president, to help him...I couldn't take a job knowing that what I know and what I brought to the job, I wouldn't be able to apply to helping him,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Carter said the most urgent threats posed to the United States include China, Russia, Iran, North Korea and general terrorism.

""The future is more concerning to me, it's a competitive world,"" he said. ""All five of those are potential opponents are focused on us and we have to deal with all five of them and its a fast-moving world in technology, and so we need to make sure we stay competitive, because being the best, which we are, isn't a birthright, you got to keep earning it.""

Trump appoints Social Security Administration watchdog to also oversee Interior,https://thehill.com,[],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/447713-trump-appoints-social-security-administration-watchdog-to-also,"President Trump Donald John TrumpTop Armed Services Republican plots push for 0B defense budget Amash exits House Freedom Caucus in wake of Trump impeachment stance Amash exits House Freedom Caucus in wake of Trump impeachment stance MORE has quietly appointed his Social Security Administration (SSA) inspector general to also oversee a much different agency: the Interior Department.

On May 28, Gail Ennis began her second job overseeing the Interior Department’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG), a role she will keep for the foreseeable future, the OIG confirmed to The Hill.

The Trump administration is still awaiting the confirmation of Mark Greenblatt, the former assistant inspector general for investigations at the Commerce Department, to formally head the Interior’s OIG office.

Ennis was sworn into the SSA role just five months ago, her first time serving as an inspector general. Her professional background is in securities litigation, working previously as a partner at the Washington, D.C.-based law firm WilmerHale, where she reportedly earned $2 million a year.

At the SSA, Ennis has most recently led efforts to thwart scam Social Security phone calls, at the Interior department she will oversee investigations into Interior’s newly appointed Secretary David Bernhardt's lobbying ties and two ongoing Justice Department investigations into former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke Ryan Keith ZinkeOvernight Energy: Trump appoints Social Security watchdog to also oversee Interior | Critics question EPA guidance on pipelines | Battle over science roils EPA Overnight Energy: Trump appoints Social Security watchdog to also oversee Interior | Critics question EPA guidance on pipelines | Battle over science roils EPA Trump appoints Social Security Administration watchdog to also oversee Interior MORE. One of those investigations has reportedly made it to the grand jury.

The appointment of Ennis to Interior was not formally announced by the White House, however, the Interior Department’s website was updated last week to reflect her new position.

Ennis replaces former acting Inspector General Mary Kendall, who retired from the office at the end of May. Kendall oversaw multiple ethics investigations into Zinke, including recommending a number of them to the Justice Department for further investigation. Those investigations reportedly played a heavy factor in Zinke’s decision to leave the administration early this year.

Ennis is the second Trump political appointee whom the administration has attempted to put in the Interior OIG role.

Earlier this year, Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson Benjamin (Ben) Solomon CarsonTrump appoints Social Security Administration watchdog to also oversee Interior Trump appoints Social Security Administration watchdog to also oversee Interior Ben Carson decries 'gotcha' politics: 'Give me a break' MORE announced to staff that Assistant HUD Secretary Suzanne Israel Tufts would replace Kendall. Because Tufts had been previously confirmed by the Senate, she would not have to go through another confirmation process for the role.

However, following backlash to that announcement, the Interior Department later said the announcement was a misunderstanding and Carson reversed the move. Tufts resigned not long after.

“On May 28th, Social Security [Inspector General] Gail S. Ennis started at [Department of Interior] OIG as Acting Inspector General. Continuing with her responsibilities as SSA IG, Ms. Ennis will also lead our organization while Mark Greenblatt’s nomination continues to progress in the Senate,” an OIG spokesperson said in a statement to The Hill.

The White House referred comment to the Interior OIG. The Interior Department did not return a request for comment.

In addition to the ongoing investigations into Interior's current and former secretaries, the OIG is also investigating six high-ranking interior officials for ethics concerns.

Wilmer Hale, the law firm where Ennis previously worked as a partner, lobbies for a number of clients with business before Interior. For example, the law firm represents Twin Metals a Minnesota based mineral mining company that is lobbing to build a hotly debated copper-nickel mine near the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. In May, the Trump administration moved to renew one of the mine's mineral leases, reversing a decision from the Obama administration.

Ennis, who was not a registered lobbyist, said the Interior OIG ethics office is currently reviewing her former clients.

""DOI OIG General Counsel is conducting a thorough ethics review that will ensure that I do not participate in any matter that would create a conflict of interest or an appearance of a conflict of interest,"" Ennis told the Hill in a statement.

Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann WarrenWarren calls on top DOJ antitrust official to recuse himself from tech probes Iowa Poll: Most likely caucus goers wish several or most candidates would drop out Iowa Poll: Most likely caucus goers wish several or most candidates would drop out MORE (D-Mass.) on Tuesday called on the Department of Justice's (DOJ) top antitrust official to recuse himself from any probes into Google or Apple because of his previous lobbying for the two tech giants.

In letters, Warren cited Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim's ""real or perceived conflicts of interest.""

""Your past work as a lobbyist for two of the largest and most scrutinized tech companies in the world creates the appearance of a conflict of interest,"" Warren wrote in a letter to Delrahim on Tuesday. ""As the head of the antitrust division at the DOJ, you should not be supervising investigations into former clients who paid you tens of thousands of dollars to lobby the federal government.""

Reports in recent weeks have indicated the DOJ and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) are divvying up oversight of the country's largest tech giants in preparation for potential investigations into the companies' enormous market power, with the DOJ charged with overseeing Apple and Google while the FTC takes on Facebook and Amazon.

Warren was the first major 2020 Democratic presidential candidate to call for breaking up companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon, with others since following her lead. It became one of the signature plans that she has become known for as she surges in the polls as a top-tier candidate.

Delrahim lobbied on Google's behalf in 2007 when it was facing antitrust scrutiny over its acquisition of DoubleClick, a top online advertising company that has boosted its dominance in digital ads. The controversial $3.1 billion merger was approved after eight months, despite an outcry from competitors and industry-watchers who said it would give Google an unfair advantage in search advertising tools.

Experts have said any antitrust investigation of Google would likely home in on its dominance in digital advertising, which is partially enabled by its acquisition of DoubleClick.

According to Senate lobbying numbers, Delrahim reported a $100,000 paycheck from Google that year.

Delrahim also lobbied on behalf of Apple in 2006 and 2007 on patent reform.

Federal ethics laws require individuals to recuse themselves from situations in which they could not be impartial.

In a letter to Delrahim, Warren slammed his swing around the so-called revolving door, writing, ""Your prior work lobbying the federal government on behalf of these and other companies in antitrust matters compromises your ability to manage or advise on this investigation without real or perceived conflicts of interest.""

""Given his extensive and lucrative previous work lobbying the federal government on behalf of Google and Apple — particularly his work to aid Google in its acquisition of DoubleClick Inc. — any reasonable person would surely question Mr. Delrahim’s impartiality in antitrust matters involving Google,"" Warren wrote in a separate letter to Assistant Attorney General for Administration Lee Lofthus.

Warren asked Lofthus, the DOJ's ethics official, to provide information by June 14 on how the department is planning to address Delrahim's potential conflicts. She sent him a list of questions pressing the agency over whether it considers Delrahim's former lobbying work an issue and whether Delrahim has filled out an ethics agreement over his work for Google and Apple.

""Your past work as a lobbyist for two of the largest and most scrutinized tech companies in the world creates the appearance of conflict of interest,"" Warren wrote in her letter to the top antitrust attorney. ""As the head of the antitrust division at the DOJ, you should not be supervising investigations into former clients who paid you tens of thousands of dollars to lobby the federal government.""

""American consumers and markets deserve the confidence that the DOJ will conduct any antitrust investigation into Google or Apple with integrity, impartiality, and with the best interest of competitive markets and consumers in mind,"" she wrote.

Warren's letters comes as the Trump administration and House gear up for separate antitrust investigations into companies including Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google."

VA owes $190 million to disabled veterans improperly charged home loan fees,https://www.foxnews.com,['Robert Gearty'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/va-owes-190-million-to-disabled-veterans-improperly-charged-home-loan-fees,"The Department of Veterans Affairs owes about $189 million to 53,000 disabled veterans who were charged home loan fees they were exempt from having to pay, an investigation has found.

These veterans were charged the fees under the VA’s Home Loan Guaranty Program and now may be entitled to refunds ranging from $5,000 to $20,000, a VA Inspector General audit released Thursday found.

VA loan managers knew disabled vets were being charged the fees improperly since 2014 but never did anything about it, VA IG auditors determined.

“OIG finds it troubling that senior (Veterans Benefits Administration) management was aware that thousands of veterans were potentially owed more than $150 million yet did not take adequate actions to ensure refunds were issued,” the IG report says.

DOZENS OF ATTORNEYS GENERAL ASK BETSY DEVOS TO FORGIVE DISABLED VETS STUDENTS LOANS

The loan managers told the IG they were focused on other priorities, including processing high volumes of applications, USA Today reported.

The report faulted the Veterans Benefits Administration for placing the burden on a disabled vet to submit a claim for a refund.

The VA announced last month that it was notifying veterans when they buy homes through the Home Loan program that they are exempt from the fees if they are disabled or later determined to be disabled, the paper reported.

“Through an internal quality improvement effort, VA has put a plan in place to better inform veterans through key communications when the law allows VA to waive the fee for a veteran,” the announcement quoted VA Secretary Robert Wilkie as saying.

The Veterans Benefits Administration told the IG that it would identify exempt veterans who paid the fees and issue them refunds and that the financial impact to the veterans was minimal over the life of the loan, The Washington Post reported.

Auditors looked at the period 2012 to 2017.



They determined nearly $300 million in home loan origination fees had been collected from 73,000 exempt disabled vets during that time.

“Pride Month, that we’re in right now, is celebrated around the world by many State Department employees, by many embassies,” Ortagus said in a Monday press briefing at the department. “The secretary has the position that, as it relates to the flag pole, that only the American flag should be flown there.”

The U.S. embassies in at least four countries — Israel, Germany, Brazil and Latvia — were denied the ability to fly the flag, NBC News reported Friday. The Washington Post reported that some U.S. diplomatic offices, including in Seoul, South Korea, and Chennai, India, were still displaying rainbow flags despite the policy.

Ortagus added that embassies are permitted to hang the rainbow Pride flag or display other Pride images without violating the State Department’s directive, but flag poles should be reserved for the U.S. flag.

She also told reporters that Pompeo “respects the dignity of every individual,” reflected in the Pride celebrations taking place in U.S. embassies.

“You can do a simple, easy Google or Twitter search and see the pictures of members of embassies and ambassadors, people of the foreign service celebrating Pride throughout the world,” Ortagus said.

When asked why Pompeo did not release a statement in honor of Pride Month or the International Day Against Transphobia and Homophobia, which was on May 17, Ortagus reaffirmed Pompao’s focus on “dignity.”

“He remains committed to this effort around the world,” Ortagus said."
"USDA Report Corn, Soybean Yield Preview",https://www.agriculture.com,[],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.agriculture.com/news/crops/usda-report-yield-preview,"Market attention continues to focus on the potential size of the U.S. corn and soybean crops.

Acreage totals look to remain uncertain for the rest of the year and any adjustments in the next WASDE report may not reflect the changes facing both crops this year.

U.S. average yields appear set to move lower in Tuesday’s WASDE report as severe delays in planting indicate reduced yield potential.

Expectations for the U.S. average corn and soybean yields this year continue to deteriorate over recent weeks, as planting delays dragged on over much of the Corn Belt. In particular, states in the eastern Corn Belt dealt with extreme moisture and massive delays this year.

Yield potential falls for corn planted after the second or third weeks of May, all other conditions equal. Even though progress accelerated last week on drier weather, corn planting after May 25 came in at a higher-than-average percentage.

Based on the USDA’s weekly Crop Progress report, an estimated 51% of the corn acreage in the 18 major corn-producing states went in the ground after May 25, compared with the average of 16.8% from 1986 through 2018. Typically, late-planted acres remain isolated in specific areas of the country. While most of the very late planting this year occurred in eastern corn-producing states, a substantial amount of late-planted acreage occurred in almost every Corn Belt state.

The USDA’s weekly ratings of corn conditions, due out this week in the Crop Conditions report, should provide an initial indication of the 2019 crop. This conditions report is setting up to be one of the worst on record. Data available since 1986 indicate that as of the 23rd week of the year (June 9 this year), an average of 67% of the crop rated in good or excellent condition at the end of the 23rd week (excluding 1995 when ratings were not yet available due to extremely late planting). The five worst years for good and excellent ratings (excluding 1995) were 1992 (42%), 1988 (47%), 1996 (50%), 1990 (52%), and 1993 (57%). Late-planted corn acreage including 1995 came in well-above average in each of these years except for 1992 and 1988.

Crop Yield History

Crop condition ratings usually fall as the growing season progresses. Early season ratings do not supply an unbiased indication of the final U.S. average yield. Even so, the upcoming rating, along with severe planting conditions, should keep yield expectations low. If one includes 1995 with the five years mentioned above with the worst good and excellent ratings, the U.S. average corn yield came in above trend in only 1992 (+11 bushels) and 1990 (+2 bushels). The average yield over all six years totaled 9 bushels below trend. While the upcoming WASDE report may not fade the corn yield very much, an expectation this year for corn yield at or below trend appears reasonable.

Soybean Yield History

Soybean planting lagged well behind average pace this year as well. As of the June 3 Crop Progress report, 39% of the crop in the 18 major soybean producing states was planted. An expectation of substantial planting progress over the next few weeks is in place.

Based on the USDA’s weekly Crop Progress report, an estimated 72% of the soybean acreage in the 18 major soybean-producing states went in the ground after May 25. This amount sits well above the average from 1986 through 2018 of 39.2%. Field trials in Illinois indicate yield losses higher than 10% after May 20 with increasing levels as planting moves into June. Planting after June 10 led to almost a 20% loss expectation for soybean yields.

While this seems drastic, actual national data on soybean yields rarely falls outside a range of 3 bushels from trend (see farmdoc daily article for more details). Due to the later planting of soybeans this year, the first crop condition rating for soybeans looks to be out in the next two weeks depending on the percentage of the crop emerged.

Crop condition ratings for soybeans tend to decline more than corn as the growing season advances. Like corn, early season ratings do not provide a reliable indicator of the final U.S. average yield.

Lower yield expectations for corn and soybeans seem plausible. By factoring in late planting, a conservative yield estimate for corn near 170 bushels per acre, 4.5 bushels below the current USDA projection, appears reasonable. Uncertainty regarding acreage levels for corn will linger, but acreage reduction in the 7 to 12 million acres range produces a corn crop 1.7 to 2.2 billion bushels smaller than currently projected by the USDA.

For soybeans, an average yield of 47.8 bushels, which sits 1.7 bushels lower than the current USDA projection, fits current conditions. If one assumes 2 million additional soybean acres due to switching, soybean production comes in 150 million bushels lower than forecast by the USDA.

The June 11 WASDE report should provide the first indication from USDA about the size of both crops this year. The June 28 Acreage report will be the next major indicator.

Lawmakers try to save DHS lab that prepares first responders for terror threats,https://www.cnn.com,['Geneva Sands'],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/10/politics/dhs-lab-first-responders-funding-house/index.html,"(CNN) Lawmakers are again attempting to keep a Department of Homeland Security laboratory that specializes in first-responder technology and assistance from shutting its doors.

The House overwhelmingly passed a bill Monday evening that would permanently authorize the New York City-based National Urban Security Technology Laboratory, which has been at risk of losing funding over the past couple of years and was not included in the administration's latest DHS funding request.

The lab ""is constantly developing and testing new tools for our brave first responders to use in the event of a terrorist attack, industrial accident or natural disaster and closely collaborates with law enforcement agencies like the FDNY, NYPD and the Nassau County Police Department in my district,"" Rep. Kathleen Rice, a New York Democrat who cosponsored the bill, said Monday on the House floor, urging her colleagues to pass the legislation. The final vote was 395-3.

She said the administration has proposed closing the lab in each of the last two federal budgets.

The potential funding cut comes amid budget battles between the White House and Democrats on Capitol Hill, as the administration has shifted its funding and influence to the department's immigration missions.

""As we've been watching the coverage of June 6, 1944 D-Day, I had the thought that my arrival this time felt a little bit, I think, like jumping into Sainte-Mère-Église on the morning of June 5, trying to figure out where you could land without getting shot,"" he said at the FBI Academy on Friday.

Thursday marked the 75th anniversary of D-Day, the day when Allied soldiers stormed the beaches of Normandy in an effort to challenge the Nazi stronghold in Northern Europe.

DEMS UNVEIL CONTEMPT RESOLUTION FOR BARR, MCGAHN OVER SUBPOENA SNUB

President Trump spent that day at Normandy, commemorating the sacrifice of American veterans as he faced impeachment calls and investigations from Democrats in Congress.

“To more than one hundred and seventy veterans of the Second World War who join us today – you are among the very greatest Americans who will ever live,"" he said.

While in Normandy, Trump also spoke with Fox News about the Russia investigation and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who resisted impeachment but also reportedly said she wanted to see Trump in ""prison.""

“She’s incapable of doing deals, she’s a nasty, vindictive, horrible person, the Mueller report came out, it was a disaster for them,"" he said of Pelosi.

ADAM SCHIFF CONTINUES ATTACK ON BARR, SAYS AG IS 'SECOND MOST DANGEROUS MAN' IN US

Pelosi, who also visited Normandy, refused to discuss impeachment during an interview on D-Day but has repeatedly criticized the administration, especially the attorney general.

Barr, who also served as AG under former President George W. Bush, returned to the Justice Department as Pelosi's party continued pressing the Russia issue and his department faced intense questioning surrounding the investigation.

From the start, Barr was suspected of bias due to a memo he wrote which said he thought Trump was well within his powers when he fired former FBI Director James Comey -- one of the main issues in suspicions surrounding whether the president obstructed justice.

Since his arrival, Barr has taken actions that prompted both media figures and congressional Democrats to accuse him of shielding the president from warranted scrutiny. Barr has also come under fire for pursuing the president's directive to de-classify intelligence material in order to uncover information related to the Russia probe's origins.

HOUSE DEMS TO VOTE ON HOLDING BARR, MCGAHN IN CONTEMPT, SEEKING TO KEEP MUELLER SPOTLIGHT ALIVE

That prompted an inquiry from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who blasted the AG as unworthy of that title. Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., who also serves on that committee, said that while he was reluctant to impeach Trump, he was ready to pursue that path with both Barr and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.

Democrats seemed poised to at least hold Barr in contempt as his Department refused to comply with House Democrats request for more information surrounding the investigation.

Citing Barr's refusal, House Democrats proposed giving congressional investigators the power to ""“to initiate or intervene in any judicial proceeding before a Federal Court.""

REUTERS/Ting Shen

(Reuters) - The main U.S. refining industry association said on Monday it sued to block the Trump administration’s effort to expand sales of higher ethanol blends of gasoline, arguing the move exceeded the administration’s authority.

The legal challenge from the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) association escalated a battle between the oil and corn industries over the nation’s biofuel policy, which requires refiners to blend biofuels like corn-based ethanol into their gasoline, often at great expense.

President Donald Trump had directed the Environmental Protection Agency to lift a summertime ban on the sale of gasoline containing 15 percent ethanol, called E15, in an effort to help farmers suffering from the U.S. trade war with China. The EPA unveiled its rule doing so on May 31.

The summertime E15 ban had been implemented during the Obama administration to reduce smog emissions, but Trump’s EPA said E15’s impact on air quality was similar to that of E10, which could already be sold year-round.

The tension over the policy move reflects how Trump has struggled to please both Big Oil and Big Agriculture, two critical constituencies in the Republican president’s 2020 re-election bid.

AFPM asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to review the EPA’s rule, in papers filed on Monday, said Diana Cronan, a spokeswoman for the group.

AFPM has one month to provide the court with the outline of its case, she said."

Mnuchin believes that falling bond yields, rather than warning of a recession, are indicating that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in the coming months. Bond yields fell to 20-month lows last week after government data showed U.S. job creation slowed more than expected in May.

""I would say that the bond markets are predicting ... a lowering of interest rates,"" Mnuchin said in an interview Sunday on CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia. ""

Mnuchin noted that he did not intend to comment on whether interest rates should be lowered, saying that he wants ""to respect"" the independence of the Federal Reserve. Mnuchin meets weekly with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. On Monday, President Donald Trump told CNBC the Fed made a mistake raising rates in December and is ""very disrputive"" to the economy.

Investor expectations of a June rate cut from the Fed rose last week to 27.5%, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. The market gives July a 79% chance of a Fed rate cut.

Mnuchin said the global economy is now in an environment where ""interest rates are very low around the world,"" which is what investors are ""seeing in the U.S. bond markets."" But the Treasury sees ""no signs of a recession"" in the U.S. economy, Mnuchin said, even as his department is ""somewhat concerned about what we see as a slowdown in Europe, China and other areas of the world.""

Plan to Reclassify Radioactive Nuclear Waste Spurs Anger,https://www.usnews.com,[],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2019-06-10/energy-department-plan-to-reclassify-radioactive-nuclear-waste-spurs-anger,"A welcome sign outside the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, May 10, 2017, in Richland, Wash. (Young Kwak/The Washington Post/Getty Images)

A Department of Energy plan to reclassify some of the country's radioactive waste to lesser threat levels in order to save time and money is angering environmental groups and raising questions among experts.

Last week, the Energy Department put into place its new interpretation for high-level radioactive waste, saying that the updated definition will allow the agency to more easily move less hazardous waste from old nuclear weapons facilities where it has languished without a permanent disposal solution.

The agency's previous classification efforts managed hazardous waste based on how it was produced instead of its radioactivity. For example, the use of uranium fuel in a nuclear reactor produces high-level radioactive waste. Classifications for the waste determine disposal methods, which can vary in things like how deeply such material is buried in the ground or how thick the protective material in which it is encased.

The Energy Department said its past approach cost billions of dollars and led to decades of delays.

""Recognizing this failure, this Administration is proposing a responsible, results-driven solution that will finally open potential avenues for the safe treatment and removal of the lower level waste currently housed in three states,"" the Energy Department's Undersecretary for Science Paul Dabbar said.

By changing the process to allow for some high-level radioactive waste to be categorized as low-level, the agency said it will be able to start moving waste that has been trapped in Energy Department facilities in Washington state, South Carolina and Idaho.

Management of high-level radioactive waste has effectively been at a standstill as Nevada's Yucca Mountain, which houses a deep geological repository storage facility, awaits proper licensing.

Yucca Mountain has suffered from ""technical and political disagreement"" for decades, says Rod Ewing, a professor in nuclear security at Stanford University.

""There's an understandable pressure to do something with at least some of the waste,"" Ewing says.

Under the proposal, waste newly deemed less harmful that is currently housed at Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington state, the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina and the Idaho National Laboratory could be removed for disposal.

But the National Resources Defense Council says reclassifying the waste is akin to the Energy Department giving itself the authority to declare victory and abandon cleanup at these sites.

""The Trump administration is moving to fundamentally alter more than 50 years of national consensus on how the most toxic and radioactive waste in the world is managed and ultimately disposed of,"" Geoff Fettus, a senior attorney at the environmental group, said in a statement. ""No matter what they call it, this waste needs a permanent, well-protected disposal option to guard it for generations to come.""

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said he would not stop state efforts to clean up the Hanford site to a higher standard and challenged the legality of the federal change.

""By taking this action, the administration seeks to cut out state input and move towards disposal options of their choosing, including those already deemed to be unsafe by their own assessments and in violation of the existing legally binding agreement,"" he said. ""We will consider all options to stop this reckless and dangerous action.""

Experts agreed that reclassification is a valid issue for the Energy Department to examine but had questions about the agency's process.

""In principle, it does make sense to try to tie these definitions more closely to hazards,"" says Edwin Lyman, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. However, the agency ""would have to do a much more rigorous job defining their methodology,"" he says.

Determining the class of radioactive waste involves assessments that can be ""highly controversial,"" Ewing says.

The assessment process can allow for some leeway, which ""opens the door for monkey business,"" Lyman says.

The Energy Department paired its announcement with a notice that the agency is starting an environmental impact analysis for an alternative disposal method for low-level radioactive waste at the Savannah River Site.

Tom Clements, the director of non-profit public interest group Savannah River Site Watch, pushed back against the agency's move."

Ken Cuccinelli named acting head of DHS's legal immigration division,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Stephen Dinan']",06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jun/10/ken-cuccinelli-named-acting-head-dhss-legal-immigr/,"Former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli was officially named acting director at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services on Monday, putting him in charge of some of the most important behind-the-scenes immigration initiatives of the Trump administration.

Foremost among his tasks will be to speed changes to a major guest-worker program and to finalize the new “public charge” rules, which are designed to push legal immigrants to prove they can be self-sustaining without becoming dependent on public assistance.

Mr. Cuccinelli, in a statement, pronounced himself “honored” to lead the agency.

“USCIS has the extraordinary responsibility to administer and protect the integrity of our nation’s lawful immigration system,” he said. “Our nation has the most generous legal immigration system in the world and we must zealously safeguard its promise for those who lawfully come here.”

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan announced Mr. Cuccinelli’s accession to the USCIS job in a statement Monday — though there could be some legal hurdles.

Since Mr. Cuccinelli has not been in the agency, Mr. McAleenan created a new deputy position at USCIS and placed it first in the line of succession, giving him a path to be the new director.

Democrats said that was a cheap-shot end run that might not hold up to court scrutiny.

“Once again, this president is trying to circumvent Congress and our Constitution by appointing someone as acting head of an agency who would not be confirmed by the Senate to that post and who is grossly unqualified for it,” said House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer, Maryland Democrat.

Mr. Cuccinelli had been under consideration for a job as immigration “czar” at the White House, but instead President Trump deputed him over to Homeland Security as an adviser.

Now he lands in a specific job, taking over for Director Francis Cissna, who had fallen out of favor with the White House for not moving fast enough on what top White House advisers said were the president’s top priorities.

Democrats saw Mr. Cuccinelli’s appointment as an attempt to undermine the agency.

“Mr. Cuccinelli is an anti-immigrant fringe figure that has no business leading a component that is supposed to administer our nation’s legal immigration system,” said Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, chair of the House Homeland Security Committee.

The Mississippi Democrat predicted Mr. Cuccinelli would be a force for chaos at the agency, undermining its mission.

And he said there’s no chance Mr. Cuccinelli would be confirmed to the position if nominated to it, so it makes no sense to install him as the acting director.

Mr. Thompson didn’t say which Senate Republicans he thinks would oppose Mr. Cuccinelli and thus prevent his confirmation, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell earlier this year told reporters he did not want Mr. Trump to select Mr. Cuccinelli.

Mr. Cuccinelli, as head of a conservative activist organization, backed a challenger to Mr. McConnell in his 2014 election, and in 2017 Mr. Cuccinelli signed onto a letter urging Mr. McConnell to give up the leader’s post.

“America is too good for you to lead it,” Mr. Cuccinelli and fellow conservatives wrote.

Though USCIS gets less attention than the other two immigration agencies, Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, it is instrumental in the enforcement of immigration laws, deciding on legal immigration applications and some visitor visas.

The agency is under fire from Democrats who say that it has slow-walked legal immigration under Mr. Trump, erecting what activists have labeled an “invisible wall” to prevent migration.

Yet USCIS points to increased processing of citizenship applications and to the border crisis, which has spawned a massive surge in asylum petitions, both of which fall to the agency’s officers to adjudicate.

The White House has been demanding stricter asylum standards out of USCIS, saying it could help cut down on the flow of illegal immigrants if it took a more critical eye of the initial claims migrants make at the U.S.-Mexico border.

“One of the biggest frustrations is the fact that USCIS has not been able to change agency culture about ‘credible fear’ and asylum from the Obama years,” a White House official told reporters two months ago, predicting changes at the agency.

Those comments came as Mr. Trump had ousted Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and acting ICE Director Ronald D. Vitiello, seeking a tougher direction from his leaders.

Mr. Cissna survived the initial culling, but White House officials made clear he was on the hot seat.

EPA issues guidance critics say would limit state's authorities over pipeline projects,https://thehill.com,[],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/447782-states-have-shut-down-pipeline-projects-epa-seeks-to-change-that,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a guidance Friday that critics say seeks to limit states’ influence over controversial pipeline projects.

Federal law through the Clean Water Act essentially gives states veto power over large projects that cut through their rivers and streams if they believe those projects would negatively impact their water quality.

Spurred by an April executive order from President Trump Donald John TrumpTop Armed Services Republican plots push for 0B defense budget Amash exits House Freedom Caucus in wake of Trump impeachment stance Amash exits House Freedom Caucus in wake of Trump impeachment stance MORE, the EPA’s guidance encourages states to more quickly process project applications, even if they don’t have all the information yet.

“This seems to be another attempt by the Trump Administration to limit states, and by extension local communities, ability to protect their own waterways and to give pipeline developers or other project proponents an ability to skip over one of the steps in the process that had been there to protect local waterways,” said Nathan Matthews, a senior attorney with the Sierra Club, one of the environmental groups weighing action against the EPA.

The Clean Water Act gives states a year to weigh permits and determine how projects would impact their water, but some feel states have used the process to block major projects.

“I welcome this announcement and hope EPA’s new guidance will reduce abuse of the Clean Water Act to block infrastructure needed to provide reliable and affordable energy,” Sen. Lisa Murkowski Lisa Ann MurkowskiOvernight Energy: Trump appoints Social Security watchdog to also oversee Interior | Critics question EPA guidance on pipelines | Battle over science roils EPA Overnight Energy: Trump appoints Social Security watchdog to also oversee Interior | Critics question EPA guidance on pipelines | Battle over science roils EPA EPA issues guidance critics say would limit state's authorities over pipeline projects MORE (R-Alaska) said of the guidance in a press release. “EPA’s updated guidance will maintain vital protections for our water resources while promoting responsible development of our energy resources.”

The EPA said states should not take more time than is reasonable to review permits, encouraging them to “promptly begin evaluating the request to ensure timely action.”



The guidance says the timeline for reviewing the permits begins as soon as they are filed, and states should not wait for an environmental assessment to be completed as that may take longer than the year states are granted. The guidance also notes that the clock doesn’t stop because states have requested more information.



States have recently sidelined two large projects using the certification process through the Clean Water Act, actions that contradict the energy dominance strategy promoted by the Trump administration.

New York denied a certification for the Constitution Pipeline, a 124-mile natural gas pipeline that would have run from Pennsylvania to New York, crossing rivers more than 200 times. Washington state denied certification for the Millennium Coal Terminal, a shipping port for large stocks of coal.

“The Trump Administration’s attempt to attack our state’s right to protect the health and well-being of our residents, without any consultation with states or tribal governments, is wrong,” Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson said in a statement to The Hill. “It will undermine four decades of state and federal cooperation in environmental stewardship.”

But even states with more conservative leadership have spoken out for maintaining states rights under the law.

“We urge you to direct federal agencies to reject any changes to agency rules, guidance, or policy that may diminish, impair, or subordinate states’ well-established sovereign and statutory authorities to protect water quality within their boundaries,” the Western Governors’ Association wrote in a January letter when the White House was still weighing an executive order.

Matthews said states are likely to have trouble getting the information they need in order to meet the timelines. The lengthy environmental assessment process means pipeline routes or construction plans might change long after they’ve applied for permission from the state. Trying to force states to approve a project before they have that information could backfire, he said.

“States cannot make a decision about whether a project will or won’t comply with state water quality standards until they know where and what rivers it will be crossing,” Matthews said. “If they encourage or later require states to make these decisions before all the information is available, states are going to have to deny these applications without prejudice and encourage them to reapply which could slow everything down rather than speed it up.”

Industry groups voiced support for the EPA guidance, arguing it helped restore the balance between the state and federal government.

“The balance between those roles has been disrupted and some states have viewed Section 401 as means of determining which interstate pipeline projects are in the public interest and which are not,” Don Santa, president of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America, said in a release, referring to the specific portion of the law creating the state certification process.

Environmentalists say they are still weighing what response to take to the guidance, though some say they are more concerned about the coming regulations on the same topic that were also spurred by Trump’s executive order.

“I would say there are several alarming suggestions in this guidance that if taken to their extreme could be very problematic as they play out,” said Moneen Nasmith, an attorney with EarthJustice. “There are a number of places that provide the suggestion that EPA could weigh in in places within the state decisionmaking process that it has never participated in before and doesn’t have the authority to do now.”

She’s concerned the EPA may try to weigh in on what reasons states can give to deny a certification or try to define water quality issues more narrowly, blocking states from weighing certain aspects of projects. Both are things she said EPA is not legally allowed to do.

“I’m worried that in the guidance EPA seems to be contemplating having that kind of role,” she said."
"Daily on Defense: HASC chairman lays down his mark, Republicans cry foul, US-Turkey alliance unwinds over F-35, United Technology and Raytheon join forces",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/house-committee-members-deeply-divided-on-presidents-pentagon-budget-request,"OFF THE MARK: House Armed Services Chairman Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., is drawing clear battle lines with President Trump’s proposed defense budget and its Republican backers in Congress with his “Chairman’s Mark” of the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, released early this morning.

The plan proposed by the House committee controlled by Democrats would trim Trump’s $750 billion request to $733 billion, eliminate funding for low-yield nuclear weapons, bar the use of military construction funds for border barriers, prohibit Trump from pulling U.S. troops out of South Korea or send more prisoners to Guantanamo. Nor would it support a separate Space Force, a top priority for the president.

The plan not only conflicts with the administration’s Pentagon proposal but also the Senate version of the NDAA. That plan, passed with little fanfare by the Senate Armed Services Committee last month, enjoyed bipartisan support.

BY THE NUMBERS: Here’s the House FY 2020 proposal:



Department of Defense base: $632.9 billion

Department of Energy base: $22.6 billion

Other defense-related activities: $0.3 billion

Defense topline: $655.9 billion

Overseas contingency operations: $69 billion

Defense topline: $724.9 billion

Authorizations outside of HASC jurisdiction: $8.2 billion

Total defense authorization: $733 billion

For comparison here are the Senate numbers from two weeks ago:



Department of Defense base: $642.5 billion

Department of Energy base: $23.2 billion

Overseas contingency operations: $75.9 billion

Defense topline: $741.5 billion

Other defense: $8.4 billion

Total defense authorization: $750 billion



BORDER RESTRICTIONS: House Democrats, who have been fuming about President’s Trump’s legal use of emergency powers to divert military construction funds for his border wall, want to specifically bar the practice in the future.

The House NDAA includes a blanket prohibition on the use of DoD, military construction or counter-drug funds to build a “wall, fence, or physical barrier” along the southern border. It also specifically denies $7.2 billion in funding that the Trump administration planned to pay back to the construction fund to make up for the money shifted to border barriers this year.

DEEP PARTISAN DIVIDE: The ranking member on the committee, former chairman Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, weighed in with his objections, noting the move away from what he called the traditional “broad bipartisan support” the NDAA usually enjoys. “There are a number of provisions in the bill that meet that standard,” he said. “There are others that are troubling.”

What troubles Thornberry:



The $17 billion cut from Trump’s budget, which he says doesn’t provide the 3%-5% in real growth to continue readiness restoration

No Space Force, despite bipartisan support on the committee

A $1.2 billion cut in military personnel funds, which he says will hurt service members and their families

Nuclear weapons restrictions. “In addition to prohibiting the deployment of new low-yield weapons, the Chairman’s Mark weakens our deterrent posture against Russia and China and defers essential safety upgrades,” Thornberry says.

A $2.3 billion shortfall in disaster relief funds for Offutt and Tyndall Air Force bases and Marine Corps bases at Cherry Point Camp Lejeune.

Guantanamo restrictions he argues “will ultimately lead to the transfer of current detainees to the U.S.”

Too many reports. The NDAA imposes 240 new reporting requirements, a 34% increase over last year.

The differences will ultimately have to be hammered out in a conference committee.

CAN THIS MARRIAGE BE SAVED? The U.S.-Turkey alliance is being strained to the breaking point over Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s insistence that he should be able to buy both U.S. F-35s and Russian S-400 air defenses.

Friday the U.S. restated its position after learning Turkey had sent personnel to Russia for training on the S-400 system. “The S-400 is incompatible with the F-35,” said Ellen Lord, undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment at Pentagon briefing. “Turkey will not receive the F-35 if Turkey takes delivery of the S-400 system. Thus, we need to begin unwinding Turkey's participation in the F-35 program.”

Lord said Turkey would be disinvited from future program management activities, and she set a deadline of the end of next month for Turkey to capitulate to U.S. demands or be booted from the F-35 program. “If the United States and Turkey cannot reach a mutually agreeable resolution to this issue by July 31, all Turkish F-35 students and instructor pilots currently in the United States will be required to depart the country,” she said. “Turkey will receive no new workshare in the F-35 program. Its current workshare will be transitioned to alternate sources.”

But at the same time, Lord said the U.S. “greatly values,” the “strategic partnership,” with Turkey and is “trying to be respectful,” with the long-time NATO ally. ““None of the steps we are taking are irreversible. If Turkey chooses to forgo delivery of the S-400, we look forward to restoring normal program activity,” she said.

‘A MERGER OF EQUALS’: Raytheon Company and United Technologies Corp announced Sunday they agreed to an all-stock merger that it called “a merger or equals.”

The combined company, which will be named Raytheon Technologies Corporation, will have approximately $74 billion is 2019 sales, which would make it the second-largest defense and aerospace company in the U.S. after Boeing.

“The transaction will create a premier systems provider with advanced technologies to address rapidly growing segments within aerospace and defense,” said a release from the two companies. More on the merger from the Associated Press here.

‘WE’LL DÉMARCHE THEM’: On Friday, acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan called actions of the Russian navy “unsafe and unprofessional,” and said the U.S. would file a formal protest after a Russian destroyer nearly collided with the U.S. guided missile cruiser USS Chancellorsville in international waters in the Philippine Sea.

""We’ll have military-to-military conversations with the Russians, and of course we'll démarche them,” Shanahan said in a brief exchange with reporters at the Pentagon.

The Navy released video Friday of the encounter showing the Russian warship coming within 50 to 100 feet of the American ship, forcing it to reverse its engine to avoid contact with the Russian vessel.

The Navy’s top admiral, John Richardson, chief of naval operations, also released a statement condemning the Russian actions as “irresponsible and reckless.”

""This unwise maneuver, combined with the unsafe maneuvers by the Russian aircraft in the eastern Mediterranean earlier this week, make it clear that these dangerous actions by Russian military forces across the globe do not match what the world expects from a responsible and trustworthy world power,” Richardson said. “The U.S. Navy will not be deterred from supporting the free and open use of the seas and skies where international law clearly allows all to operate.”

55 SYRIAN HOSPITALS BOMBED: The Union of Medical Care and Relief Organization says the Russian-backed air campaign of Syrian leader Bashar Assad against opposition forces in northern Syria has devastated the regions hospital system, causing widespread misery among the civilian population.

“The entire medical system of Northern Hama and Southern Idlib, Syria, is in a state of emergency, with 55 medical facilities shut down after a month of continuous bombing,” said the humanitarian group in a statement. “Since April 28, 25 medical facilities have been bombed, with some hospitals hit by airstrikes on multiple days. “

“In a region of Southern Idlib, only one hospital is left serving a population of over 500,000. The use of phosphorous (incendiary weapons) and barrel bombs in addition to airstrikes has created an apocalyptic landscape for civilians,” the statement continues. “UOSSM staff on the ground in conjunction with local health directorates report 347 civilians have been killed (including at least 75 children), over 1,000 have been injured and 400,000 IDPs displaced by bombardment on civilian areas.”

RECRUITING BY TWITTER: The RAND Corporation is out with a new report that finds while the Army’s @GoArmy’s Twitter feed helps build awareness of Army culture, it’s not so great at convincing young people to join up.

The report, “Social Media and the Army: Implications for Outreach and Recruiting,” analyzes social media and the Army web presence to see if and how potential recruits and others are engaging.

RAND found that GoArmy.com visitors are interested in career information and the site is used more intensively in densely populated areas and in immigrant and ethnic communities.

It called @GoArmy’s Twitter feed “a good source for building awareness of Army culture,” but concluded the platform appears to be less effective at producing recruits.

And it said GoArmy’s Facebook page “has an audience made up of the general public, soldiers, veterans, military families and potential recruits – and has substantial potential for creating a positive image of an Army career for precisely the people who are in a position to influence recruits.”

ARCTIC STRATEGY: The Pentagon has released updated Arctic Strategy in a report sent to Congress last week. The mission statement says the desired end-state for the Arctic is “a secure and stable region in which U.S. national security interests are safeguarded, the U.S. homeland is defended, and nations work cooperatively to address shared challenges.”

The strategy outlines three objectives:



Building Arctic awareness

Enhancing Arctic operations

Strengthening the rules-based order in the Arctic

NO CASUATIES IN NIGER BOMBING: A U.S. military vehicle struck a roadside bomb in Niger while on the way to a training exercise Saturday, but the U.S. Africa Command says all of the soldiers inside survived the attack.

“There are no reported U.S. casualties, however, as a precaution, U.S. service members are being evaluated,” AFRICOM said in a statement.

The U.S. troops were riding in a Mine Resistant Ambush Protected All-Terrain Vehicle when it triggered an improvised explosive device while entering a firing range in the vicinity of Ouallam, Niger.

U.S. forces are in the north-central African country assisting Nigerien troops in their fight against violent extremist groups like Boko Haram.

CADET IDENTIFIED: West Point has identified the cadet killed in last Thursday’s military vehicle accident. ""Cadet Christopher J. Morgan, Class of 2020, died due to injuries sustained from a military vehicle accident in the U.S. Military Academy’s training area,"" the school said in a press release.

Morgan, 22, of West Orange, N.J., was a Law and Legal Studies major and was part of the Army Wrestling Team.

""Cadet Morgan was a valued member of the Corps of Cadets and will be missed by all. The entire community is ensuring that our cadets are being cared for physically, emotionally, and spiritually,” Superintendent Lt. Gen. Darryl Williams said. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the Morgan family.”

Private attorney and GOP activist Brady Toensing is leaving Vermont to take a senior counsel position with the U.S. Department of Justice. He starts work for the Office of Legal Policy Monday.

Toensing, 51, announced his resignation as vice chair of the Vermont Republican Party on May 23. An activist lawyer, advocate for open government and head of President Donald Trump’s Vermont campaign committee in 2016, Toensing has long been a thorn in the side of moderate Republicans, iconoclastic lefty U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders and the Democratic establishment in Vermont.

Get all of VTDigger's daily news. You'll never miss a story with our daily headlines in your inbox.

“We are going to miss Vermont, but I am excited to be joining the Department of Justice in a dream job and under the leadership of Attorney General Bill Barr,” Toensing said in an email. “Our youngest is graduating from high school this week, so the timing is pretty good.”

Deb Billado, chair of the Vermont Republican Party, said his seat will remain vacant until the party reorganizes in November. “It’s certainly an opportunity that doesn’t come along every day for lawyer and I’m excited for him,” Billado said.

Toensing and Billado have been Trump stalwarts, pushing away moderate Republican Party members, including Gov. Phil Scott who has rebuffed many of the president’s policies.

Toensing’s connection to Trump runs deep. Last year the president considered retaining Toensing’s mother and stepfather, prominent conservative D.C. attorneys Victoria Toensing and Joseph diGenova, to be part of his team handling the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller.

Over the past five years, Toensing has fought with the state’s most prominent politicians in the press and the courts over the state’s gun laws, climate change initiatives, accusations of campaign finance abuse and the state’s refusal to produce public records. He also waded into public pissing matches with U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, Gov. Peter Shumlin, and former Vermont Attorney General William Sorrell, accusing them of misconduct.

TJ Donovan, who took Sorrell’s place when he was elected Vermont attorney general in 2016, says Toensing has been a worthy adversary. Donovan appointed him to the Vermont Campaign Finance Task Force in 2017.

VTDigger is underwritten by:

“I said to him I hope you’re not leaving Vermont for good, that we need lawyers like Brady in our state,” Donovan said in an interview Monday. “He can be a pain in the butt no doubt, but he holds government officials accountable — he was a worthy adversary, he was tough, he was dogged and he was fair.”

“Brady and I have been fighting for the past three years so my sense is our fights will continue,” Donovan said. “But I also think it’s useful, I will have somebody I can call and have a reasonable conversation with — I anticipate calling upon Brady as issues arise … I have respect for his legal acumen and his integrity.”

Others on the left of the political spectrum weren’t as generous in their appraisal of Toensing’s contributions to the legal and political landscape.

State Sen. Chris Pearson, P/D-Chittenden, who was the subject of one of Toensing’s several campaign finance complaints leveled at liberals, said “he really does epitomize the modern Republican ethic of winning at all costs.”

“I know how hard it is to recruit people to run for office and to serve and when they look at the kind of harassment that can entail at the hands of people like Brady Toensing that discourages more people from being engaged,” Pearson said. “At the same time he’s vigorously defended transparency and the public’s right to know, there’s a tension there I think.”

Most recently, Toensing served as local counsel in a case brought by the National Rifle Association against the state of Vermont over the constitutionality of a new magazine limit put in place last year as part of sweeping reforms to the state’s gun laws.

Toensing won a landmark First Amendment case in 2018. The Vermont Supreme Court ruling set a new precedent making the private emails of officials pertaining to government business subject to public records requests. In that lawsuit, the Charlotte attorney represented the interests of the Free Market Environmental Law Clinic and the Energy and Environment Legal Institute, conservative groups funded by the Koch brothers, that were seeking information about a group of state attorneys general offices — including Vermont’s — investigating Exxon Mobil’s alleged early knowledge and longtime denials of climate change.

Toensing is perhaps best known for his 2016 letter to the U.S. Department of Justice alleging that Sanders pressured People’s United Bank to issue a loan requested by his wife, Jane Sanders, the former president of Burlington College, for the purchase of the former Roman Catholic Diocese of Burlington headquarters on Lake Champlain. Last fall, the Vermont U.S. Attorney’s Office dropped an investigation into whether Jane Sanders overstated donor pledges used as collateral for the loan.

Toensing also went after then-Vermont Attorney General William Sorrell in 2015 for alleged campaign finance violations when he accepted $200,000 from a PAC set up by the Democratic Attorneys General Association in his 2012 primary against Donovan. Sorrell was accused of improperly coordinating with the PAC. A special investigator found in 2017 that DAGA — not Sorrell — ran afoul of Vermont campaign finance rules.

When former Gov. Peter Shumlin came under criticism for taking advantage of his neighbor Jeremy Dodge in East Montpelier, Toensing represented Dodge pro bono and helped him reclaim his land.

And then there were the campaign finance cases.

When Sanders promoted former staffer Pearson’s campaign for the state Senate in an email to supporters in 2016, Toensing cried foul. He alleged that the email was an in-kind contribution that generated an $80,000 windfall from 12,000 Sanders fans and therefore violated campaign finance laws.

In 2011, Toensing defended former Republican Lt. Gov. Brian Dubie when he was accused of misusing campaign finance laws by allegedly coordinated with the Republican Governors Association on a poll. In a settlement, Dubie paid $10,000 to the state and $10,000 to the Vermont Foodbank. The RGA settled for $30,000.

Toensing holds an undergraduate degree and obtained a juris doctorate from Georgetown University in 1996. He worked for U.S. Sen. Warren Rudman after law school and then went into private practice. Toensing has represented plaintiffs and defendants in gender discrimination cases, and CIA and FBI employees in internal hearings and investigations, according to a bio on his law firm’s website.

Since 2010, he has represented the former president of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International through multiple lawsuits involving allegations of international money laundering and bank fraud.

His mother, Victoria Toensing, and his stepfather, Joseph DiGenova, are prominent conservative Washington lawyers and fierce advocates for Trump. A recent Politico piece characterized the “husband and wife duo” as the staunchest defenders of the president on TV. Toensing and DiGenova were such a dominant media presence in the Lewinsky affair that Washington Post dubbed them the “Power Couple at the Scandal’s Vortex.”

Treasury yields rise after Trump suspends tariffs on Mexico,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/10/us-treasury-yields-tick-higher-as-trump-suspends-tariffs-on-mexico.html,"At around 4:04 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note , which moves inversely to price, was higher at around 2.143%, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was also higher at around 2.621%.

U.S. government debt yields rose Monday after President Donald Trump said U.S. tariffs on goods from Mexico would be suspended.

U.S. President Donald Trump announced Sunday that proposed tariffs on Mexican imports would be suspended indefinitely. Trump said in a Twitter post Sunday that he has ""full confidence"" that Mexico will crack down on migration from Central America, after the two neighbors reached a consensus. The New York Times reported Saturday that the deal to avert tariffs largely comprised actions Mexico had already agreed to take.

Meanwhile, investors will be watching trade developments between the U.S. and China ahead of a key meeting between the leaders of the two countries. Speaking to CNBC on Sunday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said President Trump will decide about further Chinese tariffs after he meets his Chinese counterpart later this month."
Justice Department strikes deal to give House Democrats evidence obtained by Robert Mueller,https://www.salon.com,[],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.salon.com/2019/06/10/justice-department-strikes-deal-to-give-house-democrats-evidence-obtained-by-robert-mueller/,"The Department of Justice has agreed to provide Congress with some evidence collected by Robert Mueller that could zero in on possible obstruction of justice by President Donald Trump, the House Judiciary Committee announced Monday.

The exact scope of the material the Justice Department has agreed to turn over was not immediately clear.

""These documents will allow us to perform our constitutional duties and decide how to respond to the allegations laid out against the president by the special counsel,"" Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., the committee chairman, said in a statement.

Nadler said he expected the department to begin sharing some of the material later Monday and noted that all members of the panel would be able to view the documents privately.

The development marks an unexpected breakthrough in the negotiations between the House Judiciary Committee and the White House over access to evidence obtained by Mueller throughout his nearly two-year investigation into Russian election interference in the 2016 election, alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Moscow and whether the president obstructed justice.

Discussions between the Trump administration and the House Judiciary panel appeared to come to a halt last month after the committee voted along party lines to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress for failing to comply with a subpoena to turn over Mueller's full report and underlying evidence — material which members of the House Judiciary Committee said they need to conduct an obstruction of justice investigation into the president. Trump also asserted executive privilege over Mueller's findings on the attorney general's recommendation.

Nadler's announcement comes a day before the House is scheduled to vote on a resolution on whether to hold Barr and White House counsel Don McGahn in contempt of Congress for defying congressional subpoenas related to Mueller's report. He said Monday that he would ""hold the criminal contempt proceedings in abeyance for now.""

If the Justice Department, Nadler added that ""proceeds in good faith, and we are able to obtain everything that we need, then there will be no need to take further steps."" But, if important information is held back, he said, ""we will have no choice but to enforce our subpoena in court and consider other remedies.""

Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, praised the Justice Department for turning over the documents, which he said ""debunks"" claims the White House is stalling Congress in their oversight efforts.

""The Justice Department has yet again offered accommodations to House Democrats, and I am glad Chairman Nadler — for the first time in months — has finally met them at the negotiating table,"" Collins said in a statement. ""In light of today's agreement from the Justice Department, it's logical to ask: Is the chairman prepared to rescind his baseless recommendation to hold the attorney general in contempt, or do House Democrats still plan to green-light lawsuits against the attorney general and former White House counsel tomorrow?"""
State Dept. denies embassies’ requests to fly rainbow pride flag on official flagpoles,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/state-dept-denies-embassies-requests-fly-rainbow-pride/story?id=63566900,"The State Department has denied multiple U.S. diplomatic posts' requests to fly the rainbow pride flag on official flagpoles during LGBT Pride Month, according to two State Department sources.

The decision is the latest in a string of moves by the agency under Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's tenure that LGBT rights activists say discriminate against the community.

Among the U.S. missions overseas that were denied are Brazil, Germany, Israel, and Latvia, one source told ABC News.

The denials fly in the face of the spirit of President Donald Trump's stated push to launch ""a global campaign to decriminalize homosexuality."" While the president tweeted last Friday that the White House would ""celebrate LGBT Pride Month and recognize the outstanding contributions LGBT people have made to our great Nation"" -– making him the first Republican president to do so – his administration has not proclaimed June as LGBT Pride Month.

Jack Guez/AFP/Getty Images, FILE

Pride flags can be displayed elsewhere on a U.S. mission's grounds, but not the official flagpole, according to department guidance distributed in May. Flying any special flag on the official flagpole at a US diplomatic post overseas requires special permission, per the department's Foreign Affairs Manual.

The denial to the U.S. embassy in Germany is particularly striking since Trump's envoy to Berlin is Richard Grenell, one of the highest-ranking openly gay officials in the administration.

""The President's recognition of Pride Month and his tweet encouraging our decriminalization campaign gives me even more pride to once again march in the Berlin Pride parade, hang a huge banner on the side of the Embassy recognizing our pride, host multiple events at the Embassy and the residence, and fly the gay pride flag,"" Grenell told NBC News, which was first to report on the denials.

In 2016, the Obama administration granted ""blanket written authorization from the Under Secretary for Management to display the pride flag on the external-facing flagpole"" during June, according to a cable sent at the time. But that permission was rescinded under the Trump administration, and individual posts had to request permission to fly the pride flag.

In previous years, an official cable was sent from Washington with guidance on how to mark LGBT Pride month and International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia.

But this year, Pompeo did not approve the cable and instead, the department sent guidance to posts via email that noted it would not transmit an [an official cable for and International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia] and LGBT Pride Month this year.""

That meant embassies and consulates could still mark both with whatever actions they wanted. But they were not given encouragement as in years past to engage in outreach with local LGBT communities, and they had to again get permission to fly the Pride flag on the official flagpole.

This time, those requests were denied, the sources said. The State Department has not responded to requests for comment.

LGBT rights activists expressed concern last week after news broke that the State Department was planning to convene a new commission on human rights that was based on ""natural law"" -- often taken to mean a religiously-based interpretation that excludes LGBT rights.

The author of the commission's concept paper is Robert George, a prominent anti-LGBT academic who created the National Organization for Marriage, a source told ABC News.

The department has also come under fire from Congress for a policy that does not automatically grant birthright citizenship to U.S. citizens' children who are born abroad through assisted reproductive technology, which lawmakers say indiscriminately affects gay and lesbian couples.

Under State Department policy, children born overseas must be the biological child of a U.S. citizen to receive citizenship at birth. But citizenship will not be granted to the child if it is born through in vitro fertilization and surrogacy and the genetic parent is not a U.S. citizen, even if the couple is legally married.

In several cases, the children of same-sex couples have had their citizenship denied or delayed even though at least one parent is a U.S. citizen. The State Department is currently fighting lawsuits from two couples on this issue.

Nearly 20 Democratic senators and 80 House members signed two letters to Pompeo Thursday demanding he reverse the policy."
Battle over science roils EPA,https://thehill.com,[],06-09-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/447520-battle-over-science-roils-epa,"Environmental Protection Agency is battling its own board of science advisers over its controversial plan to dismiss certain types of scientific research from consideration when issuing rules.

A meeting this week between the agency and some of the nation’s top scientists highlighted the growing rift between the EPA and the scientific community, with members of the Science Advisory Board (SAB) pushing back on the administration's efforts to bar consideration of studies that don't make their underlying data public.

Critics say the move would omit important research from EPA consideration and lead to a dramatic rollback of existing regulations.

The SAB, a team of more than 40 of the nation’s top scientists, have been asking to weigh in on the controversial proposal since it was unveiled more than a year ago.

On Wednesday, it said it would do so —despite a request from the agency to review a narrow portion of the rule.

There’s mistrust between the scientific community and EPA’s leaders in the Trump administration.

Then-EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott PruittOvernight Energy: Trump appoints Social Security watchdog to also oversee Interior | Critics question EPA guidance on pipelines | Battle over science roils EPA Overnight Energy: Trump appoints Social Security watchdog to also oversee Interior | Critics question EPA guidance on pipelines | Battle over science roils EPA Battle over science roils EPA MORE said the proposal, called Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science, would battle “secret science” when it was first introduced. That spurred scientists to call the proposal “censored science.”

EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerOvernight Energy: Trump appoints Social Security watchdog to also oversee Interior | Critics question EPA guidance on pipelines | Battle over science roils EPA Overnight Energy: Trump appoints Social Security watchdog to also oversee Interior | Critics question EPA guidance on pipelines | Battle over science roils EPA Battle over science roils EPA MORE on Wednesday appeared before the board, vowing to improve the relationship between it and the agency.

“I’ll be the first to admit that we have not utilized you in ways that we should. We can and we will do better,” Wheeler said.

But many in the science and environmental community walked away from the meeting disheartened at what they see is the agency’s plan to amplify pet policies and the voices of industry over those from scientists.

“I would say the way that the meeting proceeded kind of contradicted a lot of Administrator Wheeler’s statement at the beginning of the meeting,” said Genna Reed, lead science and policy analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists. “Their discussion showed that EPA has not really involved the Science Advisory Board and gotten their advice on several of the deregulatory actions they’ve proposed.”

Scientists have had a number of concerns over how the Trump administration values science, but things really came to a head when the EPA announced the science transparency rule without first consulting the SAB.

The group didn’t find out about the rule until it was publicly announced — a sign, scientists and environmentalists say, the EPA was not interested in meaningful feedback.

The proposal has since proven to be one of the most controversial EPA has written, prompting 600,000 comments. Critics say the rule will exclude some of the most important research from consideration simply because it does not rely on data that can be shared publicly.

The board sent a letter in May of 2018 with a number of questions and asking to weigh in on the rule but it took almost 11 months before the agency responded in April of this year.

Wheeler apologized for the delay Wednesday, saying it was the result of the agency taking time to rethink how it wants to work with the board going forward.

He asked the board to give its thoughts on how the agency can deal with studies that don’t make their data public because it includes confidential business information or personally identifiable information.

The board bucked that request and instead voted to review the proposal in its entirety.

“I’m wondering if any of the comments the EPA received gave you pause about proceeding with that rule?” asked Barbara Morrissey, chair of a separate EPA panel, the Children’s Health Protection Advisory Committee.

“I agree the confidentiality issue in an important and a thorny one so I’m glad that you referred that to us, but I’m concerned about whether the best available science can be ignored because it can’t be replicated for obvious reasons,” she said, nodding to studies of people who were exposed to harmful chemicals.

Watchers of the board were surprised by the vote given how the makeup of the board has changed under the Trump administration.

Fears that the EPA planned to sideline scientists started under Pruitt when he announced that scientists who receive grants from the EPA would not be allowed to serve on the board—a move that knocked out about half of the members sitting on the Science Advisory Board.

Reed with the Union of Concerned Scientists said there are pretty much two types of grants available to scientists—those from the EPA and those from industry. She didn’t understand why getting an EPA grant would present a conflict of interest when an industry grant wouldn’t.

“People who received these no strings attached grants and are experts on some of the most pressing environmental issues are kept from serving on the board,” she said. “It’s clearly a political maneuver to change the composition of these advisory committees.”

Twenty six of the 45 current board members were appointed during the Trump Administration, a huge amount of turnover in a board that otherwise loses under a fifth of its members each year due to term limits.

“I was pleasantly surprised,” Chris Zarba, who served as the former staff coordinators for SAB until last year, said of the vote to review the entire science transparency rule. It’s not that the Trump administration picks aren’t qualified, he said, but a good board needs diversity.

“Think of it this way. If I was picking a world class football team, and I only picked people that were world class, top-ranked players — if all those people I picked were field goal kickers, I’d never win a game,” he said. “It’s hard to question any single member on the board, and by law the administrator can pick anyone they want and any member that is qualified, but the bigger question is: is the entire team well equipped and accurately representing mainstream science? I think we will see how it turns out...There are certainly picks I wouldn't have recommended to the administrator.”

Robert Phalen is one Trump administration pick that has been questioned by scientists for views of air pollution that are out of line with most mainstream scientists. The University of California Irvine professor told the American Association for the Advancement of Science that “modern air is a little too clean for optimum health.""

Phalen was one of the few at the meeting to vote against reviewing the science transparency rule in its entirety.

“I can see and respect both sides of the debate on transparency,” he told The Hill in an email. “We need to know if the research used for regulations is free of serious errors, and that requires other scientists having access to the data. On the other hand if the data were widely available it could be improperly used, such as for disclosing private information. So both sides have validity.”

Wheeler said the agency will move forward with something, assuring the board that the administrator will always have the power to give an exemption to an important study, even if it can’t disclose all its data.

“I do fundamentally believe the more information we put out to the public as far as what is the basis for our regulatory decisions, the more sound our decision will be and the more easily understood and accepted by the public our decision will be because they see all the science we are using,” he told the board."

Lawyers for the House of Representatives are pushing back on the Justice Department's decision to walk away from a statute barring female genital mutilation — and an unusual argument that lawmakers shouldn't intervene to defend the interests of Congress in the case.

The fight is unfolding over the first federal criminal prosecution for female genital mutilation.

Last year, a judge in Michigan threw out charges against several women who had their daughters circumcised. The Justice Department notified Congress it would not appeal that decision because of constitutional considerations.

Solicitor General Noel Francisco wrote to Congress in April to say female genital mutilation should be ""universally condemned"" but that DOJ had ""reluctantly determined"" it lacked a ""reasonable defense"" of the law following Supreme Court rulings in other cases.

In stepped the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown University Law Center, which is working with Congress to mount a defense of the statute. The lawyers argued Congress has an interest in the enforcement and defense of the laws it has passed.

The ICAP lawyers were surprised, though, to face opposition from the Justice Department, which only once before has opposed moves by the House and Senate to weigh in on legal disputes.

""It's deeply concerning to see the Justice Department abandoning its defense of this important federal law,"" said Joshua Geltzer, the executive director of ICAP.

""It's further concerning to see the department resisting even the effort by the House of Representatives to offer its own defense of the law it helped to enact. The court should reject the department's effort and at a minimum hear the House's arguments in defense of the statute.""

ICAP is arguing that it wants to weigh in to support the law — which made it a crime to ""knowingly"" circumcise young women who have not yet reached the age of 18 — not to try to force the Justice Department to proceed with a criminal prosecution.

Four of the eight people who were originally charged in Michigan face other criminal allegations, including obstruction of justice.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that half a million women and girls inside the U.S. have suffered genital mutilation or are at risk in the future.

Congress outlawed it, but the Justice Department's Office of Legislative Affairs earlier this year asked Congress to amend that existing law to make clear that it applies to travel between states and when payments or offers are made in connection with the circumcision.

The issue is now before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, which covers territory that includes Michigan.

DOJ distance from Congress

DOJ's position in the female genital mutilation case followed closely behind its refusal to defend President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy legislation, the Affordable Care Act.

In practice, the Justice Department routinely defends legislation passed by Congress so long as there are reasonable arguments that are lawful.

Attorney General William Barr and lawyers inside the White House opposed the decision to walk away from the defense of the health care law, but they were overruled by President Trump.

Democrats in Congress and on the campaign trail have criticized that move. But Barr appeared unbothered about their concerns in testimony earlier this year — if the law is sound, they shouldn't be bothered, he said.

""You say that administration's position is hokey and then you say the sky is falling?"" the attorney general said. ""If this was such a hokey position to take, what are you worried about?"""
"Mnuchin says no to 'recap and release' plan for Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac",https://www.americanbanker.com,[],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.americanbanker.com/articles/mnuchin-says-no-to-recap-and-release-plan-for-fannie-mae-freddie-mac,"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin made clear that freeing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from U.S. control won’t happen without a major overhaul of the nation’s housing finance system, potentially dashing investors’ hopes that they might soon make a windfall from their stakes in the mortgage giants.

In a June 8 interview, Mnuchin was adamant that the Trump administration won’t just let Fannie and Freddie build up their capital buffers and then release the companies. He also said he backed a key reform that can only be implemented by Congress, casting doubt on how ambitious the administration will be absent a legislative fix.

“What we’re not going to do is business as usual with no changes, just recapitalize them and float them,” said Mnuchin, referring to a possible public offering of Fannie and Freddie shares. “There needs to be housing reform as part of this.”

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also backed an explicit government guarantee for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, something that would require legislation. Bloomberg News

The comments appear to push back a process known as recap and release, which would consist of bolstering Fannie and Freddie’s ability to absorb losses and then returning them to exclusively private shareholder ownership. Hedge funds have long seen a quick recap and release as the fastest and simplest way to mint fortunes off their investments in the companies, partly because it can be done without the involvement of lawmakers.

Mnuchin’s remarks also underscore that despite the administration’s determination, solving the biggest outstanding issue from the 2008 financial crisis is easier said than done.

The companies were seized by regulators and bailed out by taxpayers during the housing market collapse, ultimately getting $191.5 billion in aid. They have returned to profitability and returned to the government more in dividend payments than they got in bailout funds.

President Trump has ordered the Treasury Department to come up with a proposal for ending the Fannie and Freddie conservatorships, and that plan could be released within weeks, people familiar with the matter have said.

While Fannie and Freddie don’t make loans, they are crucial to keeping the nation’s housing-finance system humming. That’s because they buy mortgages from lenders and package the debt into bonds that are sold to investors with guarantees of interest and principal. The process makes homes more affordable, while keeping the mortgage market liquid.

Mnuchin, during the interview along the sidelines of a finance ministers’ summit in Japan, added that he would prefer an explicit government backstop of Fannie and Freddie securities. That would make the debt incredibly safe in the minds of bond investors, even if the two companies were released from conservatorship. While many housing-finance policy changes can be made administratively, an explicit U.S. guarantee can only be created by Congress.

Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Mark Calabria, Fannie and Freddie’s independent regulator, has said that such a guarantee is not a prerequisite for the companies to be freed. But Treasury and the FHFA would have to agree on major parts of any plan that releases the companies without the involvement of lawmakers.

Stefanie Johnson, an FHFA spokeswoman, declined to comment.

“It is as if Mnuchin is the good cop and Calabria is the bad cop,” said Ed Mills, policy analyst at Raymond James. “It’s clearly preferable to have a legislative solution with an explicit guarantee as it relates to limiting any disruption to the housing system. However, it is unclear if Congress is going to act unless they are pressured into feeling that they will have executive action without them.”

Lawmakers have failed for more than a decade to agree to an overhaul of Fannie and Freddie. While they are now making a renewed push, reaching a deal seems challenging considering the level of congressional partisanship.

One of the biggest questions about Fannie and Freddie’s potential exit from conservatorship is how they would raise enough capital to withstand a financial calamity, which both Mnuchin and Calabria have said is a precondition to the companies being released. Regulators have indicated that the amount they’d need might exceed $200 billion. Right now, each company is restricted to capital cushion of $3 billion.

While Calabria has said the he thinks a public offering of Fannie and Freddie shares will likely be necessary, Mnuchin suggested in the interview that private money could also be used.

“Could be IPO, could be private capital, there are lots of ways of doing it, but ultimately it would need a combination of retention and capital raise,” he said.

A stock sale would not only likely be the largest in history, but also one of the most complex, considering the conservatorships and because Treasury owns nearly 80% of Fannie and Freddie’s senior preferred shares. Mills said such an offering would likely be at least three to four years away, because of all the steps involved.

Separately, sources within the Justice Department confirmed to Fox News that Barr has met “on multiple occasions in recent weeks” with John Durham, who was in Washington, D.C., this month.

DEMS UNVEIL CONTEMPT RESOLUTION FOR BARR, MCGAHN

Fox News has learned that Durham has been getting briefed on the “four corners” of the investigations into the FBI's use of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants, among other issues. Barr appointed Durham, 68, last month.

News of Durham's high level of engagement in the probe comes days after Barr said he has not received answers from the intelligence community that were ""at all satisfactory"" in the early stages of his review into the origins of the Russia investigation.

""In fact probably have more questions, and some of the facts that I've learned don't hang together with the official explanations of what happened,"" Barr told CBS News in an interview.

Durham is specifically reviewing the FISA warrant obtained by the FBI to surveil former Trump aide Carter Page, as well as general issues relating to surveillance during the 2016 campaign and matters flowing from the FISA process. Fox News is told Durham would handle the prosecution of any criminal action he might uncover.

During the CBS interview, Barr revealed Durham picked up the FISA and surveillance components from Utah U.S. Attorney John Huber, whose work was put on hold pending DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz's findings from his ongoing review. Huber, Barr said, “was essentially on standby” in case Horowitz “referred a matter to him to be handled criminally.”

Horowitz's investigation is expected to be completed shortly.

Before the 2016 midterm elections, sources tell Fox News, Republicans who controlled key House committees sought to “tee up” potential targets for future investigation.

They pointed in particular to the apparent conflict in testimony between the co-founder of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, Glenn Simpson, and DOJ official Bruce Ohr. Fusion GPS was retained by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC), which in turn hired British ex-spy Christopher Steele to write the infamous dossier that the FBI relied on in its FISA application to surveil Page.

Simpson testified to the House Intelligence Committee that he contacted Ohr about the largely discredited dossier after Thanksgiving 2016, but Ohr’s records point to contact months earlier, in August. Bruce Ohr became a backchannel for Steele to the FBI in the fall of 2016 after the bureau fired the ex-spy over contacts with the media.

Last month, Republican Rep. Mark Meadows made a criminal referral for Ohr’s wife, Nellie, who worked for Fusion GPS. Nellie did extensive opposition research on Trump family members and campaign aides while working for Fusion GPS, according to a transcript of her closed-door interview with Congress.

""During her transcribed interview, Ms. Ohr testified she 'would not have any knowledge of what [was] going on in an ongoing investigation' at DOJ and would not 'have any knowledge of the Department of Justice’s investigations on Russia.' Ms. Ohr also denied she shared her research on Russian organized crime and Donald Trump with individuals outside of Fusion GPS (her employer); her husband, DOJ attorney Bruce Ohr, and Christopher Steele,"" Meadows' referral stated.

""However, documents reviewed by our committees raise concerns Ms. Ohr not only had knowledge of an ongoing DOJ investigation, but that she shared information and research on Russian organized crime to assist DOJ, in direct contradiction with her testimony."""
The White House reportedly blocked climate testimony warning of a 'possibly catastrophic' future because it didn't 'jibe' with Trump's policy,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Aria Bendix'],06-08-2019,2019,6,https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-blocked-climate-testimony-trump2019-6,"The White House is engaged in a war of words about climate change.

Last Wednesday, Rod Schoonover, a senior analyst at the US State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, was barred from submitting his written assessment of the effects of a warming world to the House Intelligence Committee, the Washington Post reported.

Schoonover was scheduled to testify on behalf of the bureau at a climate change hearing held on June 5. Though he was permitted to speak in person, his office's written statement was blocked by White House officials, who thought his scientific claims contradicted the policies of the Trump administration.

In his written testimony, Schoonover predicted that the ""the compounded effects of climate change"" would produce ""significant,"" ""possibly catastrophic,"" harm to the planet. The ability to prevent this future, he wrote, will depend partly on humanity's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

A White House aide told the Washington Post that the testimony didn't ""jibe"" with the administration's official stance on climate change.

The testimony was reportedly opposed by members of the White House's Office of Legislative Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, and National Security Council, including William Happer, a National Security Council senior director. Happer, who was dismissed from his post at the Department of Energy in 1993, has stated that most of Earth's warming ""has probably been due to natural causes.""

Before the White House barred Schoonover's written testimony, the Bureau of Intelligence and Research reportedly refused a request from the Trump administration to eliminate certain scientific claims.

Here are a few claims from the written document, first obtained by the Washington Post:

Extreme high temperatures are increasing worldwide, and will continue to increase, due ""largely"" to greenhouse gas emissions.

Today's levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere haven't been seen in ""at least 800,000 years.""

Oceans are becoming more acidic due to increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

Climate change will amplify ""stresses"" such as droughts, floods, and fires.

The effects of climate change could undermine trade routes, the global economy, and the world's food supply.

Climate change will ""almost certainly"" threaten national security in the coming decades.

The crackdown on Schoonover's testimony reflects a larger effort on behalf of the Trump administration to police government reports related to climate change.

In May, the New York Times reported that the administration planned to prevent the federally-funded National Climate Assessment from outlining the ""worst-case scenarios"" if climate change went unchecked.

The Times also reported that the White House aimed to prevent the US Geological Survey from making climate predictions beyond 2040. Scientists expect the worst effects of global emissions to manifest after that time period.

Re “Elizabeth Warren Wants Congress to Ensure Presidents Can Be Indicted” (nytimes.com, May 31 ):

Contrary to Senator Warren’s view, the mere fact that the current occupant of the White House has engaged in deplorable, and perhaps criminal, conduct provides no basis for revoking the Justice Department’s longstanding rule that a sitting president cannot be indicted.

Senator Warren’s desire to use the criminal justice system against a president the Democrats find objectionable is shortsighted: Given our polarized times, if she were to succeed, it would surely not be long before we would see efforts to use the same tool against a Democratic president.

Moreover, the Justice Department policy, which has remained in force through Democratic and Republican administrations alike, is firmly rooted in the constitutional provision establishing impeachment as the course for dealing with presidential misconduct.

Lastly, as a practical matter, it is likely that the Supreme Court rues the day that it naïvely ruled, in Clinton v. Jones, that a sitting president can simultaneously handle his or her constitutional duties and defend against civil litigation. We saw how the Paula Jones litigation consumed President Bill Clinton’s second term, and having to defend against criminal charges would surely hamstring President Trump to a far greater degree."

ATCHISON, Kan. -- Most history classes teach Zachary Taylor was the 12th U.S. president and Harry Truman was the only president from Missouri.

But a pair of historical markers in Plattsburg, Missouri, and a museum in Atchison, Kansas, tell a different story.

People pass by the towering statue outside the Clinton County Courthouse every day. Few people recognize it as David Rice Atchison, and likely fewer understand the plaque below that declares him ""President of the United States for one day.""

""He was this vital important pre-Civil War person that pretty much vanished off the pages of history,"" said Chris Taylor, Atchison County Historical Society executive director.

But on March 4, 1849, Atchison was the nation`s highest ranking elected official sworn into office.

The nation's 11th president, James Polk's term had expired, and the President-elect, Zachary Taylor, refused to be inaugurated on a Sunday.

Atchison of Missouri had just been named president pro tempore of the U.S. Senate.

""In 1849, there was no pressing thing that would happen. Today, if we didn't have a president for 24 hours, the whole world would be in total chaos,"" Taylor said.

The Atchison County Historical Society Museu boasts ""The World's Smallest Presidential Library.""

In its Hall of Presidents, Atchison is placed between Polk and Taylor and proclaimed ""The Real 12th President."" It features a 1849 newspaper article from Washington D.C.'s National Intelligencer that explained how Atchison may have accidentally become president for a day.

The museum asks visitors to vote in a 1850s Kansas ballot box what they'd do if they were president for a day.

So how did Atchison spend it? After being up for dozens of hours signing final presidential orders that had to pass through the Senate from the previous term, he mostly slept.

""His friends started showing up to wake him up to be appointed as ministers to different countries or part of his 24-hour cabinet, so people realized this odd thing was happening,"" Taylor said.

Atchison never gained the official title of vice president either, but would serve in the de-facto capacity under two presidents because of deaths in office. He'd retire from politics shortly after Atchison, Kansas, was named for him, on the losing side of the debate whether Kansas should be admitted as a slave or free state.

A marker next to his Plattsburg, Missouri, grave declares him ""President for a Day."" Memoirs say he'd often boast after his odd attachment to history that he had ""the honestest administration in the U.S.""

Since 1849, whenever Inauguration Day has fallen on a Sunday, the president has been sworn in privately, and then had a formal public ceremony the following day."
