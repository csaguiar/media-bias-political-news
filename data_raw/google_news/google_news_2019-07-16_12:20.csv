Extra protection sought for certain lawmakers after Trump's comments about 'squad',https://www.foxnews.com,['Chad Pergram'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-squad-tweets-extra-protection-house-exclusive,"EXCLUSIVE – House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie G. Thompson, D-Miss., was seeking extra protection for members of Congress on Monday after President Trump’s tweets and remarks about the progressive “squad.”

Trump’s remarks apparently were directed at four congresswomen: Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. All are American citizens and three of the four were born in the U.S.

Far from backing down, Trump on Monday dug in on comments he had initially made a day earlier on Twitter that if lawmakers “hate our country,” they can go back to their “broken and crime-infested” countries.

“If you’re not happy in the U.S., if you’re complaining all the time, you can leave, you can leave right now,” he said.

In the letter for House Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving and Senate Sergeant at Arms Michael Stenger, Thompson argued that the Capitol Police Board should meet to “analyze the current threat environment and set thresholds for enhanced safety of Members.”

Thompson asked for a meeting within 48 hours and a classified readout of the meeting.

The letter was addressed to Stenger because he has headed the Capitol Police Board this year.

Thompson said security officials should set “thresholds for enhanced security for certain targeted Members, and evaluate threat streams with law enforcement partners in Member districts. Being proactive in this instance is vital to the safety of not only these targeted Members, but all Members of Congress.”

Fox News has been told that despite Thompson’s pleas, other lawmakers have faced more serious threats than members of the squad ahead of Trump's tweets."
A Racist in the White House,https://www.newyorker.com,"['David Remnick', 'Dana Goodyear', 'Siddhartha Mukherjee', 'Charles Bethea', 'Michael Luo', 'Lizzie Presser', 'John Cassidy']",,,,https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/a-racist-in-the-white-house-donald-trump-tweets-ocasio-cortez-tlaib-omar-pressley,"On November 4, 2008, Barack Obama beat John McCain by nine and a half million votes and became the country’s first African-American President. In 2016, Donald Trump, an unapologetic racist, lost the popular ballot by three million votes but, thanks to the antediluvian rules that still govern our voting system, succeeded Obama in the Oval Office. Understanding the role of racism and its persistence in this dismal pivot will be as central to our understanding of our times as it was to our understanding of Reconstruction.

What’s curious is just how many people have resisted seeing squarely Trump’s racism, his shrewd exploitation of animosity, hatred, and division for political advantage. Trump is hardly a man of subtle concealment. W. E. B. Du Bois wrote that Andrew Johnson’s unwillingness to enact policies to give freedmen land, a decent education, or voting rights resided, first and foremost, in “his inability to picture Negroes as men.” Trump’s hostility toward minorities and his capacity to signal that hostility to others has never been a secret. This quality is central to his politics and his appeal.

The biography is plain. As real-estate developers in the nineteen-seventies, Trump and his father did what they could to keep people of color out of their buildings in Brooklyn and Queens. These slimy stratagems attracted the attention of the Department of Justice. As a tabloid big mouth eager to enhance his peculiar brand of outrageous celebrity, Trump paid for ad space in the New York papers to call for the execution of the so-called Central Park Five. Long after they were vindicated and given a collective award of forty-one million dollars, Trump refused to apologize or reconsider.

Trump always made a point of forming “friendships” with Don King, Mike Tyson, and a few other black celebrities, but the fraud was obvious. As Kip Brown, a driver who worked at one of Trump’s casinos in Atlantic City, told Nick Paumgarten in The New Yorker, “When Donald and Ivana came to the casino, the bosses would order all the black people off the floor. . . . I was a teen-ager, but I remember it: they put us all in the back.”

The foundational cause of Trump’s fledgling political career was not tax policy or the nuclear deal with Iran; it was the promotion of “birtherism,” the conspiracy theory that Obama was lying about his citizenship and place of origin. After the election, a ban on Muslim immigration was among Trump’s top priorities. His ongoing cruelties directed at men, women, and children at the southern border is a naked attempt to strike fear into would-be migrants throughout Mexico and Central America and to arouse the approval of white voters. The President’s views are clear: black athletes who dare to protest police violence are “sons of bitches”; African countries are “shitholes”; and there are some “fine people” among the bigoted thugs who carried tiki torches and chanted “blood and soil” and “Jews will not replace us” in Charlottesville.

Just last week, the President invited to the White House leading members of the far-right social-media crowd, including one “Carpe Donktum,” who recently made a nasty altered video of Joe Biden; Bill Mitchell, who ladles out the latest QAnon conspiracy theories; the oppo-research operative James O’Keefe III; and Ali Alexander, who, like the President’s own son, recently shared a tweet that called into question Kamala Harris’s racial background. A sterling bunch. At the meeting, Trump expressed the full knowledge that cyber-fuelled hatred and racism had helped him win the election. He honored the group with a White House invitation in the hopes that it will be there for him again in 2020. “The crap you think of is unbelievable!” he told them in bemused admiration. These were his people.

And, like a self-infatuated child, Trump said of his own tweets, “I used to watch it like a rocket ship when I put out a beauty.”

Over the weekend, Trump put out a beauty, telling his sixty million Twitter followers that four members of Congress—Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Rashida Tlaib—four Democrats on the left, four women of color, that they should “go back” to the countries “from which they came” if they were going to keep on criticizing him.

This was a threat of the ugliest variety, and one with a malodorous history. And a President of the United States was making it. At a press conference Monday, Ocasio-Cortez said that when she visited Washington, D.C., as a girl, her father showed her the Capitol, the reflecting pool, the Lincoln Memorial, and other sites of American democracy and told her, “This belongs to all of us.”

“This weekend that very notion was challenged,” Ocasio-Cortez said. This was precisely the point: Trump was saying that these four women of color did not belong. He would never have said something similarly threatening to a white critic. In his conception of American-ness, white people belong; the rest are contingent.

Asked by reporters if his message had been racist, Trump, of course, neither apologized nor retreated. He amplified his message. “If you’re not happy here, then you can leave,” he said. “As far as I’m concerned, if you hate our country, if you’re not happy here, you can leave. And that’s what I say all the time.”

“That’s what I said in a tweet, which I guess some people think is controversial—a lot of people love it, by the way,” he went on. “A lot of people love it. But if you’re not happy in the U.S., if you’re complaining all the time, very simply, you can leave. You can leave right now. Come back if you want. Don’t come back. That’s O.K., too. But if you’re not happy, you can leave.”

A lot of people love it. This might as well be Trump’s campaign slogan.

Trump can hardly run a reëlection campaign on policy triumphs. His polling results show him trailing the top four Democrats: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Kamala Harris. And so he will sling as much filth as possible and hope his base comes out in sufficient numbers. This is what he knows how to do. This time around he will shout about “socialism” and “You can leave.” He will make ugly caricatures of “the Squad”—the four members of Congress whom he targeted this weekend. “I hear the way she talks about Al Qaeda,” Trump said of Omar. “Al Qaeda has killed many Americans. She said, ‘You could hold your chest out.’ ” Ilhan Omar, of course, has said no such thing.

Reaction in the Republican leadership has been, at best, nervous. By the pusillanimous standards of the G.O.P., you could almost count Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, as positively courageous. Graham went on Fox News and called the four congresswomen a “bunch of communists.” Hardly surprising. He has been bowing and scraping to Trump since the election. But he also gently counselled Trump to “aim higher.”

Trump, of course, was having none of it. “I disagree with Lindsey on that,” he said. “He said, ‘Aim higher, shoot higher.’ What am I going to do, wait until we get somebody else in a higher position, higher office? These are people that hate our country.” In fact, at their press conference, Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib, Omar, and Pressley all took the high road, imploring the public not to take the bait—Trump’s race-baiting—and focus on the issues, from the climate crisis to income inequality.

Republicans and Independents, evangelicals, and many others who might have voted for Trump in 2016 will eventually have to ask themselves whether it is possible to go on believing that he is a man of sufficient character to hold the Presidency. They will have to ask themselves what it means to overlook his racism and what this says about them. How can they believe it is possible to support a racist and escape that in themselves? Or will they pronounce themselves, as the Treasury Secretary, Steven Mnuchin, did, “not concerned”?

The present moment is never fixed, or not for long. History is in the hands of members of Congress who have the option to collude or impeach, go along or resist; it is in the hands of citizens who can vote or stay at home. In 1989, we lived the illusion of unstoppable democratic advance. Democratic values have since receded. In 2008, we enjoyed the illusion of racial progress. Today, Donald Trump is in the White House.

“The slave went free; stood a brief moment in the sun; then moved back again toward slavery,” Du Bois wrote in his great study, “Black Reconstruction in America.” Then came the Second Reconstruction, better known as the civil-rights movement. Now we are where we are. What’s next is entirely up to us.

"After 2016 Bible Slip, Trump Lashed Out at ‘So-Called Christians,’ Book Says",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Maggie Haberman', 'Jonathan Martin']",07-15-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/us/politics/trump-evangelical-christians.html,"Evangelical voters make up a core constituency for Mr. Trump. Without their support, he would not have won the presidency, his advisers acknowledge. And the president has sought ways to engage those supporters.

For his part, in 2016, Mr. Cruz was candid with friends about his view of evangelicals who backed Mr. Trump. “If you’re a faithful person, if you believe that Jesus Christ died for your sins, emerged from the grave three days later and gives eternal life, and you’re supporting Donald Trump,” the book quotes Mr. Cruz saying to friends, “I think there’s something fundamentally wrong with you.”

Mr. Cruz won the caucuses by a small margin, following questionable tactics that the Cruz campaign used against a third candidate, Ben Carson. When Mr. Cruz won, Mr. Trump, aboard his private plane, called the chairman of the Iowa Republican Party, Jeff Kaufmann, and said, “I think you need to publicly disavow the result.” When Mr. Kaufmann said he could not do that, Mr. Trump was quiet for a moment, and then repeated: “You should disavow the result. Think about it, will you?”

Mr. Cruz was the last candidate standing against Mr. Trump deep into the primary election season. Mr. Trump clinched the nomination after the Indiana primary in May 2016, but some of his detractors within the Republican Party still hoped to persuade delegates to back Mr. Cruz at the national convention in Ohio that summer. That effort failed.

Since then, the two have joined forces, and Mr. Cruz has at times vociferously defended Mr. Trump. But the book goes into extensive detail on the various smears and humiliations of both Mr. Cruz and his wife, Heidi, that Mr. Trump doled out. That included extensive efforts by The National Enquirer, run by Mr. Trump’s ally David J. Pecker, to dig up dirt on Mr. Cruz."
Kellyanne Conway says critics employ Hatch Act to 'silence' her support for Trump,https://www.foxnews.com,['Charles Creitz'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kellyanne-conway-says-critics-using-hatch-act-to-silence-her-support-for-trump,"Counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway responded to critics Monday after formally defying a Hatch Act-related subpoena from the House Oversight Committee.

Her opponents are concerned about her effectiveness at her job and hoped to silence her, Conway said Monday on ""Hannity.""

""I'm concerned that there's such a weaponization and politicization of this thing called the Hatch Act,"" she said.

The Hatch Act limits political activity by federal workers. Congress approved the Hatch Act in 1939 to limit partisan activity by federal employees to ensure the government functions fairly and effectively.

The Office of Special Counsel -- separate from the office formerly run by Special Counsel Robert Mueller -- opened two cases focused on allegations Conway violated the Hatch Act by engaging in “both official and political activity” -- during her media appearances and on her Twitter account, @KellyannePolls.

The report stated, ""Ms. Conway regularly participated in official media interviews in her capacity as a White House spokesperson to answer reporters’ questions about the Administration. Beginning in February 2019, Ms. Conway, during official media appearances, engaged in a pattern of partisan attacks on several Democratic Party candidates shortly after they announced their candidacy for President,” detailing instances involving Sens. Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren, and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke.

The OSC stated that in one Feb. 19 interview on ""Fox & Friends,"" Conway “insinuated that Senator Booker was ‘sexist’ and a ‘tinny’ ‘motivational speaker,’” and claimed Warren, D-Mass., was “’lying’” about her ethnicity.

Conway said that no matter how heavy the pressure is on her to keep a low profile, she will continue to publicly support the president's policies.

""They're not going to silence me,"" she said. ""They're not going to take away my First Amendment rights.""

Conway also “attacked” O’Rourke for not “thinking the women running are good enough to be President.”

The Trump administration plans to relocate most of the Bureau of Land Management’s D.C. workforce to west of the Rockies, part of its broader push to shift power away from Washington and shrink the size of the federal government.

The proposal to move roughly 300 employees from a key Interior Department agency — among them the majority of top managers — comes as Trump officials are forcibly reassigning career officials and upending operations across the federal government. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue finalized plans this summer to move about 550 jobs at two of his department’s scientific agencies from the nation’s capital to greater Kansas City. The White House is trying to abolish the Office of Personnel Management, the government’s human resources agency, and has threatened to furlough as many as 150 employees if Congress blocks it.

“The problem with Washington is too many policy makers are far removed from the people they are there to serve,” Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) said in a statement supporting the land agency’s move. “Ninety-nine percent of the land the BLM manages is West of the Mississippi River, and so should be the BLM headquarters.”

But opponents argue that abrupt decisions to relocate or reassign federal workers have not been justified by sufficient analysis, can disrupt families’ lives and already have cost the government valuable expertise. BLM has about 360 employees in Washington, many of them supervisors, with 95 percent of its 9,260 employees working in the field.

“If I wanted to dismantle an agency, this would be in my playbook,” said Steve Ellis, who retired as BLM’s deputy director in 2016 after nearly four decades in government service. In a phone interview Monday, he said that transferring so many employees out of Washington could complicate the agency’s relationship with Capitol Hill, budget officials and other federal entities.

He noted that BLM dispatched all of its wildfire and aviation staff to Boise, Idaho, in the 1990s only to reestablish a wildland fire office in the District when lawmakers expected briefings after fires broke out in the West.

“It’s important for these agencies to have a meaningful footprint in D.C.,” Ellis said.

Margaret Weichert, Office of Management and Budget deputy director for management, said in a statement that the move will make the government more efficient and “better serve the American people.”

In a shift long sought by conservatives, Trump’s government has shed thousands of employees overall since he took office, with gains at the Defense Department and Department of Veterans Affairs but an exodus of civil servants at several other agencies, including Labor, Education, and Housing and Urban Development.

Jason A. Briefel, head of the Senior Executive Association that represents 6,000 top government leaders, said it is worth having a public conversation about how to reorganize different agencies. But he questioned whether the Trump administration has made a solid business case for some of these decisions.

“This isn’t just an Interior issue,” he said in an interview. “This is a government-wide issue.”

Interior’s plan for BLM, according to two people briefed on it who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, proposes dispersing about 225 staffers who report to headquarters to states including Colorado, Nevada and Utah over time, while reassigning another 75 to the bureau’s state offices. The rest of employees would remain in Washington to work on issues such as the bureau’s budget, regulations and Freedom of Information Act requests.

Some of the BLM top employees slated for a job transfer will move to Grand Junction, Colo., according to three federal officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the decision has not been formally announced. But many affected workers — who include some top officials, Senior Executive Service staffers and low-level managers — will move to other cities in the West.

Interior officials have been eyeing a possible move for BLM, which manages more than 10 percent of the nation’s land, for more than two years. A handful of Western states, such as Colorado and Utah, have sought to recruit the agency.

While administration officials defend the Agriculture Department and BLM moves as an effort to spread the federal workforce around, 85 percent of the 2.1 million federal employees already live outside the Washington area.

The idea of shifting the bureau west has received the support of some lawmakers, including the top Republican on the House Natural Resources Committee, Rob Bishop (Utah), as well as Gardner and Sen. Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.). In March 2018, the two senators from Colorado urged then-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to look at Grand Junction, roughly 280 miles west of Denver.

Bishop said Interior Secretary David Bernhardt is “promoting a thoughtful, methodical approach that is a true win for the West. I’m pleased that a significant number of personnel will be coming to Utah and other Western states.”

But House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) accused Bernhardt of being secretive about his plans. Bernhardt’s hometown of Rifle, Colo., is not far from Grand Junction.

“Putting BLM headquarters down the road from Secretary Bernhardt’s hometown just makes it easier for special interests to walk in the door demanding favors without congressional oversight or accountability,” Grijalva said. “The agency will lose a lot of good people because of this move, and I suspect that’s the administration’s real goal here.”

Interior declined to comment on the relocation.

It remains unclear whether Congress would have to explicitly authorize the shift in personnel. The first stage of the move is expected to cost about $5 million, according to two government officials.

This is not the first time Interior has reassigned senior executives with little notice. In June 2017, political appointees reshuffled the assignments of more than three dozen career executives, with just 15 days’ notice of their job change. Interior’s Office of Inspector General investigated the matter but did not determine whether the moves were justified, citing the department’s incomplete records.

Denise Sheehan, who worked at Interior for 33 years before retiring last month from U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, said in an interview that the round of reassignments had a “chilling effect,” limiting what career officials are comfortable saying to political appointees.

“I don’t know if that was intended or not, but that was definitely the effect. It’s the most toxic thing in the senior executive corps I have ever seen,” she said.

In many cases, reassigned federal staffers have chosen to leave the government because they hail from two-career families or for other personal reasons. A majority of scientists and researchers at the USDA agencies slated to move to Kansas City are choosing not to move, and Perdue’s plan has been dogged by questions about its cost and the motivation behind it.

“When you move large numbers of employees from one part of the country to another, you’re going to lose a lot of institutional knowledge,” said Ward Morrow, assistant general counsel for the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employee union — with 530 members at BLM.

In other instances, the administration has shuttered parts of agencies altogether. The small Federal Labor Relations Authority, which adjudicates disputes between federal employees and their agencies, has closed regional offices in Dallas and Boston, citing declining workloads.

Under federal law, BLM will have to pay all relocation and real estate costs for employees who choose to move west, including what it takes to sell their homes in the Washington region and purchase a new one. Employees and their families will be entitled to four months of hotel stays on the government’s dime, federal personnel experts said, which could cost as much as $100,000 per employee.

The agency probably will offer retirement and buyout packages to employees who decide not to move, which could equal as much as a year’s salary depending on their age and years of service.

Scientists flee USDA as research agencies move to Kansas City area,https://thehill.com,[],07-15-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/453193-scientists-flee-usda-as-research-agencies-move-to-kansas-city-area,"A Trump administration decision to move researchers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to the Kansas City area is threatening to spark the flight of more than half of the staff selected to move, gutting the agency of its top scientific voices.

Staff have until midnight Monday to decide whether to uproot and join the department as it moves its research branches from Washington, D.C., lured by $26 million in promised incentives from state and local officials.

Critics see the move, set to be completed by Sept. 30, as yet another example of the Trump administration looking to sideline scientists and researchers, keeping them away from the corridors of power. Administration officials deny that, calling it a cost-saving move intended to have researchers closer to farmers.

The decision comes as other agencies are also planning to relocate parts of their teams amid suspicions about the move. For example, the Interior Department is expected to announce new headquarters for the Bureau of Land Management on Tuesday.

“Moving these researchers out of Washington puts them out of earshot from policymakers. A lot of the research that scientists and economists do at [the USDA] has policy implications, and members of Congress need this information and need to have face-to-face meetings with these researchers,” Rebecca Boehm, with the Union of Concerned Scientists, told The Hill.

“It keeps science out of the policymaking process. And we’ve seen many times that this administration doesn’t like facts or research that isn’t convenient or [is] an impediment to their agenda, so I think moving them away helps accomplish that,” she added.

The move affects two wings of the USDA. Economic Research Service (ERS) employees analyze the agricultural market, but their research is much broader, including looking at food stamps, rural poverty and conservation.

National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) employees work with universities to fund research and coordinate the process that issues research grants on agriculture-related subjects, including climate change adaptation.

The two agencies voted to unionize in response to the move, as Democrats in both chambers and a number of groups that regularly work with the two agencies lobby to keep them in Washington.

Estimates tallied by employees show 70 percent of ERS employees designated for the Kansas City office will not be moving. For NIFA, 45 percent of those surveyed said they will not move. Overall, the move was expected to impact 547 staff between the two agencies.

But the numbers of staff refusing to move may grow. Some employees said staff at both agencies are trying not to tip their hands, saying they will move only if they do not find another job in the D.C. area.

So far, just 27 ERS staff out of 250 have committed to moving to the Kansas City area, according to the employee tallies.

The UDSA argues the move will save $300 million over 15 years, but critics have said their cost-benefit analysis was shoddy and did not follow guidelines.

A different cost-benefit analysis from the Agricultural and Applied Economics Association found the move would cost taxpayers between $83 million and $182 million.

Democrats have blocked USDA funding from supporting the move and asked the agency to turn over information about its decisionmaking process, and they have sponsored legislation to keep the two agencies in Washington.

“I am appalled with the Trump administration’s decision to force hundreds of Washington-based USDA research staffers to uproot their lives to Kansas City in order to keep their livelihoods,” Rep. Chellie Pingree Rochelle (Chellie) PingreeFederal employees turn their backs on Agriculture secretary after relocation plans announced Congress should make Interior's Bernhardt 'manage the land to stop climate change' Hollywood stars celebrate #RightToBearArts at DC gala MORE (D-Maine), who sponsored the legislation, said in a statement when the move was announced.

“Many of these staffers believe their relocation is an effort to silence their research into topics that do not align with the Trump administration’s political agenda, including the study of climate change and benefits of low-income food assistance,” she added.

Employees had a list of complaints about a move they have likened to Amazon’s search for a second headquarters, as the USDA examined bids from 139 cities.

That process was put on pause during the government shutdown, but on June 16 employees were told they had a month to decide whether they’d like to move to the Kansas City area or leave the agency.

Employees would then have two months to move to Kansas City — they must be there by the end of the fiscal year — but school in the area is slated to start Aug. 12, putting added pressure on those with families to quickly make a move.

Employees say they are getting conflicting information about how much of their moving costs will be covered by the government. Other key details about the move are also unknown so far, according to the employees.

The USDA said it was working to make the move as smooth as possible but did not respond to several specific questions about the move from The Hill.

“USDA has determinedly worked to ensure employees have the resources they need to make informed decisions about their employment and to ensure the transition is as smooth as possible,” the agency said in a statement.

Employees say morale is at an all-time low and they worry about the future of an agency that is already hemorrhaging staff and having trouble completing its work.

“Honestly, I’m not sure how we’re going to bounce back or if we will,” said Laura Dodson, an agricultural economist with ERS who is now a union steward. “This agency is the product of like 50 years of institutional knowledge and gathering up researchers who are very specialized in their fields.”

Employees also say there are contradictions between what the USDA says it hopes to achieve with the move and how it would actually impact the department.

“It was sort of get fired or go,” said Ariela Zycherman, a national program leader with NIFA who is still weighing a move to Kansas City.

“People keep saying, ‘Those East Coasters don’t want to come to Kansas or Missouri.’ The fact of matter is that’s not really the issue,” she said. “Many of us would move to Kansas City, but there are questions about future of agency and its effectiveness and questions about the way this was hastily rolled out and whether it will have long-term effects on our families’ well-being.”

The USDA has argued the move will allow employees to be closer to farmers — something employees say shows a fundamental misunderstanding of what they do.

“I think the biggest misconception around this is, we don’t serve individual farmers,” Dodson said. “Our stakeholders are primarily Congress and program leads and agencies and nonprofits in D.C. or people that come to meet with multiple entities in D.C.""

“I think our presence will be very much diminished. I think we’ll be quite literally out of sight and out of mind,” Dodson added.

The bipartisan Kansas and Missouri delegation pushed hard to bring the offices to the Kansas City area, calling it a hub for research and a talented workforce and touting the lower cost compared to Washington, D.C.

But employees say the hectic way the move has been handled has soured many about the USDA.

“I’ve never experienced morale like this in any job,” said Wesley Dean, a national program leader in sociology for NIFA. “My colleagues are deeply committed to the mission of the agency and see their positions as an opportunity to both shape the future of their scientific disciplines and to serve the American people.

“These highly motivated civil servants feel as if their expertise and dedication to the agency and the public has been undermined and dismissed by the department,” Dean added."

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration failed to follow ethics rules last year when it dismissed academic members of Environmental Protection Agency advisory boards and replaced them with appointees connected to industry, a federal watchdog agency concluded Monday.

The agency, the Government Accountability Office, found that the administration “did not consistently ensure” that appointees to E.P.A. advisory panels met federal ethics requirements. It also concluded that Trump administration officials violated E.P.A. guidelines by not basing the appointments on recommendations made by career staff members.

Scott Pruitt, President Trump’s first E.P.A. administrator who resigned last year amid ethics scandals, remade the agency’s science advisory panels because he said they did not fairly represent the United States geographically, or the industries affected by regulations.

The percentage of academic scientists serving on one E.P.A. panel, the Scientific Advisory Board, dropped 27 percent during the first year of the Trump administration. Academics on the agency’s Board of Scientific Counselors dropped 45 percent. Investigators found that the percentage of academics on E.P.A. advisory boards remained stable around 83 percent during the first year President Barack Obama was in office ."

""Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin have been exploited to support billions of dollars of illicit activity like cyber crime, tax evasion, extortion, ransomware, illicit drugs and human trafficking,"" Mnuchin said, adding that he is ""not comfortable today"" with Facebook's launch.

""They have a lot of work to do,"" he said.

The press conference comes days after President Donald Trump said in a tweet that he was ""not a fan"" of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. He also suggested Facebook, which plans on launching the global cryptocurrency next year, would need a bank charter to do so. Bitcoin dropped sharply on Monday following the president's criticism on Twitter. The world's first and most valuable digital currency fell roughly 10% to a low of $9,872 to start the week.

""The president does have concerns as it relates to bitcoin and cryptocurrencies — those are legitimate concerns that we have been working on for a long period of time,"" Mnuchin said.

In response to the Treasury secretary's comments, Facebook told CNBC that ""they anticipated critical feedback from regulators, central banks, lawmakers around the world."" The tech giant also said they announced Libra a year before its anticipated launch date, ""so that we could have those conversations.""

Facebook's David Marcus, head of Facebook's Calibra digital wallet that will be used to store Libra, is scheduled to testify before the committee on Tuesday. The House Financial Services Committee will hold its own hearing focused on Libra on Wednesday. Marcus responded to questions from the U.S. Senate Banking Committee in a letter last week, saying the company needs governments, central banks and regulators involved to properly launch the digital asset and Facebook ""can't do this alone.""

Watchdog finds EPA skirted rules when appointing industry leaders to science boards,https://thehill.com,[],07-15-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/453178-watchdog-finds-epa-skirted-rules-when-appointing-industry-leaders,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) increased the number of industry representatives and consultants on its top scientific board and failed to ensure all those appointees met ethics requirements, a government watchdog found.

A report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found the EPA did not follow the process for selecting the “best qualified and most appropriate candidates” for two important committees that advise on environmental regulations and also “did not ensure that all appointees met ethics requirements.”

The EPA’s Science Advisory Board (SAB), a team of more than 40 of the nation’s top scientists, is designed to guide the agency on its scientific processes.

Critics say it has been repeatedly targeted by the Trump administration. Many academics were removed by guidelines from former Administrator Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott PruittSenior Trump administration official to leave post next week For Big Pharma, the revolving door keeps spinning Acosta defends Epstein deal, bucking calls for resignation MORE that barred those who receive EPA research grants from serving on the committee. There was no similar ban for scientists who receive industry funding.

“After a careful investigation, the non-partisan GAO confirms what we’ve been critical of all along: The Trump Administration is violating its own rules by putting industry officials in charge of crucially important science advisory boards,” the statement said.

The GAO report said there were “notable changes” to some committees, including an initial drop in the number of academics serving on the SAB.

It also highlighted numerous issues with following ethics guidelines.

“EPA also did not consistently ensure that members appointed as special government employees (SGE)—who are expected to provide their best judgment free from conflicts of interest and are required by federal regulations to disclose their financial interests—met federal ethics requirements,” the report said, adding that there should have been more periodic reviews of its ethics programs.

The EPA pushed back again the report.

“EPA has already provided GAO its thorough explanation on their conclusion that the Agency did not follow its own policy – the assertion is incorrect and should be removed from the report,” Michael Abboud, an EPA spokesman, said in a statement to The Hill. “Under this administration, EPA has doubled its career ethics attorney staff to ensure that all appointees meet financial disclosure requirements. Finally given the range of environmental and public health considerations across the country, EPA is proud of the fact that its chartered scientific advisory committees have the highest participation of state, local, and tribal experts than at any point in the Agency’s history. Further, legal challenges to the Agency’s FACA directive on Special Government Employees with EPA grants have been dismissed in three separate district courts.”

EPA’s SAB has pushed back against a proposal that would consideration of studies that don't make their underlying data public, even as its membership has changed. The Trump administration has also proposed cutting one-third of boards like the SAB that advise agencies."

"Veterans Affairs abandoned 200,000+ health care applications this year",https://www.ajc.com,[],,,,https://www.ajc.com/news/breaking-news/veterans-affairs-abandoned-200-000-health-care-applications-this-year/VR5zYSyyBn0LnTndnE2x1L/,"An arm of the Veterans Affairs Department in Atlanta eliminated 208,272 applications from across the country for health care early this year amid efforts to shrink a massive backlog of requests, saying they were missing signatures or information about military service and income, according to records reviewed by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Veterans groups say the VA should have done more to communicate with the veterans before closing their applications, some of which date back to 1998. Troops face additional challenges in applying for VA health care, they said, as they grapple with reentry into civilian life, change addresses following overseas deployments and suffer from combat stress.

In the middle of the controversy is the VA’s Health Eligibility Center, the Atlanta office that oversees the process by which veterans seek access to the VA medical system. It and its parent agency have come under intense scrutiny in recent years for mismanagement and delays in providing medical care, presenting a thorny challenge for the administration of President Donald Trump, who focused on veterans’ care during his presidential campaign.

As of April, 8.8 million veterans were enrolled in the VA’s health care system, the agency’s records show. The VA said it enrolled 395,417 people in its health care system and rejected 98,897 in the fiscal year ending in September. Its backlog of pending applications totaled 317,157 in April, down from a high of 886,045 last year, according to records the VA sent the AJC.

That current backlog is still “way too high,” said Jeremy Butler, CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, a New York-based advocacy group. He suggested additional collaboration between the VA and veteran service groups could shrink it more.

“Something is not quite working right if we are not getting that number lower than it is,” he said. “We need to be working together to get that number down.”

Butler joined Adrian Atizado, deputy national legislative director for Disabled American Veterans, a nonprofit charity based in Kentucky, in criticizing the VA’s efforts to reach the veterans before rejecting and closing their 208,272 applications.

The VA sent out one rejection letter to each of those applicants in 2016. In 2017, a bipartisan group of federal lawmakers — including Georgia Sen. Johnny Isakson — urged the VA to send the applicants an additional letter clarifying what missing information they needed to turn in. The lawmakers were responding to allegations that a coding error caused the VA to send veterans incorrect letters about what they still needed to submit.

The VA said it opted against sending an additional letter after its Office of Inspector General determined there was no such error and that the letters it sent in 2016 were appropriate and complied with federal law.

Isakson, who leads the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, was unavailable for an interview, according to an aide. But his spokeswoman said the VA took Isakson’s recommendation to have the inspector general review the issue and then briefed the senator’s committee about its decision to close the applications.

Atizado called the VA’s decision to send just one letter to the applicants in 2016 before closing their cases this year “quite unfortunate.”

“When we hear about the VA not taking a more thoughtful approach to a situation like this — when they only send one letter because they have an incomplete application — I think we all should be expecting our government and this administration to do better by our veterans,” he said.

The VA said veterans may reapply for health care. The agency said it is now striving to contact people about incomplete applications up to six times each with phone calls and letters. Its Health Eligibility Center in Atlanta, meanwhile, has added 115 employees since July of 2016.

The 208,272 eliminated cases didn’t receive such treatment, though. That also has drawn renewed criticism from Scott Davis, a VA employee and whistleblower who testified before Congress in 2014 about problems at the VA’s Health Eligibility Center, located off Clairmont Road.

“This purge has the dual effect of letting the VA avoid the work of processing the applications and absolving the agency of any responsibility for veterans’ delayed access to health and disability benefits,” Davis wrote in an article for the Washington Examiner in May.

Defending its decision, the VA pointed to a federal law that says applications that remain incomplete for a year cannot be approved.

“In accordance with federal law, VA closed 208,272 incomplete health care enrollment applications between January and February,” the VA said in a prepared statement. “It would have been illegal for VA to keep the applications open.”

Davis disputed that, saying the law doesn’t say anything about closing applications. In an interview, he accused the VA of “purging applications under a law that does not give them the authority to do so.”

Asked how many of the 208,272 applications the agency closed were from former prisoners of war, Purple Heart recipients and combat veterans, the VA told the AJC that the newspaper would have to file a request under the federal Freedom of Information Act for that information. The AJC did that last month and its request is still pending.

Trump Fans the Flames of a Racial Fire,https://www.nytimes.com,['Peter Baker'],07-14-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/14/us/politics/trump-twitter-race.html,"WASHINGTON — President Trump woke up on Sunday morning, gazed out at the nation he leads, saw the dry kindling of race relations and decided to throw a match on it. It was not the first time, nor is it likely to be the last. He has a pretty large carton of matches and a ready supply of kerosene.

His Twitter harangue goading Democratic congresswomen of color to “go back” to the country they came from, even though most of them were actually born in the United States, shocked many. But it should have surprised few who have watched the way he has governed a multicultural, multiracial country the last two and a half years.

When it comes to race, Mr. Trump plays with fire like no other president in a century. While others who occupied the White House at times skirted close to or even over the line, finding ways to appeal to the resentments of white Americans with subtle and not-so-subtle appeals, none of them in modern times fanned the flames as overtly, relentlessly and even eagerly as Mr. Trump.

His attack on the Democratic congresswomen came on the same day his administration was threatening mass roundups of immigrants living in the country illegally. And it came just days after he hosted some of the most incendiary right-wing voices on the internet at the White House and vowed to find another way to count citizens separately from noncitizens despite a Supreme Court ruling that blocked him from adding a question to the once-a-decade census."
DHS inspector general confirms investigation into leaked ICE raids,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-15-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/dhs-inspector-general-confirms-investigation-into-leaked-ice-raids,"The Department of Homeland Security's independent Office of Inspector General has taken up the formal investigation into the leak of confidential government information in late June that forced Immigration and Customs Enforcement to call off a nationwide operation, according to the federal agency.

“Last month, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) became aware of an apparent leak related to a planned enforcement operation. Leaks of law enforcement sensitive information jeopardize the safety of ICE officers and agents who have sworn an oath to uphold the law. ICE referred the incident to its Office of Professional Responsibility, which, in accordance with its normal procedures, referred it to the DHS Office of Inspector General,"" ICE said in a statement issued Monday morning.

The Washington Examiner was first to report on Friday that then-acting ICE Director Mark Morgan’s team had reported the incident to the ICE Joint Intake Center so they could investigate.

“There is an ongoing investigation. An internal investigation has been launched,” one official said in a phone call Friday.

The investigation, which is not a criminal probe, is centered around acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, the leader of the department’s 240,000 employees, as well as at least one aide, for possible involvement in the leak.

""Everyone knows who they are investigating. Why didn't the acting secretary call for an investigation?"" a senior official told the Washington Examiner on Monday.

McAleenan was named by three senior administration officials and two former officials as the orchestrator of the leak. These sources charged he wanted to sabotage ICE’s months-long plan to find and arrest around 2,000 people who had been denied asylum and not left the country. McAleenan opposed the plan because of its potential to remove a parent from a household with children in it.

Three officials have claimed McAleenan ordered Morgan on two occasions in the two weeks leading up to the planned June 23 operation to not carry it out, orders that would have contradicted the White House’s support and approval. Morgan contacted the White House following McAleenan’s warning to try to carry it out, according to three current and two former senior administration officials.

He directly denied being the leaker during an interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham two weeks ago, but last Sunday dodged the same question when it was asked by ABC News host Martha Raddatz.

“I find it interesting that he demanded an investigation into the Border Patrol Facebook, but he didn’t demand an investigation into the leak. If he was innocent of this, why didn’t he?” said a senior former official.

The official was referring to a Facebook page on which Border Patrol agents made vulgar and derisive posts.

The planned raids in cities such as Los Angeles, Miami, and Houston, were first reported by the Washington Post the day after its reporter traveled on a government plane with the acting secretary and aides to the border.

ICE carried out raids nationwide this past weekend, though reports suggested they were not of the magnitude anticipated."
Pentagon silent on Turkey as Congress urges retaliation for Russian missile buy,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-15-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/pentagon-silent-on-turkey-as-congress-urges-retaliation-for-russian-missile-buy,"STILL WAITING: The Pentagon on Friday appeared poised to bring the hammer down on Turkey after the NATO ally announced that — in clear defiance of U.S. warnings — it had accepted the first delivery of components of the Russian S-400 air defense system.

The Pentagon scheduled a rare on-camera, on-the-record briefing for 11:15 a.m. with Ellen Lord, undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, and David Trachtenberg, deputy undersecretary for policy, to give the department’s official response.

CONGRESS READY TO ACT: Members of Congress were weighing in , calling for the Trump administration to follow through on its months of threats to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that if he bought the sophisticated Russian system he would have to give up the American F-35 fighter jet and risked further economic sanctions.

The Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees issued a bipartisan statement. “Congress has made it clear that there must be consequences for President Erdogan’s misguided S-400 acquisition, a troubling signal of strategic alignment with Putin’s Russia and a threat to the F-35 program. As a result, we urge President Trump to fully implement sanctions as required by law under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act,” said the statement signed by Jim Inhofe, Jack Reed, Jim Risch, and Bob Menendez, the respective chairmen and ranking members of both committees. “Additionally, while all F-35 material deliveries remain indefinitely suspended, we call on the Department of Defense to proceed with the termination of Turkey’s participation in the F-35 program.”

ESPER SAYS STAY TUNED: In a brief exchange with pool reporters, acting Defense Secretary Mark Esper said, ""We are aware of Turkey taking delivery of the S-400. Our position regarding the F-35 has not changed.”

Esper said he would be speaking later Friday with his Turkish counterpart, Hulusi Akar. “So there will be more to follow after that conversation,” he told reporters.

THEN, CRICKETS: The planned briefing by Lord and Trachtenberg was postponed and later canceled. There was no statement from the Pentagon, the State Department, or the White House on Turkey’s future with the F-35 program.

President Trump last spoke publicly on the issue at the G20 meeting in Osaka, Japan, in which he blamed President Obama for the problem, claiming Turkey had no choice but to buy Russian missiles because Obama denied Turkey U.S. Patriot missile defenses. In fact, efforts by both the Obama and Trump administrations to sell Patriots to Turkey fell through in a dispute over technology transfer.

As of Monday morning, we are still waiting to hear how the situation will be resolved.

HAPPENING TODAY: All quiet on the Pentagon front as Mark Esper prepares for his expedited Senate confirmation hearing, set for 9:30 am tomorrow. As of this morning, Esper is still listed on the Pentagon’s website as acting defense secretary, even though the plan is for him to step aide as soon as his nomination is submitted and for Navy Secretary Richard Spencer to fill in until he gets a final vote in the Senate.

No events are listed on Esper’s public schedule. The indications are that Esper’s nomination will be submitted later today, in order to minimize the time Spencer will have to serve as his replacement.

The Senate Armed Services Committee agreed to waive the usual seven-day waiting period and put his confirmation on the fast track while still fully exercising its “advise and consent” responsibilities.

PARTISAN NDAA PASSES HOUSE: The debate over whether the House version of the National Defense Authorization Act was a partisan document seems settled by the fact it passed the House Friday 220-197 without a single Republican vote.

In contrast to the Senate version, the $733 billion House NDAA is loaded with a wish list of progressive initiatives that appear doomed to be defeated once the bill goes to conference committee, reports the Washington Examiner’s Susan Ferrechio. It also cuts $17 billion from the topline for defense.

“I predict the bill the bill that ends up on the president’s desk is going to look a lot more like the Senate bill than the bill that came out of the House,” House Minority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana said Friday.

HOW PROGRESSIVE IS THE HOUSE NDAA?: Illinois Democrat Jan Schakowsky, a senior chief deputy whip, released this summary of the bill’s major provisions:



Includes a blanket prohibition on funding for the President’s wall on the southern border

Prohibits Department of Defense funds from aiding the President’s child separation policy

Provides Paid Family and Medical Leave for all government employees

Denies the President the unilateral authority to go to war in Iran

Repeals the 2001 Authorization of Use of Military Force war authority

Aids military families by providing increased resources for housing, childcare, and education

Requires DOD to help combat climate change

Stops DOD programs that significantly pollute the environment and provides a significant amount of funding for environmental cleanup

Accelerates the closure of the prison at Guantanamo Bay Cuba

Increases and aids diversity in the military

Reduces the size of our nuclear weapons program, and eliminates new low-yield nuclear weapons

Increases family planning services for military women and provides resources to combat sexual assault

Increases protections or unionized civilian defense employees

Requires and audit and increased fiscal responsibility for the Department overall

Prevents military assistance to groups or forces that are known to commit human rights violations

Helps hold Russia accountable for its interference in U.S. elections

Reverses the President’s ban on transgender individuals serving in the armed forces

WAR POWERS SHOWDOWN: The House bill includes a provision that would block new use of military force by the president without explicit permission from Congress, approving an amendment by a vote of 242 to 180 that prevents the president from using a 2001 war authorization to conduct future military action abroad.

An amendment that would also specifically curb Trump’s ability to authorize a military strike on Iran passed on a bipartisan vote of 251-to-170, with 27 Republicans voting for it along with all but 7 Democrats.

“We can’t let Trump and his warmongering cabinet drag us into another costly and destabilizing war in the Middle East,” said Barbara Lee of California, who sponsored the war authorization amendment.

‘VERY MISGUIDED’: Appearing on Fox News Channel’s Sunday Morning Futures, House Foreign Affairs Committee lead Republican Michael McCaul of Texas called the votes “very misguided.”

“I think it is a very dangerous, reckless policy by the Democrats to repeal the 2001 AUMF [Authorization for the Use of Military Force] with no replacement to it,” he told host Maria Bartiromo.

“In fact, every indication I have seen is he doesn't want to go to war with Iran,” McCaul said. “That's why he didn't respond back militarily after they shot down a U.S. military asset. He's trying to use a diplomatic route here. So, these are all ... I think very misguided.”

“I'm all for arguing about updating the 2001 AUMF after 9/11, but this would … illegalize all global counterterrorism operations in the world that we're conducting,” he added. “And then they want to repeal the 2002 [AUMF] with Iraq. And, of course, we know ISIS is still a threat in Iraq.”

ISIS WARNING: The latest “ sitrep ” from the Institute for the Study of War doubles down on its warning that ISIS is posed for a comeback in Iraq and Syria.

""The ISIS campaign in Iraq and Syria has demonstrated to ostensibly liberated communities that they are not safe, perpetuating conditions of fear and distrust that will make it increasingly difficult to establish durable and legitimate security and political structures across Iraq and Syria. ISIS’s next resurgence could be faster and even more devastating than 2014,” the group warned in its June report .

THE WAR IN AFGHANISTAN: The Pentagon on Friday quietly released its latest congressionally mandated report on the war in Afghanistan, which puts a decidedly upbeat spin on how things are going in the wake of a number of deadly Taliban attacks and another U.S. soldier killed in combat.

The report credits U.S. Forces-Afghanistan commander Gen. Scott Miller with making changes in counter-terrorsim that have “restored the Coalition’s tactical initiative and put heavy pressure on the Taliban” and said the Afghan military “continued to improve its ability to fight the insurgents.”

Also of note was the ongoing effort by Zalmay Khalilzad, the special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation, aimed at achieving a peace agreement “that safeguards the U.S. homeland and could lead to a reduction in the number of U.S. forces deployed in Afghanistan.”

AFGHANISTAN KIA: The Pentagon has identified the soldier killed in Afghanistan Saturday as Sgt. Maj. James G. “Ryan” Sartor, 40, of Teague, Texas. Sartor died from wounds sustained from enemy small arms fire during combat operations. Sartor, a Green Beret who had served several combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne), Fort Carson, Colorado.

His death is the 11th U.S. military fatality this year, including one death listed as “non-combat” by the Pentagon. In 2018, 14 U.S. troops died in Afghanistan.

A sweet moment of former President Barack Obama holding the hand of his daughter Sasha and waving at onlookers has been memorialized in a sculpture as part of Rapid City, South Dakota’s long-running “City of Presidents” project.

Since 2000, the western South Dakota city has been populating its streets and sidewalks with life-size bronze statues of the nation’s past commanders-in-chief — an art instillation meant to honor the legacy of the American presidency.

So far 43 former president have been added to the project, from the country’s first, George Washington, on to Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush and, now, Obama.

Rapid City offers a “City of Presidents” map and interactive walking guide for the project. The pattern of placement for the presidents was chosen “to maintain a coherent structure and eliminate any sense of favoritism or political gain,” the city notes.

Each sculpture is privately funded and depicts the president in a pose specific to his personality.

Obama’s statute, which was unveiled on Saturday, was created by sculptor James Van Nuys over a two-year period.

According to CNN, Meyers was originally going to sculpt Obama, 57, standing and waving when his collaborators suggested he try something different.

“One of us said, ‘This is boring. This is not going to have the wow factor,’ ” Dallerie Davis, the group’s co-founder, told CNN. “A man waving is not a showstopper.”

The final sculpture was inspired by a photo of Obama and Sasha walking on a stage at Chicago’s Grant Park, after Obama was first elected president, Van Nuys told CNN.

Rapid City has yet to unveil the placement of the Obama statue but said on its website it will be placed by the end of the summer."

Attorney General Bill Barr condemned the politics of fighting ""under the banner of identity politics"" in an address Monday to at the Department of Justice's Summit on Combatting Anti-Semitism.





WILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Good Morning.

Thank you all for being here. Thank you, Jeff, for that introduction. I would like to offer a special thanks to Rabbi Soloveichik for his benediction. I also want to thank everyone who helped to bring this summit together – in particular, Larry Rothenberg, Lindsey Freeman, and Katie Crytzer from the Office of Legal Policy; Omeed Assefi from the Civil Rights Division; and Brian Pandya and Patrick Davis from the Office of the Associate Attorney General. Finally, let me say thank you to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Education Secretary Betsy Devos, Special Envoy Elan Carr, and FBI Director Chris Wray, who are joining us here today for this summit.



Today's program includes a great set of panels and speakers. For one thing, you will hear throughout the day from federal officials across the Administration about our efforts to combat anti-Semitism. I know that for me and for the Department of Justice, this is an important priority.



I am deeply concerned about the rise in hate crimes and political violence that we have seen over the past decade. And this trend has included a marked increase in reported instances of anti-Semitic hate crimes. We can all agree this trend is intolerable. We must have zero tolerance for violence that is motivated by hatred for our fellow citizens whether based on race, sex, or creed. Anti-Semitic violence is especially pernicious because it targets both Jewish ethnic identity and religious practice.



The most ancient and stubborn form of racism throughout Western History has been anti-Semitism. The causes have varied. At various times it has been driven by religious intolerance, cultural differences, economic envy, or ideological dogma. Sometimes those disappointed with their own lot in life seize on conspiracy theories to blame the Jewish people for their own discontent. Sometimes political factions competing for power find in the Jewish people a convenient scapegoat to unify and inflame their base.



Hostility or prejudice against the Jewish people has manifested itself in the organized violence of pogroms, expulsions, and massacres. Within living memory, these genocidal acts reached the unimaginable scale and evil of the Holocaust. In the United States today, we do not have state-organized violence. But increasingly we are seeing hate inspired violence against the Jewish community perpetrated by individuals and groups.



This past year in particular, the entire Nation saw the evil fruits of anti-Semitism in Pittsburgh at the Tree of Life Synagogue and in California at the Chabad of Poway. In both instances, gunmen motivated by hatred against Jews opened fire, killing worshippers and injuring others. We were all horrified by these attacks. Federal, state, and local law enforcement responded quickly and decisively.



Of course, it is one thing for the Nation to pull together in condemning anti-Semitism when confronted with front-page stories about horrific shootings, as in Pittsburgh and Poway. But far too often, Jews and Jewish communities in America suffer outside the spotlight. New York City, this past year, has seen a sharp uptick in attacks on Orthodox Jews, particularly in the Crown Heights neighborhood. People are attacking Jews in the streets and vandalizing synagogues. In Massachusetts in March, vandals desecrated 59 gravestones in a Jewish cemetery, knocking over headstones and scrawling swastikas and hateful graffiti. While the tragic attacks in Pittsburgh and Poway appropriately drew national attention, these attacks and others like them in communities across the country are, sadly, less well-known outside the Jewish community. But they form the daily background of concerns about security and safety that many in the Jewish community feel. The Nation as a whole must be aware of these concerns and reject the forces that motivate them. As Attorney General and a fellow citizen, I want to assure the Jewish community that the Department of Justice and the entire federal government stands with you and will not tolerate these attacks.



Anti-Semitism in the United States manifests itself in many ways other than outright violence. Prejudice is often reflected in zoning laws designed to exclude Jews from residing in particular communities. It is also manifest in the harassment of Jewish individuals and businesses. That is also why today is about far more than criminal prosecutions. We need to combat anti-Semitism on all fronts, as a government but also as a society. We are therefore grateful that today's summit will include thoughtful discussions with several outside contributors who have been gracious enough to join us.



The first panel will focus on combatting anti-Semitism while respecting the First Amendment. Hate-crime and civil-rights prosecutions are important tools but they cannot solve the problem on their own. Hearts and minds must be changed, but that is not always a task to which the government is particularly well-suited. We have a legal obligation to respect the free speech rights of even despicable speakers and our harshest critics. But lines can be drawn by our society, sometimes easily and sometimes not so easily, between that commitment and repudiation of anti-Semitism.



Another panel will focus on the problem of anti-Semitism on campus. On college campuses today, Jewish students who support Israel are frequently targeted for harassment, Jewish student organizations are marginalized, and progressive Jewish students are told they must denounce their beliefs and their heritage in order be part of ""intersectional"" causes. We must ensure – for the future of our country and our society – that college campuses remain open to ideological diversity and respectful of people of all faiths.



I think of the various forms of anti-Semitism as very much like different kinds of cancer. A healthy body with a strong immune system can have success in preventing cancers from emerging and spreading. But if the immune system weakens cancer can emerge. Some might be localized. But others can rapidly metastasize and become systematic. Like a physical body, a body politic must have an immune system that resists anti-Semitism and other forums of hatred.



What is the state of our immune system within the American society? In a pluralistic society like ours, I think the ability to resist hate comes from cultivating a civil society that, on the one hand, nurtures the freedom of each group to pursue their faith and distinctive way of life, while, at the same time, fostering the ties that bind us together into a genuine broader community.



My concern today is that under the banner of identity politics, some political factions are seeking to obtain power by dividing Americans. They undermine the values that draw us together, such as shared commitment to our country’s success. This is the breeding ground for hatred, and we must reject it.



What is the competing vision? I am reminded of something that happened two months after 9/11.



An Americans Airline flight with 260 souls aboard took off from JFK, went wildly out of control over Jamaica Bay, and crashed into the small Belle Harbor neighborhood on Rockaway in Queens. The community had just completed burying its victims of 9/11 – 50 of them – the highest concentration of victims of any neighborhood of New York. All onboard the American flight died, as did five people on the ground. Many houses were consumed by fire.



A news report on the incident is always stuck in my mind. It involved a man-on-the-street interview of a life-long resident of Belle Harbor. With fires raging behind him, he was distraught, but unbowed, as he assured the reporter that Belle Harbor would surmount this latest tragedy.



He said, “This is a tight-knit neighborhood. We have a fabric. You got your Irish. You got your Italians. You got your Jews. So we are pretty homogeneous.”



Is there a better description of the Framers’ aspiration of “E Pluribus Unum?”



We are a pluralistic Nation composed of very distinct groups, each bound together by ethnicity, race, or religion – each group proud of its identity and committed to its faith and traditions. Yet despite these differences, we can be bound together into a broader community. Not one that seeks to grind away our distinctive identity. Not one that seeks to overbear our religious commitments, which must be paramount. But one that respects, indeed delights in, the freedom of each of us that give meaning to our lives – that help us understand our place and our purpose in this Creation.



This real sense of community cannot be politically mandated. It arises from the genuine affinity, affection, and solidarity that grows out of a shared patriotism and that spontaneous feeling of fellowship that arises from a shared sense of place, shared experience, and common local attachments. These bonds are the surest safeguard against racial hatred, including anti-Semitism.



So with that, I would like to thank you all again for being here. Allow me to conclude with a few lines from the letter that President George Washington wrote to the Jewish congregation in Newport, Rhode Island, following a visit there in 1790:



May the children of the stock of Abraham who dwell in this land continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other inhabitants – while ever one shall sit in safety under his own vine and fig tree and there shall be none to make him afraid."
Equal dialogue key in Sino-US trade talks,https://www.asiatimes.com,['Asia Times'],,,,https://www.asiatimes.com/2019/07/opinion/equal-dialogue-key-in-sino-us-trade-talks/,"The leaders of China’s and the United States’ economic and trade consultation teams spoke over the phone on the evening of July 9 on the implementation of the consensual exchanges agreed by the two nations at the recent Group of Twenty summit, according to a spokesman for China’s Ministry of Commerce.

The Americans appear to be showing goodwill for the upcoming round of talks. The US Department of Commerce has announced that it will partially lift the Huawei ban by removing restrictions on exports to the firm and eliminating tariffs on 110 Chinese products that were previously hit with a 25% levy.

However, Huawei is still on the backlist of the US “entity list.” Only non-critical components had their sanctions lifted, which was done at the request of US companies. In addition, the 110 Chinese goods that had their tariffs lifted were under the normal tariff exemption mechanism, which overall is more favorable to American consumers.

In the past year, the US has shown no mercy in pressuring China. A high-tariff policy on China’s exports to the US – valued at US$250 billion annually – had been implemented. China also retaliated by imposing tariffs on $94 billion worth of US goods.

While China’s tariffs do not match those of the US, the United States stands to lose even more. Benn Steil, the director of international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations, and CFR analyst Benjamin Della Rocca pointed out in The Washington Post that the trade war did not bring in “FAR MORE wealth to the US than even a phenomenal deal of the traditional kind” as US President Donald Trump said on Twitter. The tariffs only brought $8 billion into the coffers of the US government, which had to give out more than $25 billion in subsidies to farmers because of the retaliation from China. US exports to China have decreased by 15% as well.

Before the G20 summit in Osaka, hundreds of companies opposed any additional tariffs as Trump’s trade war with China not only failed to resolve trade imbalances but also caused companies to see their incomes decline.

Manufacturing industries did not leave China, nor was foreign capital withdrawn from the Chinese market. From January to June this year, 20,131 foreign-invested enterprises were established in China. The use of foreign capital increased by 7.2% to 478.33 billion yuan ($70.74 billion.)

As for the frictions over science and technology, the pressure on Huawei did not end as planned, as the company pulled out its “spare tires” program and is set to use the independent Haisi chip as well as its own in-house Hongmeng operating system.

Huawei has since received 50 orders throughout the world for its fifth-generation (5G) equipment, further highlighting that the sanctions have borne no fruit.

Although the United States remains arrogant and China retains its stern stance, it is worth pointing out that Chinese Commerce Minister Zhong Shan’s participation in the upcoming trade talks with the hawkish US team promises to make the negotiations a bit more balanced.

The power balance in the third round of the China-US economic and trade consultation is most likely to be even. With that being said, rebuilding trust will be key in the negotiations. As China is about to introduce an “unreliable list” system to counter the US entity list, the US has also extended frictions to the Taiwan Strait by passing a new arms-sales bill. In the end, only bilateral consultation can result in a win-win situation.

Education Department ruling a win for cosmetology schools and students,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/education-department-ruling-a-win-for-cosmetology-schools-and-students,"The cosmetology industry is among the fastest growing sectors in our economy because millions of Americans have come to rely on experienced, licensed cosmetologists every day. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the industry is expected to grow nearly twice as fast as the national average, by over 13% in the next few years. In 2016 alone, it generated more than $84 billion in revenue, which has helped to support workers and communities across the country.

That record of success and continued growth has been at great risk because of the Obama-era “Gainful Employment” rule. This rule could have forced cosmetology school closures across the country. This would have created a ripple effect of unintended consequences for schools, students, spas, and salons, as well as millions of Americans who rely on skilled, licensed cosmetologists every day.

Fortunately, students, schools, and consumers achieved an important win recently when Education Secretary Betsy DeVos rescinded the rule, based on its flawed construction and the inaccurate data that had been used to grade cosmetology programs.

Gainful Employment was first implemented to measure schools' success by comparing their students' debt to their presumed income after graduation. While seemingly well intentioned, the rule’s framework serves as a warning of what happens when rulemaking does not account for real-world situations.

When it came to the cosmetology industry, the rule failed to take into account a number of critical factors, including the underreporting of wages and tips. It’s well known that much like the restaurant industry, many transactions in the cosmetology industry are made in cash. As a result of underreported tips, the Gainful Employment scores of cosmetology schools were being significantly skewed.

Despite these known inaccuracies, the Education Department continued to use this metric with devastating consequences. If a school program failed, it faced ineligibility for federal aid. Students would no longer be able to use financial aid to pay for their education, ultimately forcing them to withdraw or pay out-of-pocket.

American Association of Cosmetology School members have always supported strengthening transparency in the higher education system and ensuring students can make the best choice possible for their own futures. But from day one, the association made clear that this rule was not only flawed but also had the potential to seriously damage and possibly close hundreds of reputable cosmetology schools. Even the IRS recognized how problematic the underreporting of wages and tips were on accurately measuring a school’s score.

When other efforts failed, the association filed a lawsuit against the Education Department and won. But it still left an uneven playing field across our educational institutions with an unfair advantage given to nonprofit schools.

That is because in reality, this rule did nothing more than target schools based on their tax status. According to Forbes, in 2016, only 16% of all students were actually enrolled in a program covered by the Gainful Employment rule. This means that roughly 80% of all college students were exempt from these standards. Moreover, cosmetology programs often take a year or less to complete and cost approximately $18,000, with average debt less than $10,000, significantly less than traditional four-year schools. In contrast, private, nonprofit schools average $35,000 per year.

All schools should be held to the highest standards, but those standards should be applied fairly across the board to create a level playing field.

As an industry, we believe that holding institutions of higher education to the highest standards, and ensuring students and parents have all the necessary information to make informed enrollment and borrowing choices is vital to the long-term success of both students and our schools. America’s cosmetology schools applaud Secretary DeVos and the Department of Education for ending this harmful regulation and protecting schools, students, and consumers.

Kathy Chow is the executive director of the American Association of Cosmetology Schools, representing over 600 cosmetology schools and nearly 300 school owners across the nation."

An open letter to Barack Obama:

Mr. President, it is time. You must speak. Your country needs you.

Eleven summers ago, as you accepted the Democratic nomination for president, you announced: “Tonight, I say to the people of America, to Democrats and Republicans and independents across this great land: Enough. This moment — this election — is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive.”

Of course, we knew then that our nation had deep political differences, and would continue to. Only the most naive among us would have expected the election of the first African American president to come about with no backlash.

But would anyone have anticipated that within a dozen years, we would hear another president tell four nonwhite congresswomen — three of whom were born in this country — to “go back” to where they came from?

Donald Trump’s tweets over the weekend were the basest kind of bigotry, the oldest of racist tropes. And they were a reminder that in the eyes of some, who apparently include our current president, people of color will never be seen as fully American, regardless of how many generations their families have been part of this nation’s story or how much they achieve as individuals.

President Obama, I understand your reluctance to weigh in on Trump’s latest transgression. You are a respecter of norms, including the one dictating that former presidents steer clear of criticizing their successors. And for all the barriers you shattered, racism was never a topic upon which you seemed eager to hold forth.

But silence now is unacceptable. It is time to make yourself heard.

We have long since given up expectations that anyone in Trump’s own party will do or say anything to call him out for what he is. The few who tried at the beginning have capitulated, been driven from office or walked away.

For Trump, racism is not a moral failing; it is a political tactic. None of us can really claim to understand what is in his heart, but the cynicism of his actions is apparent, and it must be exposed for what it is.

No one knows that better than you do. Trump launched his political career by spreading a blatantly racist lie that you had been born in Africa.

At the time, Americans could still be hopeful enough about who we were to write him off as a buffoon. You even joked about it. As Trump sat fuming in the audience at the 2011 White House correspondents’ dinner, you released what you said was your “official birth video.” It was a clip from “The Lion King.”

But he was just getting started. Birtherism turned out to be Trump’s original sin, the one from which so many others have followed — the 2015 presidential announcement speech in which Trump branded Mexican immigrants as drug dealers and rapists, his call for a ban on Muslims entering the country, his claim that a judge of Mexican descent born in Indiana was incapable of ruling fairly on a case involving Trump University, his declaration that there were “very fine people on both sides” of the deadly clashes between hate-fueled white supremacists and protesters in Charlottesville.

There was a political calculation behind every one of those vile statements, and as repulsed as we are with his latest racist rant, it is possible to see the calculation that is at work here as well.

Trump knows Democrats will set aside their internal differences, as they should, to rally around the four, who represent their party’s more liberal, more youthful edge. He intends to make Reps. Ayanna Pressley (Mass.), Rashida Tlaib (Mich.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.) and Ilhan Omar (Minn.) the faces of the Democratic Party, as he wants America to see it.

“These are people that if they don’t like it here, they can leave,” he said Monday. “They hate our country. They hate it, I think, with a passion.”

The irony was rich, given how incessantly Trump himself criticized this country before he was elected, and how even his campaign slogan — “Make America Great Again” — denigrated both the nation and the progress it has made.

President Obama, what we need more than anything else right now is someone who can lift the country’s sights again. Someone who can charge us, as you once did, with a mission to “march into the future. Let us keep that promise, that American promise, and in the words of scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess.”

Find your voice again. Reclaim your legacy. Do it now. It won’t wait until your memoirs."

Harlem is a neighborhood that is very special because Harlem is not just about the Apollo or 125th Street. It’s really about an attitude and a personality and a history and a legacy.

Democrats hammered Trump over Tubman $20 slow rollout. Obama set the timeline,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/democrats-hammered-trump-over-tubman-20-slow-rollout-obama-set-the-timeline,"Current and former Treasury officials that served in the Obama administration say the Harriet Tubman $20 bill's 2028 release date is consistent with plans and estimates crafted before President Trump took office.

Democrats accused Trump in June of delaying the release of the ""Tubman $20."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Trump ""refusing to honor"" Tubman is ""an insult to the hopes of millions.""

It is an insult to the hopes of millions that the Trump Administration is refusing to honor Harriet Tubman on our $20 bill. This unnecessary decision must be reversed. — Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) June 20, 2019

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the White House’s reason for the late release date, to accommodate anti-counterfeiting and other safety measures, ""is simply not credible"" in a speech on the Senate floor.

There are no women or people of color on our paper currency today, and there haven’t been for more than a century. The plan to put Harriet Tubman on the $20 note was a long overdue way to rectify that disparity. https://t.co/znLBjoqweQ — Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) June 20, 2019

The original timeline for the Tubman $20's release date was largely set under former President Barack Obama, according to the Washington Post.

Jack Lew, treasury secretary during Obama’s second term, declared in 2016 that the department would release a “final concept design” for the Tubman $20 in 2020. Officials inside the department doubted Lew’s claim based on a confidential 2013 report by the Advanced Counterfeit Deterrence committee, which oversees the new designs for currency.

The committee estimated that a new $20 bill would not be fit for public circulation until around 2030. While a concept design is released earlier than the actual currency, it is usually made public a year before printing, according to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.

“Those announcements were not grounded in reality. The U.S. had not at the time acquired the security features to redesign and protect the notes,” former bureau Director Larry Felix said, referring to hopes to release the Tubman $20 in 2020 alongside the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment that secured women’s right to vote.

Felix said that too much security work was left to be done on the design for it to be released so soon.

Neither a representative for Schumer nor Pelosi responded to a request for comment."
Communities no longer able to appeal pollution permits under forthcoming EPA rule: report,https://thehill.com,[],07-15-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/453164-communities-no-longer-able-to-appeal-pollution-permits-under,"Changing Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations could soon strip individuals and communities of the ability to challenge granted pollution permits while continuing to allow industry to appeal denials, The New York Times reported.

The rule the EPA is preparing to weaken would no longer allow community voices across the country to challenge decisions on how much pollution is legally allowed to be released at nearby power plants, according to the report.

Three people familiar with the draft plan, which has not yet been released, told the Times that industry stakeholders would still be allowed to appeal the EPA’s decisions to the Environmental Appeals Board.

The EPA did not confirm or deny the existence of the forthcoming rulemaking.

“EPA is always interested in improving its processes while maintaining environmental protection. Contrary to the speculation by certain parties, EPA is working to protect the public interest and transparently carry out its work,” an EPA spokesman said in a statement.

News of the rule change, first announced by the Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility on Friday, came the same week President Trump Donald John TrumpCNN's Camerota clashes with Trump's immigration head over president's tweet LA Times editorial board labels Trump 'Bigot-in-Chief' Trump complains of 'fake polls' after surveys show him trailing multiple Democratic candidates MORE held his environmental leadership speech at the White House. Trump preached the role his administration has played in bringing top-notch water and air protections to the U.S.

“What E.P.A. is proposing means communities and families no longer have the right to appeal a pollution permit that might affect them,” Patrice Simms, a former staff lawyer for the Environmental Appeals Board, told the Times.

Critics of the rule change say the appeals option offered communities a forum to push back on the EPA’s decisions without piling on legal fees and mounting lengthy legal cases.

Supporters of the change say it would eliminate red tape and speed up a process that ends up being decided by the courts anyway.

The rule proposal could be made public as soon as this week, according to the Times."

I had a very busy week, and I forgot.

Oh, yes, I am sure I would certainly very loudly denounce them as would my colleagues, but you see I cannot yet, because I died.

Also I don’t know what a tweet is.

Also a big bird flew through the window and scooped up my phone in its beak and dropped it into a river, so even if I was going to, you see now I cannot!

Also I am becoming a bird.

Also CAW! CAW! CAW! NO FURTHER QUESTIONS!

Also I have this condition where if anyone forces me to think hard at all about anything the president has said or done, I start to melt and then catch fire.

Seriously, my whole worldview is hanging by a very fragile thread! Please, nothing further.

Also I am invisible. You cannot see or hear me.

Also I would, but I am not a statesman any more! I spend all my time on John Boehner’s riding mower going around his lawn in slow circles with a martini! You have come to the wrong place, cowboy! I haven’t done that sort of thing for a long time!

Also I made a vow of silence unto the Lord. Oops!

Also, oh, no, I suddenly forgot how to read, so the words in front of me are all meaningless now, little squiggling black worms in milk.

Also there was a power outage somewhere in the country, so out of respect, I could not, absolutely could not, turn on my phone.

Also my phone fell out the window.

Also the Internet, I hear, fell into a lake.

Also I didn’t see you there.

I did denounce him already, surely I did! I am no coward! Did you not see it? Well, it was there! Oh, this racist remark? This new one? No, that was — never mind.

Opinion | All Presidents Are Deporters in Chief,https://www.nytimes.com,['The Editorial Board'],07-13-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/13/opinion/sunday/trump-deportations-immigration.html,"Here’s how a recent Times report described an immigrant detention facility in Clint, Tex. , that was built during the Obama administration but overfilled under Mr. Trump: “Outbreaks of scabies, shingles and chickenpox were spreading among the hundreds of children and adults who were being held in cramped cells, agents said. The stench of the children’s dirty clothing was so strong it spread to the agents’ own clothing — people in town would scrunch their noses when they left work. The children cried constantly. One girl seemed likely enough to try to kill herself that the agents made her sleep on a cot in front of them, so they could watch her as they were processing new arrivals.”

This week , Mr. Trump announced a new series of raids by ICE in at least 10 cities, aiming to arrest thousands of people who have been issued deportation orders.

“We’re focused on criminals,” Mr. Trump sai d on Friday, dodging the truth that his administration’s hard-line policies make little to no distinction between people who pose a genuine risk and those who miss an immigration court date.

The administration, for instance, publicly warned of collateral arrests as part of the new raids, threatening to detain other unauthorized immigrants who happen to be on the scene (children or other relatives, perhaps), even if they are not the main targets of the raids.

Publicity over the raids has rattled immigrant communities, as the administration clearly intended. For Mr. Trump, deterrence of illegal immigration has been a guiding principle — if not by means of a wall, then by means of cruelty toward migrants, from the squalid conditions in detainee facilities to separating children from their parents.

“It’s the complete, 100 percent focus on harsher options that will deter the influx, with a disregard for managing what’s happening,” a Department of Homeland Security official told The Times earlier this year. “We have a lot more families, a lot more unaccompanied children, and the focus has just been on how can we deter, rather than how can we handle.”

But deterrence alone can’t explain a slew of other moves — scaling back a program that protects the families of members of the military and veterans from being deported, for instance. It doesn’t explain the frantic — yet unsuccessful — effort to put a question about citizenship on the census, which experts agree would lead to an undercount of people in immigrant-heavy communities. Nor does deterrence explain removing deportation protections from nearly one million people who live in the country under the auspices of humanitarian programs or because they were brought to the country as children."
Devin Nunes: GOP will grill Mueller about top prosecutor's briefing with AP reporters,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-14-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/devin-nunes-gop-will-grill-mueller-about-top-prosecutors-mystery-briefing-with-ap-reporters,"Rep. Devin Nunes said Republicans plan to grill former special counsel Robert Mueller about his top prosecutor when he testifies in an open setting later this month.

Andrew Weissmann, who was known as Mueller's ""pitbull,"" will be the subject of multiple lines of inquiry, the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee told Fox News' Bill Hemmer on an episode of the ""Hemmer Time"" podcast.

In a preview of what he and his GOP colleagues will ask on July 24, Nunes said Mueller will be pressed on why the FBI withheld from his panel that Weissmann briefed Associated Press reporters in 2017 on ""something to do with the Trump-Russia investigation"" before the Mueller team had assembled. Nunes said the House Intelligence Committee, which was investigating Russian election interference, was never told why Weissmann was talking to these journalists.

He indicated this is significant as Weissmann was briefed on British ex-spy Christopher Steele's dossier, which contained salacious and unverified claims about President Trump's ties to Russia, in the summer of 2016. Nunes said Weissmann ""was in the chain of custody of the major piece of evidence that started this investigation.""

The Daily Caller reported in July 2018 that documents show Weissmann arranged the April meeting with four AP reporters and other FBI officials meeting to discuss former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. In a pre-hearing trial, FBI special agent Jeffrey Pfeiffer suggested the meeting the FBI may have conducted its May 2017 raid of a storage locker bring rented by Manafort based on an AP tip.

“Associated Press journalists met with representatives from the Department of Justice in an effort to get information on stories they were reporting, as reporters do. During the course of the meeting, they asked DOJ representatives about a storage locker belonging to Paul Manafort, without sharing its name or location,"" AP spokeswoman Lauren Easton told the outlet.

Manafort is serving prison time after being found guilty of federal tax fraud, bank fraud, and foreign lobbying violations due to charges stemming from Mueller's investigation.

Calling the investigation an ""obstruction of justice trap"" that began without evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, Nunes called for accountability. ""These are all a bunch of dirty cops and I'll tell you,"" the California Republican said. ""I'll tell you — some of them better go to jail, or we're going to go down in a spiral in this country because you will not have a Republican that will trust the FBI or the Department of Justice for generations to come.""

According to Michael Wolff's book Siege, Weissmann, who recently scored a book deal, led the initiative to draft a three-count obstruction of justice indictment against Trump, which Mueller's spokesman denied existed.

Mueller was originally scheduled to testify before the House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees next week, but after members complained about strict limits for questioning, Democratic Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler of New York and Democratic Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff of California announced on Friday that a deal had been struck for a less stringent hearing to take place on July 24.

Trump disparaged Mueller and top ex-officials on Saturday, claiming that the special counsel's team engaged in ""illegal"" activity by deleting text messages exchanged between former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. ""This is one of the most horrible abuses of all. Those texts between gaga lovers would have told the whole story. Illegal deletion by Mueller. They gave us 'the insurance policy,'"" Trump tweeted.

Strzok and Page were said to be involved in an affair as they sent each other text messages that displayed disdain for Trump while they were involved in the Hillary Clinton emails and Russia investigations. Strzok was fired from the FBI in August 2018 and Page resigned a couple months earlier.

Mueller’s report, released by the Justice Department with redactions in April, concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 election but did not establish that any members of the Trump campaign criminally conspired with the Russians in these efforts. Mueller did not reach a conclusion on obstruction of justice, but Attorney General William Barr and then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein concluded there was insufficient evidence for such a crime.

Barr is now engaged in investigating the origins of the Russia investigation and tasked U.S. Attorney John Durham with leading the effort. That inquiry is being supplemented by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigation into alleged abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which is looking into Steele and his dossier.

Steele's dossier on Trump was used by the FBI to obtain FISA warrants to surveil onetime Trump campaign aide Carter Page.

Four FISA warrant applications and renewals were filed from October 2016 through June 2017 against Page. The applications relied heavily on the unverified dossier compiled by Steele, who was hired by Fusion GPS. The opposition research firm was hired by Marc Elias of the Perkins Coie law firm at the behest of the Clinton presidential campaign. Steele and Fusion GPS shopped the research around to various government figures, including one skeptical State Department official, as well as the media in the run-up to the 2016 election."

E.P.A. Plans to Curtail the Ability of Communities to Oppose Pollution Permits,https://www.nytimes.com,['Coral Davenport'],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/climate/epa-community-pollution-appeal.html,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.

WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency is preparing to weaken rules that for the past quarter-century have given communities a voice in deciding how much pollution may legally be released by nearby power plants and factories.

The changes would eliminate the ability of individuals or community advocates to appeal against E.P.A.-issued pollution permits before a panel of agency judges. However, the industrial permit-holders could still appeal to the panel, known as the Environmental Appeals Board, to allow them to increase their pollution.

The draft plan was described by three people familiar with the document, who requested anonymity because the proposal is not yet public. The document has been largely completed, they said, and the next step would be to announce the proposed rule change and seek public comment.

“This is outrageous,” said Richard Lazarus, an environmental law professor at Harvard. “Individuals in communities will lose a way to seek relief from pollution that has historically been very effective. But industry will still be able to seek relief to pollute more.”"
Treasury's Mnuchin says deal to raise U.S. debt ceiling getting close,https://www.reuters.com,"['Jeff Mason', 'Min Read']",07-15-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-debt/treasurys-mnuchin-says-deal-to-raise-us-debt-ceiling-getting-close-idUSKCN1UA250,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday the Trump administration and Congress were getting close to a deal on raising the U.S. debt ceiling and he urged lawmakers to take action on the issue before leaving for an August recess.

In addition, Mnuchin and congressional leaders have been discussing a possible two-year budget deal that would set overall federal spending levels for fiscal 2020, which begins on Oct. 1, and for fiscal 2021, he told reporters during a briefing at the White House.

Mnuchin said he did not see a government shutdown looming over the issue. He said there was a preference in both parties to agree on the debt ceiling increase and a budget pact.

“That is the first choice, and I think... we’re getting closer,” Mnuchin said.

U.S. borrowing authority could be exhausted sometime in September, according to the latest administration estimates, rather than in October or November, as had earlier been projected.

That means the government could hit its credit limit just as Congress comes back into session in the fall if it does not reach a deal to raise the debt limit before then.

Without an extension of that authority, the Treasury would have difficulty getting lenders to continue servicing a public debt that has topped $22 trillion, potentially causing defaults that likely would shake global financial markets.

Without a budget deal, defense and non-defense programs could face deep, across-the-board spending cuts that most Republicans and Democrats want to avoid or partial government shutdowns.

Mnuchin said all parties wanted to reach a deal on budget issues, along with the debt ceiling.

He said that if a deal on all of the issues were not reached before lawmakers were scheduled to recess for the summer, they should either stay put or approve an increase in the debt ceiling on its own.

“I think we’re very close to a deal, but as you know, these deals are complicated,” he said.

Last week, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said, “There will not be any question that we will raise the debt ceiling,” but he did not predict when legislation to do so might clear Congress."

Obama latest presidential statue in South Dakota city,https://www.channel3000.com,['Nicole Chavez'],07-14-2019,2019,7,https://www.channel3000.com/news/national-news/obama-latest-presidential-statue-in-south-dakota-city/1095102557,"Shizuo Kambayashi - Pool / Getty Images Barack Obama

Former President Barack Obama is joining a ""City of Presidents"" in western South Dakota.

A life-size bronze statue of Obama was unveiled Saturday in Rapid City. The sculpture, created by artist James Van Nuys, is part of a collection of figures honoring past US presidents throughout the city's downtown district.

But Obama's statue is slightly different than the others.

The City of Presidents project, the private group behind the statues, initially planned to release the statue within nine months and it took them about two years. Members had planned to show Obama only standing and waving when they decided to brainstorm more ideas.

""One of us said, 'This is boring. This is not going to have the wow factor,'"" said Dallerie Davis, the group's co-founder. ""A man waving is not a showstopper.""

The new statue depicts the former President waving with one hand and holding his daughter Sasha with his other hand.

Van Nuys said the sculpture was inspired by photo that showed the father and daughter walking on a stage at Chicago's Grant Park when Obama was first elected president.

The Obamas' statue is the fourth sculpture he's created for the project, CNN affiliate KOTA reported.

The sculptures, which are privately funded, have been placed through the streets of downtown Rapid City since 2000 to honor the legacy of the presidents. They are placed in a ""coherent structure"" to ""eliminate any sense of favoritism or political gain,"" according to the city's website. It was not immediately clear where the new statue will be installed."
"Megan Rapinoe will be my Secretary of State, presidential candidate Jay Inslee jokes",https://news.yahoo.com,['Matt Brannon'],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://news.yahoo.com/megan-rapinoe-secretary-state-presidential-005250281.html,"Redding, Calif., native Megan Rapinoe's performance on the international stage during and after the Women's World Cup in France has drawn the attention of Democratic presidential hopeful Jay Inslee, who quipped over the weekend that his ""first act"" as president would be asking the soccer star to serve as secretary of State.

""I should think about getting a secretary of State who has asked us to embrace more unity across the world and more love rather than hate,"" the Democratic candidate and Washington governor said Saturday. ""So my first act will be to ask Megan Rapinoe to be my secretary of State.""

Inslee's comment drew a mix of laughter and applause from the audience at Netroots Nation, a Philadelphia conference for progressive political activists.

""I haven't asked her yet, so this could be a surprise to her,"" Inslee continued.

The remark, delivered as a joke, was part of a longer answer about how a potential Inslee administration would differentiate itself from President Donald Trump's approach to foreign policy.

After pausing for audience reaction, Inslee finished his answer, using Rapinoe's post-World Cup stardom to contrast his vision with Trump's.

""I actually believe this because I think what she (Rapinoe) has said that has inspired us so much is such an antithesis of the president’s foreign policies,"" Inslee said, advocating for better relationships with international allies.

Rapinoe later responded indirectly when she was asked if she'd consider a career in politics on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" Sunday.

""I'm not sure I'm qualified for office,"" she told Chuck Todd.

""There's no qualifications for office these days,"" Todd joked.

""Yeah, that's true. Up to 44, I guess there was,"" Rapinoe said, alluding to Trump's being the country's 45th president.

Inslee isn't the only Democratic presidential candidate to suggest Rapinoe has a place in politics. When Rep. Eric Swalwell, who represents California's 15th Congressional District, withdrew from the presidential race in a press conference last week, he jokingly floated a Rapinoe endorsement.

""If Megan Rapinoe gets in the race, I'm probably going to endorse her. I think she turns 35 next July,"" Swalwell said, referencing the minimum age to run for president.

A July poll this month found that Rapinoe has a lead over Trump in a potential general election matchup, 42% to 41%, according to left-leaning firm Public Policy Polling.

""Rapinoe may be an unlikely Presidential candidate but her numbers still speak to a broader truth about Trump’s standing,"" a writeup on the poll stated.

Rapinoe has drawn criticism from Trump and his supporters for saying she wouldn't visit the White House. The soccer star has also called the president's message exclusionary and protested during the national anthem.

Former DHS chief warns immigrants not to open doors for ICE without a warrant,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Camilo Montoya-Galvez'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeh-johnson-on-face-the-nation-former-dhs-chief-warns-immigrants-not-to-open-doors-for-ice-without-a-warrant/,"Jeh Johnson, who led the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) during President Obama's second term, advised undocumented immigrants they are not required to open the doors of their homes to immigration authorities unless agents produce a warrant signed by a judge.

""If someone from ICE ERO comes to someone's home — unless they have a warrant — that person is not required to admit them,"" Johnson said on ""Face the Nation"" Sunday, referring to the Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) branch of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) which is responsible for apprehending people the government seeks to deport.

ICE was slated to begin a new wave of roundups on Sunday targeting about 2,000 undocumented families with open deportation orders living in major U.S. cities. The operations were first publicly announced last month by President Trump, who postponed them for a few weeks.

To prepare for the raids — which have left many undocumented immigrants living in constant fear — advocacy groups and Democrats have mobilized to mount a high-profile campaign designed to inform people who could be targeted about their rights and other information, one of them being Johnson's advice.

Pro-immigrant organizations want to make sure people are not opening their doors to ICE agents who do not have a search and seizure warrant signed by a judge. When conducting roundups, ICE agents often produce an administration warrant — but attorneys say that by itself does not give them the right to enter private property to apprehend someone.

Johnson also noted that just because someone is apprehended, that does not mean the person is automatically deported without access to any legal recourse.

""They have a right to a lawyer and they should not be deported from this country unless there has been a final order of deportation by an immigration judge after the individuals had an opportunity to go through the appellate process and make whatever claims for asylum they have,"" he said.

In fact, he suggested that some of deportations of those who are apprehended by ICE during the looming sweeps will be delayed or stopped as attorneys file motions to reopen their cases in immigration court. He noted that judges often grant new hearings for those who were ordered deported without being present in the courtroom. Attorneys have said that many people miss court because of bureaucratic errors, like their notices to appear being sent late or to the wrong address.

""Very often if someone's ordered deported in absentia without being present in court they have a right to a rehearing,"" Johnson said. ""And so it's important for people particularly today and over the next week to know exactly what their rights are.""

Like Obama, when Johnson was at the helm of DHS, he came under fire from progressive and pro-immigrant activists for the millions of deportations during their administration, as well as for his handling of the 2014 surge of unaccompanied migrant children from Central America coming to the U.S.-Mexico border. He and other Obama-era officials have noted that many of those deported during those years had criminal convictions and were migrants who had recently crossed into the U.S. illegally."
New York Times: EPA to limit ability to oppose pollution permits,https://www.cnn.com,['Devan Cole'],07-15-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/15/politics/epa-pollution-permits-regulation-changes/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Environmental Protection Agency is working to change rules that allow individuals or community advocates to fight agency-issued permits that regulate how much pollution can be released by area power plants and factories, The New York Times reported.

The Times, citing conversations with three unnamed people familiar with the plans, said the potential changes could come as early as this week. According to the paper, the regulations, which were created during George H. W. Bush's administration, allowed individuals or community advocates to appeal the permits before a panel of judges within the agency. The changes would eliminate that ability but allow the permit holders to ""appeal to the panel, known as the Environmental Appeals Board, to allow them to increase their pollution,"" according to the paper.

The Times' report, published Friday, said the documents for the changes have ""been largely completed,"" and ""the next step would be to announce the proposed rule change and seek public comment,"" a period the paper said could last 60 to 90 days.

Patrice Simms, a former staff lawyer for the agency's appeals board who now works as an environmental attorney, and Richard Lazarus, an environmental law professor at Harvard, told the paper that the potential changes could give companies ""a broader role in influencing the EPA to issue more lenient pollution permits,"" and could be especially harmful to ""poor and minority communities, which are statistically more likely to be located near polluting sites.""

""What EPA is proposing means communities and families no longer have the right to appeal a pollution permit that might affect them,"" Simms said, according to the Times. He added that when the EPA issues pollution permits, ""they may or may not get it right,"" according to the paper.

In a 2-1 decision that overturns a nationwide injunction, the DOJ is now allowed to give preferential treatment for community policing grants to cities that don't defy federal immigration enforcement.

""The department is pleased that the court recognized the lawful authority of the administration to provide favorable treatment when awarding discretionary law enforcement grants to jurisdictions that assist in enforcing federal immigration laws,"" the DOJ said in a statement.

DHS LEADING INTERNAL INVESTIGATION INTO RAID LEAKS

While the Trump administration has faced numerous obstacles in cutting funding to sanctuary cities, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals appears to make an exception for the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) grant program, which is meant to help cities hire more police officers.

Other factors in the program's ""points"" system include the hiring of veterans, and the occurrence of school shootings within a jurisdiction. In 2017, the DOJ under then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions implemented points that benefit non-sanctuary cities.

Broken Promises: Teachers Sue U.S. Over Student Loans That Weren't Forgiven,https://www.npr.org,['Chris Arnold'],07-11-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/2019/07/11/739860400/broken-promises-teachers-sue-u-s-over-student-loans-that-werent-forgiven,"Broken Promises: Teachers Sue U.S. Over Student Loans That Weren't Forgiven

Updated at 1:09 p.m. ET

Debbie Baker thought she qualified for a federal program that helps teachers such as her, as well as nurses, police officers, librarians and others. The Department of Education program forgives their federal student loans if they make their payments for 10 years and work in public service.

For 10 years, Baker, who was a public school teacher in Tulsa, Okla., checked in with loan servicing companies and was told she was on track.

""I said, 'I'm qualifying for public service loan forgiveness,' and they said, 'OK, great,' "" she says.

But it turns out that her $76,000 in student loans didn't get forgiven. Baker was finally told she was in the wrong type of loan. If she'd known that at the beginning, she could have switched loans and ended up qualifying. But she says nobody ever told her.

""When this hit ... I didn't know whether to cry, throw up, get mad,"" she says. ""I honestly did not think the federal government would do this to someone.""

Now, Baker is a plaintiff in a lawsuit being brought by one of the biggest teachers unions in the country against the Department of Education. The suit alleges the loan forgiveness program for millions of public service workers is in such a shambles that it violates federal law and the Constitution.

Have you had problems qualifying for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program? Share your story with NPR.

The American Federation of Teachers filed the lawsuit Thursday in federal court. In the complaint obtained by NPR, the union is asking the court to order the department to fix the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program so that it meets legal standards. It's also asking the department to come up with an appeals process for people who believe they have been treated unfairly.

Congress created the program more than a decade ago to encourage public service. So, if you make loan payments for 10 years and you work in a qualifying job for the government or a nonprofit, the program promises to forgive the remainder of your federal student loan debt.

That promise sounded really good to a lot of people. More than 1 million have filed official paperwork to take part in the program. But there's a problem.

""The promise is broken, virtually all the time,"" says Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers. ""This is a debacle.""

Plenty of consumer watchdogs agree.

""The Department of Education just cannot seem to get this right,"" says Christopher Peterson, a law professor at the University of Utah and a former top attorney at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. ""They keep making mistakes and are not appropriately administering this program that Congress has created.""

By the department's last count, only 1% of the people who think they've made their 10 years of payments and apply for loan forgiveness are getting approved.

If you took all the people getting rejected and got them together in one place, Peterson says, you'd have ""football stadiums full of nurses, firefighters, teachers, law enforcement officers that are seeking to have their debts forgiven.""

He says they've made ""all of these payments under the impression that they were on track, and now they're being turned away in droves.""

As happened with Debbie Baker, if a student loan borrower is in the wrong type of loan, or the wrong type of repayment plan, they can't qualify for loan forgiveness.

There are different kinds of federal loans and a wide array of payment plans. If a student loan borrower is told they need to switch from one type to the other to qualify for the program, that's easy enough to do. For public service loan forgiveness, borrowers need to have a ""direct federal loan."" But if their loan servicer never tells them that, they can remain in the wrong type of loan or plan for years, thinking they're making progress toward loan forgiveness only to find out later that none of those payments counted towards forgiveness.

The teachers union lawsuit alleges that the Department of Education ""knows of — but completely disregards — repeated misrepresentations made by [student loan] servicers to borrowers who are attempting to qualify ... resulting in unwarranted denials of loan forgiveness.""

In other words, people like Baker aren't given the right information or advice, and many end up in the wrong types of loans or repayment plans and get unfairly disqualified. Government reports and investigations have found similar problems with borrowers getting bad information.

The lawsuit also alleges that loan servicers are having trouble keeping track of the number of qualifying payments people make — even when they are in the correct loan and payment plan and manage to do everything right.

Weingarten says the program is hurting the very people it's supposed to help. ""It is so broken, it is so unfair that it violates our basic United States Constitution requirement of due process,"" she says.

Another problem with borrowers getting rejected after many years of thinking they were on track is that many make life decisions based on the expectation of loan forgiveness.

Janelle Menzel is a high school math teacher in Brainerd, Minn. She says people would ask her: ""You have a degree in math, why are you teaching?"" She says they would tell her she could make ""so much more money in the private sector.""

Menzel says she loves teaching. And she thought she was going to get her student loans forgiven, so financially she decided it made sense. ""Oh yeah, definitely. That was a factor in it,"" she says.

But Menzel says that after 10 years of making payments, she was told by her loan servicer that she was in the wrong type of payment plan and couldn't qualify.

If a call center worker had told her that 10 years before, she easily could have switched into the right kind of loan. But she says nobody ever told her. And so that never happened.

She remembers after contacting her loan servicer repeatedly, trying to find a way to appeal, a call center worker told her, ""Look, you just need to give up.""

""And I remember sitting at the table watching my kids running around and playing and just thinking, man, I am stuck with this now,"" Menzel says. Thoughts of ""the freedom that would come with being released of the student loan debt kind of came crashing in in that moment,"" she adds.

Congress passed a partial fix, called Temporary Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness, that was designed to help at least some borrowers. But the teachers union lawsuit alleges the Department of Education ""has mismanaged [that program] as well."" As of March 2019, only 3.6% of applications for that new program have been approved.

The Department of Education says it can't comment on ongoing litigation. But the department's press secretary, Liz Hill, said in a statement to NPR on Thursday, ""the Department has improved internal processes and enhanced communications and outreach to borrowers."" As an example, Hill pointed to an automated PSLF Help Tool that assists borrowers in determining whether they are in the right types of loans and payment plans, and which forms to submit.

She also pointed to a department blog post about avoiding common mistakes.

The teachers union is asking the court to order a new appeals process through which the department could use its power to forgive or ""discharge"" loans for borrowers who were treated unfairly.

But in its statement, the department says it ""expects few people to be immediately eligible for a loan discharge under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program due, in large part, to complexities of the program Congress created more than a decade ago.""

For those borrowers interested in the program, the Education Department says submitting an Employment Certification Form annually is key to making sure that borrowers are on track to qualify for forgiveness.

Navient, one of the nation's largest loan servicer companies, is not commenting on the lawsuit. But the company said in a statement to NPR, ""We understand the frustration borrowers face in navigating a complex federal loan program, which is why we consistently advocate for policy reforms to simplify the system.""

The Department of Education recently implemented a dramatic fix to a different program, TEACH Grants, that's now returning grant money to thousands of people who had grants taken away unfairly.

Acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan under federal investigation for alleged leaks,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,['Ap Photo Pablo Martinez Monsivais'],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/acting-dhs-secretary-mcaleenan-under-federal-investigation-for-alleged-leaks-officials,"Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan is at the center of a federal investigation into the leak of confidential government information in late June that forced Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to call off a nationwide operation, three senior administration officials told the Washington Examiner.

Following the publishing of sensitive leaked law enforcement information on June 21, then-acting ICE Director Mark Morgan’s team followed department protocol and reported the incident to the ICE Joint Intake Center so they could investigate. JIC is an agency office that handles internal investigations of personnel misconduct, sexual abuse, staff neglect, or violations of responsibilities that may have contributed to such incidents.

“There is an ongoing investigation. An internal investigation has been launched,” one official said in a phone call Friday.

The investigation, which is not a criminal probe, is centered around the leader of the department’s 240,000 employees, as well as at least one aide, for possible involvement in the leak. ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It's not clear if JIC has referred the matter to the DHS Office of the Inspector General.

“Any investigation into the malicious, unauthorized disclosure of the operations is completely justified. Any causal observer would logically deduce that McAleenan’s dodgy response and coy behavior warrant additional scrutiny,” a second senior official said late Thursday.

A third official said the department’s decision to pursue the investigation of the acting secretary in itself was “very troubling.”

“It’s worrisome that it took days for the acting secretary to acknowledge and then deny the allegations, and it’s telling that he didn’t call for the investigation in the first place. More than anything, it’s unfortunate that people are even having this discussion at all,” the official wrote in a text.

McAleenan was named by three senior administration officials and two former officials as the orchestrator of the leak, charging he wanted to sabotage ICE’s monthslong plan to find and arrest around 2,000 people who had been denied asylum and not left the country. McAleenan opposed the plan because of its potential to remove a parent from a household with children in it.

Three officials have claimed McAleenan ordered Morgan on two occasions in the two weeks leading up to the planned June 23 operation to not carry it out, orders that would have contradicted the White House’s support and approval. Morgan contacted the White House following McAleenan’s warning to try to carry it out, according to three current and two former senior administration officials.

“That’s our belief,” one official told the Washington Examiner in late June, when asked if McAleenan was behind the leak. “The secretary was not supportive from day one.”

The acting secretary, who was in El Paso Thursday to show mayors from southern border cities conditions of Border Patrol facilities, has not mentioned the investigation in the weeks since the leak.

He directly denied being the leaker during an interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham last week, but on Sunday dodged the same question when it was asked by ABC News host Martha Raddatz.

“I find it interesting that he demanded an investigation into the Border Patrol Facebook, but he didn’t demand an investigation into the leak. If he was innocent of this, why didn’t he?” said a senior former official.

The official was referring to a Facebook page on which border patrol agents made vulgar and derisive posts.

The planned raids in cities such as Los Angeles, Miami, and Houston, were first reported by the Washington Post the day after its reporter traveled on a government plane with the acting secretary and aides to the border.

ICE is now planning to carry out raids nationwide this weekend, though it is not clear if the same people targeted in the canceled ones from June will be the focus of these new ones. The raids were reported Friday as having started earlier than expected."
