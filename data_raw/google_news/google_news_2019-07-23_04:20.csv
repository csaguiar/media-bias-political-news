"Trump announces 'real compromise' on budget deal, as fiscal hawks and some Dems cry foul",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Sen. Rand Paul', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-budget-deal-congressional-leaders,"The Trump administration and congressional leaders, including Democrats, have reached a critical debt and budget agreement that all but eliminates the risk of another government shut down this fall -- but that has already drawn fierce blowback from fiscal conservatives worried about overspending, as well as progressives unhappy with where the money could go.

The deal announced Monday evening, which requires congressional approval, would increase spending caps by $320 billion relative to the limits prescribed in the 2011 Budget Control Act, whose spending-control provisions have been repeatedly waived since 2014. It also would suspend the debt ceiling and permit more government borrowing until July 31, 2021 -- after the next presidential election.

The compromise reportedly outraged Democrat Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, the ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, who noted the bill would not block Trump from spending money on his proposed border wall.

""I'm worried the House is willing to give him far too much discretion to take money and move it anywhere he wants including a wall,"" Leahy, D-Vt., told The Washington Post. ""So the way it is now I will not vote for it. . . . The other 99 can vote for it, I won’t.""

However, in a statement, Leahy later said he would ""support the bill"" because it ""will raise the debt limit for the next two years and stave off economic catastrophe"" and reverse ""unsustainable cuts in non-defense discretionary spending.""

Leahy added, ""I understand there is a statement of principles between congressional leaders and the White House, and I have many concerns with its content.""

In the end, domestic programs would on average receive 4-percent increases in the first year of the pact, with much of those gains eaten up by veterans increases and an unavoidable surge for the U.S. Census. Defense would jump to $738 billion next year, a 3-percent hike.

President Trump would retain flexibility to transfer money between accounts, raising the possibility of attempted transfers for building border barriers.

In response, North Carolina GOP Rep. Mark Walker tweeted out a picture of the Joker lighting a pile of money on fire, from the 2008 ""Batman"" film ""The Dark Knight."" (""All you care about is money,"" the Joker laments to a hardened career criminal as the money burns. ""This town deserves a better class of criminal. And I'm going to give it to them."")

Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican, called the deal a ""huge mistake"" because it gets rid of automatic spending cuts.

""It scraps the sequester, which is a huge mistake,"" Paul told Fox News. ""It would be a huge mistake if the Republican leadership agrees to this.""

WATCH: RAND PAUL TALKS ABOUT THE IMPACT OF ALL THIS GOVERNMENT SPENDING

But Georgia Republican Sen. David Perdue told Fox News that the sequestration spending caps ""never fulfilled their mission,"" in part because Congress regularly waived them.

""It would be a huge mistake if the Republican leadership agrees to this."" — Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.

""I would blow them up,"" Perdue said. ""Mandatory spending has blown through the roof.""

Texas Republican Rep. John Cornyn told Fox News, ""I wish we could address debt and deficit reduction. But it’s not going to happen on this deal.""

Despite the mixed reception on Capitol Hill, the president and top congressional leaders were ebullient about the deal.

""I am pleased to announce that a deal has been struck with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy - on a two-year Budget and Debt Ceiling, with no poison pills,"" Trump tweeted.

""Poison pills"" generally refers to undesirable attachments stuck onto budget bills, and in this context, Trump was likely referring to the fact that the budget compromise keeps the Hyde Amendment -- which bars government funding for most abortions -- intact. Additionally, the bill gives Trump latitude to fund border wall construction.

He added: ""This was a real compromise in order to give another big victory to our Great Military and Vets!""

In a statement, Pelosi, D-Calif., and Schumer, D-N.Y., said the compromise deal will ""enhance our national security and invest in middle class.""

“Democrats are also pleased to have secured robust funding for critical domestic priorities in this agreement,"" they said. ""Democrats have always insisted on parity in increases between defense and non-defense, and we are pleased that our increase in non-defense budget authority exceeds the defense number by $10 billion over the next two years. It also means Democrats secured an increase of more than $100 billion in funding for domestic priorities since President Trump took office.""

McConnell, for his part, said he ""commended"" Trump for seeing the deal through.

""I am very encouraged that the administration and Speaker Pelosi have reached a two-year funding agreement that secures the resources we need to keep rebuilding our armed forces,"" McConnell, R-Ky., said. ""This was our top objective: Continuing to restore the readiness of our armed forces and modernize our military to deter and defend against growing threats to our national security. That includes investing in our facilities here at home, like Ft. Knox, Ft. Campbell, and the Blue Grass Army Depot, which my state of Kentucky is proud to host.""

Democrats celebrated that, under the new deal, the domestic, non-military budget receives larger increases than the defense budget, when compared to last year. Democrats also lauded the deal's allocation of $2.5 billion for the 2020 Census, following the fierce battle over adding a citizenship question to the survey.

TRUMP ANNOUNCES EXECUTIVE ORDER TO COUNT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, 'NOT BACKING DOWN' AFTER CENSUS LEGAL DEFEAT

The deal also comes as budget deficits have been rising to $1 trillion levels — requiring the government to borrow a quarter for every dollar the government spends — despite the thriving economy and three rounds of annual Trump budget proposals promising to crack down on the domestic programs that Pelosi has been defending.

It apparently ignored warnings from fiscal conservatives saying the nation's spending has been unsustainable and eventually will drag down the economy.

""This agreement is a total abdication of fiscal responsibility by Congress and the president,"" said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a Washington advocacy group. ""It may end up being the worst budget agreement in our nation's history, proposed at a time when our fiscal conditions are already precarious.""

Prospects for an agreement, a months-long priority of McConnell's, came far brighter when Pelosi returned to Washington this month and aggressively pursued the pact with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who was anointed lead negotiator instead of more conservative options such as acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney or hardline Budget Director Russell Vought.

Mnuchin was said to have been eager to avert a crisis over the government's debt limit. There was some risk of a first-ever U.S. default in September, and that had added urgency to the negotiations.

McCarthy, the House Republican leader, conceded in a statement that ""while this deal is not perfect, compromise is necessary in divided government.""

""The Trump Administration and Congressional Republicans have undertaken an extraordinary rebuilding of America’s military,"" McCarthy said. ""Given that sequestration cut defense spending more than non-defense, we are pleased that the agreement provides $20 billion more for defense than non-defense over two years.""

""Furthermore, as Democrats continue to try to impose their radical policies on issues of life, border security, and presidential harassment, this deal locks out Democrat poison pills to must-pass funding bills,"" McCarthy concluded. ""In particular, this deal maintains the Hyde Amendment and continues to grant the President the authority to keep our border and country safe.""

Added Oklahoma Republican Sen. Jim Inhofe, who serves as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee: “I’ve said over and over again that we need a budget deal that prioritizes defense—and I am pleased this budget agreement does just that by providing predictability and much-needed growth to our defense budget.""

DOJ tells Mueller to limit testimony to his report,https://www.politico.com,"['Eliana Johnson', 'Andrew Desiderio', 'Kyle Cheney']",07-22-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/22/justice-mueller-congress-testimony-limit-1426035,"As a private citizen, former special counsel Robert Mueller is not bound by assertions of presidential privilege, but he is known as a rule follower who is unlikely to defy the administration’s directions to limit his testimony. | Alex Wong/Getty Images legal DOJ tells Mueller to limit testimony to his report The Justice Department argues that anything outside the report is covered by 'presidential privilege' that hasn’t been waived.

Justice Department officials have communicated to Robert Mueller that the department expects him to limit his congressional testimony this week to the public findings of his 448-page report, according to one current and one former U.S. official familiar with the preparations.

In extensive discussions since the former special counsel was subpoenaed on June 25 to testify, department officials have emphasized that they consider any evidence he gathered throughout the course of his investigation to be “presumptively privileged” and shielded from public disclosure.

Story Continued Below

The Justice Department is “taking the position that anything outside the written pages of the report are things about which presidential privilege hasn’t been waived,” the former U.S. official said.

The White House and the Justice Department, however, have signaled they don’t intend to place lawyers in the room during Mueller’s highly anticipated testimony before the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees on Wednesday.

Without a presence at the hearing, administration officials would have little recourse to prevent Mueller from going off-script and revealing details of his investigation that the White House considers off-limits. They are poised instead to rely on Mueller to self-police his remarks, indicating that they are confident the former special counsel will stick to carefully planned comments that mirror the already disclosed findings of his investigation.

Their stance cuts against President Donald Trump’s own protestation that Mueller shouldn’t be allowed to testify, which he reiterated on Monday. “Highly conflicted Robert Mueller should not be given another bite at the apple,” Trump tweeted on Monday morning.

The president has accused Democrats of trying to conduct a “do-over” of Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election — a probe that he has falsely claimed “exonerates” him.

Mueller’s posture will likely deprive Democrats of an opportunity to get a clear answer from Mueller about whether he would have charged Trump with obstruction of justice if he were not the president, among other burning questions. Mueller said publicly after the report’s release that he adhered to a Justice Department policy prohibiting the indictment of a sitting president.

But some Democrats have said that even if Mueller simply reads from his report word for word, it would educate the American public about Trump’s attempts to thwart the Russia probe.

Jim Popkin, a spokesman for Mueller, said he was unsure whether Mueller was in contact with the Justice Department about aspects of his investigation that the administration believes would be off-limits during his testimony.

“In terms of DOJ and the Hill, there have been discussions for purposes of scheduling and clearly … to understand what the expectations are,” Popkin told POLITICO. “But they have not seen the [opening] statement. They’ve not provided the statement to either DOJ or anyone in the House.”

Popkin emphasized that Mueller’s opening statement would stay within “the four walls of the report as much as that is possible.”

Mueller has stated that his congressional testimony would not go beyond what is contained within his report.

The report “contains our findings and analysis, and the reasons for the decisions we made,” Mueller said on May 29. “We chose those words carefully, and the work speaks for itself. The report is my testimony.”

Jay Sekulow, one of Trump’s personal attorneys, said on his radio show Monday that he, too, believes Mueller will not speak publicly about matters outside of his report.

“I think that would be completely unethical to go beyond the report,” Sekulow said, adding that he expects Republicans — who say they are essentially seeking to cross-examine Mueller and press him on the origins of the probe — to also face roadblocks.

The Justice Department’s deference to Mueller cuts against the administration’s handling of efforts by Congress to interview former officials who were crucial witnesses in the special counsel investigation.

White House lawyers have accompanied those high-level witnesses subpoenaed by Congress, including Trump’s former communications director Hope Hicks, to their hearings, objecting to hundreds of questions lobbed at them by Democratic lawmakers on the grounds that any conversations that took place during their time in the White House are subject to presidential privilege claims. The White House has consistently pushed the idea that some current and former advisers are “absolutely immune” from answering questions about their White House tenures.

Negotiations over the scope of Mueller’s testimony have taken place under a veil of secrecy. Justice Department officials have been discussing the parameters of Mueller’s testimony with him and his team ever since the former special counsel was subpoenaed last month.

Attorney General William Barr has said publicly that Mueller is free to testify on Capitol Hill, but he has also said that he would support Mueller if he decides to skip the hearing. The Justice Department has not indicated publicly whether it will direct Mueller to limit his remarks in any way, but a spokesperson said in a cryptic statement that the department expects Mueller to keep his testimony within the bounds of the report.

“As the attorney general has said, we support special counsel Mueller if he wants to testify or if he doesn’t want to testify,” a Justice Department official said. “He has said publicly that his report is his testimony and that is our expectation. We support that approach.”

As a private citizen, Mueller is not bound by assertions of presidential privilege, but he is known as a rule-follower who is unlikely to defy the administration’s direction.

A Judiciary Committee official said the panel does not anticipate that lawmakers will spar with Mueller over matters of presidential privilege.

“[T]hese are private individuals who no longer work at the Department of Justice. And although we acknowledge that these are career department officials who give quite a bit of deference to what the department says, the department cannot order them to do anything,” the Judiciary Committee official said.

Even though Trump and his aides are projecting a hands-off approach, they’ve signaled that they expect Mueller to closely guard the voluminous evidence he gathered about the inner workings of the Trump White House.

Trump’s former counsel Emmet Flood warned the Justice Department in April that it considers any of Mueller’s evidence, other than what’s contained in the public version of his report, “presumptively privileged” and forbidden from public disclosure.

In May, Trump asserted executive privilege over the entirety of Mueller’s report and the underlying evidence as part of a bid to block the House Judiciary Committee’s access to the complete, unredacted report.

Trump invoked the broad privilege claim just minutes before the committee voted to hold Barr in contempt of Congress — a move that came after hours of exhaustive negotiations between the committee and the Justice Department over how to delay the contempt proceedings. The White House later called the committee’s demands “unlawful and reckless.”

Elizabeth Warren warns that Trump may trigger economic meltdown,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Zak Hudak'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elizabeth-warren-economic-plan-massachusetts-senator-warns-trump-may-trigger-economic-meltdown/?ftag=CNM-00-10aag7e,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren is sounding the alarm on what she says may be a coming economic meltdown. ""Warning lights are flashing,"" she wrote in a blog post Monday.

Warren, who founded the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, warned of the housing market's volatility years before the country's latest financial crisis. But despite her clout in the field, it could prove difficult for her to sell voters on the idea that the economy is on the brink of disaster when most Americans feel confident about it.

Warren largely blames President Trump's economic and foreign policy decisions — like waging a trade war with China — and, citing top economists, she warns that if the administration breaches the debt ceiling in September, it could be more devastating to the economy than the collapse of Lehman Brothers was in 2008. Its failure resulted in what remains the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history and was seen as one of the landmark moments in the global financial crisis.

Critics will note jobs reports have been strong during the Trump administration, but Warren is concerned with skyrocketing household debt, corporate debt and a Fed-designated manufacturing ""recession.""

Warren lawn signs read, ""She's got a plan,"" and now, she says she has one to prevent her forecast of economic calamity from coming to pass. In the plan she released Monday, she says that as president, she would never breach the debt ceiling.

""Trade-war-by-tweet"" with China would also not be a part of Warren's foreign policy, she wrote, with an oft-used jab at President Trump. She also promised to monitor and reduce leveraged corporate spending.

The remainder of Warren's plan amounts to a compilation of other policy proposals meant to help ""working people"" — including largely eliminating student debt, raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour, strengthening unions and a handful of other initiatives — that the Massachusetts senator has released since announcing her candidacy.

It illustrates the extent to which nearly every proposal or claim the Warren campaign makes is intertwined. But some may question why she didn't fully explain what she's portraying as a ticking time bomb before offering so many of its solutions.

""Whether it's this year or next year, the odds of another economic downturn are high — and growing,"" Warren wrote."

Justice Department tells Mueller his House testimony 'must remain within the boundaries' of public report,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Liam Quinn', 'Liam Quinn Is A Senior Editor At Fox News. He Can Be Found On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/justice-department-tells-mueller-his-house-testimony-must-remain-within-the-boundaries-of-public-report,"A Justice Department official told former Special Counsel Robert Mueller that his upcoming testimony to House lawmakers ""must remain within the boundaries"" of the public, redacted version of his report, in a letter obtained by Fox News on Monday evening.

The letter, obtained by Fox News, signed by Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer, states: “Dear Mr. Mueller: I write in response to your July 10, 2019 letter concerning the testimonial subpoenas you received from the House Judiciary Committee (HJC) and House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI).

“Your letter requests that the Department provide you with guidance concerning privilege or other legal bars applicable to potential testimony in connection with those subpoenas.""

After stating the decision to testify is Mueller's to make, the letter continues: ""But the Department agrees with your stated position that your testimony should be unnecessary under the circumstances. The Department generally does not permit prosecutors such as you to appear and testify before Congress regarding their investigative and prosecutorial activity.

READ THE FULL LETTER HERE

""In addition, the Department already has taken the extraordinary steps to make almost your entire report, as well as a substantial volume of your underlying investigative material, available to the committees.

""Should you testify, the Department understands that testimony regarding the work of the Special Counsel's Office will be governed by the terms you outlined on May 29 -- specifically, that the information you discuss during your testimony appears in, and does ""not go beyond,"" the public version of your March 22, 2019 report to the Attorney General or your May 29 public statement.""

It continued: ""Finally, any testimony must remain within the boundaries of your public report because matters within the scope of your investigation were covered by the executive privilege, including information protected by law enforcement, deliberative process, attorney work product, and presidential communications privileges.

""These privileges would include discussion about the investigative steps or decisions, made during your investigation not otherwise described in the public version of your report. Consistent with standard practice, Department witnesses should decline to address potentially privileged matters, thus affording the Department the full opportunity at a later date to consider particular questions and possible accommodations that may fulfill the committees' legitimate need for information while protecting Executive Branch confidentiality interests.""

BRET BAIER: MUELLER HEARING COULD BACKFIRE ON DEMOCRATS

The letter comes after a deal was struck earlier this month for Mueller to give extended testimony as part of an agreement for him to appear before congressional lawmakers later this month, Democratic Party officials said at the time.

Mueller's highly anticipated appearance was pushed back at his request, Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said in a joint statement.

Mueller had been scheduled to testify on July 17 about the findings of his two-year Russia probe after he was subpoenaed by the panels last month.

The former special counsel's only public comments on the investigation came in May, when he did not clear Trump of wrongdoing and reaffirmed his reluctance to testify in front of Congress. He did not say whether Trump obstructed justice during his probe.

DEMOCRAT CONFIDENT MAJORITY OF CAUCUS WILL BE IN FAVOR OF IMPEACHMENT AFTER MUELLER TESTIMONY

“Charging the president with a crime was not an option we could consider,” he said at the time. Mueller's report did not assert that evidence showed Trump had, in fact, committed a crime.

Charges were brought against three businesses and 34 people, including former Trump aides, senior advisers, and Russian agents, although no Americans were indicted in connection with attempts to conspire with Russians to interfere with the 2016 presidential election. Mueller found no evidence the Trump team conspired with Russian actors, despite multiple outreach efforts aimed at involving the Trump campaign.

Mueller also told reporters any testimony he gave would not exceed what's contained in his report.

""There has been discussion about an appearance before Congress,"" Mueller said. ""Any testimony from this office would not go beyond our report. It contains our findings and analysis, and the reasons for the decisions we made. We chose those words carefully, and the work speaks for itself. And the report is my testimony. I would not provide information beyond that which is already public in any appearance before Congress."""
‘It’s a disaster over there’: Commerce reaches new heights of dysfunction,https://www.politico.com,['Daniel Lippman'],07-22-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/22/wilbur-ross-commerce-department-dysfunction-1424427,"Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross doesn’t hold routine meetings with senior staffers, according to a person familiar with the department’s inner workings, ""Because he tends to fall asleep in meetings."" | Win McNamee/Getty Images Finance & Tax ‘It’s a disaster over there’: Commerce reaches new heights of dysfunction Under Secretary Wilbur Ross, the department is chaotic and adrift.

Constant infighting among top officials. Sudden departures of senior staffers without explanation. A leader who is disengaged and prone to falling asleep in meetings.

The Commerce Department has reached its apex of dysfunction under Wilbur Ross, according to four people with knowledge of the inner workings of the department. The 81-year-old Commerce secretary, who has for months endured whispers that he is on the outs, spends much of his time at the White House to try to retain President Donald Trump’s favor, the sources said, leaving his department adrift.

Story Continued Below

He’s hardly the only top Trump official to seek the president’s approval. But department insiders say they’ve rarely seen Commerce so rudderless — and they say Ross’ penchant for managing upward at the expense of his staff is leading to what one plugged-in observer described as “a disaster over there.”

“With our ongoing trade wars and the census looming, Commerce needs functional leadership to be effective, and right now they just don’t have it,” said Theo LeCompte, a former top Commerce official in the Obama administration who speaks often with former colleagues.

One common complaint: Ross, a successful investor before Trump tapped him as secretary of Commerce, isn’t frequently seen in the building talking to employees or rallying them to do good work.

“He’s sort of seen as kind of irrelevant. The morale is very low there because there’s not a lot of confidence in the secretary,” said a former outside adviser to Commerce who is still in touch with many employees at the department. “He’s not respected in the building.”

Ross doesn’t hold routine meetings with senior staffers, according to a person familiar with the department’s inner workings and a former outside adviser — a departure from past practice that one source attributed to the secretary’s lack of stamina.

“Because he tends to fall asleep in meetings, they try not to put him in a position where that could happen so they’re very careful and conscious about how they schedule certain meetings,” said the former outside adviser. “There’s a small window where he’s able to focus and pay attention and not fall asleep.”

A Commerce official disputed that criticsm, saying that Ross has frequent afternoon meetings, including “long” meetings on the census.

“Secretary Ross is a tireless worker who is the sole decision-maker at the department,"" said Commerce press secretary Kevin Manning. ""He routinely works 12-hour days and travels often, with visits to seven countries and eight states in the last three months to advance the president’s agenda.""

Yet top Commerce officials have pushed to not have Ross called to testify at congressional oversight hearings, according to two sources close to the department, because they fear he isn’t up to the task. “There’s a great deal of effort to shield him from testifying ever again,” said one of the sources.

A Commerce official disputed that and said, “He’s obviously going to have to testify again. … You can’t get through the rest of [congressional appropriations] season without testifying again.”

Ross did testify at an oversight hearing on the census for nearly seven hours in March, and emerged through the ordeal generally unscathed. But according to one person familiar with the department, the consensus among the top ranks of the administration was that it would be best to avoid a repeat appearance.

“There was a great deal of concern to not have him testify expressed from the White House,” this person said, characterizing the instructions as: “‘Don’t do this, people. Don’t do this, he’s probably not the right guy to go there.’”

Ross certainly has other reasons to avoid Congress — namely, the heated dispute between Hill Democrats and the administration over adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201906/3704/1155968404_6052147728001_6051795407001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

In April, Ross offered to send aides to testify on his behalf before a House Appropriations subcommittee, an offer the panel’s Democratic chairman, José Serrano, said showed “stunning disrespect.” Serrano’s Republican counterpart, Robert Aderholt, told Reuters that Ross refused to testify out of “concern that this hearing might focus more on political or legal issues than the budget itself.”

“His relationship with the Hill has deteriorated more and more, and he’s just not interested in dealing with the Hill if he can avoid it,” said a person familiar with the department’s internal discussions.

A Commerce official noted that Ross talked to Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) two weeks ago, and held a party two months ago that a number of senators attended. Another Commerce employee observed, “This administration is very hesitant to do oversight in general or to comply with oversight requests in general.”

There are public signs, however, of apparent unease with Ross as a spokesperson for the administration. At an appearance at the White House in mid-July on an announcement on abandoning the citizenship question in the census, the Commerce secretary stood next to Trump the entire time and was one of three people who didn’t speak. Attorney General Bill Barr, on the other hand, spoke at length.

Ross’ relationship with the White House and with Trump was also damaged by stories that came out in the past 18 months showing that he wasn’t as rich as he had claimed and hadn’t fully divested some stock as he had promised, according to the former outside adviser. (The Commerce official disputed that, arguing that the White House has not cared about these issues.)

Ross’s deputies, meanwhile, are coming under fire of their own as tensions rise withini the department.

Political appointees sometimes close doors right in front of career employees to keep them out of meetings, one former Commerce official in touch with former colleagues said.

Meanwhile, “it’s totally infighting among the politicals,” said another person familiar with the department. “It’s just everybody fighting everybody.” In particular, the relationship between Ross’ office and the legislative affairs team is “clearly broken,” this person said.

Charles “Kolo” Rathburn, who had been acting head of legislative affairs, “was unceremoniously let go” and abruptly left earlier in July, according to a person familiar with Commerce and the outside adviser, who said it had to do with issues of professional conduct in the workplace. Another person familiar with Commerce also confirmed his departure.

“He wasn’t allowed to clean out his office,” said one of the people. Rathburn had replaced Mike Platt, who had left in early May.

A Commerce official said Rathburn, who didn’t respond to requests for comment, is working to pass the bar exam and has an offer for a higher-paying position at a law firm if he does.

Ross Branson, who had been deputy assistant secretary of legislative affairs and was Platt’s deputy, also left Commerce on Friday, according to two people familiar with his departure. He had become “collateral damage,” according to one of the people, and was told that he had to look for a new job. He starts on Monday as head of legislative affairs at the Export-Import Bank, a position that a Commerce official described as “definitely a promotion.” Branson and the Ex-Im Bank did not respond to a request for comment.

Much of the tension inside the building has centered on Earl Comstock, who shepherded Ross’ confirmation on Capitol Hill and is one of the secretary’s top lieutenants as the department's policy director.

The disarray inside Commerce is drawing an intervention from chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and other White House officials, who are trying to figure out how to wrest control from Comstock, who increasingly seems to be involved in everything that happens inside the department.

“Things come to a screeching halt because he demands to be the final decision on everything whether it’s an email that goes out to the Hill or a letter to respond to X, Y and Z,” said a person familiar with Commerce.

Comstock, who didn’t respond to requests for comment, has also been at the center of many of the spectrum battles between the Federal Communications Commission and the departments of Transportation, Education, Commerce and NASA and NOAA, according to an administration official. He has “literally been seeding bad intel and bad information to get other people agitated,” said the official.

He also tried to scuttle a joint White House-FCC summit on 5G, the wireless technology, in April by “calling everyone he could 24 hours before the event trying to get it to be canceled,” this person said. Comstock clashed in particular with former National Telecommunications and Information Administration chief David Redl, who left his post abruptly in May.

Critics of Ross’ leadership at Commerce also have a new target of concern: chief of staff Michael Walsh, who is described by some as inexperienced on policy and difficult to work with.

Walsh didn’t respond to a request for comment, but the Commerce official said that he has good relationships throughout the administration and on the Hill and visits the White House frequently. A second person familiar with Commerce also claimed, “People want his job so they’re spreading bad stuff on him.”

The chaos inside the department has had consequences for some employees.

“There’s great frustration among people who really want to use their skills and talents to help this country and are being marginalized by a White House who doesn’t need to ask any questions because it already thinks it has the answers,” said Roger Fisk, a Commerce official in the Obama administration. “All of that expertise is just lying dormant hiding in plain sight.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Gregory Bull/AP Gregory Bull/AP

The Trump administration announced on Monday it is expanding fast-track deportation regulations to include the removal of undocumented immigrants who cannot prove they have been in the U.S. continuously for two years or more.

The change dramatically expands the ability of the Department of Homeland Security to quickly deport certain immigrants without any of the due-process protections granted to most other people, including the right to an attorney and to a hearing before a judge. It is set to go into effect Tuesday and is the latest escalation of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.

""The effect of that change will be to enhance national security and public safety — while reducing government costs — by facilitating prompt immigration determinations,"" DHS said in a notice.

Additionally, DHS stated part of the purpose for the policy revision is to ""harmonize"" existing regulations to apply equally to undocumented immigrants who arrive by land and sea.

Currently, undocumented immigrants who cross into the U.S. by land can be deported without an immigration hearing if they are arrested within 100 miles of the border during the first 14 days after their arrival. Those who arrive by sea can be deported without legal proceedings if they are unable to prove they have been living in the U.S. for two years or more.

But under the latest proposal, all geographical limitations would be lifted and rapid removal proceedings would be applied to all undocumented immigrants who have been in the country for less than two years.

The move is also designed to mitigate a massive court backlog of immigration cases ""and will reduce the significant costs to the government associated with full removal proceedings before an immigration judge."" DHS said that as of June there were 909,034 pending immigration cases. It estimates the average removal proceeding for an undocumented immigrant not being held in detention ""has been pending for more than two years before an immigration judge.""

In early 2017, days after taking office, President Trump issued an executive order directing DHS to expand the use of expedited removal. The order designated recent unauthorized arrivals as a top priority for deportation.

""We plan on challenging the change ... speedily,"" Anand Balakrishnan, Senior Staff Attorney for the ACLU's Immigrant Rights Project told NPR.

Balakrishnan called the policy shift ""extremely sweeping,"" and said it authorizes any Customs and Border Protection officer to determine whether a person has been in the U.S. the requisite amount of time to trigger legal proceedings.

""The only way out of that is for the person to affirmatively prove that they've been here for two years or more. To have that evidence on them at all times,"" he said. ""It puts the burden on every noncitizen to prove their continuous presence.""

He noted, deportations could happen within hours of a person's arrest.

""From what we know about the way expedited removals have been administered in the past, it's been rife with errors,"" Balakrishnan said. ""U.S. citizens have been ordered deported"" and in other cases, people who have lived in the country for more than a decade have also been ejected, he said.

The DHS notice stated unaccompanied children may not be placed in expedited removal under current law. Further, undocumented immigrants can apply for asylum when they are apprehended, potentially delaying an immediate deportation until a credible-fear hearing and a determination is made. People who are deported under expedited removal regulations have no right to appeal.

The pro-immigration American Immigration Council estimates thousands of people could be deported as a result of the expansion."
Adam Schiff says DOJ inspector general's work is 'tainted' ahead of FISA abuse report,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-22-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/adam-schiff-says-doj-inspector-generals-work-is-tainted-ahead-of-fisa-abuse-report,"House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz got roped into a politically-motivated scheme to protect President Trump, laying the groundwork to discredit the government watchdog's work as he nears completion of a report on alleged surveillance abuses by the DOJ and FBI.

At the Aspen Security Forum this weekend, Schiff accused top Justice Department officials of pandering to Trump by instigating a ""fast track"" report last year about former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. His comments came as part of a broader answer to a question about whether he has concerns about Attorney General William Barr's review of the origins of the Russia investigation.

Schiff claimed the president wanted McCabe, who briefly took over as acting FBI director after Trump fired James Comey in May 2017, investigated and his pension taken away and suggested someone such as former Attorney General Rod Rosenstein obliged the president by making a referral.

""The inspector general found that McCabe was untruthful. He may very well have been untruthful,"" the California Democrat said, but noted that is not where main his concern lies.

""I have no reason to question the inspector general's conclusion, but that investigation was put on a fast track. It was separated from a broader inspector general investigation, which is still ongoing,"" he said. ""Why was that done? It was done so he could be fired to not get a pension. It was done to please the president when the initiation investigation is tainted. So are the results of that investigation.""

McCabe was fired from the FBI on March 16, 2018, less than two days before he planned to retire on his 50th birthday and collect a full pension, after the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General determined he misled investigators about the role he had in leaking information to the Wall Street Journal in October 2016 about the investigation into the Clinton Foundation.

In April 2018, it was revealed that the Justice Department inspector general referred its findings to the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington for possible criminal charges, and his lawyer confirmed as recently as February that McCabe was still under investigation.

McCabe, whom Trump has accused of planning to carry out an ""illegal and treasonous"" plan to oust him as president, has argued that his firing was an attempt to discredit the FBI and special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

The initiation of the inspector general's inquiry in McCabe happened, Schiff said, ""because the president wanted it politically."" He added, ""Once you go down that road, it leads to disaster.""

Horowitz is nearing the end of another investigation that Trump and his allies are eagerly anticipating. The inspector general announced his investigation into whether the FBI and Justice Department filing of four FISA applications and renewals to surveil former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page was an abuse of the FISA process in March 2018, following requests by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions and members of Congress. House Judiciary Committee ranking member Doug Collins said he expects the inspector general's report to be released this fall after some delays.

This matters because now that Mueller's work is complete, Barr's ""investigation into the investigators"" is underway, and the attorney general has said he is working very closely with Horowitz. The inspector general can recommend prosecutions, and U.S. Attorney John Durham, whom Barr tasked to lead the review, has the ability to convene a grand jury and subpoena people outside of the government. Beyond that, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, has promised a ""deep dive"" into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation after Horowitz completes his work.

Wary of the churning cycle of investigations, Schiff tied Horowitz to Barr, saying, ""this is tainted from the start because it is motivated for a political end and the damage it will do in terms of a chilling impact is of deep concern, um, the damage it will do in terms of trying to cast doubt on things that are not in doubt.""

The question Schiff was asked by and audience member focused on whether he was concerned about how Durham's team reportedly wanted to talk to at least one senior CIA counterintelligence official and a senior CIA analyst who examined Russia's role in meddling in the 2016 election.

He said the inquiries that question ""well substantiated conclusions to essentially politicize the intelligence process and tell analysts that the work will be scrutinized with a political perspective if it runs contrary to the desires of the president. That's a terrible, terrible precedent."""
"Trump says Mueller shouldn’t testify, warns hearing will backfire",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-mueller-shouldnt-testify-warns-hearing-will-backfire,"President Trump argued Monday that Robert Mueller should not be given the chance to testify before Congress later this week, warning that the former special counsel’s highly anticipated hearing appearance could be “bad for him” and for Democrats in the end.

“Highly conflicted Robert Mueller should not be given another bite at the apple. In the end it will be bad for him and the phony Democrats in Congress who have done nothing but waste time on this ridiculous Witch Hunt,” Trump tweeted. “Result of the Mueller Report, NO COLLUSION, NO OBSTRUCTION!”

Mueller is slated to appear before both the House Judiciary Committee and the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday, for back-to-back public hearings. Later, lawmakers are expected to interview Mueller’s staff behind closed doors, but it is unclear whether Mueller himself will continue to answer questions in a private setting.

NADLER: SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE PRESIDENT TRUMP 'GUILTY OF HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS' CONTAINED IN MUELLER REPORT

Mueller only spoke in public about his investigation once. In May, Mueller hosted a press conference (he did not take any reporter questions) outlining his findings, noting there “was not sufficient evidence to charge a conspiracy” over whether members of the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russian government during the 2016 presidential election. His language on the question of whether the president obstructed justice, though, left the issue open—a move that Democrats took as a signal to ramp up their investigations.

Fox News learned last week that Democrats on the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees are expected to focus on five areas in Mueller’s report having to do with his inquiry on “obstruction,” rather than on accusations of the Trump campaign colluding with the Russians, in an attempt to expose potential wrongdoing by the president.

Among the topics they are expected to focus on: Trump’s reported call to then-White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Mueller; the claim the president ordered McGahn to deny he told him to try to get rid of Mueller; allegations the president told former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski to instruct then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to curb the probe; the dangling of pardons to former campaign manager Paul Manafort; and allegations of witness tampering, including with Manafort.

“The [Mueller] report presents very substantial evidence that the president is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors and we have to present—or let Mueller present those facts to the American people and then see where we go from there,” House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler said on “Fox News Sunday.” “Because the administration must be held accountable and no president can be above the law.”

Mueller, though, has signaled his reluctance to testify before Congress.

“There has been a discussion about an appearance before Congress. Any testimony from this office would not go beyond our report. It contains our findings and analysis, and the reasons for the decisions we made. We chose those words carefully and the work speaks for itself,” Mueller said in May.

Still, Nadler, D-N.Y., and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., subpoenaed the former special counsel to testify.

Trump on Monday, though, proposed certain questions be asked of Mueller, including how the Russia investigation began.

“But the questions should be asked, why were all of Clinton’s people given immunity, and why were the text messages of Peter S[Strzok] and his lover, Lisa Page, deleted and destroyed right after they left Mueller, and after we requested them (this is Illegal)?” Trump tweeted Monday.

The president was referring to the FBI’s deal to give immunity to those implicated in the bureau’s investigation of Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server and handling of classified information while secretary of state during the Obama administration.

The president was also referring to former FBI special agent Peter Strzok and former FBI counsel Lisa Page—both of whom served in Mueller’s office during the early stages of the Russia investigation. Page left Mueller’s office during the summer of 2017 after a short detail and returned to the FBI. Strzok, though, was removed from Mueller’s team and re-assigned to the bureau’s human resources division after the Justice Department inspector general discovered a series of anti-Trump and politically charged text messages exchanged by Strzok and Page. Page resigned from her post in May 2018, and Strzok was fired from the bureau in August 2018.

DEMS PLOT STRATEGY FOR GRILLING MUELLER AHEAD OF HIGHLY-ANTICIPATED TESTIMONY

The president and congressional Republicans have been asking questions about Strzok and Page, and how the Russia investigation began, for months. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., vowed in March to probe the origins of the investigation, and Attorney General Bill Barr appointed U.S. attorney from Connecticut John Durham to examine the origins of the probe, including all intelligence collection activities related to the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election, alleged misconduct and alleged improper government surveillance.

But Nadler said he isn’t worried about Republicans asking questions of Mueller about the origins of the probe, and claimed they would only be wasting their time.

""It's been very clear that the Trump investigation was not predicated on the so-called dossier that they're talking about. There was nothing wrong with the FISA application. All the things they're talking about have been gone through. The inspector general found that there was nothing wrong with the other half of what they’re talking about, which is the Hillary [Clinton] investigation. He's finishing it,"" Nadler said.

""If they want to debate, or discuss, I should say, this irrelevancy, let them waste the time. But what's before the American people now is the conduct of this president. And what Mueller found about the conduct of this president and where we go from here.""

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross reportedly can't stop falling asleep in department meetings,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Joseph Zeballos-Roig'],07-22-2019,2019,7,https://www.businessinsider.com/wilbur-ross-reportedly-cant-stop-falling-asleep-in-commerce-meetings-2019-7,"Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross reportedly often falls asleep in department meetings and his staff are taking care of scheduling meetings for certain times of the day, according to a new report from Politico.

""Because he tends to fall asleep in meetings, they try not to put him in a position where that could happen so they're very careful and conscious about how they schedule certain meetings,"" a former outside adviser told Politico. ""There's a small window where he's able to focus and pay attention and not fall asleep.""

Politico reported that the Department of Commerce under Ross is reaching new levels of dysfunction, where repeated infighting among senior officials and sudden departures of experienced career staff is taking its toll on employee morale. Ross came under fire for spending more time at the White House trying to stay in President Donald Trump's good graces rather than managing the department he leads.

Ross's bruising defeat at the Supreme Court over adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census has tested his relationship with Trump, who appointed him in 2017.

Rumors of Ross's departure have circulated for months, pushing the 81-year-old Commerce secretary to handle his relationship with the White House instead of holding regular meetings with his staff to steer the department's direction.

It has led one observer familiar with the department's inner workings to describe it as ""a disaster over there.""

The Commerce secretary pushed back against the report on Monday morning, tweeting that the report isn't connected with reality and he blamed ""disgruntled"" former employees for characterizing his leadership negatively.

""Today's Politico report bears no resemblance to reality and appears to be solely sourced from disgruntled former employees whose poor performance led to their departures,"" Ross said.

One complaint echoed among many department employees is that Ross isn't a frequent sight at his own department, either holding meetings or boosting staff morale.

""With our ongoing trade wars and the census looming, Commerce needs functional leadership in order to be effective, and right now they just don't have it,"" former senior Commerce official Theo LeCompte told Politico.

Another former advisor in touch with Commerce employees told Politico that Ross is ""seen as kind of irrelevant and that ""he's not respected in the building.""

Ross also doesn't hold regular meetings with the department's senior staff, which was attributed to a lack of energy on his part, Politico reported. Commerce officials are also trying to avoid having Ross testify again to Congress.

Ross, alongside Attorney General William Barr, were both held in contempt of Congress by the House of Representatives last week in a party-line vote for refusing to turn over documents related to the 2020 census.

Trump expands fast-track deportation authority across U.S.,https://www.aol.com,"['Aol Staff', 'The Associated Press']",07-22-2019,2019,7,https://www.aol.com/article/news/2019/07/22/trump-expands-fast-track-deportation-authority-across-us/23775627/,"SAN DIEGO (AP) — The Trump administration is expanding the authority of immigration officers to deport migrants without requiring them to appear before judges ahead of deportation.

The Homeland Security Department said Monday that fast-track deportations will apply to anyone in the country illegally less than two years.

Until now those deportations applied online to people caught crossing the U.S. border by land and not entering by boat or plane.

The department says the expansion ""expedited removal"" authority will allow it to more efficiently pursue large numbers of people in the country illegally and promptly remove them.

Jim Jordan on the DOJ IG report: 'What's got Schiff worried?',https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-22-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/jim-jordan-on-the-doj-ig-report-whats-got-schiff-worried,"Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio said today that Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California must be “worried” about the upcoming results of the investigation into alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Abuse conducted by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz.

The GOP’s ranking member on the House Oversight Committee was responding to comments made by the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee at the Aspen Security Forum this weekend, where Schiff suggested that Horowitz’s prior investigation of former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was put on a “fast track” by the Justice Department in order to please President Trump and that its results were therefore “tainted” by politics.

“Inspector General Horowitz is a professional. He’s conducting a crucial investigation into FBI and DOJ misconduct. But @RepAdamSchiff said his investigation is ‘tainted.’ What’s got Schiff worried?” Jordan tweeted.

Horowitz concluded in February 2018 that McCabe had improperly disclosed information about an investigation to the media and then had “lacked candor” when speaking with former FBI Director James Comey and with investigators from the FBI and the inspector general’s office. Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired McCabe in March 2018 just before McCabe was scheduled to retire.

Schiff also said this weekend that the “investigation of the investigators” related to the origins of the Trump-Russia probe being carried out by Attorney General William Barr and U.S. Attorney John Durham was similarly “tainted.”

Schiff’s comments came after Horowitz interviewed British ex-spy Christopher Steele, whose unverified dossier was relied upon in four FISA applications and renewals, and as the inspector general’s highly-anticipated report is reportedly set to be released in the coming weeks."
EPA’s watchdog scrutinizes ethics practices of former air policy chief,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Juliet Eilperin', 'Reporter Covering Domestic Policy', 'National Affairs', 'July At Pm', ""Juliet Eilperin Is The Washington Post'S Senior National Affairs Correspondent"", ""Covering The Transformation Of Federal Environmental Policy.

It is the third inquiry into whether Bill Wehrum, who headed the Environmental Protection Agency’s air policy division from November 2017 until last month, violated federal ethics rules.

The EPA’s inspector general is looking at Wehrum’s interactions with his former law firm as well as several of its clients, who rank among the nation’s major emitters of greenhouse gases linked to climate change, according to two individuals who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.

“This is yet another example where the Trump administration has done just the opposite of ‘draining the swamp,’ by empowering polluting industries and installing those industries’ lobbyists and lawyers at the highest levels of our federal government,” said Sen. Thomas R. Carper (Del.), the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.

In February, The Washington Post reported on two instances in which Wehrum appeared to violate President Trump’s ethics pledge, which limits political appointees from interacting with their former employers and clients for two years after taking office. Wehrum, who worked at a firm now called Hunton Andrews Kurth, is also under investigation by the House Energy and Commerce Committee and Democrats on the Senate environment panel.

On Sunday night, Carper and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) sent an investigative report to the inspector general’s office, identifying new cases in which Wehrum allegedly violated the ethics pledge by meeting with clients he did not disclose on his recusal statement. They also said the inspector general should look into EPA senior counsel David Harlow, a lawyer who worked with Wehrum at his former law firm.

The multiple probes highlight the extent to which some Trump appointees’ past work in the private sector has intersected with their roles in the federal government. Before joining the administration, Wehrum worked for a decade at Hunton and focused on air policy, the office he then headed at the EPA for a year and a half. Harlow, senior counsel to Wehrum, worked as a Hunton attorney before joining the agency in October 2017.

“At EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation, it appears Mr. Wehrum and Mr. Harlow used those positions of public trust to dismantle decades-old protections for clean air and climate at the behest of Hunton-associated groups,” Carper said in a statement Sunday night.

In their letter to acting EPA inspector general Charles J. Sheehan, Carper and Whitehouse urged “in the strongest possible terms not to abandon or decline to pursue work on this matter in the wake of Mr. Wehrum’s departure from the agency.”

In an email Monday, EPA spokesman Michael Abboud said the Democrats were making unfounded allegations in an effort to attack the administration’s policy agenda.

“The Senate EPW minority’s report and letter to EPA’s Office of Inspector General is a replay of old allegations that have repeatedly been answered by the agency and Mr. Wehrum,” Abboud said. “This administration will continue to focus on improving upon the environmental successes we have already seen in the first two and half years.”

Asked about the inspector general’s inquiry, spokeswoman Jennifer Kaplan said in an email: “Our office doesn’t confirm or deny the existence of investigations, so we aren’t able to comment on that statement either way.”

Wehrum could not be reached for comment on Sunday. In an interview in February, in which he appeared to skirt the line on what is permissible under federal ethics rules, Wehrum said he had determined that he was in compliance.

“I have, from day one, tried to be absolutely strict and assiduous as to what I do about complying with my ethical obligations, because it doesn’t do me any good, and it doesn’t do the agency any good, to be doing things that people see as unethical,” he said.

[Bill Wehrum stayed in close touch with his law firm, emails show]

Under the ethics pledge, political appointees may meet with former employers or clients only when the meetings are open to all interested parties — interpreted to mean four other participants who were not clients.

In December 2017, Wehrum met with two former clients at his old firm without consulting in advance with ethics officials, even though they had cautioned him about such interactions. That same month, Wehrum weighed in on a decision that appeared to benefit a client of his former firm, DTE Energy.

Evidence discovered in recent months by congressional investigators in both chambers raises the question of whether Wehrum’s ties to other companies and trade groups posed other potential conflicts of interest.

According to the Senate report, four industry groups represented by Hunton — the Utility Air Regulatory Group, Air Permitting Forum, NAAQS Implementation Coalition and CCS Alliance — have advocated regulatory rollbacks that the EPA advanced during Wehrum’s tenure. In one instance, the agency included language in a policy memo that was copied verbatim from a document Hunton submitted to the EPA on behalf of the Air Permitting Forum.

An aide to the House Energy and Commerce Committee said the panel has obtained documents indicating that each of the more than 30 members of the Utility Air Regulatory Group (UARG) were also individual clients of Hunton. If so, Wehrum and Harlow would have had to recuse themselves from additional interactions with several companies that have backed the EPA’s recent moves to ease federal limits on air, water and coal ash pollution from power plants.

Wehrum has rejected the idea that he represented the individual members of UARG, in addition to the overall group. “That’s not my understanding,” he told Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.) during a hearing last month.

Hunton Andrews Kurth issued a statement Monday reiterating the idea that it did not represent members of the Utility Air Regulatory Group, which included some of the nation’s biggest companies operating coal-fired power plants, as individual clients.

“Judicial and administrative actions have been taken in the name of the Group to advance Group positions, not in the name of any individual group member to advance its individual interest,” the statement said.

Senate investigators, meanwhile, have determined that Wehrum failed to disclose three court clients that should have been listed on his ethics recusal statement, including the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers. Wehrum had at least six meetings with the automakers’ group, a key player in one of the Trump administration’s most significant climate rollbacks: the freezing of gas mileage standards for cars and light trucks.

In the report, Carper and Whitehouse noted that meetings with the alliance appear “to violate Ethics in Government Act regulation and the Trump ethics pledge” because the six sessions, which included a speech to the group’s board, were not open to all interested parties.

Abboud said that Wehrum’s involvement in the case involving the alliance ended as of Nov. 9, 2015, so that his period of recusal for the group would have ended shortly after joining the EPA, before he began meeting with the trade association.

Jeff Holmstead, a partner at Bracewell who headed the EPA’s office of air and radiation under President George W. Bush, said in a phone interview that appointees need to observe federal ethics rules and cannot weigh in on “a particular matter involving specific parties” that they have represented within two years of taking office. But Holmstead, who has clients in the power sector, added that there was nothing wrong with adopting policy ideas espoused by outside groups.

“The whole purpose of asking for comments is so you can get good ideas from folks outside the agency,” he said. “A policy idea should stand or fall on its own, not based on who suggested it.”"

Scalia — son of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia — had made his reputation in Washington as a lawyer for big corporations resisting labor regulations, after all.

He had helped Walmart overturn a Maryland law mandating minimum contributions by big employers for workers’ healthcare, defended SeaWorld against workplace safety charges after a park trainer was killed by an Orca (he lost that case), and had written extensively against a federal regulation expanding ergonomic safety requirements.

But Scalia’s appointment is best seen not in the context of his own legal career, but in the context of Trump’s assault on worker rights and welfare. Despite his positioning himself during his presidential campaign as a flag carrier for the working class, Trump has rolled back numerous pro-worker regulations from the Obama era and before.

He talked a good game about bringing back manufacturing and coal jobs, but that hasn’t materialized. His steel tariffs are credited with saving some 12,000 steel manufacturing jobs, but at the enormous cost to the economy of an estimated $900,000 per job.

That’s paid by steel users, including automakers and other manufacturers. General Motors says it took a $1-billion hit in 2018 from the tariffs. That contributed to its decision to shed 14,000 jobs globally and to shutter its assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio, costing 900 jobs. Although Trump attacked GM Chief Executive Mary Barra for the decision, he also turned his ire on UAW and AFL-CIO leaders, calling them “not honest people” and blaming high union dues for the Lordstown closing. (Union dues are paid by workers, not employers.)

Hourly wages for rank-and-file workers are up since Trump’s inauguration, but only at a measly rate after inflation. Wages rose about 3.1% in June over a year earlier, but with consumer inflation running at 1.6% during the same period, the real gain for workers was a mere 1.1% in a year. Workers’ share of economic growth remains dismally low and continues to fall under Trump.

The real hubs of Trump’s attack on workers are the Department of Labor and the National Labor Relations Board. These bodies were established to protect worker rights. As we’ve reported before, under Trump they’ve become the advance guard in eviscerating those rights. Through those agencies, writes Pedro Nicolaci Da Costa of the labor-oriented Economic Policy Institute, “Trump is pursuing the most hostile anti-labor agenda of any modern president.”

Under Acosta, the Department of Labor rolled back a rule proposed by the Obama administration expanding overtime pay to thousands of workers misleadingly designated as “supervisors.” The Obama rule would have raised the pay threshold under which workers would be guaranteed overtime pay to $47,476 from $26,660, where it had settled for more than a decade. Trump’s labor regulators propose fixing it at $35,000, reducing the number of covered workers in half, leaving behind about 6 million workers who would have been covered under the Obama proposal.

As Terri Gerstein, a labor expert at Harvard Law School, observed in March, the Trump proposal would work out to less than $17 an hour — not exactly what most would consider “supervisor” pay — and would be silent on fast-food chains’ habit of suspiciously loading up their restaurant workforces with “general managers, assistant managers, night managers, managers for opening and closing and delivery, all paid a weekly salary.”

Trump’s NLRB has reversed the board’s trend toward expanding the definition of “joint employer,” which would have made big franchisers such as McDonald’s jointly liable with their franchisees for violations of employees’ wage and hour rights. Its proposed definition would narrow the joint-employer standard “to the point at which many workers would find it nearly impossible to bring all firms with the power to influence their wages and working conditions to the bargaining table,” according to the labor-oriented Economic Policy Institute.

The Trump administration also has rescinded the Obama-era “persuader” rule, which required employers to disclose their relationships with union-busting law firms. The Labor Department has indicated it will take a hands-off approach to enforcing workplace regulations when employees have agreed to bring workplace disputes to arbitration. That drew an objection from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who observed that affected workers often have been “forced to sign away important legal rights” and therefore are “most in need of federal protection.”

That brings us back to Eugene Scalia, who would be almost certain to continue Acosta’s policies, which included fighting legislation to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour from its woefully outdated $7.25. Scalia’s career has demonstrated his affinity with employers and bankers; back in 2012, the Wall Street Journal labeled him one of the financial industry’s “go-to guys for challenging financial regulations.”

His 2000 campaign against the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s effort to impose more responsibility on employers for ergonomic-related worker injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome gives a good taste of his approach. In an essay for the Cato Institute he lamented that the rule would “require businesses to slow the pace of production, hire more workers, increase rest periods and redesign workstations or even entire operations.” He asserted that OSHA’s intention to expand the rule to home-based work for employers reflected Democrats’ intention to “court union leaders” ahead of the coming presidential election.

The Trump administration is full to the brim of pro-employer front persons. The last place another one is needed is the Department of Labor. Scalia’s appointment to that agency, which is expected to be waved through by the Republican-controlled Senate, will merely continue a void in worker rights in Washington."

Lawmaker from a Lyme-plagued district demands to know if DoD scientists ever used infected ticks as weapons,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Ellen Ioanes'],07-22-2019,2019,7,https://www.businessinsider.com/new-jersey-chris-smith-dod-ticks-bioweapons-2019-7,"The US military has a long history of developing dangerous chemical weapons, from Agent Orange, a defoliant that has left Vietnam-era vets with Leukemia and other life-threatening illnesses, to the nerve agent VX, which killed North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's half-brother Kim Jong Nam in minutes in 2017.

But a New Jersey lawmaker is concerned that the Pentagon may be hiding research about developing Lyme disease as a biological weapon, part of an unlikely theory that these alleged experiments led to increased Lyme disease infections in the US.

Rep. Christopher Smith of New Jersey proposed an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which passed the House last week, requiring the Department of Defense Inspector General investigate whether the DoD experimented with using ticks to spread diseases like Lyme between 1950 and 1975.

Smith's amendment is based on the idea that insects infected with Lyme disease may have escaped from government labs at Plum Island, New York, and Fort Detrick, Maryland and then begun infecting the civilian population.

""Lyme Disease is endemic to his District. The recently published book ['Bitten'] leaves questions about tick-borne diseases as bioweapons unanswered,"" Julia Nesta, a spokesperson for Smith, told INSIDER via email. Smith's office did not respond to a request for further information.

Smith's office referred to ""Bitten: The Secret History of Lyme Disease,"" by Kris Newby, a science writer and former Lyme sufferer. ""Bitten"" relies on interviews with the late Willy Burgdorfer, a Swiss-born scientist who worked as a bioweapons specialist for the Defense Department and is credited with discovering the bacteria that causes Lyme disease.

Smith said there was evidence that Burgdorfer and his colleagues ""stuffed ticks with pathogens to cause severe disability, disease — even death — to potential enemies.""

""With Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases exploding in the United States — with an estimated 300,000 to 437,000 new cases diagnosed each year and 10-20 percent of all patients suffering from chronic Lyme disease — Americans have a right to know whether any of this is true,"" Smith said on the House floor.

Newby's book posits that the DoD research facilities could have released diseased ticks into the general population, causing an increase in Lyme disease cases during the middle of the 20th century, according to Newsweek.

Plum Island Fire Department firefighters decontaminate their suits after identifying several hazardous materials during a collective training event at the Plum Island Animal Disease Research Facility, New York, May 2, 2018. The event brought together the resources of several fire departments, the 106th Air Rescue Wing, the 24th Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Team, and the Department of Homeland Security to respond to a simulated containment breach at the research facility Sgt. Harley Jelis / (U.S. Army National Guard / DVIDS

Newby spoke with INSIDER via phone, saying that Burgdorfer's original lab notes and and letters, as well as interviews with the scientist when he was in his 80s and suffering from Parkinson's, suggest that he was putting biological agents like Venezuelan equine encephalitis in ticks. Newby said that the insects that concerned her were those infected with Lyme and another illness — what she calls a ""germ gang bang.""

While Lyme can be very serious if untreated, it is often curable with antibiotics and wouldn't cause an immediate disruption on the battlefield, like VX or other deadly chemical weapons would. Newby said she spoke with a former CIA operative who said he dropped two canisters of infested ticks over Cuba in 1962, during Operation Mongoose.

While Newby said that the operation ""probably didn't work,"" she told INSIDER that ""bug-borne weapons are the perfect weapon"" because they're difficult to protect yourself against, and they don't destroy infrastructure.

Still, ticks are unlikely to have been useful as a weapon. They can't bite individuals with any specificity or on any timeline, and the effects take days or weeks to affect a person's health. There's also little evidence that tick populations in North America were impacted by proximity to these DoD labs.

Dr. Richard S. Ostfeld, a researcher at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem studies, told INSIDER that the tick that spreads Lyme ""was known to exist throughout the eastern United States before the discovery of Lyme disease in the 1970s and 80s, so the evidence regarding the distribution of the tick is not consistent with the notion that it was somehow released on Plum Island.""

Ostfeld also said that Idoxes, or blacklegged, ticks, which carry Lyme, ""are frequently infected with multiple disease agents"" and that ""the main source of these multiple infections in ticks is small wild mammals like white-footed mice and eastern chipmunks.""

The House vote will add $1 million to the Centers for Disease Control's Lyme research budget and require the Pentagon to report on ""whether any ticks or insects used in such experiments were released outside of any laboratory by accident or experiment design.""

The Pentagon Inspector General did not respond to INSIDER's request for comment on this story. The government facilities at Fort Ditrick and Plum Island did not respond to emails seeking comment."
Using the VA Mission Act to justify raising federal spending levels is bad for veterans and taxpayers,https://thehill.com,[],07-22-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/454156-using-the-va-mission-act-to-justify-raising-federal-spending,"Earlier this month, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin demanding that an additional $22 billion above current federal spending levels be included in any deal to raise the debt limit in order to pay for new private health care options created by the VA MISSION Act - the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care reform law signed by President Donald Trump Donald John TrumpChelsea Clinton announces birth of third child Ukrainian officials and Giuliani are sharing back-channel campaign information: report Trump attacks 'the Squad' as 'racist group of troublemakers' MORE but which was opposed by Pelosi. This requested increase comes in spite of the fact the 2019 VA budget is just under $200 billion under current non-defense spending levels, which is more than double what the VA budget was over a decade ago. The extraordinary increase in the VA budget has far outpaced the growth of patients and beneficiaries and has occurred during a decline in the overall veteran population.

Ensuring veterans get the care and benefits they earned is a critical part of the social contract our country has made with those who put their lives on the line in our defense. It is therefore vital to our national security to have a properly funded VA. But there is a difference between providing the resources the VA needs to accomplish its mission and raising federal budget levels to spend billions more on the VA without a meaningful assessment of whether those additional funds are needed.

Unfortunately, Congress has too often taken the latter approach, to the detriment of veterans and American taxpayers alike.

In 2014, it was revealed that veterans across the country were dying on secret lists while waiting for VA health care. Some ardent defenders of the VA claimed the long wait times for care were a result of lack of funding. But the Obama administration had massively increased the VA’s budget in the previous five years – growing more than $50 billion from 2009 to 2014. In the aftermath of the 2014 scandal, Congress passed and President Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaTrump struggles to win over voters reaping economic boom Michelle Obama weighs in on Trump, 'Squad' feud: 'Not my America or your America. It's our America' Media cried wolf: Calling every Republican a racist lost its bite MORE signed into law a measure that gave the VA another $15 billion increase. In subsequent years the VA budget would continue to grow, reaching its current level of nearly $200 billion.

Despite the influx of resources, veterans continued to die on wait lists and receive poor quality care. The reason is simple: Congress and prior presidential administrations refused to thoroughly address systemic issues within the VA that wasted money and hindered its health care delivery. They chose the easier path of just writing the VA a bigger check.

For example, as of 2017, most of the VA’s medical facilities were more than 50 years old. Considering the shrinking size and changing demographics of the veteran population, most of these facilities are not in the best locations to provide the best and most convenient care. Many VA hospitals are operating either at significant under-capacity or over-capacity. For primarily political reasons, Congress prevented the VA from shifting infrastructure resources to account for this dynamic. Instead, the agency has been forced to spend billions maintaining aging and underutilized facilities.

Fortunately, the VA MISSION Act included provisions mandating the VA undertake an infrastructure review to ensure that funds for facilities are spent to best serve veterans and not wasted on unnecessary or outdated buildings. Additionally, the law consolidated the VA’s community care programs and greatly expanded health care choice for veterans. Unlike many past efforts effort to reform the VA, the VA MISSION Act took a different approach then just simply spending more money – it fundamentally changed how the VA delivers health care to veterans.

The current overall federal spending levels provide more than enough budgetary flexibility to pay for any additional expenses incurred by the implementation of the VA MISSION Act. Further raising spending levels to provide additional money for the already-funded VA MISSION Act, as Pelosi is demanding, would set a bad precedent while also disincentivizing further reforms within the VA that would reduce waste and improve care for our veterans.

No one wants to shortchange those who sacrificed in service of our country. But as recent history has shown, simply dumping more money into the VA without real reform serves neither our veterans nor taxpayers. With a $22 trillion national debt posing a growing threat to our national security, additional unnecessary spending puts at risk the future of the very country our veterans fought to defend.

Homeland Security’s cuts in counterterrorism programs assailed,https://www.latimes.com,"['Staff Writer', 'David Willman Is A Reporter For The Los Angeles Times Based In Washington']",07-22-2019,2019,7,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2019-07-22/trump-administration-counterterrorism-cutbacks-criticized,"A senior House member said Monday that he will explore legislation to prevent the Department of Homeland Security from diverting funds from critical research and programs on tracking nuclear material that could be used in a terrorist attack.

Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank), who heads the House Intelligence Committee, said that the gutting of programs intended to thwart potential terrorist attacks involving weapons of mass destruction over the last two years was a “dereliction of duty” and has put the nation at greater risk of potential catastrophic attack.

A recently published Times investigative report revealed that multiple WMD-related programs have been cut back sharply or eliminated since 2017 at Homeland Security, which has primary domestic responsibility for helping authorities identify and block chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats.

“Reducing staffing and capabilities to respond to WMD attacks, including nuclear terrorism, is shortsighted at best, and could be devastating in the event of an attack,” Schiff said in a statement.

According to an aide, Schiff is considering a legislative remedy within Homeland Security’s pending congressional appropriation.

Schiff sponsored legislation in 2010 that authorized the creation of the National Technical Nuclear Forensics Center at Homeland Security to strengthen detection and tracing capabilities that might deter a hostile foreign state from slipping radiological or nuclear material to terrorists.

Over the last two years, the center’s leadership has left and its staff has shrunk from about 14 to three, one of multiple shifts and cutbacks in the counterterrorism programs at Homeland Security.

“That the Trump administration is letting that capability wither away ... is a dereliction of duty,” Schiff said in a written statement.

Among the programs affected was an elite Homeland Security “red team,” which previously conducted dozens of drills and assessments each year to help federal, state and local officials detect such potential threats as an improvised nuclear device concealed in a suitcase, or a cargo ship carrying a radiation-spewing dirty bomb.

Another Homeland Security unit had helped lead up to 20 WMD-related training exercises each year with state and local authorities. The unit participated in fewer than 10 such exercises last year and even fewer so far this year.

The department’s International Cooperation Division, which worked closely with foreign counterparts and the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency to track and stop the smuggling of dangerous nuclear materials overseas, has been disbanded.

In an interview Sunday, John Roth, who served as Homeland Security’s inspector general from 2014 to 2017, said that the reported shifts and cutbacks merit congressional scrutiny.

“My recommendation would be rigorous oversight hearings and investigations of what’s going on,” said Roth, a former federal prosecutor and Justice Department official.

The WMD-related cutbacks and shifts have been directed by James F. McDonnell, whom President Trump appointed to successive Homeland Security positions in 2017 and 2018.

McDonnell declined through a spokeswoman to be interviewed about the changes, and Homeland Security did not answer written questions about the matter. The department didn’t respond to a request for comment Monday regarding Schiff’s remarks.

Roth said he believes the WMD-related developments likely stem from turmoil at the top of Homeland Security. Since taking office, Trump has gone through two secretaries of Homeland Security and the department now is led by an acting secretary.

Several other top-level appointive positions at Homeland Security remain unfilled, including the deputy secretary and the undersecretary for management.

“When you have significant vacancies in key leadership positions,” Roth said, “you’re basically going to get people who do whatever they want, and aren’t being held accountable.”

The Times reported that $162.2 million — about 40% of the money Congress appropriated last year for the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office, which McDonnell heads — went unspent. That should be a “huge red flag” to Homeland Security’s most senior leaders, Roth said.

“Every dollar obligated to one component is unavailable to others,” Roth noted. “I would be asking some hard questions.”"
How Mueller deputy Andrew Weissmann's offer to an oligarch could boomerang on DOJ,https://thehill.com,[],07-22-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/454185-how-mueller-deputy-andrew-weissmanns-offer-to-an-oligarch-could-boomerang,"The ink was still drying on special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerThis week: Mueller dominates chaotic week on Capitol Hill Top Republican considered Mueller subpoena to box in Democrats Kamala Harris says her Justice Dept would have 'no choice' but to prosecute Trump for obstruction MORE’s appointment papers when his chief deputy, the famously aggressive and occasionally controversial prosecutor Andrew Weissmann, made a bold but secret overture in early June 2017.

Weissmann quietly reached out to the American lawyers for Ukrainian oligarch Dmitry Firtash with a tempting offer: Give us some dirt on Donald Trump Donald John TrumpChelsea Clinton announces birth of third child Ukrainian officials and Giuliani are sharing back-channel campaign information: report Trump attacks 'the Squad' as 'racist group of troublemakers' MORE in the Russia case, and Team Mueller might make his 2014 U.S. criminal charges go away.

The specifics of the never-before-reported offer were confirmed to me by multiple sources with direct knowledge, as well as in contemporaneous defense memos I read.

ADVERTISEMENT

Two years later, Weissmann’s overture may have far-reaching consequences for the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), here and abroad. His former boss, Mueller, is slated to testify Wednesday before Congress.

The DOJ, Mueller’s office and Weissmann did not immediately respond to emails requesting comment on Monday.

At first blush, one might ask, “What’s the big deal?” It’s not unusual for federal prosecutors to steal a page from Monty Hall’s “Let’s Make a Deal” script during plea negotiations.

But Weissmann’s overture was wrapped with complexity and intrigue far beyond the normal federal case, my sources indicate.

At the time, pressure was building inside the DOJ and the FBI to find smoking-gun evidence against Trump in the Russia case because the Steele dossier — upon which the early surveillance warrants were based — was turning out to be an uncorroborated mess. (“There’s no big there there,” lead FBI agent Pete Strzok texted a few days before Weissmann’s overture.)

Likewise, key evidence that the DOJ used to indict Firtash on corruption charges in 2014 was falling apart. Two central witnesses were in the process of recanting testimony, and a document the FBI portrayed as bribery evidence inside Firtash’s company was exposed as a hypothetical slide from an American consultant’s PowerPoint presentation, according to court records I reviewed.

ADVERTISEMENT

In other words, the DOJ faced potential embarrassment in two high-profile cases when Weissmann made an unsolicited approach on June 4, 2017, that surprised even Firtash’s U.S. legal team.

To some, the offer smacked of being desperately premature. Mueller was appointed just two weeks earlier, did not even have a full staff selected, and was still getting up to speed on the details of the investigation. So why rush to make a deal when the prosecution team still was being selected, some wondered.

Second, Weissmann’s approach was audaciously aggressive, even for a prosecutor with his reputation.

According to a defense memo recounting Weissmann’s contacts, the prosecutor claimed the Mueller team could “resolve the Firtash case” in Chicago and neither the DOJ nor the Chicago U.S. Attorney’s Office “could interfere with or prevent a solution,” including withdrawing all charges. “The complete dropping of the proceedings … was doubtless on the table,” according to the defense memo.

Firtash’s team suspected Weissmann’s claim was exaggerated. While Mueller had full authority to investigate the Russia case, he wasn’t an independent counsel separate of the DOJ but, rather, a special counsel subject to the attorney general’s oversight.

The third red flag came in how much Weissmann communicated to Firstash’s lawyers about his hopes for the Ukrainian oligarch’s testimony.

Prosecutors in plea deals typically ask a defendant for a written proffer of what they can provide in testimony and identify the general topics that might interest them. But Weissmann appeared to go much further in a July 7, 2017, meeting with Firtash’s American lawyers and FBI agents, sharing certain private theories of the nascent special counsel’s investigation into Trump, his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort Paul John ManafortUkrainian officials and Giuliani are sharing back-channel campaign information: report Key numbers to know for Mueller's testimony Webb: Questions for Robert Mueller MORE and Russia, according to defense memos.

For example, Firtash’s legal team wrote that Weissmann told them he believed a company called Bayrock, tied to former FBI informant Felix Sater, had “made substantial investments with Donald Trump’s companies” and that prosecutors were looking for dirt on Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner Jared Corey KushnerTrump talks to Swedish leader about rapper A$AP Rocky, offers to vouch for his bail Trump: 'We already started' talks to get A$AP Rocky home from Sweden Kim Kardashian West thanks Trump, Kushner for helping efforts to free A$AP Rocky from Swedish jail MORE.

Weissmann told the Firtash team “he believes that Manafort and his people substantially coordinated their activities with Russians in order to win their work in Ukraine,” according to the defense memos. And the Mueller deputy said he “believed” a Ukrainian group tied to Manafort “was merely a front for illegal criminal activities in Ukraine,” and suggested a “Russian secret service authority” may have been involved in influencing the 2016 U.S. election, the defense memos show.

Weissmann’s private observations and sharing of prosecutor’s theories went beyond what prosecutors normally do in proffer negotiations and risked planting ideas that could lead the witness to craft his testimony, according to legal experts I consulted.

Remarkably, Firtash turned down Weissmann’s plea overtures even though the oligarch has been trapped in Austria for five years, fighting extradition on U.S. charges in Chicago alleging that he engaged in bribery and corruption in India related to a U.S. aerospace deal. He denies the charges.

The oligarch’s defense team told me that Firtash rejected the deal because he didn’t have credible information or evidence on the topics Weissmann outlined.

ADVERTISEMENT

But now, as Firtash escalates his fight to avoid extradition, the Weissmann overture is being offered to an Austrian court as potential defense evidence that the DOJ’s prosecution is flawed by bogus evidence and political motivations.

In a sealed court filing in Austria earlier this month, Firtash’s legal team compared the DOJ’s 13-year investigation of Firtash to the medieval inquisitions. It cited Weissmann’s overture as evidence of political motivation, saying the prosecutor dangled the “possible cessation of separate criminal proceedings against the applicant if he were prepared to exchange sufficiently incriminating statements for wide-ranging comprehensively political subject areas which included the U.S. President himself as well as the Russian President Vladimir Putin Vladimir Vladimirovich PutinKey Merkel ally set to test Trump amid tensions with Europe How global anti-corruption efforts are being corrupted Trump, racism and diversity in America MORE.”

After years of litigation, the U.S. Justice Department won a ruling in Austria to secure Firtash’s extradition to Chicago. But then his legal team secretly filed new evidence that included the Weissmann overture, and Austrian officials suddenly reversed course last week and ordered a new, lengthy delay in extradition.

That new court filing asserts that two key witnesses, cited by the DOJ in its extradition request as affirming the bribery allegations against Firtash, since have recanted, claiming the FBI grossly misquoted them and pressured them to sign their statements. One witness claims his 2012 statement to the FBI was “prewritten by the U.S. authorities” and contains “relevant inaccuracies in substance,” including that he never used the terms “bribery or bribe payments” as DOJ claimed, according to the Austrian court filing.

That witness also claimed he only signed the 2012 statement because the FBI “exercised undue pressure on him,” including threats to seize his passport and keep him from returning home to India, the memo alleges. That witness recanted his statements the same summer as Weissmann’s overture to Firtash’s team.

Firtash’s lawyers also offered the Austrian court evidence of alleged prosecutorial wrongdoing.

ADVERTISEMENT

A key document submitted to Austrian authorities to support Firtash’s extradition was portrayed by DOJ as having come from Firtash’s corporate files and purported to show he sanctioned a bribery scheme in India. In fact, the document was created by the McKinsey consulting firm as part of a hypothetical ethics presentation for the Boeing Co. and had no connection to Firtash’s firm.

Moreover, McKinsey claims in an official statement that it had no knowledge of a bribery scheme by Firtash, and the PowerPoint’s use of the phrase “bribery payments” never came from Firtash or his company and were, instead, hypothetical “assumptions by McKinsey about standard business practices in India,” according to the new Austrian court filing.

Firtash’s U.S. legal team told me it alerted Weissmann to DOJ’s false portrayal of the McKinsey document in 2017, but he downplayed the concerns and refused to alert the Austrian court. The document was never withdrawn as evidence, even after the New York Times published a story last December questioning its validity.

“Submitting a false and misleading document to a foreign sovereign and its courts for an extradition decision is not only unethical but also flouts the comity of trust necessary for that process where judicial systems rely only on documents to make that decision,” Firtash’s American legal team wrote in a statement to me. “DOJ’s refusal to rescind the document after being specifically told it is false and misleading is an egregious violation of U.S. and international law.”

Weissmann long has been a favorite target of conservatives, in part because his earlier work as a prosecutor in the Enron case was overturned unanimously by the U.S. Supreme Court because of overly aggressive prosecutorial tactics. Former DOJ official Sidney Powell strongly condemned Weissmann’s past work as a prosecutor in “Licensed to Lie,” a book critical of DOJ’s pressure tactics.

It is now clear that Weissmann’s overture to a Ukrainian oligarch in the summer of 2017 is about to take on new significance in Washington, where Mueller is about to testify, and in Austria, where Firtash’s extradition fight has taken a new twist.

USDA's plan to relocate research agencies to the Midwest unleashes a brain drain,https://www.cnbc.com,"['Kate Rogers', 'Jeff Daniels']",07-22-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/22/usdas-plan-to-move-research-agencies-to-midwest-starts-a-brain-drain.html,"Two critical federal research agencies are being gutted after workers were asked to relocate from Washington to the Midwest. Starting Monday, new and relocating employees can begin reporting to temporary offices in the Kansas City region, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said. But more than half the workers from the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture have declined to relocate or even respond to transfer assignments, creating a brain drain. The move was announced in June by USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue, beating out more than 100 other proposals. The USDA didn't name which state would house the new headquarters but said a cost-benefit analysis showed a $300 million savings over the course of 15 years, which will help to fund more research, get researchers closer to stakeholders in agriculture and save taxpayer dollars. Perdue added that state and local governments offered ""generous relocation incentives packages"" totaling more than $26 million. The governors of Kansas and Missouri declined to specify what the incentives were. The relocation comes at the cost of existing talent. In total, 72 ERS workers agreed to relocate to Kansas City, while 99 had declined, the USDA said last week. At NIFA, 73 accepted and 151 declined. (The number of workers reported as declining included employees who never responded to relocation requests.) Just under 100 jobs for both agencies will remain in the D.C. region. The USDA said 91% of its more than 100,000 employees are outside Washington.

""We expect these numbers may fluctuate until Sept. 30, the report date to the Kansas City region for relocating employees, as employees are free to change their status until that date,"" a USDA spokesperson said. ""These anticipated ranges were taken into account in the department's long-term strategy, which includes both efforts to ensure separating employees have the resources they need, as well as efforts to implement an aggressive hiring strategy to maintain the continuity of ERS and NIFA's work.""

Pushback on relocation

The move has been met with criticism from congressional Democrats, watchdog groups and workers' unions, which complained about the short time employees were given to decide. Others stressed that separating scientists from other collaborators in Washington would hinder their ability to work and produce research on a range of topics. They've also cited the agency brain drain, since experienced workers are declining to relocate. ""This is not a choice between Kansas City and Washington, D.C.,"" said Kevin Hunt, acting vice president of American Federation of Government Employees Local 3403 and a 10-year employee of the USDA. Hunt works in the ERS and said even though he is from Missouri, he declined relocation. ""We are being asked to relocate to be closer to stakeholders, but we are a national policy-focused agency. This is about people's lives and the amount of time we are being given."" Others balked at the idea of the USDA holding a competition for relocation. Greg LeRoy, executive director of Good Jobs First, a watchdog group that promotes accountability in economic development, called it reminiscent of Amazon's nationwide search for its second headquarters. ""This is Uncle Sam imitating Jeff Bezos,"" LeRoy said. ""Except that these are federally funded taxpayer jobs. The residents of Kansas and Missouri already pay federal taxes, why should they also give a handout to the USDA because the secretary of Agriculture wants to move some jobs there?""

10 ways Andrew Wheeler has decimated EPA protections,https://www.salon.com,[],07-22-2019,2019,7,https://www.salon.com/2019/07/22/10-ways-andrew-wheeler-has-decimated-epa-protections_partner/,"On Monday, President Trump hosted a White House event to unabashedly tout his truly abysmal environmental record. Tuesday, coincidentally, marked the one-year anniversary of Andrew Wheeler at the helm of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), first as acting administrator and then as administrator after the Senate confirmed him in late February.

The good news, if there is any, is that Wheeler is an Eagle Scout compared to his ethically challenged predecessor, Scott Pruitt. The bad news is, as predicted, Wheeler has been more effective than Pruitt in rolling back and eliminating EPA safeguards.

My organization, the Union of Concerned Scientists, has compiled a list of 80 Trump administration attacks on science since taking office, and Wheeler has been the driving force behind many of them. Below are 10 of the more egregious ways he has undermined the EPA’s time-honored role to protect public health and the environment so far.

1. Sidelined Scientists

Wheeler, a former coal industry lobbyist, has taken a number of steps to systematically reduce the role of scientists in the agency’s policymaking process. Last fall, for example, he eliminated the agency’s Office of the Science Advisor, which counseled the EPA administrator on research supporting health and environmental standards, and placed the head of the EPA’s Office of Children’s Health Protection on administrative leave. He also disbanded a 20-member scientific advisory committee on particulate matter, or soot; failed to convene a similar panel on ozone; and packed a seven-member advisory committee on air quality standards with industry-friendly participants.

2. Proposed to Restrict the Use of Scientific Data

Claiming his intent is to increase “transparency,” Wheeler is promoting a rule Pruitt proposed that would dramatically limit the scientific studies the agency considers when developing health standards. If adopted, the rule would restrict the use of scientific studies in EPA decisions if the underlying data are not public and reproducible, which would disqualify many epidemiological and other health studies the EPA relies on to set science-based public safeguards. Given that EPA health standards often rely on studies that contain private patient information, as well as confidential business information that cannot be revealed, the rule would significantly hamper the agency’s ability to carry out its mission. Wheeler plans to finalize the rule sometime this year.

3. Gutted the Coal Ash Rule

The first major rule Wheeler signed as acting administrator refuted his claim that he could fulfill President Trump’s directive to “clean up the air, clean up the water, and provide regulatory relief” at the same time. By rolling back the Obama-era coal ash rule, Wheeler provided regulatory relief to his old friend the coal industry by weakening environmental protections established in 2015 to clean up coal ash ponds, which are laced with toxic contaminants that leak into groundwater. The move was a top priority for coal baron Bob Murray, owner of Murray Energy, Wheeler’s most lucrative client when he worked for the Faegre Baker Daniels law firm.

Coal-fired power plants have been dumping this residue from burning coal into giant, unlined pits for decades. According to the EPA, there are more than 1,000 coal ash disposal sites across the country, and a recent analysis by Earthjustice and the Environmental Integrity Project found that 91 percent of the coal plants filing monitoring data required by the 2015 rule are polluting water with unsafe levels of toxic contaminants. Wheeler’s EPA says the new rule — which extends the deadline for closing some leaking ash ponds and allows states to suspend groundwater monitoring and set their own standards — will save utilities as much as $31 million. But the agency ignored the enormous costs of cancer and neurological and cardiovascular diseases linked to coal ash ingredients, which include arsenic, chromium, lead and mercury.

4. Recommended Unsafe Levels of Drinking Water Contaminants

Poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are used in firefighting foam and a variety of nonstick, cleaning, packaging and other household products, have been linked to thyroid disease and kidney, liver, pancreatic and testicular cancer. According to a recent study by the Environmental Working Group and Northeastern University, these chemicals threaten the drinking water supplies of an estimated 19 million Americans. A 2018 Union of Concerned Scientists report, meanwhile, found that PFAS water contamination at 130 military bases across the country exceed the 11-parts-per-trillion safety threshold determined by the Department of Health and Human Services Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. Nearly two-thirds of the sites had contamination that was more than 100 times higher than the safe level.

In February, Wheeler announced the “first-ever nationwide action plan” to regulate PFAS chemicals in water, saying the agency would develop and set a limit for two of the most prevalent PFAS chemicals, perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid. During the announcement, he told reporters he believes the agency’s voluntary 70-part-per-trillion health-advisory level for the chemicals is “a safe level for drinking water,” despite the fact that this level is more than six times higher than what the Disease Registry considers safe.

While Wheeler slow-walks the EPA’s response, members of Congress have introduced at least a dozen bills to address PFAS contamination, and the Senate recently passed a defense bill that would require the EPA to set a science-based standard for PFAS in drinking water.

5. Rolled Back Clean Water Act Protections

Clearing up a decade-long dispute over the scope of the Clean Water Act, the Obama EPA adopted a broad, science-based definition of the law that included protecting intermittent and ephemeral streams and wetlands that do not have surface water connections to other waterways. A 2015 EPA meta-analysis of more than 1,200 peer-reviewed studies concluded that even infrequently flowing small streams and isolated wetlands can affect “the integrity of downstream waters.” Trash them and that pollution could wind up in rivers, lakes, reservoirs and estuaries.

Regardless, Wheeler announced plans during a December telephone press briefing to reverse the Obama EPA definition of waters protected by the Clean Water Act, a thinly disguised gift to land developers and the agriculture industry. When asked what wetlands would no longer be protected, Wheeler replied, “We have not done … a detailed mapping of all the wetlands in the country.” Likewise, EPA Office of Water head David Ross — who represented industry clients against the EPA before joining the Trump administration — told reporters on the call that the agency had no idea how many streams would be dropped from Clean Water Act protection under the proposal.

In fact, Wheeler and Ross were well aware of the damage their new definition would do. At least 18 percent of streams and 51 percent of wetlands across the country would not be covered under their proposed definition, according to an internal 2017 slideshow prepared by the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers and obtained by E&E News under the Freedom of Information Act.

6. Suppressed an Inconvenient Formaldehyde Report

Last August, Wheeler disingenuously told a Senate committee that the EPA was holding up the release of a report on the risk of cancer from formaldehyde to confirm its veracity. “I am sure we will release it,” he said, “but I need to make sure that the science in the report is still accurate.”

In fact, the report — which concluded that formaldehyde can cause leukemia and nose and throat cancer — was completed by EPA scientists a year before Wheeler testified, according to a Senate investigation, and their conclusion was hardly a surprise. Both the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services National Toxicology Program have already classified formaldehyde as a known human carcinogen.

The EPA’s review process normally takes 60 to 90 days. The formaldehyde report has been in limbo for at least a year and a half, a blatant giveaway to the American Chemistry Council, the U.S. chemical industry’s premier trade association, which has blocked tighter restrictions on formaldehyde for decades.

7. Ignored EPA Scientists’ Advice to Ban Asbestos

Instead of heeding the advice of agency scientists and lawyers to follow the example of 55 other countries and ban asbestos completely, the EPA announcedin April that it would tighten restrictions on asbestos — not ban it — despite overwhelming scientific evidence of its dangers. Manufacturers will be able to continue to use the substance if they obtain EPA approval.

Asbestos has not been produced in the United States since 2002, but is still imported for use in a wide range of commercial and consumer products, including auto brake components, roofing, vinyl floor tile, fire-resistant clothing, and cement pipes, sheets and shingles. One of the deadliest known carcinogens, asbestos kills nearly 40,000 Americans annually, mainly from lung cancer.

8. Weakened the Mercury Emissions Rule

In late December, the EPA proposed to significantly weaken a rule restricting mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants by recalculating its costs and benefits. The Obama EPA, which issued the rule in 2011, estimated it would cost utilities $7.4 billion to $9.6 billion annually to install pollution controls and lead to $37 billion to $90 billion in health benefits by reducing not only mercury, a potent neurotoxin, but also sulfur dioxide and soot, thus preventing 130,000 asthma attacks, 4,700 heart attacks, and as many as 11,000 premature deaths. The Wheeler EPA ignored the “co-benefits” of limiting sulfur dioxide and soot, and flagrantly lowballed the health benefits of curbing mercury alone at only $4 million to $6 million annually.

Most utilities have already complied with the mercury rule at a fraction of the estimated cost, but health advocates fear that this new, industry-friendly accounting method, which makes it appear that the cost to polluters far outweigh the rule’s benefits, will set a precedent for the EPA to sabotage an array of other public health protections.

9. Slammed Vehicle Emission Rules Into Reverse

Last August, the EPA and the Transportation Department issued a proposal to freeze vehicle tailpipe pollution and fuel efficiency standards, rolling back a 2012 Obama-era rule requiring automakers to boost passenger vehicle fuel economy to a fleetwide average of 54 miles per gallon by 2025. In a Wall Street Journal opinion piece titled “Make Cars Great Again” published a few days before the two agencies announced their proposal, Wheeler and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao charged that the Obama-era standards — the first to limit vehicle carbon emissions — are too burdensome for automakers and “raised the cost and decreased the supply of newer, safer vehicles.”

Advertisement:

Parroting the Trump administration’s line of reasoning, Wheeler and Chao argued that fuel-efficient cars — which weigh less than gas-guzzlers — are not as safe, a contention that has been widely debunked. In fact, a 2017 studyconcluded that reducing the average weight of new vehicles could result in fewer traffic fatalities.

In any case, freezing the standards at 2020 levels would be hard on the planet, not to mention Americans’ wallets, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists. It would result in an additional 2.2 billion metric tons of global warming emissions by 2040, amounting to 170 million metric tons in 2040 alone — the equivalent of the annual output of 43 average size coal-fired power plants. It also would cost drivers billions of dollars. In 2040 alone, they would have to pay an additional $55 billion to fill their gas tanks. Meanwhile, the design improvements automakers have made so far to meet the standards have already saved drivers more than $86 trillion at the pump since 2012, and off-the-shelf technological fixes, the Union of Concerned Scientists says, would enable automakers to meet the original 2025 target.

10. Rescinded the Clean Power Plan

Perhaps Wheeler’s most damaging move to date came late last month when he signed a final rule to repeal and replace the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, which would have required coal-fired power plants to dramatically cut their carbon emissions. Yet another gift to the coal industry, Wheeler’s so-called Affordable Clean Energy rule grants states the authority to determine emissions standards but sets no targets, leaving them the option to do absolutely nothing.

Advertisement:

Before Wheeler released the final rule, an April study in the journal Environmental Research Letters found that his draft version would boost carbon emissions in 18 states and the District of Columbia and increase sulfur dioxide emissions in 19 states. The EPA’s own analysis of the draft rule, meanwhile, found that the proposal could have led to as many as 1,400 premature deaths annually by 2030 due to an increase in soot, and as many as 15,000 cases of upper respiratory problems.

Reversing Decades of Bipartisan Protections

If Wheeler truly cared about transparency, he would petition the Trump administration to change the name of his agency to “Every Polluter’s Ally.” In just 12 months, he has killed or weakened dozens of safeguards with the sole intention of bolstering polluting industries’ profit margins even after Congress slashed the corporate tax rate. As a result, millions of Americans will be drinking filthier water and breathing dirtier air, and more will suffer from serious diseases, according to his agency’s own accounting.

Wheeler and his predecessor Pruitt have sullied the bipartisan track record of one of the nation’s agencies entrusted with protecting public health and safety. So it is little wonder that three former EPA administrators who, notably, served under Republican presidents, recently sounded the alarm on Capitol Hill, urging legislators to step up their oversight of the agency and denouncing its attempts to hamstring science.

“There is no doubt in my mind that under the current administration the EPA is retreating from its historic mission to protect our environment and the health of the public from environmental hazards,” former EPA Administrator Christine Todd Whitman, who served under President George W. Bush, stated in her written testimony for the House Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. “This administration, from the beginning, has made no secret of its intention to essentially dismantle the EPA…. Therefore, I urge this committee, in the strongest possible terms, to exercise Congress’s oversight responsibilities over the actions and direction of the EPA.”

U.S. State Department says concerned by reports of Chinese interference in South China Sea,https://www.reuters.com,"['Nandita Bose', 'Min Read']",07-20-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-southchinasea/u-s-state-department-says-concerned-by-reports-of-chinese-interference-in-south-china-sea-idUSKCN1UF0EM,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department said on Saturday it is concerned by reports of China’s interference with oil and gas activities in the South China Sea, including Vietnam’s long-standing exploration and production activities.

“China’s repeated provocative actions aimed at the offshore oil and gas development of other claimant states threatens regional energy security and undermines the free and open Indo-Pacific energy market,” the State Department said in a statement.

Vietnam on Friday accused a Chinese oil survey vessel and its escorts of violating its sovereignty and demanded that China remove the ships from Vietnamese waters.

Vietnam and China have for years long been embroiled in a dispute over the potentially energy-rich stretch of waters in the South China Sea.

On Wednesday, two U.S.-based think tanks reported that Chinese and Vietnamese vessels had engaged in a standoff lasting several weeks near an oil block in Vietnam’s exclusive economic zone. Neither Beijing nor Hanoi have directly confirmed or denied the reports.

“The United States firmly opposes coercion and intimidation by any claimant to assert its territorial or maritime claims,” the State Department said.

“China should cease its bullying behavior and refrain from engaging in this type of provocative and destabilizing activity,” it added.

The State Department also pointed to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s comments earlier this year when he said, “by blocking development in the South China Sea through coercive means, China prevents ASEAN members from accessing more than $2.5 trillion in recoverable energy reserves.”

The State Department also said that China’s growing pressure on ASEAN countries to accept provisions that seek to restrict their right to partner with third party companies or countries further reveal its intent to assert control over oil and gas resources in the South China Sea.

“China’s reclamation and militarization of disputed outposts in the South China Sea...including the use of maritime militia to intimidate, coerce, and threaten other nations, undermine the peace and security of the region,” it said."
"Sen. McSally rips Ocasio-Cortez's 'uninformed and dangerous' call to get rid of DHS, investigate White House border policies",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Fox News Staff', 'This Article Was Written Fox News Staff.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/mcsally-ocasio-cortez-border-uninformed-dangerous,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.'s call to get rid of the Department of Homeland Security and to establish a ""9/11 style commission"" to investigate White House border policies are ""uninformed and dangerous,"" Sen. Martha Mcsally, R-Ariz., told Fox News.

In an interview with ""Fox & Friends"" Monday, Sen. McSally, a 26-year veteran who was stationed in Saudia Arabia at the time of 9/11, said that her response to AOC's plan was ""what the hell is she talking about?""

McSally said that she prefers to work on ""closing the loopholes and fixing the laws on which the Democrats are refusing to come to the table,"" as a more effective way of solving the border crisis, and slams democrats for failing to work towards a solution.

Sen. McSally said she has been ""begging"" Democrats for years to come to the table, and that she is glad many have them have finally traveled to the border to see the crisis first hand. She urged members of Congress to join her and Senator Linsey Graham, R-S.C., on a bill they've been working on, to ""get it to the president's desk and stop the crisis.""

TRUMP AND THE 'SQUAD' CONTINUE WAR OF WORDS

Current laws incentivize trafficking of children, McSally said, explaining that if an adult were to show up with a child illegally, they would be let-go ""within 20 days."" She explained that she, together with Senator Graham is working to close the loopholes to ""stop the incentive for the dangerous journey,"" and she hopes Democrats will join her, despite their ""lack of action"" thus far.

""They want to deny detention space and ICE beds, they don't want any barriers, no border wall, they don't want to close the loopholes that are incentivizing this behavior, essentially that's what's overwhelming and causing it to break.""

""We're open to their ideas - Senator Graham and I have both said that. Come to the table, let's fix this crisis. Stop the crazy dangerous rhetoric and the humanitarian crisis which is really being exacerbated by their lack of action on this,"" McSally said in a plea of help.

On Saturday, Senate Minority Leader, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., visited the border and said he ""would like to work with Republicans"" to tackle the crisis on the Southern border.

Following his visit, the president tweeted that he looks forward to speaking with Schumer to come up with a solution to the crisis.

""Senator Chuck Schumer has finally gone to the Southern Border with some Democrat Senators. This is a GREAT thing! Nearby, he missed a large group of Illegal Immigrants trying to enter the USA illegally. They wildly rushed Border Patrol. Some Agents were badly injured Based on the comments made by Senator Schumer, he must have seen how dangerous & bad for our Country the Border is. It is not a “manufactured crisis,” as the Fake News Media & their Democrat partners tried to portray. He said he wants to meet. I will set up a meeting ASAP!"""
VA secretary uses religious liberty to delay veterans' claims,https://www.sctimes.com,"['Patricia Wilson', 'Times Writers Group', 'Published P.M. Ct July']",07-22-2019,2019,7,https://www.sctimes.com/story/opinion/2019/07/22/va-secretary-uses-religious-liberty-delay-veterans-claims-agent-organge-vietnam-korea-court-battle/1796376001/,"CLOSE

The Department of Veterans Affairs issued a press release July 5 announcing the extension of Agent Orange claims for “Blue Water Navy” veterans.

Agent Orange was the toxic herbicide used to clear plants and trees in battle zones in Korea and in Vietnam. Vietnam veterans who served offshore of Vietnam between Jan. 9, 1962-May 7, 1975, and veterans who served in or near the demilitarized zone in Korea from April 1, 1968-Aug. 31, 1971 are eligible for benefits.

The 2019 Blue Water Navy Veterans Act was signed into law June 25. According to the VA press release, 420,000 to 560,000 Vietnam veterans may be considered Blue Water Navy Veterans. The law goes into effect Jan 1. Korean War veterans in their late 80s may not live long enough to collect these benefits.

VA Secretary Robert Wilkie stated, “VA is dedicated to ensuring that all veterans receive the benefits they have earned.” Wilkie further stated the VA will not begin to process the claims until Jan. 1 “we are working to ensure we have the proper resources in place to meet the needs of our Blue Water Veterans community and minimize the impact on all veterans filing for disability compensation.”

Wilkie fails to mention the VA denied these claims for years, and fought a bitter court battle before Congress could finally pass the bill.

VA benefit claim representatives will not begin to deal with a backlog estimated to be 420,000 to 560,000 claims until Jan. 1 because they do not have to comply until that date.

Wilkie found a cause, which is of such importance, that he issued a press release on July 3 to let the public know the VA is overhauling religious and spiritual symbols to protect the religious liberty of veterans effective immediately.

The reason given for this urgent action by Wilkie is “to make sure that all our veterans and their families feel welcome at VA no matter their religious beliefs.”

In what universe have veterans been beating the doors of their local VA Medical Center and demanding Bibles?

Veterans know every VA medical center has an all-faith chapel or meditation room. A VA may also have a reflection garden, hall of harmony, or corners of meditation, depending on the size of the VA facility. At smaller clinics, VA personnel have a list of local religious leaders to assist a veteran in need of spiritual care.

Like many of my sister and brother veterans, I have spent time in VA waiting rooms to see a health provider. In over 15 years of care from various VA medical centers across the country, I have never witnessed a veteran being upset or on a rant because a Bible was not sitting on a table with the rest of the reading materials.

The waiting room conversations revolve around the weather, what branch of the military you served in and when. Veterans also tend to relate their personal experiences in getting care at the VA and if they have had problems with their benefit claims.

Nothing gets the attention of the public quicker than to mention religion. Wilkie is using this as a distraction from the backlog of claims.

Jeremy Redmon of the Atlanta Journal Constitution, in a July 14 article, cited the fact that, “the backlog just to achieve eligibility for VA care is 317,157 claims.”

Veterans know they have religious freedom. We all took the same oath to protect and defend the Constitution, which guarantees that freedom among others. Veterans want their claims for eligibility processed, their disability claims handled in a fair and timely manner, and health care they earned.

When I walk through the doors of Building 1 at the St. Cloud VA, I am not there for a prayer meeting. I am there to receive the best possible health care from one of the better VA centers in the country.

Let us handle our religious beliefs Secretary Wilkie. You get busy and light a fire under the VA to process the paperwork that will grant veterans the care they need now!

This is the opinion of Patricia Wilson, a veteran and a resident of St. Cloud. Her column appears on the fourth Tuesday of the month.

DOJ tells Robert Mueller 'any testimony must remain in the boundaries of your public report',https://www.cnn.com,"['David Shortell', 'Jessica Schneider', 'Manu Raju', 'Paul Leblanc']",07-22-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/22/politics/doj-has-not-seen-robert-mueller-opening-statement/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Justice Department wrote a letter to Robert Mueller on Monday about his upcoming congressional hearing, telling the former special counsel his testimony must adhere to the 448-page report he issued earlier this year.

The testimony, the letter stated, ""must remain within the boundaries of your public report because matters within the scope of your investigation were covered by executive privilege.""

The letter, sent in response to Mueller's request for guidance about his testimony, is signed by Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer.

Mueller is scheduled to testify before the House Judiciary and Intelligence panels Wednesday morning beginning at 8:30 a.m. ET. The former special counsel has been a reluctant witness, and is appearing before subpoena . Democrats plan to push Mueller on several aspects of his investigation as well as the question if he would recommend charges against President Donald Trump were he not the President.

The statement, which will likely not be released until Mueller starts his testimony, did not have to be cleared through the Department of Justice and no officials from the department, including Attorney General William Barr, have seen the document, Popkin said.

Popkin did not comment on how much or how long Mueller has been preparing, but would confirm that Wilmer Hale -- a Washington, DC, law firm -- has allowed Mueller and ""a small group of folks who worked with him at the special counsel's office"" to use some unoccupied office space for the purpose of preparation.

""If you look at him and his career, he is someone who comes to the table fully prepared and he's going to be ready on Wednesday,"" he said.

In Monday's letter, Weinsheimer quotes from Mueller's public statement in May where he indicated his reluctance to testify, and notes that the Department of Justice does not typically allow prosecutors to appear before Congress and discuss their cases.

""As the Attorney General has repeatedly stated, the decision to testify before Congress is yours to make in this case, but the Department agrees with your stated position that your testimony should be unnecessary under the circumstances,"" Weinsheimer wrote.

Weinsheimer told Mueller that DOJ policy prevents him from commenting on the legal conclusions his office made ""with respect to uncharged individuals, other than information contained within the portions of your report that already have been made public."" Weinsheimer also said Mueller should not testify about portions of the public report that have been redacted or about uncharged third parties.

All of the people preparing Mueller have spent the last two years working with him at the special counsel's office investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. The individuals helping Mueller prepare are some of the top people from that office, though their names haven't yet been released.

Mueller's testimony is expected to be in line with the public statement he made on May 29 wherein he stated charging Trump was not an option that his office could consider, Popkin said. Mueller also used his public statement to make clear his desire to not testify before Congress.

""I hope and expect this will be the only time I will speak to you in this manner,"" he said.

""It's important the office's written work speaks for itself,"" Mueller added of his report, which was delivered in March to Barr. ""The report is my testimony.""

""If you listen to that statement, he made it clear that you can basically expect him to stick to the report,"" Popkin added.

Mueller will also submit a statement for the record to the committee, but that will be the redacted report and nothing else.

""He was subpoenaed obviously and he's made it clear that's why he will be there,"" Popkin said when asked about Mueller's frame of mind ahead of the hearing.

""Other than that, any information on his demeanor and tone will have to wait until Wednesday,"" he said.

While Mueller has made clear his intention to not extrapolate beyond his report, Democrats hope pointed questions during testimony will offer new context that could deal a blow to Trump.

As a sign of the importance Democrats are placing in Mueller's testimony, members on the House Judiciary Committee are planning to hold a two-hour mock hearing Tuesday afternoon ahead of the Mueller hearing Wednesday, according to a source briefed on the plan.

This comes days after Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee held their own mock session, as did Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee, as CNN reported last week.

The House is out of session Monday, so there have been scant in-person meetings among the members. That will change Tuesday as members on both committees plan to go behind closed doors for a final round of deliberations and preparations to make sure they are on the same page ahead of the high-stakes Wednesday hearing.

Mueller's 448-page report , which was released in April, detailed numerous cases in which Trump asked his aides to take actions that would have obstructed the investigation, but stated they were unsuccessful because the aides refused his orders.

For many Americans, traveling abroad is the best solution to escape the suffocating temperatures of July and August.

Relaxed work hours and schools on summer vacations also allow for more time to plan and embark on extended getaways.

But many popular tourist destinations, including countries that have traditionally had friendly relations with the U.S. and its citizens, might not be as safe as you assume.

On Thursday, a travel advisory was issued for people traveling to Peru, which is hosting the Pan American Games from July 26 to August 11, 2019, and Parapan American Games August 23 to September 1.

U.S. citizens are being warned to be aware major events are a prime opportunity for thieves and other criminal elements to prey upon unsuspecting tourists.

If you are set on taking a trip to warm-weather areas such as Latin America or the Caribbean, or to cultural European hotbeds, the Department of State's Bureau of Consular Affairs has you covered.

The organization's purpose is to ""protect the lives and serve the interests of U.S. citizens abroad"" by providing information to help travelers assess the risks of international travel.

It’s time to break up DHS.,https://slate.com,['Fred Kaplan'],07-19-2019,2019,7,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/07/aoc-dhs-break-up.html,"Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Photo illustration by Slate. Photos by Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images and Win McNamee/Getty Images.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez got at least one thing right this week: The Department of Homeland Security should be abolished.

Ocasio-Cortez proposed breaking up DHS in a radio interview with New Yorker editor David Remnick, after which several Republicans began hammering her for the idea. “Absolute irresponsibility,” Rep. Liz Cheney exclaimed to a reporter. “Moronic, stupid, naïve, and dumb,” GOP strategist Karl Rove sputtered on Fox News.

It’s unclear why Dick Cheney’s daughter and George W. Bush’s former White House deputy chief of staff should find AOC’s suggestion so outrageous. A Democrat, then-Sen. Joe Lieberman, first proposed creating DHS in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, to show that his party could get serious about terrorism too—and then-President George W. Bush initially opposed the idea, saying that it would just pile on another layer of bureaucracy. That proved to be an understatement.

Bush finally relented after the 9/11 Commission concluded that the attacks happened, in part, because the FBI and the CIA hadn’t shared intelligence about the hijackers’ movements prior to the attack. This overstated the case, but suddenly consolidation became a popular nostrum to our problems, and in 2002, Bush signed Lieberman’s idea into law.

The organizations that didn’t consolidate—the CIA and FBI, the culprits that mishandled intelligence about al-Qaida in the first place—elevated their counterterrorism units, redirected their focus, and strung new lines of communications between them. Meanwhile the Department of Homeland Security subsumed 22 agencies from eight federal departments—with a combined budget of $40 billion (back then) and a payroll of 183,000 employees—into one hydra-headed, crossbred, poorly conceived monstrosity.

It wasn’t just the size that was the problem: Most of these agencies had been performing distinct functions; shmooshing them together wouldn’t necessarily make them more cohesive or efficient. In fact, it made each component less effective. Several of those agencies had been headed by officials with the standing of Cabinet secretaries, who could focus laser-like on their specific domains and had the clout to request direct access to the president. This is no longer true. The Secretary of Homeland Security, even a very good one, has the time and bandwidth to focus on maybe two or three of the department’s 22 areas. The other areas are now handled by undersecretaries or assistant (or deputy assistant) secretaries—people with less clout and less access, leaving issues less attended.

The place is a well-known mishmash unable to attract top talent in the upper tiers, where policy is made, and unable to retain top talent in the middle tiers, where operations are managed.

Here’s one example: In the early 1990s, when the U.S. government started addressing cybersecurity, the Defense Department created a specially staffed joint task force for “computer network defense.” It had bureaucratic clashes with similar but separate units in the Air Force and the National Security Agency, but those in charge were beginning to figure out how to work together.

DHS is unable to attract top talent in the upper tiers, where policy is made—and unable to retain top talent in the middle tiers, where operations are managed.

Then, after 9/11, it was decided that DHS would be responsible for defending the nation from cyberattacks (though the Pentagon and the NSA would remain in charge of protecting defense networks). The system of interagency arrangements, which had slowly been evolving, fell apart. DHS lacked the resources and know-how for its mission. During the early Obama administration, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano signed a memorandum of understanding allowing the DHS and NSA to work together in crises, but it was sabotaged by a DHS deputy who opposed any plan that helped turn the internet into a “war zone.” (The deputy was a few years late on trying to stop that development.)

DHS has probably also had a deleterious effect on protecting security and civil liberties on the southern border, the main topic of Ocasio-Cortez’s concerns. Before 9/11, border matters were handled by the U.S. Customs Service and the Immigration and Naturalization Services, which the DHS fused into a new agency, Customs and Border Patrol.

Customs and the INS were run as fairly professional law enforcement agencies, with varying degrees of laxity or fervency, depending on the times. Under a more normal administration, CBP might still operate in that manner. But lassoed into a political department and run by a handpicked operative, it has turned into an enforcement squad for Trump’s obsessively anti-immigrant agenda. Even under Trump’s orders, would the competent bureaucrats of the old Customs Service have herded children into cages? Maybe. But they might have handled things in a more professional fashion because it would have been an independent agency following its own rules and codes, rather than a subset of a super-agency run by a political appointee.

Bureaucratic routines and regulations sometime serve a laudable purpose.

It’s very hard to turn back the clock to 2001 and dissolve DHS into its once separate components, especially since most people don’t remember or even knowthat it wasn’t always this way. But maybe we should try. Republicans talk about dissolving federal agencies all the time. As Ocasio-Cortez put it in a clarifying tweet: “Discussing reorganization shouldn’t be out of the question.”"
"For 50 Years Since Apollo 11, Presidents Have Tried to Take That Next Giant Leap",https://www.nytimes.com,['Peter Baker'],07-19-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/19/us/politics/apollo-11-anniversary-presidents.html,"WASHINGTON — At his star-spangled Independence Day extravaganza this month, President Trump singled out Gene Kranz, the legendary Apollo flight director. “Gene,” the president said, “I want you to know that we’re going to be back on the moon very soon — and someday soon, we will plant the American flag on Mars.”

What could be more American than vowing to go to the moon and beyond on the Fourth of July? For Mr. Trump, it was a chance to channel his inner John F. Kennedy, who first made the moon the nation’s goal — to make the sort of bold promise that appeals to his own sense of greatness and to wrap himself in a part of Americana akin to baseball and apple pie.

But Mr. Trump is the 10th president since Kennedy to put his stamp on the space program and the latest to aim for the stars with more brio than blueprint. After the Apollo program ended, other presidents promised to go back to the moon — or send humans to Mars or even land astronauts on asteroids. None did, unwilling or unable to obtain the financing necessary, and it remains uncertain whether Mr. Trump will, either.

As the nation on Saturday celebrates the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing, the story of presidents and space exploration in the subsequent five decades is one of fascination, frustration and futility, an unrequited romance as star-struck chief executives dreamed of recapturing the magic of Kennedy’s moonshot without summoning the resources or the national will that made it possible in 1969, almost six years after his death."
Bipartisan senators fight 'political considerations' in EPA's new FOIA rule,https://thehill.com,[],07-22-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/454189-bipartisan-senators-fight-political-considerations-in-epa-foia-rule,"A bipartisan group of senators is pushing back against the new public records policy at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), saying it may violate the law by giving political appointees the power to hold back requested information.

“The rule purports to make numerous changes to the EPA’s FOIA process that appear to run contrary to the letter and spirit of FOIA, thus undermining the American people’s right to access information from the EPA,” the senators wrote in a letter to EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerOvernight Energy: Historic heat wave is double whammy for climate change | Trump sees 'bigger problems' than plastic straws | House Science chair threatens EPA over 'stonewalled' answers Science committee chair threatens EPA over 'stonewalled' answers to lawmakers Overnight Energy: USDA expected to lose two-thirds of research staff in move west | EPA hails Trump's work on reducing air pollution | Agency eyes reducing inspections of nuclear reactors MORE, referring to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).

The new EPA policy, first first reported by The Hill, was announced late last month without any opportunity for public feedback. ADVERTISEMENT

“It is difficult to understand, however, how a rule that limits where requests may be made and appears to affirm political appointees’ authority to redact information in ways that may violate binding precedent is ‘insignificant’ or ‘inconsequential,’” they said, pointing to the two exceptions under law for avoiding public comment on a new rule.

Grassley and others have raised the possibility of a legislative response to the FOIA rule, decrying what they call a culture of secrecy coming from the federal government.

Lawmakers and media outlets have been vocal in their concerns about the rule, saying it would limit access to information by giving political appointees more power to determine whether documents are “responsive” to a requester's query.

EPA spokesman Michael Abboud said the agency ""has no plans to withdraw the finalized rule"" in a Monday statement to The Hill.

""As we have said this rule will enhance transparency and efficiency of responses to FOIA requests. Allegations made that the rule is changing the political appointees role in FOIA are false and irresponsible,"" Abboud said.

The senators said the rule would give political appointees, including the administrator, the power to issue final determinations whether to release or withhold documents in response to FOIA requests.

“Expressly affirming appointees’ authority to issue final determinations may embolden future senior officials and increase the chances — under any administration — that final FOIA determinations are unnecessarily delayed or driven by political considerations rather than the law,” they wrote.

They were also concerned by an aspect of the rule that would allow political appointees to hold back portions of records, something they say does not fit under the current exemptions allowed by law and also violates a recent court decision that requires turning over a full record once it has been deemed responsive.

“You could have a situation where there is a pile of documents that the FOIA officer thinks is responsive and have a political appointee overrule them and say, 'I don’t think those documents are responsive because that’s not exactly what that person was looking for,’” Matt Topic, government transparency and First Amendment lawyer at Loevy & Loevy, a Chicago-based firm that specializes in civil rights, previously told The Hill. “There's a lot of opportunity to screw around with that.""

Earlier this month, the Society for Environmental Journalists along the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and 37 other news media organizations sent a letter to the EPA asking it to suspend the implementation of the FOIA rule in order to allow a public comment period.

Environmental groups have also pushed back against the rule.

“Any politicization of FOIA undermines its core functions of enabling the public to inform itself on what its government is up to, and to hold officials accountable for those actions,” the groups wrote in the letter, saying they were “concerned that this new rule will unduly impair the public’s right and ability to apprise itself of important agency actions.”"
Thousands Freed From Prison Custody As DOJ Implements Sentencing Reform Law,https://www.npr.org,['Carrie Johnson'],07-19-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/2019/07/19/743502961/thousands-freed-from-prison-custody-as-doj-implements-sentencing-reform-law,"Thousands Freed From Prison Custody As DOJ Implements Sentencing Reform Law

Updated at 4:11 p.m. ET

More than 3,100 people will leave Bureau of Prisons custody starting Friday, part of what Justice Department officials call ""a truly monumental effort"" to comply with the First Step Act, a criminal justice law passed by Congress last year.

Most of the offenders being freed have been convicted of drug-related crimes and have been living in halfway houses across the United States in preparation for their release, acting BOP chief Hugh Hurwitz told reporters at a news conference in Washington.

About 900 of the inmates are subject to detention by local authorities or immigration officials, and their fate will be up to states or the Department of Homeland Security, he said.

The Justice Department announced that 250 more inmates who are elderly or terminally ill have transitioned into home confinement or compassionate-release programs since President Trump signed the law last December.

Those programs existed in some form before the First Step Act, but advocates for prisoners and their families said they were used only sparingly and now are somewhat easier to access.

""The department intends to implement this law fully and on time, with the goal of reducing crime, enhancing public safety and strengthening the rule of law,"" said Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen.

Authorities also unveiled a new risk assessment tool designed to identify prisoners who could benefit from prison programming that would allow them to win credits that count toward early release under the law.

Inmates will be reassessed every six months under that new program.

In a joint statement, Sens. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said they would ""vigilantly"" review the new risk assessment system.

""It's critical that the assessment does not disproportionately designate minorities as having a higher risk of reoffending,"" the senators said.

Questions about implementation

The Justice Department enlisted a think tank, the Hudson Institute, to assist with the assessment effort. But that decision has come under fire from key Democrats in Congress.

""The Hudson Institute and its leadership have opposed sentencing reform, opposed the First Step Act's reforms, and authored an article entitled 'Why Trump Should Oppose Criminal Justice Reform,' "" as House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and subcommittee chairwoman Karen Bass, D-Calif., said earlier this year.

""We are concerned that the selection of a biased organization lacking requisite expertise may reflect a lack of intent to diligently and effectively implement the bipartisan criminal justice reforms,"" they said.

Advocates seeking to overhaul the federal system welcomed news Friday that the Justice Department is moving ahead to implement the First Step Act. But they said they have ongoing concerns about funding and oversight, and they want Congress to hold the administration accountable.

Attorney General William Barr has been the subject of criticism that he holds outdated views about crime and punishment from the earlier era when he served as attorney general.

""There's a lot of skepticism over whether this Justice Department is going to fully implement the law,"" said Inimai Chettiar, legislative and policy director for the Justice Action Network.

""We definitely believe that Congress needs to step in and ensure that this is happening and to also fully fund the law because the only way that these recidivism reduction programs are going to be effective is if they are fully funded.""

Still, groups that work with inmates and their families said that whatever its failings, the First Step Act is making a difference.

""Every day of freedom is important,"" said Kevin Ring, president of the group Families Against Mandatory Minimums. ""We're happy for the families who get to welcome home their loved ones a few weeks or months early."""
Many USDA workers to quit as research agencies move to Kansas City: ‘The brain drain we all feared’,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Ben Guarino', 'Reporter Covering The Practice', 'Culture Of Science', 'Ben Guarino Is A Reporter For The Washington Post S Science Section. He Joined The Post In']",07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2019/07/18/many-usda-workers-quit-research-agencies-move-kansas-city-brain-drain-we-all-feared/,"

Two research agencies at the Agriculture Department will uproot from Washington, D.C., to Kansas City in the fall. But many staffers have decided to give up their jobs rather than move, prompting concerns of hollowed-out offices unable to adequately fund or inform agricultural science.

About two-thirds of the USDA employees declined their reassignments, according to a tally the department released Tuesday. Ninety-nine of 171 employees at the Economic Research Service, an influential federal statistical agency, will not move. At the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which manages a $1.7 billion portfolio in scientific funding, 151 of 224 employees declined to relocate.

Jack Payne, University of Florida’s vice president for agriculture and natural resources, warned that the hemorrhage of employees will devastate ERS and NIFA. “This is the brain drain we all feared, possibly a destruction of the agencies,” Payne said.

Workers who agreed to move must do so by Sept. 30, although USDA has not established permanent office space and has not said whether the agencies will be located on the Missouri or Kansas side of the Kansas City area. Workers who were asked to move but declined “will be separated by adverse action procedures,” per letters the employees received in June.

The department expects relocation numbers may “fluctuate” until the Sept. 30 cutoff, according to a statement provided by USDA. “These anticipated ranges were taken into account in the department’s long-term strategy, which includes both efforts to ensure separating employees have the resources they need as well as efforts to implement an aggressive hiring strategy to maintain the continuity of ERS and NIFA’s work.”

Tim Cowden, president of the Kansas City Area Development Council, which advocated for the relocation to Kansas City, said in a statement that “just over 36 percent of those given the option to relocate have accepted, which is very strong for any HQ relocation. We remain committed to working with all USDA employees interested in relocating to KC.”

Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II (D-Mo.), along with Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.) and Rep. Sam Graves (R-Mo.), was an early supporter of the move to Kansas City. Cleaver said in a statement he empathized “with not wanting to uproot your family.” But if the move “has to happen,” he said, “then Kansas City is the best place in America for these agencies’ new home,” because it can “fill the void with competent and qualified individuals.”

Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) told The Washington Post, “This kind of staff loss will completely gut the ERA and NIFA, and will ultimately prevent the USDA from conducting critical research that helps grow the food our families eat.”

Sonny Ramaswamy, the NIFA director from 2012 to 2018, said he was aware of $50 million in grants, slated to be distributed over the next three months, for research areas identified as priorities in the 2018 farm bill. Those grants would have funded studies into subjects as diverse as disease-resistant cotton in Mississippi and hail-damaged corn in Nebraska.

Now, that science is “not going to happen,” Ramaswamy said, because the planned move has disrupted the agency. A senior NIFA scientist familiar with the grants, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid professional retaliation, confirmed that these grants are on hold and in danger of never being distributed.

NIFA, when fully staffed, employs about 400 people. As it becomes more diminished, the agency’s ability to review grant proposals, manage awards or hold grant recipients accountable is threatened, Ramaswamy said. He predicted tens of millions of dollars in grant funding will be in jeopardy. Most money earmarked for NIFA grants, if unspent, returns to the Treasury Department.

Katherine Smith Evans, the ERS administrator from 2007 to 2011, reviewed a list of employees who are leaving. Four of five economists working on bees and pollination at ERS have left or will leave, she said. Ten of 12 economists working on trade and international development have retired, already left or plan to do so. None of the farm finance and tax experts will remain with the agency. “I agree with people who say it will take 10 years to recover,” Smith Evans said.

Gale Buchanan, the USDA chief scientist and undersecretary for research, education and economics in the George W. Bush administration, said employees face “an almost impossible task” by trying to do their jobs with reduced numbers.

The decision process, he said, has been flawed. “I could live by whatever blue-ribbon committee recommended to do to address some of the concerns the secretary had,” Buchanan said. But, he added, “you don’t just pull an idea out of the air and, for some political reason, make a decision.”

The agencies were understaffed even before Tuesday’s tally of those who will not relocate. Employees at the agencies quit in large numbers before the department issued reassignment letters. In early June, vacancy rates at the agencies were about 20 to 25 percent.

“Both agencies already have experienced significant losses of skilled personnel, beginning back when the proposed move was announced,” Payne said. “The percentage of employees moving is even smaller when the denominator is the full staff level.” During fiscal year 2018, ERS had 320 employees. Unless a wave of new hires fills the deserted desks, by this fall, ERS will be half the size it was two years ago.

When Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced the relocation in August, he said it would “provide more streamlined and efficient services.” A cost-benefit analysis released by the department in June suggests moving to Kansas City will save as much as $300 million over 15 years.

An organization of economists, the Agricultural and Applied Economics Association, disputed the projected savings; the move may cost taxpayers money, the group said, because the analysis overestimated the expense of retaining the agencies in the capital and did not calculate the value of lost research.

"After census debacle, White House to knock out senior Commerce official",https://www.politico.com,"['Nancy Cook', 'Margaret Harding Mcgill']",07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/18/white-house-earl-comstock-out-1600269,"Commerce policy director Earl Comstock clashed with Trump administration officials on a number of policy issues. | Andrew Harnik/AP Photo White House After census debacle, White House to knock out senior Commerce official Senior Trump aides have sparred with the policy director for Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross over the census, 5G and other issues.

The White House is pushing a top aide to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross out of the Trump administration, the first round of house-cleaning after the 2020 census debacle and clashes over tech policy.

In recent months, Commerce policy director Earl Comstock has angered Trump’s acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, White House lawyers, members of the National Security Council and officials at the National Economic Council, according to five current and former administration officials. The irritation extends to the highest staff level of the White House, several officials stressed, citing both Comstock’s handling of the 2020 U.S. census’s citizenship question and the internal debate over spectrum policy as key areas of disagreement.

Story Continued Below

One former administration official said he could not think of anyone who “had pissed off as many senior White House officials” as Comstock, who critics allege often tried to exceed his own authority as a top Commerce policy staffer. Comstock also clashed with officials across federal agencies, according to one administration official.

While officials said the process of forcing out Comstock through a firing or resignation is underway, the date of his actual departure remains unclear. He was at the agency until the end of the day on Wednesday.

The White House referred questions about Comstock to the Commerce Department. A Commerce spokesperson said “there is no truth to these rumors. Earl Comstock is an instrumental and valuable member of the Commerce team. He has a keen understanding of the functions of the federal government and has spearheaded multiple departmental initiatives as the deputy chief of staff for policy. Earl will continue to work tirelessly on behalf of the Secretary, the Department of Commerce and the American people.”

As Mulvaney has sought to exert greater control over federal agencies, Comstock’s performance has come under far greater scrutiny — similar to how the White House also has paid close to attention recently to top officials at the departments of Labor and Health and Human Services.

Comstock’s role in failing to put the citizenship question on the U.S. census was just the latest high-profile blow for him, since it’s an issue the president cares about deeply — adding to widespread views inside the White House that Commerce is not effectively executing the president’s agenda.

Administration officials said Comstock’s eventual departure is not necessarily a foreshadowing of Ross’s own tenure in the Cabinet — though the president has been frustrated over the past year with his Commerce secretary’s negotiating prowess in trade talks and the census question.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201907/1311/1155968404_6058082603001_6058083404001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

And Commerce officials don’t see Ross, an 81-year-old investor and longtime friend of the president, leaving imminently despite months of speculation and ongoing sparring with lawmakers. “He likes doing the job,” said a personal familiar with Ross.

Comstock, who acted as Ross’s sherpa during the confirmation process, clashed with other Trump administration officials on a number of policy issues, including spectrum and net neutrality.

A feud among Trump's advisers over 5G wireless — a technology crucial to U.S. competition with China over the future of the internet — spilled into public view in March, when Commerce raised concerns that FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's effort to free up more 5G airwaves for the wireless sector would interfere with the government's use of nearby airwaves for weather forecasting. The White House ultimately sided with the FCC in that debate.

But that did not end the internal infighting. Pai accused the department of “blocking our efforts at every single turn” during a Senate oversight hearing in June. He said the relationship between his agency and Commerce has deteriorated since David Redl abruptly resigned his post as head of Commerce’s NTIA in May.

Commerce’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, with support from NASA, has raised concerns that using 24 GHz airwaves for 5G services could degrade weather forecasting systems’ ability to make predictions. The FCC concluded its auction of the airwaves in May.

Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) in June warned Ross that a senior adviser “may be placing personal animosity ahead of our country's 5G goals.” Ross responded by saying officials had reached a “workable compromise” — an assertion the FCC denied. The issue also arose in a House hearing Tuesday on spectrum policy.

Comstock has not been in lock-step with the FCC in other policy areas. Early in his tenure at Commerce, he quietly opposed the FCC’s repeal of Obama-era net neutrality regulations by backing a congressional effort to restore the rules. The one-time Republican Senate staffer believes telecom companies like AT&T and Verizon need firm oversight, and had previously challenged the Obama-era rules in court because he did not believe they went far enough in reining in broadband providers.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has failed to bring 'swagger' back to the State Department and America is paying the price,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Brett Bruen'],07-20-2019,2019,7,https://www.businessinsider.com/secretary-of-state-mike-pompeo-hasnt-restored-state-department-opinion-2019-7,"He came in promising to restore some swagger to the step of America's diplomats. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has spent a lot of time on swagger, his own. Little effort has been made to lift up others.

Our country's first line of defense at outposts around the world remains dangerously diminished and damaged. Even more concerning for our national security, such arrogance and ambition have proven quite costly for our influence abroad.

When Pompeo came on board, replacing the former Texas oil executive Rex Tillerson, the State Department was still suffering from a condition I call: Post-Tillerson Stress Disorder.

The Texas oil executive's management reforms wreaked havoc through the halls of the Harry S. Truman Building. So even though Pompeo was a former congressman from the outer extremities of the political spectrum, he was still seen as an improvement.

Pompeo promised to lift the debilitating hiring freeze and look after his people. A new ""professional ethos"" was written up, emphasizing respect and integrity. Unlike his predecessor, Pompeo spent time with families when he visited embassies. Just the fact that he held meetings and traveled regularly was an improvement.

Sure, his constant talk about swagger seemed a bit silly at first. But, my former colleagues told me, ""At least he will put us back at the big-kids table."" Many believed his promises of renewed hiring, reversing deep cuts to programs, and providing some modicum of support for those who serve.

The hiring hasn't gotten back to prior levels. Budgets continue to be slashed. Worst of all, Foreign Service families aren't getting the help they desperately need.

The State Department has not provided ongoing care for those injured by the serious sonic attacks in Cuba and China. Pompeo has also callously chosen not to restore funding for the care required for children of diplomats with special needs.

Then came the shutdown. That was the moment he really lost support, according numerous current diplomats with whom I remain in contact. They were so outraged we organized a call with journalists to shed light on their predicament, an unprecedented move for the normally press-shy diplomatic corps.

Americans serving overseas with their families bore some of the worst impacts from the extended period without pay. Unlike federal workers in the US, diplomats posted abroad could not pick up gigs on the local market. They don't have a support network of friends and family nearby. They wanted to hear their secretary at least acknowledge their predicament.

Instead, Pompeo ignored their plight. Making matters worse, he chose to bring his wife on a several-nation trip at the height of the shutdown. He even asked American diplomats working without pay to staff his wife, possibly in violation of federal regulations.

My former colleagues told me they were absolutely livid. It was an unnecessary and inappropriate burden on those serving abroad.

Then come the policy problems. Pompeo has by most measures mismanaged the North Korea account, failing to win Pyongyang's trust and teeing up solutions for three presidential-level engagements. The coalition to support a tougher stand on Iran has failed to materialize. Pompeo's aggressive saber-rattling on Venezuela was unhelpful.

Without question, selling Trump's policies can be a tall order. But his predecessors Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice managed to apply some delicate diplomacy to navigate turbulent waters in the wake of former President George W. Bush's deeply unpopular decisions, from Guantanamo to Iraq. This balancing act seems to be absent from Pompeo's State Department.

It's easy to dismiss the bombastic Pompeo as a natural byproduct of the Trump era. But bear in mind he is now what passes for a brake on bad ideas in the cabinet. He is literally what stands between us and another unwise war.

The trouble with swagger is that it soon wears off. It also really wears on people, when not grounded in substance.

America is paying a high price for the pompousness of Pompeo. Many foreign leaders have just stopped listening to him. Turkey's recent acquisition of a Russian missile system is just the latest example.

From what I hear, a good portion of his own department has lost confidence in his leadership. Career employees continue to flee, including a more than 30% decline in the percentage of senior Foreign Service executives who are African American, according to a recent report.

Lastly, despite all the bravado, the secretary has yet to deliver a single major foreign-policy victory for the administration. I think it's beyond time to dial back on the arrogance. He would be well served to channel President Teddy Roosevelt's advice of speaking softly while carrying a big stick.

Ocasio-Cortez confronted Acting Homeland Security Secretary McAleenan about images of her ""violent rape"" from a secret Facebook group. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – After a week fielding racist attacks from President Donald Trump, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez questioned Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan about the whereabouts of Border Patrol agents who threatened her in a secret Facebook group.

The intense and personal line of questioning Thursday happened as McAleenan appeared before the House Oversight and Reform Committee to testify about his role in separating migrant children from their families and worsening conditions at the migrant detention centers along the southern U.S. border.

He was also asked several times about a secret Facebook group of current and former Border Patrol agents that contained more than 10,000 members and included posts mocking migrants and the deaths of children in custody and suggesting harm to Democratic lawmakers. After the group's existence was revealed by a ProPublica report, McAleenan announced DHS was investigating the ""disturbing"" and ""inexcusable"" posts.

""Did you see the posts planning physical harm to myself and Congresswoman Escobar?"" Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., asked McAleenan. ""Yes,"" he answered. ""And I directed an investigation within minutes of reading the article.""

""Did you see the images of officers circulating Photoshopped images of my violent rape?"" Ocasio-Cortez continued. ""Yes I did,"" McAleenan responded.

McAleenan did not specifically say whether those Border Patrol agents were still on the job after Ocasio-Cortez, a freshmen lawmaker known for her progressive policies and large following on social media questioned whether they were still ""responsible for the safety of migrant women and children.""

He said several agents have been put on administrative duties while the investigation continues, saying ""I don't know which ones correspond to which posts and we've ordered cease and desist orders to dozens of more.""

McAleenan shot back after Ocasio-Cortez asked about whether the separating of children and families led to a ""dehumanizing culture"" within Customs and Border Protection. ""We do not have a dehumanizing culture at CBP,"" he said touting that the agency, ""rescues 4,000 people a year"" and is ""committed to the well-being of everyone that they interact with.""

He said the posts were ""unacceptable"" but ""I don't think it's fair to apply them to the entire organization or that even the members of that group believed or supported those posts.""

The hearing came after days of President Trump attacking Ocasio-Cortez and three other freshmen Democratic lawmakers, all women of color who are critical of his administration and its policies.

It started Sunday when Trump sent a series of tweets suggesting Reps. Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.; Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.; and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., should ""go back"" to where they came from.

The House passed a resolution condemning the racist comments on Tuesday as the president faced widespread criticism over the remarks, which he doubled down on at the White House and on Twitter throughout the week.

He singled out the four women Wednesday evening during a rally in North Carolina and his supporters started chanting ""send her back"" as the president brought up Rep. Omar, who is originally from Somalia and became one of the first two Muslim women in Congress when she was elected in the 2018 midterms. Omar is a naturalized U.S. citizen.

Trump distanced himself from the chants on Thursday, saying, ""I disagree with it"" and ""I wasn't happy with that message.""

The pesticide the EPA knows harms children but approved anyway,https://www.baltimoresun.com,['Baltimore Sun Editorial Board'],,,,https://www.baltimoresun.com/opinion/editorial/bs-ed-0722-epa-chlorpyrifos-20190722-6uujgsba7ned5atgmueqbue4a4-story.html,"That move was wrong, wrong, wrong. Not because there isn’t more to learn about the pesticide and its lingering effects — such as the impact of chlorpyrifos residue commonly found on popular grocery store mainstays like broccoli and strawberries — but because a federal agency charged with protecting human health and safety ought to be erring on the general public’s side. Their primary mission is not to protect the profitability of the chemical industry or even farmers who may find chlorpyrifos an affordable and convenient product but have other pesticide alternatives available to them. A 2014 EPA assessment warned that even relatively low exposure to the chemical can have disastrous consequences on youngsters. Shouldn’t Corteva Agriscience, its maker, be forced to prove its safety rather than allow the rest of us to be guinea pigs?"
Ellucian Banner security flaw highlighted by Education Department,https://www.insidehighered.com,[],07-19-2019,2019,7,https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/07/19/ellucian-banner-security-flaw-highlighted-education-department,"The U.S. Department of Education has warned of “active and ongoing exploitation” of a security flaw in Ellucian’s Banner system that may have given hackers access to student data such as grades, financial information and Social Security numbers.

A security alert, published Wednesday by the department’s Office of Federal Student Aid, said 62 colleges and universities using Banner had already been targeted. The alert indicates that criminals have been “scanning the internet looking for institutions to victimize” and drawing up lists of colleges to target.

Institutions that have transitioned to Banner 9, the latest version of Ellucian’s enterprise resource planning system, are not thought to be affected. But users using older versions of two Banner modules called Web Tailor and Enterprise Identity Services could be vulnerable.

According to Ellucian’s website, more than 1,400 institutions worldwide use Banner to manage student grades, staff payrolls, course schedules, admissions and student financial aid, among other tasks. Web Tailor and Enterprise Identity Services can be used by system administrators to get access to sensitive data protected under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.

The student aid office encouraged institutions that have not recently upgraded Web Tailor or Enterprise Identity Services to do so and to contact the FSA incident team to determine whether there has been a data breach. Ellucian published a patch on May 14 that fixed the security flaw but has not shared how many institutions have installed it.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology described the Banner security flaw as an “improper authentication vulnerability” that enabled attackers to take over users' sessions when they attempted to log in. Depending on the administrative privileges of the user, and the way data are organized by individual institutions, attackers could use this access to move laterally through administrative systems and access sensitive information. Attackers could also potentially manipulate this information, perhaps changing personal information or grades, dropping students from their courses or denying them student financial aid.

According to FSA, affected institutions reported that attackers used the security flaw to manipulate admissions and enrollment systems and create thousands of fake student accounts over the space of a few days. “Some of these accounts appear to be leveraged almost immediately for criminal activity,” the office said.

Josh Sosnin, chief information security officer at Ellucian, said in an emailed statement that there is no connection between the security flaw and the generation of the fake student accounts. “Ellucian has confirmed internally that the two issues outlined in the Department of Education report are separate, unrelated issues,” he said. “There is no connection between these two issues and Ellucian has communicated this to the Department of Education.”

If your campus uses Banner/Ellucian as a SIS, I hope you install updates in a timely manner. So far 62 campuses have reported they were affected by exploitation of a vulnerability in the product by ""criminal elements."" Patch was released May 14. #emchat https://t.co/SwIkZvdZaN — Dr. Liz Gross (@lizgross144) July 18, 2019

Institutions being targeted by bots that submit fraudulent admissions applications are “an industry issue and not specific to Ellucian or Banner,” said Sosnin. He added that Ellucian’s customer service employees are “standing by to help” customers with questions about patches or updates.

Why the FSA office is reporting on the Banner security flaw two months after it was patched by Ellucian is unclear. It is also not clear how the flaw was discovered, though the NIST advisory links to a document suggesting that it may have been identified as early as December 2018 by Joshua Mulliken, a member of IT staff at the University of South Carolina.

In a GitHub post, Mulliken outlines a “disclosure timeline” indicating that Ellucian took several months to address his concerns. Mulliken said via email that he was the first person to identify the security flaw.

""Ellucian has not been proactive in ensuring that its customers understand the seriousness of CVE-2019-8978,"" said Mulliken. ""Several institutions have reached out to me today and informed me that the had deferred updating for some time. The official messaging was not able to convey the urgency required, which more than likely contributed to the current situation.""

Scott Shackelford, professor of law and cybersecurity program chair at Indiana University at Bloomington, said it is not uncommon for organizations to take several months to release patches addressing security issues, particularly if they “don’t think it’s particularly troublesome.”

Moving forward, Shackelford encouraged colleges and universities to pay attention when companies release updates and install them “as quickly as possible.”

“This really boils down to basic cyberhygiene,” he said. He encouraged institutions to limit the number of users with administrative privileges for Banner and other enterprise resource planning software.

Both Shackelford and Emory Roane, privacy counsel at Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a nonprofit organization that tracks data breach disclosures and advocates for consumer data protection, said it could take weeks before more information about the data breach is made public.

Depending on where institutions are located and what type of data were affected, there are different reporting requirements for disclosing breaches, said Shackelford. In Georgia, for example, there is no state-enforced timeline for reporting data breaches, he said. Roane would like to see that change -- he thinks the U.S. should move closer to Europe’s 72-hour disclosure requirement under the General Data Protection Regulation.

Without disclosures, it is difficult to determine how serious the Banner data breaches are, said Shackelford.

Charlie Moran, senior partner and CEO of Moran Technology Consulting, described the breach as “bad, but only for a small number of schools.”

Most of the 1,400 institutions using Banner have already made the transition to Banner 9 modules, said Moran. “Most schools moved to Banner 9 this past year in a forced march because of a major software change that Ellucian was forced to make, so there are not a lot of schools running this old software,” he said."
U.S. Air Force to begin transferring space situational awareness data to Commerce Department,https://spacenews.com,['Caleb Henry'],07-19-2019,2019,7,https://spacenews.com/u-s-air-force-to-begin-transferring-space-situational-awareness-data-to-commerce-department/,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Commerce Department is “imminently” close to receiving a repository of satellite and space debris tracking data from the Air Force, a Commerce official said Wednesday.

Kevin O’Connell, director of the Commerce Department’s Office of Space Commerce, said the repository, called the Unified Data Library, is the first step in the transfer of some space situational awareness responsibilities as requested by the White House last year.

President Donald Trump, in signing Space Policy Directive 3 in June 2018, directed the Defense Department to give the publicly releasable portion of its space situational awareness data to the Commerce Department.

O’Connell said there is a growing urgency for the Commerce Department to begin handling that responsibility, driven particularly by the deployment of megaconstellations that could add thousands of new satellites in low Earth orbit.

“We had an approach that served us well for decades,” O’Connell said July 17 during a panel organized by the International Astronautical Congress here. “That approach won’t serve us well for the next decade, or the decades to come, given even our most modest expectations about the space economy.”

Satellite operators have relied on the U.S. Air Force for notifications when other satellites or debris are on a possible collision course. The White House wants the military to shed that responsibility so it can focus on “maintaining access to and freedom of action in space,” according to Space Policy Directive 3.

As the Commerce Department prepares to carry that mantle, it is looking to commercial companies to play a big role, O’Connell said.

The Commerce Department issued a request for information to industry in April that received 42 responses, O’Connell said. That response rate led the department to extend the comment window until the end of July, he said.

“I’m amazed at what’s come back,” O’Connell said. He estimated another 20 responses will likely come in before the process is completed.

O’Connell said companies not traditionally associated with the space industry, such as those involved in artificial intelligence, cloud computing and machine-to-machine communications, are presenting ideas on how to improve space situational awareness.

“We are going to get to work with some of these companies when we get access to this iteration of the Unified Data Library,” he said.

O’Connell said the Commerce Department has had extensive conversations with U.S. allies about their participation in the department’s new responsibilities. The Unified Data Library will be their first opportunity to get involved, he said.

The Commerce Department has not finalized the framework for handling its new responsibilities. George Nield, the former FAA associate administrator for commercial space transportation, suggested the government initiate a civil space traffic management pilot program as soon as possible.

“Ideally, this would be a whole of government effort with participation by interested stakeholders who are industry, academia and the international community,” Nield said during the panel. “Initial activities could take advantage of existing hardware, software and observations.”

Nield said the purpose of the pilot program would be to measure the new system against what the Air Force currently provides.

The Commerce Department is making progress bringing commercial and allied stakeholders together, O’Connell said, which he described as promising, though not at the level Nield suggested.

“We are seeing that kind of discussion,” O’Connell said. “It’s probably not as ambitious as a pilot, but it’s what is being done today.”

Members of the Satellite Industry Association are developing policy suggestions as well, according to Therese Jones, the trade group’s senior director of policy. She said the association, whose members include spacecraft operators such as Intelsat and Spire, as well as commercial space situational awareness companies AGI and ExoAnalytic Solutions, want to work on sharing data and improving data quality, among other things.

“I would encourage everyone to think not as much about prescriptive technical solutions as I would suggest thinking about what sort of outcome you want from whatever technical solution is currently at hand,” she said."

Trump and State Department's Intervention Could Reportedly Hurt ASAP Rocky's Chances of Release,https://www.yahoo.com,['Gavin Evans'],07-21-2019,2019,7,https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/trump-state-department-apos-intervention-173358816.html,"""Sources connected to the case"" have reportedly told TMZ that the intervention by the U.S. State Department and President Trump could actually end up backfiring in their ongoing effort to try and get ASAP Rocky released from a Swedish jail. While TMZ is unclear on specifics, the previously mentioned sources think that there could be acrimony from Swedish prosecutors who would be angry about attempted interference into their affairs. They also may not want to look like they're easing up due to U.S. intervention.

On Friday, prosecutor Daniel Suneson requested (and was granted) a six-day extension to continue with an investigation into assault allegations against Rocky. That investigation is now set to run through Thursday, July 25. At that point, another hearing is set to see if ASAP should be further detained. As for Rocky's side of things, he has maintained throughout the entire ordeal that he acted in self-defense.

On Saturday, Trump was told by Swedish prime minister Stefan Lofven that the Swedish government would not intervene in the investigation, according to a statement. Trump had sought the rapper's release after being asked to do so by A-listers that included Kanye West and Kim Kardashian. The call between Trump and Lofven reportedly lasted about 20 minutes, and was said to be “friendly and respectful.”

Despite the cordial vibe, however, Lofven reportedly ""underlined that in Sweden everyone is equal before the law and that the government cannot and will not attempt to influence the legal proceedings."" The call was apparently not the end of the dialogue on the subject between the two governments, as Trump said on Twitter: ""Our teams will be talking further, and we agreed to speak again in the next 48 hours."""
