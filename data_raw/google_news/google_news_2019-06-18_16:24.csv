Conservative Radio Host Has Doubts About Trump. His Audience Doesn’t Want to Hear It.,https://www.nytimes.com,['Jeremy W. Peters'],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/us/politics/michael-savage-trump.html,"Mr. Savage has always been an eccentric character in the world of conservative talk radio. His background is not in politics but plants. He studied medicinal properties in plants in Hawaii and Fiji and earned a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley, in nutritional ethnomedicine, a field that examines how various cultures and ethnicities use natural products for health purposes. His affinity for the Bay Area is one that few conservatives share.

He wrote numerous books about health under his birth name, Michael Alan Weiner. He picked Savage as his radio name after Charles Savage, a sailor who is believed to be the first to introduce firearms to Fiji but was eventually murdered by the islanders.

Mr. Savage turned to radio, he said, after being denied repeatedly for jobs as a professor. “White males need not apply,” he said. “And I remember to this day the humiliation.”

Though he is disillusioned with the Trump administration in many ways, he still takes pride in his role as an early supporter. He often tells the story about the evening in 2017 when he visited Mar-a-Lago as a guest of Christopher Ruddy, the president’s friend and chief executive of Newsmax. When Mr. Trump saw Mr. Savage, he threw his arm around him and said loudly enough for anyone within earshot to hear, “I wouldn’t be president without this man.”

Mr. Savage insists he does not need or crave that kind of access anymore. He believes enough people in his audience would see through it as phony if he did, he said, because they appreciate his independence even if they don’t share his skepticism.

“The day they think I’ve been turned and I’m willing to sell myself out for a pat on the head or another piece of Hanukkah candy,” he said, “they’re going to say he’s just like the rest of them. ‘He’ll do anything for access to the king.’”"

Three women, Maria, Nancy and Jenny, arrived Monday afternoon and camped overnight.

""We are all former Dems,"" Maria told Blanchard, saying they all support the Walk Away movement for disillusioned Democrats.

Nancy said the president ""unites everybody"" at his rallies and it feels like a ""rock concert"" for those in attendance.

""What I want to hear is what he has planned for everybody to move forward,"" she said.

The president tweeted on Monday morning that his campaign has received more than 100,000 ticket requests for the event in an arena that only holds 20,000 people.

Trump prepares to bypass Congress to take on Iran,https://www.politico.com,"['Eliana Johnson', 'Nahal Toosi', 'Anita Kumar']",06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/18/trump-congress-iran-1366756,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo addressed the media about attacks on merchant ships in the Persian Gulf, placing the blame on Iran. | Eric Baradat/AFP/Getty Images Foreign Policy Trump prepares to bypass Congress to take on Iran But the administration is looking to pressure the clerical regime, not fight it, a senior official said.

The Trump administration and its domestic political allies are laying the groundwork for a possible confrontation with Iran without the explicit consent of Congress — a public relations campaign that was already well under way before top officials accused the Islamic Republic of attacking a pair of oil tankers last week in the Gulf of Oman.

Over the past few months, senior Trump aides have made the case in public and private that the administration already has the legal authority to take military action against Iran, citing a law nearly two decades old that was originally intended to authorize the war in Afghanistan.

Story Continued Below

In the latest sign of escalating tensions, National Security Adviser John Bolton warned Iran in an interview conducted last week and published Monday, “They would be making a big mistake if they doubted the president's resolve on this.” Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan announced on Monday evening that the U.S. was deploying an additional 1,000 troops to the region for “defensive purposes.” And Secretary of State Mike Pompeo jetted to Tampa, home of Central Command, on Monday evening to huddle with military officials to discuss “regional security concerns and ongoing operations,” according to a State Department spokeswoman.

The developments came as Iran announced it was on course to violate a core element of its nuclear deal with major world powers, exceeding the amount of enriched uranium allowed under the agreement in 10 days unless European nations intervened to blunt the economic pain of American sanctions. And they came as U.S. officials promoted video footage and images showing what they say were Iranian forces planting explosive devices on commercial oil tankers.

Yet even as the president’s hawkish advisers have highlighted Iran’s alleged bad behavior, administration officials privately stressed that direct military action remained highly unlikely absent an Iranian attack on an American ship or an American citizen. The president, who campaigned against getting the U.S. bogged down in unnecessary foreign wars, is considered the primary internal obstacle to a counterattack, officials said, noting that Trump continues to press for an improved nuclear deal.

Trump on Monday de-emphasized the international significance of the recent tanker explosions in an interview with Time magazine — downplaying the Gulf of Oman's value to U.S. oil supplies and describing alleged Iranian acts of aggression as ""very minor.""

“If you look at the rhetoric now compared to the days when they were signing [the 2015 nuclear deal], where it was always ‘death to America, death to America, we will destroy America, we will kill America,’ I’m not hearing that too much anymore,” Trump told Time. “And I don’t expect to.”

Still, to the alarm of Democrats and some Republicans, Pompeo has suggested that if the administration does take military action, it might rely on the 2001 congressional bill that greenlighted America’s military response to the 9/11 attacks to strike Iran. Asked Sunday by CBS host Margaret Brennan whether the administration believed it had the authority to initiate military action, Pompeo would say only, “Every option we look at will be fully lawful.”

And Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), a close ally of the administration, urged the president to attack Iran outright — adding that he didn’t need permission from Congress. “Unprovoked attacks on commercial shipping warrant a retaliatory military strike,"" Cotton told Brennan. “The president has the authorization to act to defend American interests,” he said.

But in a sign of some unease among other Republicans, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) told POLITICO that she expected to discuss the legitimacy of that justification — and of military retaliation itself — with her Senate colleagues this week.

Trump has sent conflicting messages about his own intentions — one day signaling his desire to negotiate with the clerical regime in Tehran, the next dismissing Iran as unready for serious talks. “While I very much appreciate P.M. Abe going to Iran to meet with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,” Trump tweeted last Thursday, “I personally feel that it is too soon to even think about making a deal. They are not ready, and neither are we!”

“The regime in Tehran is testing American patience with violence in the Gulf,” said Jonathan Schanzer, senior vice president at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. “The administration now has to weigh its options.”

In some of Pompeo’s recent pronouncements, many on the left, and a few on the right, see the Trump team paving a path to war.

In April, the State Department named the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a foreign terrorist organization, a legal designation that some fear could be used to link the elite paramilitary force with al Qaeda. Later, Pompeo also said Iran had “instigated” a May 31 suicide attack on a U.S. convoy in Afghanistan, even though the Taliban claimed credit for the incident.

Pressed by CBS’s Brennan on Sunday, Pompeo reiterated the claim. “[W]e have confidence that Iran instigated this attack,” he said. “I can't share any more of the intelligence. But I wouldn't have said it if the intelligence community hadn't become convinced that this was the case.”

The secretary of state’s efforts to link Iran and al Qaeda and to terrorism more broadly have become a flashpoint in multiple congressional hearings this spring — and they have taken on renewed significance given the growing possibility of a military confrontation between the two countries.

“It’s not surprising that you have a kind of revisitation of the AUMF because here you have what looks like the potential for a kind of real escalation,” said Dennis Ross, the veteran Middle East negotiator, referring to the 2001 bill that authorized military action against any national or individual involved in the 9/11 attacks.

“In the 2001 AUMF, there’s actually no real relationship to this,” Ross added. “It certainly didn’t name Iran and there comes a point where many in Congress want to have oversight over getting into a shooting war with Iran.”

As the president’s senior national security advisers huddled on Monday to consider how to respond to Iran, it was unclear how close the U.S. was inching to military action. Schanzer, for one, cast skepticism on an unattributed report in the Jerusalem Post on Monday that the U.S. had drawn up plans for a limited bombing campaign against an Iranian nuclear facility.

A senior administration official said Monday that the goal of the administration’s maximum pressure policy remains forcing the regime back to the table to negotiate a new and improved nuclear deal.

Iran has thus far been careful to avoid attacks on American vessels — an internal administration red line that would force a military response, this official said. Administration allies including FDD’s chief executive, Mark Dubowitz, said that while he expects U.S. sanctions against the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps to increase, it is less clear whether military action will result absent a direct attack against an American ship or an American citizen.

The president himself is caught between competing impulses: his disdain for the 2015 deal the Obama administration struck with Iran and his desire to strike a contrast, on the one hand, and his reluctance to get into another war in the Middle East on the other. He has long been more skittish than his hawkish advisers about ratcheting up tensions, but he sent a blunt warning to Iran’s leaders last month that “If they do anything it would be a very bad mistake.”

Last week, two lawmakers — Trump ally Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) and Democrat Elissa Slotkin (Mich.) — said that Pompeo had invoked the 2001 AUMF in a closed-door briefing with lawmakers about Iran, suggesting the administration could use it as a legal justification for war.

“We were absolutely presented with a full formal presentation on how the 2001 AUMF might authorize war on Iran,” Slotkin said. “Secretary Pompeo said it with his own words.""

Exiting an earlier closed-door briefing on May 21 by acting defense secretary Shanahan, Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) told reporters, “What I heard in there makes it clear that this administration feels that they do not have to come back and talk to Congress in regards to any action they do in Iran.”

The Trump administration’s case against Iran has rested in part on the argument that it has supported al Qaeda. Announcing the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in 2017, for example, Trump said that the country “supports terrorist proxies and militias,” including al Qaeda.

“Iran’s connection to al Qaeda is very real,” Pompeo told lawmakers in April. “They have hosted al Qaeda, they have permitted al Qaeda to transit their country. There is no doubt there is a connection between the Islamic Republican of Iran and al Qaeda. Period. Full stop.”

When Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) pushed Pompeo in that hearing to pledge that the administration would not rely on the 18-year old war authorization to attack Iran, the secretary demurred, saying that he would “prefer to leave that to the lawyers.""

“I can tell you explicitly you have not been given power or authority by Congress to have a war with Iran and in any kind of semblance of a sane world you would have to come back and ask us before you go into Iran,” Paul retorted.

Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), who was the only member of Congress to vote against the AUMF back in 2001, included an amendment repealing the provision in the defense appropriations bill currently being debated on the House floor. Her legislation would repeal the AUMF eight months after the appropriations bill becomes law, providing time, she has argued, for Congress to properly debate and vote on a replacement bill.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said last month that the administration could not rely on the 2001 law to take military action in Iran, and more than 100 House Democrats followed up on her remarks by penning a letter to the president making a similar case.

""They cannot call the authorization, AUMF, the authorization for the use of military force that was passed in 2001, as any authorization to go forward in the Middle East now,"" Pelosi said at a press conference in May.

Several Democratic presidential candidates have made similar comments. “If the administration wants to go to war against Iran, then the Constitution requires them to come to Congress to ask for an authorization for the use of military force,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), told The Intercept on Friday, calling it “Constitutional Law 101.”

In his campaign’s maiden foreign policy speech, Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg argued for repealing and replacing the 2001 law in order to narrow its scope — an idea that has gained traction among some Democrats.

Some Republicans, however, say the administration could respond without getting a stamp of approval from Congress, drawing comparisons to the Reagan administration’s decision in 1987 to protect Kuwaiti oil tankers from Iranian attacks in the midst of the Iran-Iraq war. Because U.S. law prohibits the use of Navy ships to escort foreign vessels, the Kuwaiti ships flew American naval flags.

“Reagan ended up sinking about half the Iranian Navy,” said Eric Edelman, who served as undersecretary of defense for policy in the George W. Bush administration. “Admittedly, it was a small navy, but they noticed.”

Paul J. Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman who is serving a federal prison sentence, had been expected to be transferred to the notorious Rikers Island jail complex this month to await trial on a separate state case.

But last week, Manhattan prosecutors were surprised to receive a letter from the second-highest law enforcement official in the country inquiring about Mr. Manafort’s case. The letter, from Jeffrey A. Rosen, Attorney General William P. Barr’s new top deputy, indicated that he was monitoring where Mr. Manafort would be held in New York.

And then, on Monday, federal prison officials weighed in, telling the Manhattan district attorney’s office that Mr. Manafort, 70, would not be going to Rikers.

Instead, he will await his trial at a federal lockup in Manhattan or at the Pennsylvania federal prison where he is serving a seven-and-a-half-year sentence for wide-ranging financial schemes, according to people with knowledge of the matter."

The information came in a letter to Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, who is responsible for overseeing the security review.

""To this point, the Department has assessed culpability to 15 individuals, some of whom were culpable in multiple security incidents,"" Mary Elizabeth Taylor, the State Department's Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of Legislative Affairs, wrote to Grassley. ""DS has issued 23 violations and 7 infractions incidents. ... This number will likely change as the review progresses.""

ATTEMPT TO HACK CLINTON EMAILS STUNNED AIDES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, DOCS SHOW

President Trump highlighted the finding in a tweet overnight, questioning whether Democrats would investigate and saying, ""This is really big.""

The State Department, calling the matter ""serious,"" said it expected to conclude the investigation by Sept. 1. The department acknowledged that the probe was unusually time-consuming.

""Given the volume of emails provided to the Department from former Secretary Clinton's private email server, the Department's process has been necessarily more complicated and complex requiring a significant dedication of time and resources,"" Taylor wrote.

Taylor also noted that disciplinary consequences were pending.

""In every instance in which the Department found an individual to be culpable of a valid security violation or three or more infractions, the Department forwarded the outcome to the Bureau of Diplomatic Security's Office of Personnel Security and Suitability (DS/PSS), to be placed in the individuals' official security file,"" Taylor wrote. ""All valid security incidents are reviewed by DS and taken into account every time an individual's eligibility for access to classified information is considered.

""This referral occurred whether or not the individual was currently employed with the Department of State and such security files are kept indefinitely,"" Taylor added. ""Consistent with the referral policy, for individuals who were still employed with the Department at the time of adjudication, the Department referred all valid security violations or multiple infractions to the Bureau of Human Resources.""

The State Department declined to release the names of the employees, consistent with its procedures. The department promised another update once its review is completed.

NEWLY RELEASED EMAILS SHOW CLINTON TEAM DISCUSSING 'PRIVATE' COMMS CHANNEL WITH ISRAEL

Clinton's private email use has remained in the spotlight, as the DOJ looks into potential misconduct in the handling of federal authorities' surveillance and intelligence operations in 2016. Then-FBI Director James Comey said in 2016 that Clinton's handling of classified information was ""extremely careless"" -- remarks that were watered down from their original draft -- but that ""no reasonable prosecutor"" would bring charges.

It emerged earlier this year that then-FBI general counsel James Baker testified that he thought Clinton should have been prosecuted until he was convinced otherwise ""pretty late"" in the investigation.

And, last month, a trove of partially redacted FBI documents from the agency's investigation into whether Clinton mishandled classified information -- a probe known as the ""Midyear Exam"" -- revealed that top Clinton aides were shocked at apparent attempts to hack her private email servers.

The document release revealed numerous episodes in which the Clinton team either suspected it had been hacked or seemingly acknowledged that security measures had come up short.

""omg,"" top Clinton aide Huma Abedin wrote to Justin Cooper, the technology pro overseeing Clinton's private home-based email servers, when he told her shortly after midnight on Jan. 9, 2011, that ""someone was trying to hack us.""

And in March, it was revealed that the Justice Department ""negotiated"" an agreement with Clinton's legal team that ensured the FBI did not have access to emails on her private servers relating to the Clinton Foundation. Former FBI Agent Peter Strzok testified about the arrangement during a closed-door appearance before the House Judiciary Committee last summer, according to a transcript released this year.

""A significant filter team"" was employed at the FBI, Strzok said, to ""work through the various terms of the various consent agreements."" Limitations imposed on agents' searches included date ranges and names of domains and people, Strzok said, among other categories.

The agreement was reached, Strzok said, because ""according to the attorneys, we lacked probable cause to get a search warrant for those servers and projected that either it would take a very long time and/or it would be impossible to get to the point where we could obtain probable cause to get a warrant.""

Former Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who chaired the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee until 2017 and is now a Fox News contributor, said the arrangement signaled that agents wanted willful blindness.

""What's bizarre about this, is in any other situation, there's no possible way they would allow the potential perpetrator to self-select what the FBI gets to see,"" Chaffetz said, noting that the FBI was aware that the servers contained classified information in unclassified settings. ""The FBI should be the one to sort through those emails -- not the Clinton attorneys.""

The DOJ's goal, Chaffetz said, was to ""make sure they hear no evil, see no evil -- they had no interest in pursuing the truth."""
Homeland Security: We've tested Windows BlueKeep attack and it works so patch now,https://www.zdnet.com,['Liam Tung'],,,,https://www.zdnet.com/article/homeland-security-weve-tested-windows-bluekeep-attack-and-it-works-so-patch-now/,"A single actor is scanning Windows systems vulnerable to the BlueKeep flaw A threat actor hidden behind Tor nodes is scanning for Windows systems vulnerable to BlueKeep flaw. Read more: https://zd.net/2JWjK73

The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) cybercrime emergency response team is warning Windows admins to patch the wormable BlueKeep flaw, after confirming it can be used to remotely execute code on vulnerable PCs.

The US government's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has raised the official alert over a potentially devastating flaw that affects the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service in multiple versions of Windows, from Windows 2000 to Windows 2008.

Microsoft considered CVE-2019-0708, now known as BlueKeep, so severe that it even released a patch for unsupported Windows XP – a measure it hadn't taken since WannaCry wreaked havoc across the globe in mid-2017.

The bug was reported to Microsoft ahead of its May Patch Tuesday update by the UK's National Cyber Security Centre, the organization under UK spy agency GCHQ tasked with improving the nation's cybersecurity defenses in the public and private sector.

Microsoft released patches for XP because it believed BlueKeep's worm capabilities – the ability to automatically spread from one vulnerable machine to another – could be exploited in an attack on the same global scale as WannaCry, whose worm capabilities were enabled by EternalBlue, the leaked NSA exploit for the SMBv1 file-sharing protocol.

The NSA is also worried about BlueKeep. Earlier this month it urged admins to patch the flaw and change configurations to prevent potential attacks. Its warning followed research that found that at least one million Windows computers were still vulnerable to BlueKeep. The NSA said it was ""likely only a matter of time"" before attacks emerged.

Currently there's no publicly available exploit code for BlueKeep. However, several organizations claim to have developed exploits for it, including Zerodium, McAfee, Kaspersky, Check Point, MalwareTech, and Valthek.

CISA on Monday confirmed it has successfully exploited BlueKeep on a Windows 2000 PC. The agency has not tested other affected versions of Windows.

""CISA tested BlueKeep against a Windows 2000 machine and achieved remote code execution. Windows OS versions prior to Windows 8 that are not mentioned in this Activity Alert may also be affected; however, CISA has not tested these systems,"" it said.

However, CISA has since stepped back from that claim and replaced its original statement with: ""CISA has coordinated with external stakeholders and determined that Windows 2000 is vulnerable to BlueKeep.""

Nonetheless, its advice, like the NSA's and Microsoft's, remains the same: apply Microsoft's May fixes for the RDP BlueKeep bug. Similarly, it recommends enabling Network Level Authentication (NLA), which would shield organizations from any forthcoming BlueKeep attacks. And it suggests blocking TCP port 3389, which is used to start an RDP session.

Should a public BlueKeep exploit emerge or nation-state hackers develop one privately and decide to use it, the potential impact could be very different to WannaCry.

That malware heavily damaged organizations in Europe, most notably the UK's National Health Service (NHS), which faced a $125m WannaCry bill, was forced to cancel 19,000 appointments, and then spent £500,000 on contractors to restore data in the wake of the attack.

Additionally, thanks to suspected Russian state-backed hacking group, ShadowBrokers, public exploit code was available just a month after Microsoft's patch.

Security firm BitSight ran an internet scan in mid-June for systems vulnerable to BlueKeep. It too found about a million vulnerable machines, but the exposure to BlueKeep is greatest in China, where less than 50 percent of machines have been patched.

China by far has the most machines in the world that are vulnerable to BlueKeep, amounting to about a third of the million vulnerable machines. It is followed by the US, but more than 75 percent of US machines have been patched.

It seems Europe has learned its lessons from WannaCry and the subsequent EternalBlue-powered NotPetya outbreak. The UK, Netherlands, Germany, France, have all patched over 75 percent of systems with exposed RDP hosts.

Countries in the same bracket as China, with less than 50 percent of machines patched, include South Korea and Hong Kong, while the patch rate in Russia, India, Brazil, and Italy sits between 50 percent and 75 percent.

"Pete Buttigieg says ""it's almost certain"" he wouldn't be first gay president",https://www.cbsnews.com,"[""Caitlin O'Kane""]",,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/buttigieg-weve-probably-had-excellent-presidents-who-were-gay/,"2020 presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg could make history as the youngest president in the history of the United States — and the first openly gay one. Buttigieg, however, believes he wouldn't be the only gay president.

Pete Buttigieg Axios on HBO

Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, came out as gay in 2015, before being elected to his second term as mayor. He is now married to junior high school teacher Chasten Glezman, who would become first gentleman if Buttigieg wins the presidency.

In an interview with ""Axios on HBO,"" Buttigieg was asked about critics potentially saying he's too young, too liberal and too gay to be commander-in-chief.

He was asked, ""You are young. You are a liberal. You are gay. How will you respond?""

""I'll respond by explaining where I want to lead this country,"" the candidate replied. ""People will elect the person who will make the best president. And we have had excellent presidents who have been young. We have had excellent presidents who have been liberal. I would imagine we've probably had excellent presidents who were gay — we just didn't know which ones.""

Buttigieg said ""statistically, it's almost certain"" that there has been a gay president before. Of course, none have been openly gay, and almost every president, except for two, have been married to women.

An estimated 4.5 percent of the U.S. population is LGBTQ, a 2018 study by the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law found. So Buttigieg's assumption that at least one out of the nation's 45 presidents was gay is not so far-fetched — he just doesn't know which one.

""My gaydar even doesn't work that well in the present, let alone retroactively,"" he told Axios. ""But one can only assume that's the case."""

Opinion writer

You can’t win the Democratic nomination without African American support. So, when I interviewed South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg on May 22 at the 92nd Street Y in New York, I asked him about his nonexistent support among African Americans in South Carolina. A poll released a few days earlier showed Buttigieg garnering zero percent of black support in the Palmetto State, where black voters make up 61 percent of the electorate.

“So this is vital, first of all, in order for us to win, but also in order for us to deserve to win, that we have a coalition and supporters that are as diverse as our party,” Buttigieg told me. “What we’re finding with a lot of these early state voters is the challenge is not that they’ve sized me up and they don’t like me. It’s that they don’t know me.” And then he got to the nub of the matter.

“A lot of it is engagement, not just in the public events, but when the cameras are off, having small, quiet engagements with activists, with faith leaders, with people connected to HBCUs, with anybody we can find to not only, obviously, make sure they understand the message of the campaign, which people I believe are responding to very well,” Buttigieg continued, “but also to invite them to shape the campaign in many ways, to ask them to help us think about the right vocabularies, the right ways that we can be a voice for them in this process. And I’m very confident that as we do that, we will continue to see our support grow.”

The latest poll from the Post and Courier of Charleston, S.C., shows his approach is working.

Within one month, Buttigieg has already jumped from zero percent support among African Americans to 6 percent in the new Post and Courier poll. “Buttigieg sits between the race’s two main African American candidates — [Kamala D.] Harris, who has 11 percent of the black vote, and [Cory] Booker, who has 3 percent,” the Post and Courier reported in its story about the poll.

[Two moments that show why Democrats should do a Fox News town hall.]

Can’t say that I’m surprised. If you listen carefully to Buttigieg, he has a message that African Americans will implicitly pick up on. For instance, in that Fox News town hall last month, he talked about the high rates of death among black women surrounding childbirth without being asked a specific question about it. During an interview with the Breakfast Club in March, Buttigieg had a ready answer when Charlamagne tha God asked him about his agenda for black America. “An agenda for black America needs to focus on black entrepreneurship, black homeownership,” he responded. “We need to focus on public education. … We need to talk about health. … And we got to talk about criminal justice. All of those things.” What makes that answer impressive to me is that typical politicians lead with criminal justice reform, assuming they come back to homeownership and entrepreneurship at all.

By putting those two front and center, Buttigieg is signaling to black voters that he sees that their hopes and aspirations are just like those of the forgotten voters (read: white working class) so many folks are focused on. And all that was before he released his Douglass Plan for Black America, which folds African Americans into his overall campaign message on freedom, security and democracy.

The new Post and Courier poll also shows that overall support for Buttigieg ticked up 3 percentage points since May to 11 percent. As a result, he now sits third in the South Carolina contest behind former vice president Joe Biden (37 percent) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) (17 percent). So, let it be clear: Buttigieg’s improved standing just isn’t possible without an uptick in support from African Americans. And his growth in South Carolina bodes well for him in the black voter-rich Southern states that will make up the Super Tuesday primaries just three days after the Palmetto State goes to the polls.

"State Department cuts new funds to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, pending immigration fixes",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/el-salvador-guatemala-honduras-funds-state-department-immigration-fixes,"The State Department announced Monday it will cut new foreign aid to the ""Northern Triangle"" countries -- Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador -- unless their governments take ""concrete action"" to stem the flow of migrants towards the United States.

The aggressive move came less than two weeks after the Trump administration reached a last-minute deal with Mexico, which called for the country's deployment of more troops to its own southern border and tighter asylum protocols. The U.S. and Mexico reached the accord shortly before the White House was set to impose a series of escalating tariffs on its southern neighbor.

President Trump previously pushed in March to cut $615 million in aid to the Northern Triangle, noting that the nations have been home to some of the migrant caravans that have marched through Mexico to the U.S. border to claim asylum, in some cases fraudulently.

On further review, the State Department said the administration has decided to continue to provide $432 million for anti-gang, education, and health initiatives. U.S. officials said the review looked at roughly 700 projects funded with fiscal 2017 money by the United States in the three countries and concluded that a significant number were too far advanced to end them.

MEXICO VOWS TO HELP CENTRAL AMERICAN MIGRANTS AMID CRACKDOWN

However, the latest plans showed roughly $370 million from the fiscal year 2018 budget will no longer be spent on the Northern Triangle and approximately $185 million in funding from the 2017 budget will be withheld, at least for now.

A State Department official told Fox News a re-evaluation would be concluded no later than April 2020.

""We will not provide new funds for programs in those countries until we are satisfied that the Northern Triangle governments are taking concrete actions to reduce the number of migrants coming to the U.S. border,"" State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said. ""This is consistent with the president’s direction and with the recognition that it is critical that there be sufficient political will in these countries to address the problem at its source.""

She added, ""Working with Congress, we will reprogram those funds to other priorities as appropriate.""

Ortagus noted that ""previously awarded grants and contracts will continue with current funding.""

Many Democrats called the decision callous and unproductive.

""As feared, a presidential tantrum will limit our nation’s ability to actually help address the challenges forcing people to flee to the U.S.,"" Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., tweeted.

The Northern Triangle's immigration policies have long rankled the Trump administration. Last December, the U.S. pledged more than $10 billion in aid to Central America and Mexico to help keep migrants put. Later that month, Trump tweeted: ""...Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are doing nothing for the United States but taking our money.

""Word is that a new Caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it,"" Trump added. ""We will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries -- taking advantage of U.S. for years!""

The State Department in March then notified Congress that it would look to suspend 2017 and 2018 payments to the trio of nations.

Meanwhile, Mexico has offered refuge to migrants with credible fears as thousands remain in the country while they await court dates for asylum petitions in the U.S. The understaffed and underfunded Mexican refugee commission has faced a backlog of cases.

But, in recent months, police and immigration have stepped up enforcement in southern Mexico, setting up highway checkpoints, raiding a caravan of mostly Central American migrants and trying to keep people off the northbound train known as ""the beast.""

At the same time, Mexicans have grown increasingly intolerant of the large numbers of migrants passing through their country in an attempt to reach the United States.

A June poll in Mexican newspaper El Universal showed that Mexicans are less receptive to allowing undocumented migrants to come in, or to stay on permanently as refugees, than they were in October, when caravans with thousands of Central American migrants were winding their way north.

House Homeland Security Republicans to introduce slew of cybersecurity bills,https://thehill.com,[],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/448971-house-homeland-security-republicans-to-introduce-slew-of-cybersecurity,"Republicans on the House Homeland Security Committee are gearing up to introduce a bevy of bills aimed at enhancing the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) cybersecurity capabilities.

The bills are the first glimpse into the new ""American Security Agenda"" that committee Republicans plan to pursue this Congress.

Rep. Mike Rogers Michael (Mike) Dennis RogersDem proposal to ban Pentagon funds for border wall survives House panel votes Dem proposal to ban Pentagon funds for border wall survives House panel votes House panel OKs space military branch MORE (R-Ala.), the ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee, will announce the agenda during remarks Tuesday afternoon at the International Summit on Borders in Washington, D.C.

Rogers will say that the goal of the agenda is to “take a hard look at the Department’s missions and act to ensure that DHS is prepared to tackle the emerging threats to our homeland,” including threats to social media, satellites and theft of intellectual property.

Republican members of the committee plan to introduce seven pieces of legislation in the coming weeks, with several specifically focused on cybersecurity.

Rep. Pete King Peter (Pete) Thomas KingGOP congressman: Trump should have been 'above' attacking Pelosi at Normandy Democratic lawmaker: Trump shouldn't be allowed to attend D-Day ceremony GOP lawmakers say Trump wrong to criticize Biden in Japan MORE (R-N.Y.) will reintroduce the Securing the Homeland Security Supply Chain Act, which would enable DHS to keep products from vendors that pose national security risks out of U.S. supply chains. This legislation was passed by the House during the last Congress, but stalled in the Senate.

Three other bills set to be introduced by GOP Homeland Security committee members will include one to help TSA identify emerging threats to the transportation system, and others on reforming DHS’s structure and management.

Rogers will note in his speech that “these seven bills are just the start,” and that “we are working on other bills to address emerging threats that we hope to introduce soon as part of our agenda.”

A Homeland Security Committee aide told The Hill in a phone call that while timing for the formal reintroduction of these bills has not been set, some will be reintroduced “this week."" The aide emphasized that “we are not going to drop everything tomorrow,” and that the overall agenda outlined by Rogers will be “built out in the next 16 months.”

The aide said that Rogers and Thompson appear to be in agreement on most of the cybersecurity issues, noting that both congressmen are “very interested in making sure that DHS keeps up with nation states and hackers and making sure that our cyber infrastructure is secure.”

The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee has also been consulted on the issues Rogers will outline, the aide confirmed to The Hill, noting that the chairmen and ranking members of both committees have met to discuss the agenda.

The aide said that both Rogers and Katko engage with DHS on a weekly basis, and that the committee’s job is “to make sure they [DHS] can do their job correctly.”

“Instead of changing the deck chairs on a sinking ship, we want to make sure that this a department that is fully engaged and prepared for the 21st century,” the aide said."

Bond yields bounce off multiyear lows after Trump tweets he'll meet with China's Xi,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/18/us-bonds-treasury-yields-tick-lower-ahead-of-federal-reserve-meeting.html,"The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to its lowest level since September 2017 on Tuesday as the Federal Reserve began its two-day policy meeting and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi promised further stimulus if inflation doesn't meet its target in the euro zone.

Yields moved off their lows later Tuesday morning after President Donald Trump tweeted that he will be meeting with China's Xi Jinping at the G-20 summit next week.

By 12:07 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note had fallen 3 basis point to 2.05%, off a 20-month low of 2.016% hit earlier in the session. The yield on the 2-year Treasury note held steady at 1.852% while the rate on the 3-month bill hovered at 2.22%.

While the Fed is expected to leave the key interest rates unchanged in its June meeting, many expect the Chair Jerome Powell to telegraph easier monetary policy ahead during Wednesday's press conference. His comments at 2:30 p.m. ET will follow the release of the central bank's decision at 2 p.m.

Softer economic gauges like May's anemic jobs report and a lackluster consumer pricing print convinced many economists and fixed-income traders earlier this month that the central bank will hint at its ability to lower borrowing costs if needed.

""I think they should cut rates, and I think the discussion should instead be whether to cut 25 basis points or 50 basis points,"" said Jim Bianco, head of the Chicago-based advisory firm Bianco Research. ""But they'll probably do what they usually do, which is wait until it's too late.""

""The market has been very vocal of its pricing of expected inflation,"" he added. ""The only thing transitory is Powell's use of the word 'transitory,'"" he said, referring to the Fed chair's characterization of sluggish inflation as a temporary blip.

""We say in our statement of longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy that the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below 2%,"" Powell said last month.

""And in this case, as we look at these readings in the first quarter for core, we do see good reasons to think that some were or all of the unexpected decrease may wind up being transient,"" he added.

Traders are now pricing in a more than 80% chance of a rate cut in July and 70% probability of another reduction in September, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.

Meanwhile, ECB President Draghi said Tuesday that the central bank may need to ease monetary policy again over the coming months, possibly through new rate cuts or asset purchases, if inflation doesn't bounce back toward its target.

""In the absence of improvement, such that the sustained return of inflation to our aim is threatened, additional stimulus will be required,"" Draghi said.

The central bank foresees ""lingering softness"" on the horizon, exacerbated by geopolitical factors and trade disputes that have dampened exports and softened manufacturing."
Opinion | A New Trump Battleground: Defining Human Rights,https://www.nytimes.com,['Carol Giacomo'],06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/17/opinion/editorials/trump-human-rights-natural-law.html,"After the horrors of World War II, the United States led in adopting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, recognizing the “inherent dignity” and “equal and inalienable rights” of all people to life and liberty. For three-quarters of a century it has stood for the protection of human rights by the rule of law.

Now, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is establishing a Commission on Unalienable Rights to “provide fresh thinking about human rights discourse where such discourse has departed from our nation’s founding principles of natural law and natural rights,” according to a notice in the Federal Register.

Fresh thinking isn’t necessarily a bad thing. But tampering with a legacy built over decades raises serious questions, especially when the State Department’s human rights bureau and Congress have so far been excluded from the process.

One concern is the reference to “natural law,” which is held to be more powerful than the laws people write, and can suggest a narrower, religious sensibility. When the term natural law has been thrown about, it’s often been by people concerned with what they think is unnatural — homosexuality, transgender rights, reproductive choice and sexual equality."
Mississippi’s Mental-Illness Policies Are Working. DOJ Is Challenging Them.,https://www.nationalreview.com,"['John Hirschauer', 'Andrew C. Mccarthy', 'Charles C. W.

The state is leading a quiet revolt.

Despite having the highest poverty rate in the United States, Mississippi has the nation’s lowest rate of homelessness. But instead of heralding Mississippi’s success and imploring other states to follow its lead, the Department of Justice is taking formal legal action against the state’s highly effective method of delivering mental-health services.

Back in 2016, DOJ filed a formal complaint against the state, alleging that its approach to mental health “has resulted in [the] repeated, prolonged, and unnecessary institutionalization [of the mentally ill] in state-run psychiatric hospitals, and placed them at serious risk of such institutionalization, in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.” The complaint and ensuing legal challenges brought both sides before U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves early this month, and the judge rejected the state’s motion to dismiss the case. The case raises a series of questions about the limits of federal oversight and the jurisdictional authority of states and localities.

Mississippi is one of the few states in the country to retain a state mental-hospital network as an integral part of its mental-health system. While every state has public or private mental institutions, most have relegated their hospitals to ancillary roles, available only to treat a small handful of hard cases and forensic patients. As a result, the most seriously mentally ill, who often require institutional services, have been forced into inappropriate placements in the community. Many end up homeless, incarcerated, or as frequent patients in already-crowded emergency rooms. Mississippi has stood firm in its provision of a robust network of inpatient services for the mentally ill, much to the dismay of the Department of Justice. DOJ is apparently unsatisfied with the carnage deinstitutionalization has wrought on communities across the country and is attempting to force Mississippi to alter its approach to treating its most vulnerable citizens.

DOJ’s complaint letter accuses Mississippi of violating the terms of the landmark 1999 Supreme Court case Olmstead vs. L.C., which held that the state of Georgia had violated the Americans with Disabilities Act in its refusal to offer community-based services to two mentally ill complainants for whom the state’s experts deemed such a transfer clinically appropriate. In Mississippi, the DOJ isn’t bringing forth an analogous case; the complaint is not filed on behalf of a specific aggrieved party, but is instead directed at the entire statewide treatment apparatus for its alleged failure to protect “the rights of adults with mental illness to receive services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs.” DOJ is attempting to force Mississippi to restructure its entire mental-health system.

The original Olmstead decision, authored by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, was far more balanced than DOJ portends. The decision compelled states to offer individuals with mental disabilities access to community-based services, subject to three substantial qualifications.

First, the transfer of individuals from “institutions” to less structured environments must be formally approved by the state’s medical professionals, who are required to “have determined that community placement is appropriate” for the affected individual. Ginsburg drew explicit boundaries around the scope of the community mandate, quoting the American Psychiatric Association:

“Some individuals, whether mentally retarded or mentally ill, are not prepared at particular times — perhaps in the short run, perhaps in the long run — for the risks and exposure of the less protective environment of community settings”; for these persons, “institutional settings are needed and must remain available.”

Ginsburg also made clear that “nothing in the ADA or its implementing regulations condones termination of institutional settings for persons unable to handle or benefit from community settings.”

This last clause — “unable to handle or benefit from community settings” — has been occasionally inverted to assert that no one needs institutional services. Deena Fox, an attorney in DOJ’s Civil Rights Division, has not explicitly called for Mississippi to cease all institutional services, but she has promised that “evidence at trial will make clear that individuals with serious mental illness can be appropriately served in the community.” Some individuals with severe mental illness can be served in the community, of course, to different degrees and at different times. But the objection of the DOJ is principally much deeper than that.

Attorney Bill Choslovsky, who has fought similarly obstreperous Olmstead-based litigation in the state of Illinois, calls the logical terminus of DOJ’s argument a “leeches” hypothesis. Just as leeches are viewed as an intrinsically inappropriate medical device — it would be malpractice to use leeches to treat any conceivable disease — the DOJ is trying to impose its view that institutionalization is medically inappropriate per se by asserting medical authority that it doesn’t have. The analogy is wrong on the merits: According to Dr. E. Fuller Torrey in his book American Psychosis, 15 psychiatric experts were empaneled in 2008 to examine the minimum number of public psychiatric beds necessary to deal with those who inevitably fall through the cracks of the community system. This includes beds necessary for both the acutely ill (those suffering temporary suicidal or homicidal impulses, psychotic breaks, or other aggravated psychiatric phenomena) and the small but significant number of profoundly ill individuals who, in Olmstead’s phrasing, are not prepared “for the risks and exposure of the less protective environment of community settings” in the long run. The panel arrived at between 40–60 public psychiatric beds per 100,000 population, presuming adequate outpatient services.

The second qualifier that Olmstead made to its community-services mandate maintains that “the transfer from institutional care to a less restrictive setting” must not be “opposed by the affected individual.” Olmstead imparts no duty for patients to forgo services they are currently receiving, even if they are qualified to be in a less intensive care environment.

Finally — and this is the qualification most pertinent to Mississippi’s affirmative defense — the majority opinion insisted that for a community placement to occur, it must be “reasonably accommodated, taking into account the resources available to the State and the needs of others with mental disabilities.” This begets the “fundamental alteration” defense, which traces itself back to the original language of the ADA (emphasis mine):

A public entity shall make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.

Mississippi’s attorneys insist that the Department of Justice is demanding adherence to what amounts to a limitless and arbitrary standard. Mississippi already has community-based mental health services, though proportionately fewer than its peers. Every other state retains some degree of institutional services, and many of them have avoided DOJ litigation. The DOJ, then, is taking issue with the proportion of individuals who receive institutional services, which raises the question: How much is enough? In the absence of a specific claimant who can demonstrate harm under the Olmstead guidelines, how many hospitals must Mississippi close to meet the undefined and interminable demands of DOJ? And how does this not amount to a “fundamental alteration” of the balance of services that the state already provides?

Because of the nature of public finance and the budgetary strictures of state government, the state is making the laudable decision to orient their system towards treating the seriously mentally ill who require hospitalization; Mississippi has precisely nothing to apologize for.

Clarence Thomas’s dissent in Olmstead highlighted the imprecision with which the majority used the word “discrimination” to describe Georgia’s decision to treat patients in “an institutional setting after they became eligible for community placement.” He presciently noted that “by adopting such a broad view of discrimination, the majority drains the term of any meaning other than as a proxy for decisions disapproved of by this Court.” But even Ginsburg acknowledged an appellate court’s ruling that “the State’s duty to provide integrated services ‘is not absolute.’” States are allowed by Olmstead to preserve institutional settings necessary for the most severely ill, and the cost of preserving those settings may, in the fiscally limited world of state government, preclude those with less severe impairments from receiving commensurate services.

In his concurring opinion, Justice Kennedy warned that “it would be a tragic event . . . were the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 . . . to be interpreted so that States had some incentive, for fear of litigation, to drive those in need of medical care and treatment out of appropriate care and into settings with too little assistance and supervision.” This is precisely what the DOJ is doing. Mississippi is not a straggler to be dragged across deinstitutionalization’s finish line; the state is a necessary rebuke to policies that have relegated the severely mentally ill to lives of squalor and neglect on our nation’s streets and in our prisons."
Dems want to nuke DOJ policy barring presidential prosecutions,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Alex Pappas', 'Alex Pappas Is A Politics Reporter At Foxnews.Com.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dems-want-to-nuke-doj-policy-barring-presidential-prosecutions,"Special Counsel Robert Mueller said last month that charging President Trump with a crime “was not an option we could consider” because of the Justice Department policy barring the prosecution of sitting presidents.

Democrats are now talking about finding a way to change that.

“Congress should make it clear that presidents can be indicted for criminal activity, including obstruction of justice,"" Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate, recently proposed.

WARREN PROPOSES LAW SAYING A PRESIDENT CAN BE INDICTED

And other congressional Democrats have since said they are considering whether the DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel 1973 memorandum against charging a sitting president should be revoked -- though no legislation has been introduced just yet.

“It's fair to say that one of the options we should consider is revisiting that Department of Justice rule so you don't have a rogue and lawless president immunized from criminal prosecution,” New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, told The Hill.

Another lawmaker, Virginia Rep. Gerry Connolly, a member of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, suggested that a measure revoking the policy could be included in some sort of spending package or authorization bill.

“I guarantee you it will be a topic of discussion,” Connolly told The Hill.

While Mueller in his report said his investigation found no evidence of a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election, the special counsel declined to issue a conclusion in the report about whether Trump obstructed justice through his comments and actions related to the investigation. The president repeatedly referred to the probe as a ""witch hunt"" and allegedly sought to have Mueller removed -- but he never did, and Trump has recently disputed that he even sought the special counsel's ouster.

“Charging the president with a crime was not an option we could consider,” Mueller said during his public statement last month, adding that “it would be unfair to accuse someone of a crime when there could be no court resolution of the charge.”

After the release of the Mueller report, Attorney General Bill Barr said he determined no crime had been committed by the president, but Democrats have argued Trump would have been charged with obstruction had he not been president. Republicans, meanwhile, have countered that Trump could not have been charged with obstruction since Mueller determined there was no underlying crime of conspiring with the Russians.

TRUMP CLAIMS 'OBAMA HAD TO KNOW ABOUT' EFFORTS TO UNDERMINE PRESIDENCY

The fresh chatter about upending the DOJ guidance amounts to the latest Democratic bid to reexamine federal policy toward alleged wrongdoing of sitting presidents.

Last month, House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and other Democrats introduced the “No President Is Above the Law Act.” The sponsors said in a news release at the time that it would pause the statute of limitations for any federal offense committed by a sitting president and “ensure that presidents can be held accountable for criminal conduct just like every other American and not use the presidency to avoid legal consequences.”

""No person can be permitted to evade accountability for their actions just because they happen to be president,"" Nadler said. ""I have concerns with the Justice Department interpretation that a sitting president cannot be indicted, but if that is the policy, a president who commits a crime before or during their term in office, could exploit this loophole and avoid prosecution just because the statute of limitations has run out. This is unacceptable. The presidency is not a get-out-of-jail-free card.""

Even though Barr said he determined no crime had been committed by the president, several Democratic presidential candidates are now indicating on the campaign trail that they would support a DOJ investigation into whether Trump obstructed justice if they win the White House in 2020.

California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris said last week she believes the only reason Mueller didn’t recommend prosecuting Trump was because of the Justice Department’s policy. In an interview with NPR, Harris said that once out of office, Trump would be subject to charges – and she suggested the Justice Department in a Harris presidency would pursue them.

“I believe that they would have no choice and that they should, yes,” Harris said.

Another 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, said last week that if elected president, he could also support a Justice Department criminal investigation into Trump.

“To the extent that there’s an obstruction case, then yes, DOJ’s got to deal with it,” Buttigieg said in an interview with The Atlantic published Thursday.

Trump, during an interview that aired Sunday night on ABC News, denied being worried about being prosecuted once he leaves office.

“Did nothing wrong,” Trump said. “There was no collusion.”

Moving USDA research agencies is part of Trump’s war on science and statistics,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Editorial Board', 'June At Pm']",06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/moving-usda-research-agencies-is-part-of-trumps-war-on-science-and-statistics/2019/06/17/51c85328-9134-11e9-aadb-74e6b2b46f6a_story.html,"IN ITS war on science and statistics, the Trump administration has a habit of sidelining inconvenient information. Last week, it was at it again.

On Thursday, the Agriculture Department announced a decision to relocate two of its research agencies, the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, from Washington to the Kansas City region. The Economic Research Service, which investigates the economics of food, farming, natural resources and rural America, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which was established as part of the Food, Conservation and Energy Act of 2008, play a key role in providing the data essential for honest policy-making.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue initially declared an intention to move these sub-agencies 10 months ago but didn’t specify a location then. The USDA now says the move would put the agencies closer to the agricultural heartland while saving money both for taxpayers and for employees, because Washington is an expensive city. While the rationale may seem plausible , in reality the implications are worrying.

In theory, there’s no reason such agencies couldn’t function well in Kansas City or elsewhere. After all, as with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta, this would hardly be the first time a government agency operates from beyond Washington. But the way this operation has been managed, with insufficient warning and explanation, suggests an intention by the administration to encourage qualified analysts to leave government and stifle independent and objective research.

If carried out, the move will disrupt ongoing scientific research and displace several hundred federal employees with valuable experience. Since the abrupt announcement last August, many of the agencies’ top economists and scientists have quit.

The investigations carried out by these agencies have long underpinned decisions by Congress and by American farmers, much as research from the Bureau of Labor Statistics underpins decisions in others parts of the economy. And much of the information produced by the Economic Research Service has indeed been inconvenient for the administration, as it has illustrated the ills wrought by President Trump’s trade wars and how small farmers were helped only marginally by the 2017 Republican tax overhaul.

Democratic members of the House and Senate have introduced the Agriculture Research Integrity Act, which would bar the move. They are right to do so, but it would be best if the USDA took the hint and retreated from this abrupt and ill-considered relocation. The better way to get sunnier data would be to develop better policies."

The audit conducted by the DOJ’s inspector general, which spanned the end of the Obama administration and the beginning of Trump’s presidency, found that 62 of these foreign nationals had “absconded from DOJ control” and hundreds more weren’t being monitored properly.

DOJ sponsors the immigration of thousands of foreign nationals who might otherwise be inadmissible to the U.S. “due to their association with criminal enterprises.”

The new report, which scrutinized these DOJ immigration sponsorship programs, said these foreign nationals are useful to law enforcement because of “their access to criminal enterprises and ability to provide testimony in support of prosecution.” But there are “significant risks” involved as well, the report said, because the people in question “may be associated with criminal activity and motivated by the ability to reside temporarily in the United States.”

In addition to losing track of 62 foreign nationals, the audit also uncovered 18 instances where DOJ either didn’t renew or terminate their sponsorship of a foreign national properly “and therefore let the foreign nationals fall into an illegal status while residing in the United States.” The report said mistakes like that could result in “unnecessary, unexpected, and costly deportation of foreign nationals for whom DOJ had a continued need” and that the screw-ups could have “serious consequences for the investigations they were assisting.”

The Justice Department is supposed to work closely with the Department of Homeland Security in these sponsorship efforts, but the report described the DOJ’s faulty reporting mechanisms and poor communication with the DHS on this issue. The DOJ reported sponsoring 5,496 foreign nationals between fiscal 2015 and 2017, but the inspector general “identified over 1,000 DOJ-sponsored foreign nationals for whom DHS did not have current information” as of February 2018. According to the report, “DHS was still seeking information regarding 665 sponsorships” in August.

The two most common tools the DOJ uses in its sponsorship are the significant public benefit parole and deferred action. That type of parole permits a foreign national to enter the U.S. and stay on temporarily while being sponsored by law enforcement, while deferred action delays the deportation of a foreign national who isn’t in the U.S. legally. Two other types of sponsorship are S Visas, which allow foreign nationals to reside in the U.S. for three years while they cooperate with authorities on complex cases, and PL-110 sponsorship, which gives permanent legal residency to foreign nationals assisting in matters of national security overseas. Both of these are relatively rare.

The Drug Enforcement Agency and the FBI, which sponsored 2,380 foreign nationals and 3,059 foreign nationals during this time frame, respectively, are the DOJ agencies most heavily involved in the programs working with foreign nationals.

The DEA used parole 1,331 times and deferred action 1,033 times during this period, while the FBI used SPBPs 1,552 times and deferred action 1,433 times. The report said that “both ATF and FBI had policies that require the sponsoring special agent to immediately notify headquarters when a foreign national absconds” but that “there were no redundant methods to ensure that an absconsion is addressed immediately.”

“DOJ components must be vigilant in exercising their responsibilities for overseeing sponsored foreign nationals to fulfill their obligations to DHS, to protect the public, and to achieve their objectives of furthering investigations and prosecutions,” the inspector general report declared. “Therefore, effective oversight of these programs is essential.”

DOJ spokesman Alexei Woltornist told the Washington Examiner that “the Department of Justice is aware of the findings of the IG report and is working on remedying the problem.”

This isn’t the first time that problems like this have been uncovered inside the DOJ. A separate Justice Department inspector general investigation into the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives back in March 2017 revealed that the ATF “could not provide an accurate total number of ATF-sponsored foreign national informants.”

EPA will allow use of pesticide harmful to bees,https://thehill.com,[],06-17-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/448970-epa-will-allow-use-of-pesticide-harmful-to-bees,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said Monday it will allow states to use a pesticide that is harmful to bees.

The agency made an emergency exception for 11 states to use sulfoxaflor on cotton and sorghum crops.

“The only emergency here is the Trump EPA’s reckless approval of this dangerous bee-killing pesticide,” Lori Ann Burd, environmental health director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement. “It’s sickening that even amid the current insect apocalypse, the EPA’s priority is protecting pesticide industry profits.”

A study published in Nature last year found sulfoxaflor inhibited bumblebee reproduction.

According to the Center for Biological Diversity, the emergency declaration has been used for four consecutive years in most of the states.

Sulfoxaflor’s use was temporarily barred after a lawsuit from beekeepers in 2015, but the EPA in 2016 changed its instructions for how to use the pesticide in a way designed to reduce the impact on bees. Cotton and sorghum were not included in the directive.

The EPA’s Office of Inspector General wrote in a report last year that the agency did not have processes in place to determine how its emergency measures impact human and environmental health.

An EPA spokesperson said the emergency exemption was granted with public safety in mind, as well as the needs of farmers.

""This decision is based in part on information from the states demonstrating an urgent need and a lack of available alternatives to address the pest pressures within their states. Mitigation measures will be put in place to minimize exposure and reduce the potential for unreasonable risks to the environment. The approvals include advisory guidance for protecting bees, and users must also follow all existing EPA guidance for pollinator protection,"" an EPA spokesperson said."
In our opinion: The Department of Agriculture is moving workers to Kansas City. Utahns should hope they can be next,https://www.deseretnews.com,[],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900075743/in-our-opinion-the-department-of-agriculture-is-moving-workers-to-kanas-city-utahns-should-hope-they-can-be-next-blm-usda.html,"Utah is still waiting to see whether the Trump administration decides to move its Bureau of Land Management headquarters here from Washington — a move that makes sense considering how most BLM decisions affect the West much more than any property along the Potomac.

Continuing this trend, the administration announced last week that economists and scientists at the Department of Agriculture will be relocated to Kansas City. This is another move that makes great sense, considering that bureaucracy’s effect on farmers concentrated in the heartland.

The good sense seemed lost on angry employees of the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, however. Many of them stood and turned their backs on Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue as he made the announcement last Thursday.

Frankly, they need to get over it. Those affected by federal decisions have little need for bureaucrats who want to cling to the power structure in Washington.

"" Those affected by federal decisions have little need for bureaucrats who want to cling to the power structure in Washington. ""

CNN cited concerns by employees who don’t want to be separated from the government they serve. That is a perfect example of the problem. They are supposed to serve the people, not the government.

That said, we sympathize with workers who would need to uproot their families, sell houses, leave friends and move to an entirely different part of the country. Such moves are not easy. Millions of people each year face decisions whether to go where their employer wants them to go or to find other work that would allow them to stay. These can be difficult choices, and we acknowledge that, unlike the BLM, where many workers already reside in various states, these agencies operate mainly in Washington. However, we have no doubt that Department of Agriculture employees will weather these changes as well as have others in various industries.

Critics worry about the loss of institutional knowledge if these agencies need to hire new people. This may be a valid concern, but it should be weighed against the possible gains of having fresh eyes with fresh ideas looking at old problems. Stagnation, entrenchment and an attitude of entitlement are bigger concerns in bureaucracies.

These agencies are supposed to produce nonpartisan reports and analyses. That should be as easy to do in Kansas City as it is in Washington, where politics permeate every crevice.

Administrations will shift from conservative to liberal and back again through the years. But having these agencies close to the people they serve will add a new level of accountability.

Besides all this, the move makes great economic sense. The department estimates a savings of $300 million over 15 years. Kansas City has more modest living costs and lower salaries than does Washington.

In addition, the move will be a boon to the Kansas City economy, adding many good-paying jobs.

Perhaps only a Washington bureaucrat could find fault with such a move. Utahns, meanwhile, should hope they soon can host the headquarters of the BLM. Spreading the federal government among the people is a capital idea."
Buttigieg says Trump using Justice Department as 'his own personal law firm',https://www.foxnews.com,"[""Andrew O'Reilly""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/buttigieg-says-trump-using-justice-dept-his-own-personal-law-firm,"Pete Buttigieg, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, on Sunday slammed President Trump’s recent move directing Attorney General William Barr to look into the origins of the Russia investigation and if U.S. officials improperly surveilled Trump's 2016 campaign.

Buttigieg, whose surprise move from the mayor of South Bend, Ind., to Democratic contender has been a major focus of the early campaign season, lambasted the president for using the Department of Justice as “his own personal law firm.”

“The independence of the DOJ is obviously not something this president respects,” Buttigieg said during an interview on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” “He’s treated it like it ought to be his own personal law firm.”

MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG CALLS OUT BIG TECH'S 'MONOPOLY POWER'

He added: “Prosecutorial decisions shouldn’t be made by politicians in that sense and what I will say is any attorney general that I would appoint is somebody who would faithfully apply the concept that no one is above the law that everybody ought to be held accountable.”

Last month, Trump directed the intelligence community to ""quickly and fully cooperate"" with Barr's probe. The directive marked an escalation in Trump's efforts to ""investigate the investigators,"" as he continues to try to undermine the findings of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe amid mounting Democratic calls for impeachment proceedings.

Barr has already asked John Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, to examine the origins of the Russia investigation to determine whether intelligence and surveillance methods used during the probe were lawful and appropriate. Still, Barr has been directly involved, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to discuss it publicly, and is also working with CIA Director Gina Haspel, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and FBI Director Christopher Wray.

Despite Mueller finding no evidence to support criminal charges against Americans related to Russia's actions, his report documented extensive Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 campaign and willingness on the part of some in Trump's orbit to accept their aid. Mueller left open a decision on whether or not Trump obstructed justice during the investigation.

Buttigieg told The Atlantic earlier in the week that a Justice Department in his administration might look at charging Trump with obstruction after his presidency.

“To the extent that there's an obstruction case, then, yes, DOJ's got to deal with it,"" he said.

Buttigieg cited President Gerald Ford's pardon of Richard Nixon following the Watergate scandal, but said he wouldn't be interested in pardoning Trump. ""I would want any credible allegation of criminal behavior to be investigated to the fullest,"" he said.

DHS data breach should be taken seriously,https://www.bostonherald.com,"['Boston Herald Editorial Staff', 'Dhs Data Breach Should Be Taken Seriously - Svpn']",06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.bostonherald.com/2019/06/17/dhs-data-breach-should-be-taken-seriously/,"Security technology is on the verge of changing the world. In what particular way it does that may be decided by our ability to keep data secure and out of the hands of cyberattackers.

There have been some recent stumbles on the part of government agencies. Earlier this year, the Homeland Security Department announced that FEMA had released the personal information of 2.3 million hurricane and wildfire survivors to a contractor. That information, in the wrong hands, could certainly be used for large-scale identity fraud.

This week, Customs and Border Protection issued a statement explaining that biometric information — photos of faces and license plates — had been exposed in a cyber attack. The information was sitting on a contractor’s server at the time.

A Customs spokesman indicated that the images involved fewer than 100,000 people, according to The Associated Press, but that number is not small and lives could be terribly affected.

Kade Crockford, director of the Technology for Liberty Program at the ACLU of Massachusetts, said the breach underscores the need for both federal and state moratoriums on government use of the technology.

“Once your face is leaked in a data breach like this, it can be weaponized against you for the rest of your life,” Crockford said. “If the attackers can mock up a fake image of you based on these leaked data, they can impersonate you and potentially break into your private accounts. If your password is hacked in a data breach, you can change it. But you can’t change your face.”

Sen. Ed Markey has called on DHS to halt the expansion of its biometric program until there were safeguards in place. Likewise, so has Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah).

Until the Department of Homeland Security can adequately prove that they can secure the personal information of Americans, the expansion of the biometric program should be halted."

Corn

In its Crop Progress Report Monday, the USDA pegged U.S. corn planting at 92% complete, behind the 100% five-year average.

The planting rate is equal to what the trade had expected. This leaves about 7.0 million acres left to be planted.

Sean Hannity: Sources say DOJ inspector general resolved 'hang up' on first Carter Page FISA application,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-15-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/sean-hannity-sources-say-doj-inspector-general-resolved-hang-up-on-first-carter-page-fisa-application,"Fox News host Sean Hannity said the Justice Department inspector general's investigation into alleged surveillance abuses may have hit a snag examining the first Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant against one-time Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

During his evening show on Thursday, Hannity explained how Inspector General Michael Horowitz worked around the issue, which was related to British ex-spy Christopher Steele and his dossier, and may have already submitted his report to the attorney general.

""From my understanding, my sources, is inspector general Horowitz is probably likely done,"" Hannity said, adding, ""I’ve had some people saying, suggesting strongly they believe that the attorney general already has the inspector general's report.""

He was interviewing the Hill's John Solomon and credited memos obtained by conservative group Citizens United through open-records litigation and first reported by Solomon with aiding the watchdog investigation reach a breakthrough.

The memos showed Steele met with Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec on Oct. 11, 2016 and admitted he was encouraged by his client to get his research out before the 2016 election, signaling a possible political motivation. The timing of the meeting is notable, as it was 10 days before the FBI used Steele's unverified dossier to obtain the original warrant to wiretap Page.

""Now there was apparently, originally a hang up on only one of the FISA applications. Surprisingly that being the first,"" Hannity said. ""But according to my sources, your reporting about Kathleen Kavalec's confirmation and warning and admonition to the FBI prior to the first FISA application put that to bed in light of also the closed-door testimony of Bruce Ohr that everybody was warned,"" he added, referring to Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, who acted as an unofficial back channel between the Steele and the FBI.

Steele's dossier, which was funded by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign, contained salacious and unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia. It was used by the FBI to obtain the authority to wiretap Page, an American who had just left the Trump campaign and had suspicious connections to the Russians. The first warrant application was submitted in October 2016, after which there were three renewals at three-month intervals, including in January, April, and June 2017.

Hannity's reporting follows Joe diGenova, a former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, saying last month that Horowitz's team determined the three FISA warrant extensions against Page were illegally obtained.

Although Attorney General William Barr said he anticipated Horowitz’s investigation to be complete by early June, Solomon said his own sources and Rep. Mark Meadows, have made it clear that the FISA investigation will take longer than expected to wrap up, particularly after Steele offered himself up for an interview with the inspector general.

""Not a long time, a short while,"" Solomon said, adding that he thinks the American people will see the report sometime in the summer."
Government agency to investigate Interior Department’s moves on Grand Staircase monument,https://www.stgeorgeutah.com,[],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.stgeorgeutah.com/news/archive/2019/06/18/apc-government-agency-to-investigate-interior-departments-moves-on-grand-staircase-monument/,"Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, date unspecified | Photo courtesy of Bureau of Land Management, St. George News

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — A government watchdog will investigate whether the U.S. Interior Department broke the law by making plans to open lands cut from a Utah national monument by President Donald Trump to leasing for oil, gas and coal development, a pair of Democratic Congress members said Monday.

The Government Accountability Office’s investigation into whether the Interior violated the appropriations law by using funds to assess potential resource extraction in the lands cut from the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument is the latest chapter in a long-running saga over the sprawling monument created in 1996 on lands home to scenic cliffs, canyons, dinosaur fossils and coal reserves.

Trump reduced the monument by nearly half in 2017 following a contentious review by former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke of monuments around the country.

Trump ordered the review based on arguments by him and others that a law signed by President Theodore Roosevelt allowing presidents to declare monuments had been improperly used to protect wide expanses of lands instead of places with particular historical or archaeological value.

The GAO investigation comes after U.S. Sen. Tom Udall of New Mexico and U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum of Minnesota, both Democrats, requested the investigation in May. They argue that a section of the appropriations law on the books since 2002 states that no taxpayer money can be used to do pre-leasing studies on lands in monuments that were created by Jan. 20, 2001.

Last year, the Interior made public proposals for managing Grand Staircase, saying its preference for one of the sites would be the “least restrictive to energy and mining development.” That plan also would allow commercial timber harvesting to keep forests healthy.

The public comment period closed on the proposals and the Bureau of Land Management’s website says it intends to finalize the plans later this year.

Interior Department Press Secretary Molly Block said in a statement the agency will provide “factual information” to the GAO and is “confident” the probe will determine the Interior “acted appropriately and within the law.”

GAO spokesman Charles Young confirmed the inquiry. He said it’s too early to know how long the probe into the legal question will take.

Trump in 2017 also downsized the Bears Ears National Monument in Utah, but that won’t be part of the GAO’s inquiry because it was created in 2016 by President Barack Obama.

Environmental, tribal, paleontological and outdoor recreation organizations have separate lawsuits pending to restore the full sizes of the monuments, arguing presidents don’t have the legal authority to undo or change monuments created by predecessors.

Udall and McCollum announced the GAO investigation in a joint news release. Udall is the ranking member of the Senate’s Appropriations Subcommittees on the Interior, Environment and Related Agencies. McCollum is chair of the same committee in the House.

Udall called on the Interior to halt work on proposed management plans until the GAO makes its determination on the legal question.

“National monuments like Grand Staircase-Escalante protect some of our most spectacular wilderness areas and breathtaking lands, and it is imperative that the Department manage them in accordance with the laws passed by Congress,” Udall said in the news release.

Secretary of State Pompeo Wants to 'Unite' the World Over Alleged Iran Attacks,https://time.com,['Ellen Knickmeyer'],,,,https://time.com/5608030/mike-pompeo-iran-attacks/,"(WASHINGTON) — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is reaching out to wary foreign leaders to frame alleged Iranian attacks in a Middle East oil shipping route as a problem for the world at large, especially for Asian countries vitally dependent on that oil.

Pompeo, in a series of Sunday television interviews, emphasized the U.S. international outreach in the wake of what the U.S. says were Iranian attacks Thursday on two oil tankers near the Strait of Hormuz.

“I made a bunch of phone calls yesterday. I’ll make a whole bunch more calls today. The world needs to unite,” Pompeo said. He did not say what kind of action the Trump administration envisioned.

“We are going to work to build out a set of countries that have deep vested interest in keeping that strait open to help us do that,” Pompeo said.

That echoed comments from acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan this past week when he said the U.S. goal is to “build international consensus to this international problem.”

Iran has denied being involved in the attacks and accused America of promoting an “Iranophobic” campaign against it.

Pressed on whether any new U.S. military deployment to the region was possible, Pompeo said that “of course” remained among the options that President Donald Trump may consider to keep shipping safe through the narrow strait, a strategic choke point for oil shipments from the Middle East.

Trump last year withdrew the U.S. from an international agreement, signed in 2015 by President Barack Obama, to limit Iran’s nuclear program. Trump has reinstated economic sanctions and recently ended waivers that allowed some countries to continue buying Iranian oil. That has deprived Iran of oil income and has coincided with what U.S. officials said was a surge in intelligence pointing to Iranian preparations for attacks against U.S. forces and interests in the Gulf region.

The U.S. has accelerated the deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier battle group to the region, sent four nuclear-capable B-52 bombers to Qatar and bolstered its defenses in the region by deploying more Patriot air defense systems.

Some European allies have called for a careful investigation of responsibility, worried that Trump was escalating tensions with a country he has long called a top U.S. enemy.

Pompeo stressed that the U.S. gets relatively little of its energy supplies through the strait, which lies between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. The U.S. Energy Information Administration says 16 percent of U.S. petroleum imports came from the Persian Gulf countries in 2018.

By contrast, about 80% of oil through the shipping passage supplies energy-hungry countries in Asia, including China, Japan, India and South Korea. Those countries have skin in the game, he said.

“I’m confident that when they see the risk — the risk of their own economies and their own people and outrageous behavior of the Islamic Republic of Iran, they will join us in this,” Pompeo said.

Pompeo said intelligence officials had “lots of data, lots of evidence” that Iran was responsible. Pressed for specifics, Pompeo pointed to grainy black-and-white footage already released by the U.S.

American officials say the footage shows Iranian Revolutionary Guard troops removing an unexploded mine from a Japanese tanker. The tanker’s crew gave an apparently different account, saying “flying objects” targeted the vessel.

Pompeo said the administration had shared the video and other unspecified evidence with Germany and other nations.

Asked if the U.S. had a credibility problem with allies worried Trump could be seeking a pretext to move against Iran, the secretary of state said, “We’re not selling anything. These- these are simple facts.”

Pompeo spoke on “Fox News Sunday” and CBS’s “Face the Nation.”

US Treasury yields steady ahead of Federal Reserve meeting,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/17/us-treasury-yields-tick-lower-ahead-federal-reserve-meeting.html,"U.S. government debt yields held steady on Monday as investors prepared for the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision later in the week.

At around 2:19 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was slipped to 2.08%, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond dipped to 2.577%.

Market focus began the week centered on the Fed's upcoming policy decision and public comments, with many expecting the U.S. central bank to hold its overnight lending rate steady ahead of a cut in July. Lackluster inflation, modest economic growth expectations and a partial inversion of the yield curve are expected to pressure Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues toward reducing borrowing costs.

But the timing of any Fed rate cut, the first in more than a decade, remains a matter of debate. While some suspect the Fed to reduce interest rates in June or July after May's weak jobs data and softer consumer price index print, others are betting it waits until September to consider more data first.

Still, economists believe the Fed to hint at any future plans to reduce rates through the so-called ""dot plot,"" a chart that anonymously reflect each official's rate forecast.

Expectations for an upcoming rate cut have kept pressure on yields, with the 2-year Treasury note rate down nearly 40 basis points over the last month to 1.87% from 2.23%. Long-term rates like that of the 10-year Treasury note have touched multiyear lows in recent weeks amid equity volatility and demand for fixed-income assets."
No Reason Given by Governor After DHS Director Dismissed,https://whotv.com,['Dave Price'],06-17-2019,2019,6,https://whotv.com/2019/06/17/no-reason-given-by-governor-after-dhs-director-dismissed/,"Please enable Javascript to watch this video

DES MOINES, Iowa -- One state department leader will now oversee two separate agencies after Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds asked Department of Human Services Director Jerry Foxhoven to resign Monday.

Gerd Clabaugh, currently the director of the Department of Public Health, will also serve as interim DHS according to a news release from the governor. The statement read:

“Gerd has done an incredible job at the Department of Public Health and is well positioned to lead the Department of Human Services. He will play a very important role in implementing my vision for an integrated, compassionate, and coordinated health care system.”

Foxhoven served almost exactly two years in the position and was tasked with improving the state's switch to turn over management of Medicaid delivery services to private companies. That switch, which began under former Governor Terry Branstad with a pledge to save the state hundreds of millions of dollars, has faced numerous complaints of reduced services to the low income, elderly and disabled Iowans Medicaid serves, as well as criticism from providers who say it takes too long to get paid and that they don't always get reimbursed for their services.

Foxhoven release a brief statement regarding his resignation:

“At the Request of the Governor, I submitted my resignation. It was an honor to serve Iowans at the Department of Human Services during an important time of transition. I wish the many hard-working employees at the Department the very best and know that they will continue to serve the people of Iowa well.”

The governor provided no reason for dismissing Foxhoven and didn't mention the pending announcement to reporters during an event in Des Moines Monday morning, three hours before her office sent out the news release regarding the change.

Reynolds left the state to attend a meeting North Carolina scheduled for Tuesday.

Her staff also did not provide a reason for Foxhoven's departure."
"For U.S. presidents, poker is a main event",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Norman Chad', 'Norman Chad Writes A Syndicated Sports Humor Column.']",06-16-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/for-us-presidents-poker-is-a-main-event/2019/06/16/7a1a5e54-8fb1-11e9-b08e-cfd89bd36d4e_story.html,"Columnist

We are in the midst of the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas, with the world championship $10,000 buy-in Main Event beginning July 3, and in its 50th year this annual festival dwarfs the World Series of Baseball in one very unmistakable manner:

The World Series of Poker is a true world series.

Baseball’s alleged World Series is the championship of the United States and Toronto. The WSOP Main Event is the championship of the world — last year, 83 nations were represented, with 2,116 of the 7,874 entrants from outside the U.S.

Frankly, I would argue — and I am arguing — that in addition to having a great international presence, poker is more of an American game than baseball.

You need look no further than the White House.

Many, many presidents played poker as adults before, during and after their administrations. Of course, no presidents have played adult baseball — though George W. Bush was part-owner of the Texas Rangers for a while — and the only MLB presidential activity is the occasional “throwing out the first pitch” at a game after sometimes getting booed.

Let’s kick-start this column by listing four presidential poker facts — well, three facts and one falsehood. You have to pick the imposter!

(a) Richard Nixon loved playing in the Navy, winning enough to help finance his first congressional campaign.

(b) Rutherford B. Hayes built a “man cave” of sorts on the South Lawn, where he played a Friday night game when Congress was in session.

(c) Dwight Eisenhower loved playing in the Army, winning enough to pay for an engagement ring for Mamie.

(d) Warren Harding liked playing twice a week in office and reputedly once lost an entire set of White House china on a poker bet.

The falsehood? It is (b) — Hayes didn’t even own a deck of cards; well, his wife did.

(Usual disclosure: I have been the “color commentator” for ESPN’s World Series of Poker telecasts since 2003 despite knowing very little about poker or broadcasting, joined by my partner Lon McEachern, who also knows very little about cards or TV. We are proof you can fail upward in America, or get elected.)

Among the other presidents who played poker were Ulysses S. Grant, Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry Truman and Barack Obama.

Harding’s advisers played so often with the boss, they were known as the “Poker Cabinet.”

FDR played a regular nickel-ante game in the White House study. His favorite stud games were one-eyed jacks wild and “Woolworth’s,” in which fives and tens were wild.

(Note to readers — or to my reader — under the age of 30: Woolworth’s was a “five-and-dime” department store in the 20th century.)

Truman’s motto, “The buck stops here,” was actually a poker expression; in the 19th century, hunting knives with buckhorn handles were used as the dealer button.

On March 4, 1946, Truman and Winston Churchill played poker on the presidential train en route to Fulton, Mo. Churchill had five Scotches before the game even began, lost $250 and gave up at 2:30 a.m. — he needed to sober up for his famous Iron Curtain speech the next day and needed to sober up for the Cold War.

Which reminds me — in 1271, Kublai Khan’s chief of staff check-raised the emperor at a home game, and the poor sap was working port authority at the Black Sea within a week.*

(*This is probably a falsehood.)

Our current POTUS, Donald Trump, does not play poker. But he created the U.S. Poker Championship for his Trump Taj Mahal casino in 1998, another one of his myriad business failures, held annually until 2010.

As part of ESPN’s coverage of the event in 2006, Trump offered “Trump’s Power Tips” coming out of commercial breaks.

Here was one of them:

“When somebody challenges you, fight back. Don’t let them push you around. Don’t be a sucker. Fight back 10 times harder than they ever thought. Guess what? They’ll never play games with you again.”

I guess he wasn’t bluffing.

"As it plans LEO constellations, DoD must prepare to deal with congestion",https://spacenews.com,['Sandra Erwin'],06-16-2019,2019,6,https://spacenews.com/on-national-security-as-it-plans-leo-constellations-dod-must-prepare-to-deal-with-congestion/,"“On National Security” appears in every issue of SpaceNews magazine. This column ran in the June 10, 2019 issue.

The buzzword in military space these days is “proliferated LEO,” which is Pentagon-speak for large numbers of small satellites in low Earth orbit.

The first project of the newly created Space Development Agency will be to design a proliferated LEO architecture and figure out how it can support military activities in space such as missile detection, communications and global navigation. SDA Director Fred Kennedy believes that within a few years, DoD will be able to shift some capabilities from large spacecraft in higher orbits to small satellites closer to Earth.

Now we’re hearing that the National Reconnaissance Office is likewise ready to jump on the LEO bandwagon to take advantage of lower cost satellites and cheaper launch services. With a proliferated constellation of dozens of spacecraft, the government can take more risks, says Troy Meink, director of NRO’s geospatial intelligence directorate. “You can have a higher failure rate and be able to deal with that. Losing two out of 10 is not as bad as losing one of two.”

With the benefits of LEO come concerns, however. One is the growing congestion and danger of not knowing exactly what is up there.

“This is not just a DoD problem,” says LeoLabs founder and CEO Daniel Ceperley. “Very few people are used to the large constellations.”

LeoLabs operates a worldwide network of ground-based, phased-array radars that tracks objects in low orbits. Its primary customers are commercial satellite operators, regulatory and civilian space agencies, and insurance companies. LeoLabs does some work with DoD, but Ceperley expects the military will become a bigger customer as it moves to deploy more satellites in LEO.

Everyone is focused on building satellites, launching them and making sure they can downlink data, but much less thought is being given to the actual operation of a constellation in a congested environment, says Ceperley. “That’s where there’s a lot of challenge.”

All this is manageable, he says. There are roughly 1,000 active satellites in LEO today. If the huge broadband constellations that are now being developed come to fruition, the numbers could go up to 15,000. “I think they can all be safely put into LEO. It just requires much better active management,” Ceperley says.

Given the pace of commercial investment in space traffic management technologies, DoD should have access in the future to more sophisticated collision-prevention services that will alert operators about potential orbital crashes. Today, there’s no collision prevention information available outside of what U.S. Strategic Command sends directly to satellite operators, says Ceperley. “There’s a lot of talk about rules of the road and best practices for organizing constellations, but it’s not based on a lot of data.”

For DoD, one of the concerns is dealing with maneuvering satellites that may or may not have malicious intent but still pose hazards. A lot of satellites are using low impulse thrusters so operators can raise fleets of spacecraft slowly up to their operational altitude and bring them back down to burn up in the atmosphere. “There’s a lot more maneuvering going on,” Ceperley says. “Keeping track of those maneuvers and feeding those into collision prediction services has been a challenge in the past.” He says LeoLabs is developing new software systems and expanding its radar network precisely to fill the demand for more intelligence about what’s happening in space.

The U.S. Air Force is spending hundreds of millions of dollars on a Space Fence radar which is about to become operational and will help track much smaller objects than now possible. But that is not going to be enough to cope with the clutter and the proliferation of space junk, says Ceperley. DoD’s exquisite sensors are valuable for some activities but the military will need additional help keeping tabs on commercial activity and where the debris is going.

DoD today does not have enough sensors to adequately monitor the congestion in LEO, he says. If several dozen satellites are launched at one time, at least 10 or 20 will go untracked for weeks.

Those issues are going to become a bigger problem for the military and the intelligence community as LEO becomes more populated.

USDA provides opportunities for rural home ownership,https://www.kcrg.com,['News Staff'],,,,https://www.kcrg.com/content/news/USDA-provides-opportunities-for-rural-home-ownership-511396041.html,"June is homeownership month and the USDA Rural Development office in Iowa has options for buying or building a home in small towns.

MGN

Every year, around 2,000 Iowans get help from the USDA to get a place to live through two low-interest and no-down-payment loan programs. There are income limits, but for families moving to the country to work in agriculture or helping develop small communities, the loans are needed support.

State Director of Rural Development Grant Menke said in the last 80 years the USDA has helped 4.4 million rural Americans with housing needs.

He says home ownership is foundational to small towns in enhancing economic opportunity and improving quality of life, which is the core mission of rural development.

""If you go across the state and ask people about what the most pressing needs are in rural communities, nine out of ten times you're going to hear housing and you're going to hear workforce. So we are very pleased to be a part of that solution,"" he said.

There are also opportunities for Iowans to build their own place with USDA loans. Rural Housing 360 teamed up with government agencies, businesses, and communities to offer several small floor building plans and get loans, putting new homes in small-town communities.

As an example, when Prestage Farms decided to build a new pork processing plant in 2016, they planned to hire nearly 900 workers who would need a place to live near Eagle Grove, Iowa a town of 3,500 people.

USDA loans could help those workers find a place to live.

Menke says he's happy to be a part of the solution addressing rural housing needs.

""And there's a lot of building happening in rural communities right now. You're seeing businesses, manufacturers expanding in a lot of parts of the state and that's where that workforce and housing, those dual critical needs come together,"" he said.

DOJ defends Mnuchin’s refusal to hand over Trump’s tax returns,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Alex Pappas', 'Alex Pappas Is A Politics Reporter At Foxnews.Com.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-defends-mnuchins-refusal-to-hand-over-trumps-tax-returns,"The Justice Department released an opinion Friday defending Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s refusal to comply with a House Democratic subpoena for six years of President Trump’s personal and business tax returns.

Last month, Mnuchin said he consulted with the Department of Justice in making the decision not to hand over the returns to the House Ways and Means Committee, saying the request “lacks a legitimate legislative purpose.”

HOUSE DEMOCRAT SUBPOENAS MNUCHIN, IRS FOR TRUMP’S TAX RETURNS

In its opinion Friday, the DOJ’s Office of Legal Counsel said that it advised the Treasury Department to deny the request.

“While the Executive Branch should accord due deference and respect to congressional requests, Treasury was not obliged to accept the Committee’s stated purpose without question, and based on all the facts and circumstances, we agreed that the Committee lacked a legitimate legislative purpose for its request,” the opinion states.

Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Richard Neal, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee issued subpoenas last month to Mnuchin and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig for the tax returns.

“While I do not take this step lightly, I believe this action gives us the best opportunity to succeed and obtain the requested material,” Neal said in a statement at the time.

The topic has been a contentious one for the president since his time on the campaign trail in 2015, and throughout his administration, as he has refused to release his financial information. Trump repeatedly has claimed that his tax returns are complicated, and he has maintained that he will not release them while they are under audit by the IRS.

Last week, The New York Times obtained Trump’s federal income tax returns between 1985 and 1994. The documents revealed that Trump claimed to have lost $1.17 billion from his real estate businesses during that decade. The Times added that it had compared Trump’s tax information with other high-income earners and found that Trump “appears to have lost more money than nearly any other individual American taxpayer. The newspaper also reported that the losses were so substantial, that in the eight of the 10 years in question, Trump was able to avoid paying income tax.

House Democrats have been targeting Trump’s tax returns and financial documents since they took the majority in Congress in January. As part of their lead-off ethics package, which Trump’s lawyers cited in their filing Wednesday, Democrats’ legislation required presidents to disclose at least 10 years of their tax returns to the public, in what was an apparent swipe at Trump.

Understanding the State Department’s updated travel advisories,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Hannah Sampson', 'Reporter Focusing On Travel News', 'June At Pm', 'Hannah Sampson Is A Staff Writer At The Washington Post For The Way', 'Where She Reports On Travel News.']",06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2019/06/17/travel-advisories-can-be-confusing-heres-how-navigate-them/,"A traveler looking for global guidance from the U.S. State Department could be forgiven for being a bit confused. Official advisories — 209 of them — from the department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs cover countries and areas in every nook of the planet, and one even warns of a blanket worldwide caution.

All destinations are ranked from levels 1 to 4, and places as disparate as Italy, China, Antarctica and the Dominican Republic are among the 58 countries that share a designation of Level 2, which means “exercise increased caution” — but for a host of reasons. The warnings range from possible terrorist attacks, in Italy, to arbitrary enforcement of local laws, in China, to “extreme and unpredictable weather,” in Antarctica. The Dominican Republic advisory warns of “violent crime,” which predated a sudden influx of American deaths in the country.

[7 questions about the unexplained tourist deaths in the Dominican Republic, answered]

More than half of the advisories are at Level 1, the lowest, which tells travelers to exercise “normal precautions.” But even the countries with the lowest warning level aren’t in the clear. More than two dozen Level 1 destinations are home to regions marked with their own, higher warnings, some that even get the most severe “do not travel” label. Heading to Panama or Peru? No problem, except for the parts with big problems.

So how should travelers heed the warnings meant to help them stay safe abroad? In short, the fine print — even for the most idyllic-seeming getaway spot — is important. On first glance, for example, the Barbados advisory might suggest there’s nothing to worry about, because it sits at the lowest level. But expanding to read the entire advisory on the island nation reveals that the United States warns to avoid certain areas or activities, including two businesses that run “pirate ship” cruises at night.

[Where in the world shouldn’t you go?]

Matt Bradley, regional security director of the Americas for International SOS, a firm that provides health and security services to travelers, said the difficulty of rating an entire country is that different parts carry disproportionate levels of risk.

“The nuance of this system allows them to say, ‘While the overall country is Level 1, there are specific destinations that are Level 2 or Level 3,’"" he says.

Michelle Bernier-Toth, the State Department’s managing director for the Office of Overseas Citizens Services, said the department makes its rulings based on information from embassies and consulates, security experts, local governments and other sources. And even in a destination that is considered low-risk overall, if there are specific zones that are off-limits or restricted for employees of the U.S. government, that information must be passed along to the public.

“We really want to be as accurate as we can so people can make an informed decision,” she says.

Because situations can change quickly, the State Department urges travelers to sign up for the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program to receive alerts about a destination and to provide ways for the U.S. Embassy to reach them in case of an emergency. Through the program, anyone can choose one or more countries and enter their dates of travel, and the department will email updates with alerts and advisories. Those messages also appear on Twitter at @TravelGov and on the Department of State’s Consular Affairs Facebook page.



(U.S. Department of State)

Each advisory at Level 2 or higher includes specific risks such as crime, terror, civil unrest, natural disaster, health concerns and, as of April, kidnapping. The State Department’s site often spells out specific geographic areas of concern and also offers tips for dealing with those risks, links to more country information and warnings about what the U.S. government cannot do in an emergency.

The bureau also includes details for people traveling internationally under various circumstances: those going on a cruise, leaving the country with pets, going to high-risk areas or embarking on a pilgrimage. There are also recommendations for people in specific groups — the LGBTQ community, travelers with disabilities — who could find themselves vulnerable on the road.

Other countries issue their own advisories for international travel, but, Bradley said, it’s not necessary for a traveler to check several countries’ warnings. They should, however, be sure to pay attention to the advice of the country where they are a citizen.

“Check the site of your citizenship because that is the one written specifically for you,” he says. “The risks won’t change, but the citizenship-specific advice could change, and that could be confusing.” The United States, for example, warns citizens not to travel to Iran — a country with which the U.S. government does not have diplomatic or consular relations — whereas Canada urges its citizens merely to use a high degree of caution.

If all that sounds hard to follow, consider that the system actually got an overhaul last year that made it easier to decipher. Under the old version, low-risk countries didn’t have any kind of advice. Only those destinations with concerns were singled out with travel warnings or alerts — and the difference wasn’t necessarily obvious.

[State Department updates travel advisories to make them more understandable]

“Frankly, I personally was tired of explaining the difference between a travel warning and a travel alert even to some of my colleagues,” Bernier-Toth said in a briefing about the new changes last year.

She told The Washington Post recently that the new system treats countries consistently, uses plain language, puts the risk indicators front and center, and makes information on how to deal with threats much more clear. The department still puts out short-term alerts about security, weather or other issues, even if they don’t change an overall advisory.

“We made the change because we found that the old system of travel warnings and travel alerts was not readily understood by people,” she says, “and we wanted to make our travel advisories — now that we have [one] for every country — clearer, more concise, more actionable and more accessible to people.""

Immigration by the numbers: DHS has no idea how many people are entering illegally,https://thehill.com,[],06-16-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/opinion/immigration/448765-immigration-by-the-numbers-dhs-has-no-idea-how-many-people-are-entering,"Border agents apprehended 132,887 people trying to cross the Southwest border in May, a 13-year high, and many of the migrants were asylum seekers. The increased flow across the border has overwhelmed our asylum system. It has become so difficult to get an asylum application processed in the United States that some migrants are giving up and applying for asylum in Mexico.

But the Southwest border is only 1,954 miles long, less than two percent of the 101,471-mile border around the United States (6,000 miles of land borders and 95,471 miles of coastline borders).

And DHS seems to have concentrated its resources on the Southwest border. In fiscal 2017, there were 461,540 apprehensions, but only 3,027 of them were at the northern border and only 3,588 at coastal borders.

ADVERTISEMENT

Congress, however, apparently wants DHS to patrol the entire border — all 101,471 miles of it.

Section 1092 in the Fiscal 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) requires the DHS Secretary to provide congress with annual metrics reports on securing the border between all of the ports of entry along the perimeter of the United States.

The report must include the percentage of the illegal crossers who were apprehended, how many undetected illegal crossings occurred, how many migrants succeeded in making an illegal crossing but went back to Mexico right away, and how many were detected but able to get away without being apprehended.

The NDAA requires the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) to analyze the suitability and statistical validity of the data provided in the report.

The Secretary submitted the fiscal 2018 Border Security Metrics Report on Feb. 26, 2019, and GAO released its evaluation in March. Among other things, GAO expressed concern about DHS's failure to systematically review the reliability of the data it used to make its determinations and to comprehensively identify and communicate limitations.

I suspect that such a review would just have revealed the futility of the project — here's why.

Apprehension rate

To determine the apprehension rate between ports of entry, DHS must divide the number of apprehensions by the number of unlawful entry attempts.

For example, if the Border Patrol apprehends 100,000 illegal crossers next month, and there are 100,000 unlawful entry attempts that month, the apprehension rate would be 100 percent. Every alien who attempted an illegal entry would have been caught. But if there are 200,000 unlawful entry attempts and 100,000 apprehensions, the apprehension rate would be 50 percent.

DHS has developed two systems for making this calculation, a model-based apprehension rate system and an observational apprehension rate system. See page 7 of the report.

The apprehension rate produced by the model-based system for fiscal 2017 was 65.4 percent, and the observational-based system produced a rate of 74.5 percent.

I don't think these systems can produce reliable information. If you don't know how many illegal entries were attempted, you can't calculate an apprehension rate, and creating sophisticated-sounding metrics systems doesn't change that fact.

DHS could do this on the land borders by installing surveillance equipment, known as a ""virtual wall,"" but an attempt to install such a system in 2006 was a complete fiasco. When the project was terminated in 2011, only 53 miles of the system had been installed — at a cost of one billion dollars.

Detected unlawful entries

DHS does this calculation by adding the number of ""turn backs"" and ""got aways"" to the number of apprehensions.

""Turn backs"" are migrants who, after making an illegal entry, respond to U.S. enforcement efforts by returning promptly to the country from which they entered.

""Got aways"" are migrants who are observed making an illegal entry but are not caught.

According to the report, the number of detected unlawful entries fell from 2 million in fiscal 2006 to roughly 500,000 in fiscal 2017, a 75 percent decrease.

ADVERTISEMENT

Undetected unlawful entries

This refers to the number of migrants who succeed in making an illegal entry without being detected. DHS developed a system for making this calculation, but that doesn't change the fact that they are just guessing.

According to their system, undetected illegal entries fell from more than a million in fiscal 2006 to fewer than 57,000 in fiscal 2017, a 95 percent decrease.

Turn backs

According to DHS, the primary limitation to detecting turn backs is that it requires subjective observations from thousands of individual agents.

The report concludes that there were 91,998 turn backs in fiscal 2017.

ADVERTISEMENT

Got aways

The report only mentions got aways that occurred on the Southwest border.

It states that got aways declined from 615,000 in fiscal 2006 to 104,000 in fiscal 2017, an 83 percent decrease.

Although DHS should provide the data needed to determine the effectiveness of border security measures, it won't be able to acquire it without costly surveillance systems that may not be feasible to install with current technology.

Until then, DHS estimates will just be educated guesses.

I-Team: U.S. Department of Education investigating Duke-UNC Consortium after complaints of anti-Semitism,https://abc11.com,['Jonah Kaplan'],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://abc11.com/i-team-us-dept-of-education-investigating-duke-unc-consortium/5350504/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. (WTVD) -- On Monday, U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos formally opened an investigation into the Duke-UNC Consortium for Middle East Studies which applied a federal grant to host a conference on Gaza tainted by accusations of anti-Semitism. In a letter obtained by the ABC11 I-Team , Secretary DeVos said she is ""troubled"" by the concerns raised by Rep. George Holding (R-North Carolina) who first requested an investigation earlier this spring ""In order for the department to learn more about this matter, I have directed the Office of Postsecondary Education to examine the use of funds under this program to determine if the Consortium violated the terms and conditions of its grant.""The Duke-UNC Consortium hosted the ""Conflict Over Gaza"" in March at UNC-Chapel Hill, and it was an event sponsored by more than two dozen university departments, plus the Rotary Club of Raleigh and other local organizations.A video taken by filmmaker Ami Horowitz captured an anti-Semitic song being performed by a Palestinian rapper - and met with applause.Many thought the conference would provide diverse perspectives on the conflict in the Middle East, but rapper Tamer Nafar tells the audience: ""Let's try it together. I need your help. I cannot be anti-Semitic alone."" That was before he sang a song with the lyrics: ""Don't think of Rihanna when you sing this, don't think of Beyonce - think of Mel Gibson. I'm in love with a Jew/Oh/I fell in love with a Jew/Oh/Her skin is white and my skin is brown, she was going up up and I was going down.""""I'd like to thank Secretary Devos for treating this matter with the seriousness and attention it deserves,"" Rep. Holding said in response to the new investigation. ""I hope we can all agree that it is irresponsible and immoral for taxpayer dollars to fund overtly biased advocacy under the guise of constructive academic discourse.""Many department heads and sponsors demanded their money back after the controversy erupted.In a scathing letter to leaders of the UNC Center for Middle East and Islamic Studies, which officially sponsored the event, UNC School of Law Dean Martin Brinkley said: ""Due to your inclusion of conference content over which I had no knowledge or control, I have been forced to spend most of the last two days responding to outraged members of my own community who are ashamed and embarrassed to see the law school shown as a sponsor of what they consider hate speech.""A statement released by UNC Interim Chancellor Kevin M. Guskiewicz called the performance ""disturbing"" and that he is ""heartbroken and deeply offended that this performance happened. I stand steadfast against Anti-Semitism and hate in all its forms.""UNC-Chapel Hill will continue to work with the U.S. Department of Education to directly answer any questions about the Duke-UNC Consortium for Middle East Studies, the university said."
DOJ edges closer to T-Mobile-Sprint approval,https://www.cnet.com,['Marguerite Reardon'],06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnet.com/news/doj-edges-closer-to-t-mobile-sprint-approval/,"Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

The US Justice Department is getting close to approving T-Mobile's $26 billion merger with Sprint if the companies agree to sell multiple assets to help create a new wireless carrier, according to The New York Times. The paper reports that three unnamed sources close to the DOJ have said the agency could approve the deal as soon as next week, so long as a new nationwide phone carrier can be created to ensure sufficient competition in the wireless market.

T-Mobile and Sprint have already struck a deal with the Federal Communications Commission to sell off Sprint's prepaid brand Boost Mobile in exchange for the agency's blessing. The FCC and the DOJ must each sign off on the deal. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has already said he'd support the merger if the companies agreed to sell Boost and if they make other commitments, such as meeting build-out requirements for 5G wireless service. In addition to the Boost sale, the DOJ is also asking T-Mobile and Sprint to divest wireless spectrum, according to the Times.

Reports that the DOJ wanted the companies to sell off assets to create a new carrier first circulated last month. But the Times report suggests a deal is imminent.

Such an agreement could weaken the case for the states suing to stop the merger. A group of 10 state attorneys general, led by New York Attorney General Letitia James and California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, filed their suit earlier this week, saying that the merged company would ""deprive consumers of the benefits of competition and drive up prices for cellphone services.""

The lawsuit to block the merger is set for a pretrial hearing next week in federal court in New York City, according to Reuters.

T-Mobile declined to comment on the report. Sprint, the DOJ and the New York Attorney General's office weren't immediately available for comment."

DOJ lost track of foreign nationals with criminal histories after bringing them to US: audit,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Alex Pappas', 'Alex Pappas Is A Politics Reporter At Foxnews.Com.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-lost-track-of-foreign-nationals-with-criminal-histories-brought-into-us-for-court-cases-audit,"The Justice Department has lost track of numerous foreign nationals who were brought into the United States to help with law enforcement cases and may have criminal histories of their own – something that could be putting the public ""at risk,"" the DOJ’s inspector general warned in a newly released audit.

The report released by the Office of the Inspector General identified 62 foreign nationals brought into the U.S. who have since ""absconded"" from Justice Department oversight. The audit called this “especially problematic” because “these individuals often have criminal histories or are involved with criminal organizations.”

“Therefore, there are risks associated with these individuals remaining in the United States unsupervised and the public can be at risk,” the report said.

HOUSE DEMS VOTE TO HOLD BARR, ROSS IN CONTEMPT, AS TRUMP ASSERTS EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE OVER CENSUS

The report warned that others could be missing too: As of August 2018, the Department of Homeland Security was still seeking current information for 665 people identified as DOJ-sponsored foreign nationals as part of its own tracking.

A Justice Department spokesman, Alexei Woltornist, told Fox News: “The Department of Justice is aware of the findings of the IG report and is working on remedying the problem.”

In total, the department has sponsored thousands of foreign nationals under this program -- 5,496 between 2015 and 2017, spanning the Obama and Trump administrations, the audit said. Agencies involved include the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, United States Attorney’s Offices and the United States Marshals Service.

According to the audit, these foreign nationals – who may otherwise be considered inadmissible to the United States because of their criminal history – are brought to the U.S. to help support investigations and prosecutions.

“Significant risks accompany the sponsoring of foreign nationals to support law enforcement investigations because these individuals may be associated with criminal activity and motivated only by the ability to reside in the United States,” the report said.

But the report said the inspector general’s office does not “have assurance” that the DOJ and its law enforcement agencies have “adequately executed their monitoring responsibilities to mitigate the risks involved with sponsoring foreign nationals and to fulfill their obligation to protect the public.”

While the Justice Department and the other agencies have performed monitoring activities, problems have been identified in the process.

The report said some of the sponsored foreign nationals are not actually subject to “any routine monitoring requirements” because of “weaknesses in the monitoring policies at some DOJ components.”

And the report noted 18 instances where the Justice Department did not renew the sponsorship or termination of a foreign national in a timely matter, leading to those individuals falling into “an illegal status while residing in the United States.”

“We are concerned that the monitoring policies and practices currently executed by the DOJ components that sponsor foreign nationals do not adequately mitigate the risks associated with bringing individuals into the United States who may have criminal backgrounds or involvement in disreputable activities, or who may be associated with such individuals,” the report said.

In a response included in the audit, the Justice Department defended the use of the so-called S visa program, which allows long-term stays for foreign nationals in the United States when their presence could assist in combatting criminal and terrorism activities.

“The S visa program has played a crucial role in the successful prosecution or investigation of significant criminal or terrorist organization enterprises, and has enabled federal investigators and prosecutors to bring to justice dangerous criminals,” Jennifer A.H. Hodge, the acting deputy assistant attorney general, wrote in an April letter.

There have been risk concerns involving other federal government programs designed to expedite the admittance of foreign nationals into the United States.

In response to the special counsel’s report, Democrats are piecing together a package of legislation focused largely on shielding elections from foreign influence, including proposals to bar candidates from accepting foreign help of any kind, while making it mandatory that campaigns alert the FBI when such offers are extended.

But some lawmakers want to press further, eying legislation to nullify the Department of Justice's (DOJ) long-standing determination that presidents cannot be charged with federal crimes while they remain in office.

Rep. Hakeem Jeffries Hakeem Sekou JeffriesDems eye repeal of Justice rule barring presidential indictments Dems eye repeal of Justice rule barring presidential indictments Dem committees win new powers to investigate Trump MORE (N.Y.), chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, is also signaling his support. While he has not been involved in talks about specific proposals, Jeffries said, “It strikes me as a reasonable thing to consider.”

“It's fair to say that one of the options we should consider is revisiting that Department of Justice rule so you don't have a rogue and lawless president immunized from criminal prosecution,” he said.

It's unclear how or when the proposal might surface. Connolly said it could appear as part of a larger spending package or as an authorization bill out of the House Judiciary Committee. “But I guarantee you it will be a topic of discussion,” he said.

At issue is a Justice Department policy stretching back 46 years, when former President Nixon was coming under increasing fire surrounding a Watergate scandal that would eventually lead to his impeachment and resignation. In that 1973 memorandum, the DOJ’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) resolved that a sitting president cannot be subject to prosecution for federal crimes.

The rationale hinged on bandwidth. The president's unique responsibilities, the authors determined, “have become so onerous that a President may not be able fully to discharge the powers and duties of his office if he had to defend a criminal prosecution.” With that in mind, the OLC concluded, the only way to remove a sitting president is through impeachment.

The DOJ revisited the question in 2000, following the impeachment of former President Clinton, finding that “the conclusion reached by the Department in 1973 still represents the best interpretation of the Constitution.”

Mueller leaned heavily on that policy last month in outlining his findings during a brief appearance at the DOJ, where he made clear the agency’s guidelines precluded his team from recommending charges against Trump related to the obstruction allegations it had investigated.

“The special counsel’s office is part of the Department of Justice, and, by regulation, it was bound by that department policy,” he said. “Charging the president with a crime was therefore not an option we could consider.”

Democrats were quick to punch back, arguing that no one — not even the president — is immune to the nation’s laws.

They had just ousted a king who flaunted that.”

Quigley said legislation to invalidate the DOJ policy is “a great idea.”

Such a bill has little chance of being considered in the Senate, which is controlled by Trump's Republican allies. But some Democrats see it as a viable messaging tool heading into the 2020 elections.

“If I were a Republican member of the Senate, I wouldn't want to have to explain why the president is not subject to the laws of the United States,” said Rep.

Warren's idea is catching on with Democrats in the Capitol, who have grown increasingly frustrated with the administration's stonewalling of their investigations.

Not all Democrats, however, are so eager to jump on board. Rep.

“That's why you have impeachment,” she said. “Because when the president is unfit — and it doesn't have to be criminal — when the Congress decides that he's not fit to be president, then that's what impeachment is for. That's what we're supposed to do.”

“There's an old saying that bad facts make bad law,” he said. “And I'd be careful of making sweeping legal decisions based on Trump's conduct.”

Still, there appear to be no divisions among the Democrats when it comes to the idea that the Constitution provides no license for presidents to flout the law with impunity.

And that may just be the start.

Trump has challenged enough conventions, many Democrats say, that Congress will be forced to enshrine new laws that were previously thought unnecessary — including the voiding of the OLC guideline — even if it’s after he's gone.

DOJ establishes transnational elder fraud strike force,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-establishes-transnational-elder-fraud-strike-force/story?id=63714167,"The Justice Department has formed a transnational elder fraud strike force to combat the growing international problem of elder fraud.

Elder fraud is when fraudsters prey on older victims who can be more susceptible to when approached to give money to sympathetic causes and in some cases threatened and harassed by criminals.

Recently, three Peruvian men pleaded guilty to extorting older Americans through a Spanish-speaking call center.

""For example, one such script directed the callers to falsely and fraudulently claim to be government attorneys and to state that the victims faced lawsuits and fines for not paying for or receiving packages. Other scripts included similar stories where the callers falsely claimed to be attorneys with courts or credit bureaus in the United States,"" the indictment in the case reads.

The effort, announced Thursday, combines six U.S. Attorney's offices from California to Georgia, FBI Special Agents and the Postal Inspection Agency -- all in an effort to combat elder fraud in the United States.

“Fraud against the elderly is on the rise,"" Attorney General William Barr said in a release. “One of the most significant and pernicious causes for this increase is foreign-based fraud schemes. The new Transnational Elder Fraud Strike Force will bring together the expertise and resources of our prosecutors, federal and international law enforcement partners, and other government agencies to better target, investigate, and prosecute criminals abroad who prey on our elderly at home. The Department of Justice is committed to ending the victimization of elders across the country.”

Earlier this year, the attorney general announced the largest ever crackdown on elder fraud in country by highlighting the case of William Webster, the former FBI director who was targeted for months by scammers abroad.

“It doesn’t matter where these criminals live. We’re committed to keeping our elderly citizens safe, whether they’re being targeted door-to-door, over the phone, or online, from thousands of miles away,” FBI Director Christopher Wray said.

Barr has said that he had been a victim of one of the scams in 2017. While he was not attorney general at the time, fraudsters asked for money using his old official portrait.

He highlighted his story at a roundtable event in March.

""People took my official Justice Department portrait from 1992, so I was looking pretty good in 1992 and they put it up on Facebook and other online sites and I was telling people as the former attorney general I had access to special federal grant money and if they just sent some money I could tell them how to get some major grants,"" he explained.

Barr said he had the pages taken down, but from time to time even leading up to when he was nominated to be attorney general he would get calls from people around the country which he called ""heartbreaking."""
Department of Energy grant to develop area's nuclear workforce,https://www.augustachronicle.com,['Susan Mccord'],06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.augustachronicle.com/news/20190617/department-of-energy-grant-to-develop-areas-nuclear-workforce,"Five area institutions are getting $5 million to better develop the area’s nuclear workforce and help meet a goal of producing 80 plutonium pits per year by 2030.

Lisa Gordon-Hagerty, the administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration in the U.S. Department of Energy, was surrounded by the heads of the five institutions – Augusta and Aiken technical colleges, Augusta University and the University of South Carolina's Aiken and Salkehatchie campuses – along with two U.S. congressmen and numerous other officials when she made the announcement Monday at Aiken Tech.

“As many of you know, our mission at Savannah River Site will be growing, not decreasing,” Gordon-Hagerty said. “The Department of Energy and NNSA are committed to this partnership and helping sustain the great work being done.”

The grant doubles the current annual funding for a regional nuclear careers program administered by the Savannah River Site Community Reuse Organization, which since 2016 has received $1 million per year to coordinate programs across the institutions, the NNSA said in a news release.

Workforce development is vital to the area’s mission, including the planned repurposing of the former Mixed-Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility into a plutonium pit production facility, Gordon-Hagerty said.

“The plutonium pit mission, and congressmen (Joe) Wilson and (Rick) Allen have been instrumental in all this, given the president’s 2018 nuclear posture review, the United States determined that we needed to have a resilient monitoring structure for our nuclear deterrent,” Gordon-Hagerty said.

“We need to prepare to produce up to 80 pits per year by 2030, producing not less than 30 per year at Los Alamos (N.M.) and producing not less than 50 pits per year at Savannah River Site,” she said.

Wilson, the South Carolina Republican who represents the area, said he was “a cheerleader for the Savannah River Site” while Allen, the Republican who represents the area across the river in Georgia, said Wilson had worked through the night last week on SRS-related legislation.

While the economy is growing rapidly, Allen said, “it could grow faster if we’d trained that workforce.”

Coursework funded through the program includes radiation protection technology, nuclear engineering technology, process engineering, environmental remediation, chemistry and physics with a concentration in nuclear science, welding and others."
Federal watchdog opens inquiry into EPA handling of Minnesota PolyMet pollution permit,http://www.startribune.com,"['Jennifer Bjorhus', 'Jennifer.Bjorhus Startribune.Com']",,,,http://www.startribune.com/federal-watchdog-opens-inquiry-into-how-the-epa-handled-minnesota-pollution-permit/511333592/,"The Environmental Protection Agency Office of Inspector General has opened an investigation into the agency’s handling of a crucial pollution permit for Minnesota’s first copper mine after a retired agency attorney raised questions about the episode.

The investigation was announced June 12, the same day the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released documents related to the water quality permit requested by several parties, including the Minnesota-based advocacy group WaterLegacy and U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn.

Release of the documents shows that written comments by EPA regulators, challenging key parts of the permit, were never formally submitted for the public record and were never sent to officials at the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA). Instead, the comments were read to MPCA staff over the telephone last spring, a practice that the retired EPA attorney described as “bizarre.”

The Star Tribune has also requested the documents, but the EPA hasn’t yet provided them.

The documents relate to a crucial state water quality permit issued to PolyMet Mining, a Toronto-based minerals firm that wants to build a $1 billion copper-nickel mine in northeast Minnesota. After years of review, PolyMet cleared most of Minnesota’s regulatory hurdles in late 2018. The newly released documents include seven pages of detailed criticism by EPA Region 5 staff in Chicago, which oversees Minnesota’s enforcement of federal pollution laws, outlining deficiencies in the permit that the MPCA issued to PolyMet last December. It is the first time the EPA’s official comments on the permit, which will regulate dangerous pollutants in effluent from the mine, have been made public.

The written comments note that the permit would “authorize discharges that would exceed Minnesota’s federally-approved human health and/or aquatic life water quality standards for mercury, copper, arsenic, cadmium, and zinc.” In one core passage, they said the permit lacked specific effluent limits, known as WQBELs, which are numeric limits on how much of a pollutant can be in the effluent pumped out a discharge pipe.

A retired EPA attorney from Boston, Jeffry Fowley, learned of the phoned-in comments from confidential sources in January and filed a complaint with the EPA’s Office of Inspector General.

The sources told him EPA leadership in Region 5 were suppressing staff comments. Fowley has called it “serious improper conduct” and “unethical.”

“In all my years of experience, I have never heard of a situation where EPA personnel have read written comments on a permit to state personnel over the phone,” Fowley said in a sworn declaration filed with the Minnesota Court of Appeals.

MPCA officials told the Star Tribune there was nothing unusual about their exchange with the EPA, and that they did incorporate many of the agency’s concerns into the final permit for PolyMet.

In an interview Friday, Fowley said he and Minnesota’s Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, which also filed a complaint, were pleased with the Inspector General’s decision.

“I think the fact that they’re taking up this one indicates they think there is something seriously wrong,” Fowley said.

McCollum, who waged a monthslong public battle to obtain the EPA documents, had only brief comments. In a statement to the Star Tribune she said her role was to “ensure transparency.”

“Now the courts and the public have the information needed to determine whether the final permit adequately addresses the many concerns raised by the EPA,” said McCollum, who leads a House subcommittee that oversees the EPA.

Differing documents

In a letter to McCollum with the documents, EPA Acting Associate Administrator Joseph Brazauskas said it’s common practice for complex permitting decisions to be handled verbally rather than in writing.

“EPA Region 5 Administrator Cathy Stepp has specifically encouraged EPA staff to work more collaboratively and speak ‘face-to-face’ with state officials,” Brazauskas wrote.

Brazauskas also said the EPA hadn’t planned to release the written comments because it considers them private under the “deliberative process privilege” exemption to the federal Freedom of Information Act.

However, he said, the agency had given the comments voluntarily to the Fond du Lac tribe, so it could no longer withhold them.

The EPA’s written comments were also sent to WaterLegacy, an advocacy group in St. Paul, and the Fond du Lac Band, whose land is downstream from PolyMet’s proposed mine near Babbitt.

The parties together have challenged the water permit over its lack of stringent, federally enforceable limits on nearly two dozen pollutants regulated by the Clean Water Act.

The documents received by WaterLegacy, however, differ slightly from those sent to McCollum; they include a separate letter from Kevin Pierard, a senior official in the EPA’s Chicago office, to Jeff Udd, the MPCA’s director of metallic mining, which underscores the fact that the EPA’s concerns were conveyed by phone, not in writing.

Many sections in this copy of the written comments were underlined and numbered; across the top Pierard wrote by hand that the underlined sections were “conveyed verbally” to the MPCA on April 5, 2018, and lists the MPCA staff on the phone call.

The phone conversation occurred several weeks after the public comment period on PolyMet’s draft permit closed in March 2018, meaning that the EPA-written criticisms were never entered in the public record.

The EPA’s criticisms should have been public from the start, said WaterLegacy lawyer Paula Maccabee.

“They are some of the strongest comments I’ve ever seen,” she said. “It’s like one of the most important documents in this entire case, and it’s not in the administrative record.”

‘Rigorous’ review

MPCA officials and former MPCA Commissioner John Linc Stine said nothing improper occurred in the episode and that the final PolyMet permit did reflect some of the EPA comments.

In an interview, Stine said nothing requires the EPA to submit written comments during the public comment period. He also said that the concerns the EPA read over the telephone were similar to comments other stakeholders had filed previously.

“It didn’t strike me that there was anything that was plowing new ground,” he said.

In a statement, MPCA spokesman Darin Broton described the PolyMet permit process as “rigorous” and said the agency discussed technical issues with the EPA frequently.

“Based on those conversations, as well as other comments received … during the official comment period, the MPCA made substantive changes to the draft permit, including additional limits for arsenic, cobalt, lead, nickel and mercury; and new language was added that clearly states that the discharge must not violate water quality standards,” Broton said. “That’s why the EPA did not object to the MPCA’s final permit.”

Several MPCA staff members have filed sworn statements as part of an appeal filed by WaterLegacy, making similar arguments.

Former MPCA staff attorney Michael Schmidt said in his declaration that no one tried to conceal anything. They noted how quickly the EPA staff read the comments on the phone that day, making note-taking difficult.

In an interview Friday, Fowley, the former EPA attorney, accused both the EPA and the MPCA of a “coverup.” He said confidential sources told him that the EPA’s Region 5 staff were so frustrated about their unheeded concerns that they filed a memo Dec. 18 — just before the permit was issued — documenting the issues that had not been resolved. Fowley said the memo contained sufficient information to justify an EPA objection to the permit.

Fowley characterized PolyMet’s permit as weak, and “an end run around the … requirements of the Clean Water Act.”

“It’s kind of like if instead of speed limits they told people not to drive too fast,” Fowley said. “I’ve never seen this situation before.”"
