"Census citizenship question still a live issue, Trump says",https://www.cnn.com,"['Ariane De Vogue', 'Gregory Wallace', 'Jeremy Diamond']",07-03-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/03/politics/census-question-trump-tweet/index.html,"(CNN) Contradicting both his Department of Justice and his secretary of Commerce , President Donald Trump vowed on Wednesday to keep fighting to have a citizenship question added to the 2020 census.

""We are absolutely moving forward, as we must,"" Trump said in a tweet.

The President's message suggested that he was either reacting to criticism from the right that the government had unnecessarily caved on the issue, or perhaps speaking past the parties involved in two lawsuits in an effort to energize his base on the issue. One example of the criticism Trump faced Tuesday: conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt sent out a tweet that he was ""very surprised"" that the President had ""surrendered without a battle on this issue.""

Trump disputed that characterization in his tweet Wednesday.

""The News Reports about the Department of Commerce dropping its quest to put the Citizenship Question on the Census is incorrect, or, to state it differently, FAKE!"" the President wrote.

It was not immediately clear what the administration's next steps would be given Trump's contradictory statements. Asked for comment after the tweets, a Justice Department spokeswoman said that she would have to ""circle back on this.""

A federal judge in New York on Wednesday ordered the government to respond in writing by 6 p.m. ET about its ""position and intentions"" regarding adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census.

A White House official said earlier Wednesday afternoon that there are ongoing discussions at the White House about finding a path forward for the government to continue to press its case on getting the citizenship question on the census.

The issue is whether and how to do so even as the Department of Commerce has begun to print the 2020 questionnaire without the citizenship question, the official said.

This official suggested the printing process and Trump's vow to keep fighting this issue are not necessarily mutually exclusive -- or at least that administration lawyers are trying to figure out how to square the two.

The discussions and confusion at the White House came a day after a Justice Department Attorney, Kate Bailey, notified plaintiffs challenging the question via email that she could ""confirm that the decision has been made to print the 2020 Decennial Census questionnaire without a citizenship question, and that the printer has been instructed to begin the printing process.""

The Department of Justice later confirmed the question would not be on the census. And Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross issued a statement saying ""The Census Bureau has started the process of printing the decennial questionnaires without the question"" even though he said he disagreed with the Supreme Court ruling.

In addition, during a hearing Tuesday evening, a federal judge asked the Department whether the decision was ""final"" and the Department of Justice said that it was, according to plaintiff's lawyers participating in the call.

In the Maryland hearing, Judge George Hazel instructed the parties to put in writing by next week an agreement on how the census would move forward, according to the plaintiffs in the case, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund.

On Wednesday, the ACLU, a plaintiff in one of the legal challenges, issued a new statement. ""There's nothing fake about the Department of Justice writing us saying printing is starting without the citizenship question,"" ACLU lawyer Sarah Brannon said in a tweet.

After the President sent his tweet Wednesday, Hazel called for a previously unscheduled telephonic hearing in the ongoing case.

""The judge has on his own scheduled this hearing. We received no indication as to the reason. However, we are outraged at Trump's tweet,"" Maldef lawyer Denise Hulett said in a statement.

""The Census Bureau must immediately commit to counteract his statements with the truth -- that the citizenship question will not be on the Census, that that Census Bureau intends to carry out a full and complete count of every single person, and that they are committed to keeping all of the information they receive completely private as required by law,"" Hulett said.

Tuesday night, another lawyer involved in a separate case, expressed some skepticism that the administration's position could change.

""We're happy about the development but want to make sure it is thorough and complete,"" said Thomas Saenz, president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which also challenged the question. He told CNN on Tuesday he was concerned that the administration might find other ways to undermine the count.

The government had initially said that Monday was the deadline to begin printing forms. As late as Monday afternoon, however, the administration asked a federal judge in Maryland for more time to decide how it would proceed following the Supreme Court decision. The outcome was uncertain until Tuesday because the Supreme Court ruling last week that blocked the question from appearing for the time being had left the door open for the administration to present a new rationale.

On the one hand, it is true that the government was facing a daunting timeline. A Census official had testified at trial that extending the deadline to October under the current budget would ""impair the Census Bureau's ability to timely administer the 2020 census"" and that it would only be feasible with ""exceptional resources.""

On top of that, there were collateral legal actions set to occur over the summer in two lower courts that were sure to drag out. US District Court Judge Jesse M. Furman of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York was considering a sanctions motion against the government after a trove of documents surfaced from the files of a deceased redistricting expert raising the question of whether the decision was politically motivated. And Maryland Judge George J. Hazel of the US District Court for the District of Maryland, based on those same files, was set to order deposition and new discovery aimed at learning more about the government's rationale for adding the question.

Still, the decision came as a surprise. Chief Justice John Roberts, in ruling against the government, had not foreclosed the opportunity for the Department of Commerce to come back with a new rationale. Indeed, Trump suggested more than once that the administration was considering delaying the deadline.

Another thing that could have been in play was the testimony of Census Bureau officials that there were other ways to get citizenship data. In a memorandum, Census Bureau official John Abowd recommended that Commerce use existing administrative records — from the Social Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service — instead of adding the question. Ross ultimately chose to do both: Ask the question and compile the administrative records. In May, Abowd said the bureau was operating with the understanding that the administrative records needed to be assembled regardless of whether the courts allowed the question to be included.

In addition, there is another survey that is sent to one out of 36 households that asks the question.

Members of Congress will soon be able to ask questions to officials about the census process once they return from the July 4 recess. Census Bureau director Steven Dillingham has agreed to testify in front of the House Oversight Committee on July 24."
Trump Jr. blasts Nike with photo of Soviet-style shoe design: 'More in line with their views',https://www.foxnews.com,"['Sam Dorman', 'Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News. You Can Follow Him On Facebook']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-jr-blasts-nike-with-communist-shoe-design,"Donald Trump Jr. had a scathing critique of the athletic company Nike after it decided to pull a sneaker bearing a flag used during the American Revolution.

Instead of using that older version of the American flag, Trump Jr. suggested Nike should unveil a communist-style shoe looking similar to the hammer-and-sickle logo of the former Soviet Union.

""If the Betsy Ross Flag, the flag of the American Revolution, is too offensive for Nike to commemorate The 4th of July maybe Nike should go with this... seems to be more in line with their views,"" Trump Jr. tweeted on Wednesday.

His attack came as Nike faced mounting criticism over its decision to halt the release of a shoe that had the Betsy Ross flag because it could ""unintentionally offend"" people.

""NIKE made the decision to halt distribution of the Air Max 1 Quick Strike Fourth of July based on concerns that it could unintentionally offend and detract from the nation’s patriotic holiday,"" the company said in a statement sent to Fox News on Tuesday.

Ex-NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick reportedly played a role in Nike’s decision to pull the sneakers after they'd been sent to retailers. Sources told The Wall Street Journal that Kaepernick said he felt the use of the Betsy Ross flag was offensive, with slavery connotations.

Citing people familiar with the matter, the paper's report stated, “After images of the shoe were posted online, Mr. Kaepernick, a Nike endorser, reached out to company officials saying that he and others felt the Betsy Ross flag is an offensive symbol because of its connection to an era of slavery.”

The company also received criticism from members of Congress like Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who pledged not to buy their products after the incident.

""They’ve now decided their shoes represent snide disdain for the American flag. Since they don’t want my business anymore, I won’t buy any more. Can anyone recommend a good sneaker co that’s not so woke?"" Cruz asked in a tweet on Tuesday.

Military chiefs have concerns about politicization of Trump's July 4th event,https://www.cnn.com,"['Jim Sciutto', 'Nicole Gaouette']",07-03-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/03/politics/military-concerns-trump-july-4th-event/index.html,"The US military is expected to be front and center during Thursday's event, which will showcase a wide variety of weaponry, including M1 Abrams tanks, and has taken on a political hue, with the President, who has already launched his re-election campaign, breaking tradition to deliver a speech and the Republican National Committee distributing tickets in a special VIP area.

Military leaders could be highly visible, as the service chiefs have been asked to stand with Trump during the celebrations, according to a different defense official.

If the President turns what is meant to be celebration into an overtly political event, he could put military personnel in the position of violating Defense Department guidelines prohibiting men and women in uniform from engaging in political activity.

In the planning for the event, Pentagon leaders also had reservations about putting tanks or other armored vehicles on display, the source said.

""Military members may not participate in political campaigns,"" said Jordan Libowitz, communications director for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. ""This is likely the reason why they're hesitant to participate, because the guidelines are pretty clear about what they can and cannot do. If they come to stand next to him for a political speech while in uniform, representing the military, it could become a problem.""

Libowitz points out that if the celebration becomes an overtly political event, there are also laws that come into play. A federal law known as the Hatch Act prohibits government employees and resources from being used for political activity and the Appropriations Act bars government funds from being used for purposes Congress hasn't approved, including publicity of propaganda.

The military chief's private concerns contrast sharply with Trump's claim Tuesday that ""the Pentagon and our great Military Leaders are thrilled"" to be participating in his revamped Fourth of July celebrations, which will also feature ""incredible flyovers,"" fireworks and a speech he'll deliver.

The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Marine Corps Gen. Joseph Dunford, will attend. But Gen. Joseph Lengyel, the chief of the National Guard Bureau, is on an overseas USO tour that was planned since May and Gen. David Goldfein, the chief of staff of the Air Force, is on leave.

Air Force Col. Patrick Ryder, a spokesman for Dunford, said ""the President extended an invitation to the Joint Chiefs and Gen. Dunford to attend the Salute to America event in Washington DC on July 4, which Gen. Dunford has accepted.""

As the final details come together, several chiefs of the individual services are not attending and instead are sending alternates in their place, though some say they had prior plans.

Thomas Crosson, a Pentagon spokesman, said ""it is not unusual for senior leaders to send a representative to functions that they cannot attend due to competing commitments. It is not in a military leader's DNA to task a subordinate to do something that the leader does not want to do.""

A US defense official told CNN the White House also provided 5,000 tickets to the Pentagon.

This is not the first time military leaders have signaled their discomfort with potential politicization of the military in recent weeks. In early June, former acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan issued an internal memo to all Pentagon personnel, service members and civilian employees calling on leaders to ""reinforce the apolitical nature"" of the US military, according to a copy obtained by CNN.

The memo was in response followed reports that the White House Military Office coordinated directly with the Navy's Seventh Fleet to have the USS John S. McCain hidden from view during Trump's visit to Japan. The late senator and Trump sparred often.

Several types of military aircraft are expected to take part in the event, including the new Marine One Presidential VH-92 helicopter, which will be making its debut, a defense official confirmed to CNN.

'The greatest economy'

On Wednesday, Trump tweeted that ""our July 4th Salute to America at the Lincoln Memorial is looking to be really big. It will be the show of a lifetime!""

He continued, stressing themes that are central to his re-election campaign and that could feature in the speech he's expected to deliver from the Lincoln Memorial. ""We have the greatest economy anywhere in the world. We have the greatest military anywhere in the world. Not bad!""

Trump's plans for the event reverse decades of tradition in which the national holiday has been an apolitical affair in which the president has not been involved.

Not only is Trump involved, he has taken over planning and has reportedly been intensely involved in the details, including moving the fireworks from their usual location and expanding them to provide the ""biggest ever Fireworks!"" he declared in a Tuesday tweet.

The cost of our great Salute to America tomorrow will be very little compared to what it is worth. We own the planes, we have the pilots, the airport is right next door (Andrews), all we need is the fuel. We own the tanks and all. Fireworks are donated by two of the greats. Nice! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 3, 2019

Amid criticism of the extra cost to taxpayers to hold the event, Trump also tweeted that ""the cost of our great Salute to America tomorrow will be very little compared to what it is worth.""

He went on to say that ""we own the planes, we have the pilots, the airport is right next door... all we need is the fuel. We own the tanks and all. Fireworks are donated.""

But the President's tweet was misleading on a number of fronts, beginning with the fact that many of the planes will not come from nearby Andrews Air Force Base, but from around the country, according to a defense official.

That official said Navy F-35Cs will be coming from Naval Air Station Lemoore in California, Apache helicopters from Fort Campbell in Kentucky; Blue Angels F/A-18s will fly in from the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida; and a B-2 bomber will be brought from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri.

Other aircraft, including F-22s, VC-25, Ospreys, and two of the F/A-18s, will come from Virginia and Maryland, the official said.

The actual costs

The President's tweet also ignores the additional costs of security, personnel and infrastructure required to put on an event of the size he wants. The clear ballistic armor necessary to protect Trump as he speaks costs $24,000 and the addition of extra metal detectors, Secret Service personnel and barriers necessary for him to speak will ratchet the cost up higher than in previous years.

That is apart from the high costs of the military demonstrations.

The National Park Service will redirect nearly $2.5 million to help cover costs related to the extravaganza, money that is usually ""primarily intended to improve parks across the country,"" The Washington Post reported Tuesday

The paper, which said administration officials ""have consistently refused to say how much"" the event will cost, noted that former National Park Service deputy director Denis P. Galvin said that typically, the July 4 celebration on the mall comes at a cost of about $2 million for the agency.

According to the Post, the $2.5 million redirected by the park service ""represent just a fraction of the extra costs the government faces"" for the event.

Here is the list of attendees as provided by a senior US defense official:

Acting Secretary of Defense Mark Esper

Gen. Joseph Dunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff

Secretary of the Navy, Richard Spencer

Adm. Bob Burke, Vice Chief of Naval Operations

"After nearly two years, State Dept. responds to inquiry over alleged alcohol poisonings of US tourists",https://www.cnn.com,"['Michelle Kosinski', 'Zachary Cohen']",07-03-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/03/politics/state-department-tainted-alcohol-mexico/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Nearly two years after receiving an inquiry from Senate Homeland Security Committee chairman Ron Johnson, the State Department is finally revealing details about its investigation into multiple deaths and illnesses that occurred shortly after Americans drank alcohol at Mexican resorts , CNN has learned.

The response, obtained by CNN, said that two bars were ultimately shut down by Mexican authorities after the State Department pressured them to inspect a number of establishments.

It was sent to Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, last month by the State Department's Office of Inspector General. Johnson first wrote to enquire about the cases involving allegations of tainted alcohol in October 2017.

The timing of the OIG's response coincides with a more recent string of mysterious tourist deaths in the Dominican Republic

In several of those cases, families have alleged that the victims became ill just after consuming alcohol, leading the FBI to look into whether tainted alcohol might be a factor there as well.

While there is no indication of a link between the incidents that occurred in Mexico and the more recent cases in the Dominican Republic, the response to Johnson's 2017 letter highlights several concerns related to the US government's handling of inquires involving American tourists abroad.

Johnson sent his letter to the State Department just months after the death of a 20-year-old woman from Wisconsin named Abbey Conner in January 2017.

She and her brother Austin lost consciousness soon after consuming alcohol at the pool bar in the Iberostar Paraiso del Mar on the first day of their family's vacation. Abbey was found face-down in the shallow end of the pool, nearly drowned, and died days later after being airlifted to a hospital in Florida.

""According to Ms. Connor's family, and other victims who have since come forward, the consumption of allegedly tainted alcohol at Mexican resorts has led to violence, physical abuse and even death,"" Johnson's letter to the State Department states. ""I respectfully ask the Office of the Inspector General to examine how the Department monitors, records and reports overseas incidents involving physical abuse or death after the consumption of potentially tainted alcohol.""

'Formal report would not be appropriate'

Despite prompting a wide-ranging probe into the issue, which included reviewing every complaint made to the State Department about possible bootleg alcohol, interviewing the people involved and significant coordination with the Mexican government, the Inspector General ultimately concluded that a ""formal report would not be appropriate.""

The response explains, ""OIG faced several challenges in completing this review, including the fact that victims often did not report incidents of unregulated alcohol to the department, which significantly limited the number of cases on which OIG could base any generalizable findings,"" it states.

""In addition, OIG's review was complicated by the fact that the guidance for consular personnel who face these types of situations is general and sometimes advisory, mainly because of the complex and variable nature of the incidents themselves.""

However, the lengthy response does detail the inner workings of how this inquiry was handled as a result of pressure on the State Department, and details some of the actions that were taken as a result of the review.

Ultimately, the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs did provide OIG with a list of 15 complaints that it has received since 2017 related to the consumption of unregulated alcohol by Americans in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo, the most visited by tourists from the US.

Two bars shut down

The State Department pressured the Mexican government to inspect 30 bars, restaurants and hotels. Two bars -- including one that served Abbey and Austin Conner -- have been shut down as a result. Raids were conducted by Mexican authorities that did end up finding ""a significant amount of alcohol of 'undetermined origin'"" and led to the identification of one supplier of questionably-sourced alcohol.

Ten thousand gallons of this alcohol was seized -- although according to the OIG, none tested positive for any dangerous substances.

And the State Department's work led to the Mexican government opening an office staffed with bilingual attorneys to help American tourists file police reports.

The response makes no mention, however, of multiple incidents reported in various media outlets that Mexican officials had, in other raids, seized hundreds of gallons of alcohol allegedly tainted with methanol, a toxic form of alcohol that is used in fuel, antifreeze, windshield wiper fluid and solvents. It can cause blindness and death.

Those findings are included in the Conner family's wrongful death lawsuit against Iberostar, filed last year.

The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, which has reported extensively on the Mexican cases, reports that it has heard from more than 200 people who believe they encountered tainted alcohol in Mexico, and the paper cites a 2017 Mexican government-spearheaded study that found that as much as 36% of all alcohol consumed throughout Mexico is produced illegally and unregulated.

The OIG's response did detail some of the difficulties American families of victims faced in getting help from the State Department while in Mexico, which some families described as ""insensitive,"" ""bureaucratic,"" or virtually nonexistent. At times families were told by State officials that they could not help them navigate the Mexican law enforcement or healthcare process.

The family of one woman who died was told the State Department couldn't help them at all submitting a police report when the Mexican government refused to let them file one.

In one case, a man had to wait until the next day for assistance filing a police report, despite reporting he was drugged and sexually assaulted after drinking tainted alcohol.

Yet despite recording the summaries of various reported cases, OIG did not express an opinion as to whether extensive handling of alleged cases of tainted alcohol in Mexico falls under the State Department's area of responsibility.

""OIG cannot draw definitive conclusions about any individual consular officer's compliance with Department policies in these cases,"" their response to Johnson's letter says, since State Department guidance on this issue remains vague.

An official with the inspector general's office told CNN their investigation is now closed.

""We were really limited by our jurisdiction, in what we could look at,"" the official said. ""We mostly had to focus on the actions of the State Department. And it did put a lot of pressure on the Mexican government to do thorough inspections.""

The official said the Mexican government was receptive to the US's urgings to do something about‎ the problem, but added, ""Mexico doesn't want to lose tourist dollars. It's a huge source of revenue.""

Gary Davidson, an attorney for the family of Abbey Conner, continues to seek answers and compensation for the family's loss. ""There is basically homemade liquor down there, circulating in the community of hotels -- and a lot of the hotels are buying it,"" he told CNN."
Acting DHS chief launches probe into 'disturbing & inexcusable' Border Patrol social media posts,https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mcaleenan-launches-probe-into-disturbing-inexcusable-border-patrol-social-media-posts,"Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said Wednesday that he has launched an “immediate investigation” into what he called “disturbing & inexcusable” social media posts from Border Patrol agents that purportedly included graphic and vulgar jokes about Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.

“Reporting this week highlighted disturbing & inexcusable social media activity that allegedly includes active Border Patrol personnel,” McAleenan said in a statement on Twitter. “These statements are completely unacceptable, especially if made by those sworn to uphold the @DHSgov mission, our values & standards of conduct.”

OCASIO-CORTEZ ACCUSES BORDER OFFICERS OF 'VIOLENT CULTURE' AFTER REPORT ON GRAPHIC FACEBOOK POSTS

“I have directed an immediate investigation, and as the @USBPChief has made clear, any employee found to have compromised the public’s trust in our law enforcement mission will be held accountable. They do not represent the men and women of the Border Patrol or @DHSgov.”

The website ProPublica posted a story Monday headlined “Inside the Secret Border Patrol Facebook Group Where Agents Joke About Migrant Deaths and Post Sexist Memes.” In addition to showing indifference toward the deaths of migrants, members made vulgar jokes about Ocasio-Cortez and other members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus ahead of their visit a Border Patrol facility in Texas on Monday, the story said.

In one post reported by ProPublica, a group member referenced the visits by Democrats and encouraged an officer to throw a “burrito at these b-----s.” Other posts included a vile, fake photo illustration of Ocasio-Cortez engaged in oral sex with President Trump.

Ocasio-Cortez blasted what she described as a “violent culture” within Border Patrol.

“They’re threatening violence on members of Congress,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. “How do you think they’re treating caged children+families?”

Matthew Klein, the assistant commissioner of the CBP’s Office of Professional Responsibility, said the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general opened its own investigation on Monday.

""Today, U.S. Customs and Border Protection was made aware of disturbing social media activity hosted on a private Facebook group that may include a number of CBP employees,"" Klein said. ""CBP immediately informed DHS Office of the Inspector General and initiated an investigation.""

The inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, told House committee leaders that he is initiating a review of actions at the DOJ and FBI that led to the canceling of the plans in favor of building a smaller replacement for the J. Edgar Hoover Building downtown and dispersing other FBI staff elsewhere.

The review could produce new revelations about the Trump administration’s stunning reversal of bipartisan plans for the development of a new, highly secure campus that would have gotten the bureau out of the fast-deteriorating Hoover building.

Democratic leaders of two committees, Elijah E. Cummings (Md.) and Gerald E. Connolly (Va.) of the Oversight Committee and Peter A. DeFazio (Ore.) and Dina Titus (Nev.) of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, have pressed Horowitz to investigate. They redoubled their efforts after the head of the General Services Administration was found by her agency’s inspector general to have made potentially misleading comments to Congress about the White House’s involvement in the decision-making.

Democrats allege that Trump used the decision to put his own financial interests ahead of the needs of the FBI and taxpayers, which administration officials deny. The GSA is the landlord to Trump’s D.C. hotel, located just down the street from the Hoover building, and redeveloping the Hoover site could introduce a new hotel competitor. Trump also told The Washington Post before running for office that he was considering bidding for the FBI project as well.

Under Trump, the FBI and GSA have both resisted responding to document requests made by Democrats on the Hill, though in a statement GSA officials said the agency “has produced more than 90,000 pages in response to respective Congressional Committee requests on FBI and the Old Post Office building since 2017.”

In a statement, the House committee leaders said: “For months, our Committees have investigated the Administration’s sudden change of heart on a federal property across the street from the President’s namesake hotel, but because the FBI has withheld key decision-making documents from Congress, we have been left with many unanswered questions,”

In April testimony to Congress, FBI Director Christopher A. Wray defended the decision to keep the headquarters in downtown Washington and reaffirmed it as his preference. “It is absolutely the FBI’s view, the FBI’s choice, the FBI’s preference to build a new building . . . at our current location,” he said.

For a decade before Trump’s election, the FBI had been working with the GSA and Congress on the suburban headquarters plan. Citing security concerns with staying downtown and lack of large development sites nearby, the FBI and GSA pursued large plots of land near the Capital Beltway and suburban Metro stations, ultimately narrowing its search to sites in Greenbelt and Landover in Maryland and Springfield, Va.

But six months into the Trump administration, the FBI and GSA ditched those plans and then last year announced they preferred to keep a smaller downtown headquarters and move 2,300 headquarters staff members out of the Washington area altogether — to Alabama, Idaho and West Virginia.

GSA chief Emily Murphy testified that Wray — not Trump or a White House official — asked that the FBI remain downtown if possible, downplaying any White House role in the decision-making.

The FBI backed her assertion, but the inspector general found that Murphy’s testimony was incomplete and possibly misleading about the White House’s involvement, including an Oval Office meeting with Trump about the project that she omitted. Murphy denied misleading Congress, maintaining that the decision about where to put the FBI was made before that meeting.

The GSA maintains that the government could see cost savings under the new plan, but federal real estate experts have said the government’s expectations of cost savings weren’t likely to come true based on unrealistic expectations on the administration’s part about how little its plan will cost. The GSA inspector general found that the Trump administration plan could cost hundreds of millions of dollars more and accommodate 2,300 fewer employees.

Correction: This story has been updated to correctly characterize the GSA inspector general’s findings about Emily Murphy’s testimony. The IG found that her comments may have been misleading but did not conclude that she actively misled Congress."

Opinion writer

The Post reports:

The decision to back away from the controversial question was a victory for civil rights advocates concerned that the query would lead to an inaccurate count of immigrant communities that could skew representation and federal funding.

This result was essentially a foregone conclusion to years of litigation as soon as the Supreme Court, in a 5-to-4 opinion written by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. held that the administration had given a pretextual reason for including the citizenship question that did not match the facts. In non-lawyer-speak, the Trump administration lied about its intent to compile a deliberately inaccurate census designed to undercut nonwhites and to bolster the political fortunes of the GOP and white voters. When Roberts ordered the lower court to find a nonpretextual reason, he and the other justices ran out the clock, knowing printing of the 2020 Census needed to begin almost immediately.

The administration’s capitulation saves it from a review of newly discovered documents in a case out of Maryland confirming plaintiffs’ suspicions that “the government was guilty of conspiracy and intent to discriminate.” The Post reported, “Files discovered on hard drives belonging to a deceased Republican redistricting strategist suggested he had communicated with the Trump administration about how to get the citizenship question onto the survey and that the strategist had determined that adding the question would create an electoral advantage for Republicans and non-Hispanic whites. In his ruling Tuesday, [U.S. District Court Judge George J.] Hazel wrote that the plaintiffs’ motion ‘raises a substantial issue’ in the case.”

News reports suggest that the government has committed to drop the question for good and to not try introducing it at some later date: “Before Judge Hazel in Maryland, DOJ confirmed that the decision is final. Judge Hazel pressed them on it, specifically asking for assurance that they wouldn’t print now and revisit later and that the decision is ‘once and for all,’ and DOJ lawyer said ‘correct.’ ”

Minority Leader Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) reveled in the news that the administration had thrown in the towel. “The exclusion of the citizenship question from the census is a victory for our democracy and for fair representation of all communities in this country,” Schumer said in a written statement. “The Trump administration’s politically-motivated efforts to undermine the Constitution in this instance were so reprehensible that even the conservative Supreme Court couldn’t let them get away with it.” He vowed, “Democrats in Congress will be watching the Trump administration like a hawk to ensure there is no wrong-doing throughout this process and that every single person is counted.”

The census helps to allocate billions of federal dollars, to determine a range of policies and to calculate the number of House representatives (and hence the electoral college count) for each state. Instead of an intentionally misleading count, we now have the potential for a fair, accurate count.

This is an extraordinary, complete victory for groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union. The ACLU crowed in tweets, “The Trump administration’s attempt to politicize and manipulate this fundamental pillar of our democracy has failed. Our communities will be counted.” The tweets continued: “This ruling is a victory for immigrants and communities of color across America. It is a victory for democracy itself. Everyone MUST come together to make sure that the 2020 census counts every person.”

It speaks volumes that today’s Republican Party relies on anti-democratic tactics such as devising a census to undercount minorities, perpetuating gerrymandering, purging voter rolls, enacting voter ID laws and limiting access to the polls in nonwhite areas to maintain its grip on political power.

The decision is noteworthy insofar as the administration’s lack of legitimate legal defenses doesn’t stop it from litigating unmeritorious claims, whether it is retaliation against sanctuary cities, unilateral changes in immigration law or presidential defiance of Congress in swiping funds from the Defense Department for a border fence. They’ll try any claim, present any scenario regardless of the facts that get its way. We are fortunate that the federal judiciary, with notable exceptions (the third version of the Muslim ban, the gerrymandering case), has rejected the administration’s shenanigans and upheld the rule of law. That line of defense has been and will continue to be critical in restraining a lawless president.

"Obama DHS chief blasts Dems’ ‘open borders’ push, warns migration would explode",https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/obama-dhs-chief-blasts-dems-open-borders-push-warns-migration-would-explode,"An Obama-era Department of Homeland Security chief is warning Democratic presidential candidates to cool their push to decriminalize illegal border crossings, saying such a move would be tantamount to “open borders” policy and lead to hundreds of thousands more people flooding into the U.S. every month.

“That is tantamount to declaring publicly that we have open borders,” Jeh Johnson told The Washington Post.

DHS ACTING CHIEF PREDICTS UP TO 25 PERCENT DROP IN BORDER CROSSINGS AFTER NEW MEXICO AGREEMENT

“That is unworkable, unwise and does not have the support of a majority of American people or the Congress, and if we had such a policy, instead of 100,000 apprehensions a month, it will be multiples of that,” he said.

In May, authorities apprehended or encountered more than 144,000 border crossers, representing a stunning increase over the past several months. Current acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan said Friday that he anticipates the numbers decreased in June, amid new efforts to crack down both at the U.S.-Mexico border and Mexico's border with Central America.

Johnson’s warning that any gains could be reversed comes as 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls have lurched to the left on immigration, calling for health care for illegal immigrants and scrapping certain immigration enforcement measures.

At a Thursday night primary debate in Miami, candidates making up about half the field were asked if they support making crossing the border a civil, rather than a criminal, offense. Almost all the candidates, including former Obama Vice President Joe Biden, raised their hands.

The moment demonstrated how a once-fringe policy, pushed earlier this year by former Housing Secretary Julian Castro, has become mainstream among Democrats. Just days before the debate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., came out in favor of such a proposal.

OBAMA'S IMMIGRATION CHIEFS SPEAK OUT ON 'CRISIS' AT SOUTHERN BORDER

However, Castro on Thursday denied he supported open borders.

“Open borders is just a right-wing talking point,” he said. “It doesn’t matter what Democrats do on immigration.”

Since then Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J. announced on Tuesday a plan to “virtually eliminate immigration detention.”

“Without waiting for Congress to act, Cory will stop the treatment of immigrants as criminals, close inhumane DHS facilities, end the use of for-profit detention facilities and end unnecessary barriers for refugees and those seeking asylum to virtually eliminate immigrant detention,” a press release said.

Johnson, meanwhile, has also pushed back on the controversy surrounding the Trump administration's use of detention centers for migrants. On Friday, he said that chain link fences or ""cages"" weren't ideal, but were one of the ways authorities are forced to cope with the surge of migrants crossing the border, and that the alternative was putting them ""on the streets.""

""Chain link barriers, partitions, fences, cages -- whatever you want to call them -- were not invented on January 2017,"" Johnson said.

DOJ inspector general completed FISA abuse investigation: GOP congressman,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-inspector-general-completed-fisa-abuse-investigation-gop-congressman,"The Justice Department inspector general's investigation of potential abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is complete, a Republican congressman said, though a report on its findings might not be released for a month.

House Judiciary Committee member John Ratcliffe of Texas said Monday he’d met with DOJ watchdog Michael Horowitz about his FISA abuse report last week. Ratcliffe said in a Fox News interview they’d discussed the timing, but not the content of his report and Horowitz “related that his team’s investigative work is complete and they’re now in the process of drafting that report.”

“I would expect that a draft of that would be completed in short order,” Ratcliffe said.

The DOJ inspector general’s investigation, launched in March 2018, has centered on whether the FBI and DOJ filing of four FISA applications and renewals beginning in October 2016 to surveil former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page was abuse of the FISA process. The applications relied heavily upon an unverified dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele, who was hired by Fusion GPS. The opposition research firm was hired by Marc Elias of the Perkins Coie law firm at the behest of the Clinton presidential campaign.

Ratcliffe said he was doubtful that Horowitz’s report would be made available to the public or the Congress anytime soon.

“He did relay that as much as 20% of his report is going to include classified information, so that draft report will have to undergo a classification review at the FBI and at the Department of Justice,” Ratcliffe said. “So, while I’m hopeful that we members of Congress might see it before the August recess, I’m not too certain about that.”

Horowitz’s last high-profile probe, which looked into the handling of the Clinton email investigation by the DOJ and FBI, resulted in a 568-page tome released in June 2018.

Ratcliffe said Monday that he believed Horowitz’s findings will be significant and that the report likely presents a problem for Democrats.

“Right now we already know Bob Mueller — Bob Mueller has told us — that a Democratic administration started an investigation into a conspiracy with Russia that didn’t exist. That’s bad enough. It would be a whole lot worse if it turns out that that same Democratic administration continued that investigation by breaking rules at the FISA Court,” Ratcliffe said.

Ratcliffe said that if Horowitz concludes that the FISA process was indeed abused then “you can pretty much put a pin in any impeachment balloon, because it’d be hard for the Democrats to say that they started an investigation that they shouldn’t have, and that they continued it by breaking the rules, but they want to impeach a president for trying to obstruct that investigation that never should’ve started.”

Horowitz had reportedly been “homing in” on Steele for months, and sources close to Steele expressed his willingness to meet with Horowitz in June.

It's not just Republican members of Congress who have cast doubt on Steele's dossier. Watergate journalist Bob Woodward has been calling it “garbage” for more than two years, and former CIA Moscow station chief Daniel Hoffman told the Washington Examiner that “I called what bullshit the dossier was a year and a half ago … It’s likely FSB [the successor agency to the KGB] disinformation.”

A number of Steele’s biggest claims — including the allegation stemming from “Kremlin insiders” that former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen had met in Prague with Putin associates and foreign hackers — were knocked down by special counsel Robert Mueller's report.

Horowitz had reportedly been “homing in” on Steele for months, and sources close to Steele expressed his willingness to meet with Horowitz in June.

Other possible targets of the DOJ inspector general inquiry likely included the approvers and signers of the four FISA warrant applications and renewals from October 2016 through June 2017, including former FBI Director James Comey, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and the former Acting Attorney General and now current FBI General Counsel Dana Boente, the only signer of a Page FISA application who is still in office.

A federal lawsuit was recently filed by a conservative legal group to attempt to compel the Federal Elections Commission to rule on allegations that the Clinton campaign and the DNC broke campaign rules by allegedly hiding payments that were made to Fusion GPS."
DOJ says citizenship question being dropped from 2020 Census: NY attorney general's office,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-says-citizenship-question-being-dropped-from-2020-census-ny-attorney-generals-office,"The New York attorney general’s office said Tuesday the Justice Department has decided to print the 2020 Census without the citizenship question sought by the Trump administration, ending a contentious legal dispute over an issue that could soon affect the makeup of Congress and the Electoral College.

The Supreme Court ruled last week that the question couldn't be added for now, but left open the possibility that additional arguments could change its mind. Civil rights groups argued that the Trump administration's reasons for including the question were merely pretextual efforts to discourage illegal immigrants from responding to the Census.

Population counts from the Census are used to apportion House seats among the 50 states, and a new electoral map based on the Census will be in effect for the 2024 presidential election. States receive votes in the Electoral College equal to the number of members in their congressional delegation, counting both House and Senate seats.

In a tweet on Monday, Daniel Jacobson, who worked in the White House Counsel’s Office under President Obama, said a trial attorney at the Justice Department told him that ""the printer has been instructed to begin the printing process"" without the citizenship question.

""We won,"" Jacobson wrote.

In a statement to Fox News, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross tied the decision to the Supreme Court's ruling.

“I respect the Supreme Court but strongly disagree with its ruling regarding my decision to reinstate a citizenship question on the 2020 Census,"" Ross said. ""The Census Bureau has started the process of printing the decennial questionnaires without the question. My focus, and that of the Bureau and the entire Department is to conduct a complete and accurate census.”

For his part, House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., issued a less-than-celebratory statement calling for answers, even as he praised the decision to scrap the citizenship question.

""I am encouraged that Administration officials dropped President Trump’s unconstitutional plan to postpone the Census just because he lost the Supreme Court case,"" Cummings said. ""The Trump Administration put our country through more than a year of wasted time and squandered resources—all in the service of an illegal attempt to add a discriminatory question based on a pretext.""

Cummings continued: ""The Attorney General and the Secretary of Commerce must now turn over all of the documents our Committee has subpoenaed on a bipartisan basis.""

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y, added, ""The exclusion of the citizenship question from the census is a victory for our democracy and for fair representation of all communities in this country.""

President Trump had tweeted that he had asked lawyers if the count can be delayed until the Supreme Court can reevaluate the matter, based on additional evidence supporting the administration's justifications for adding the citizenship question.

The Supreme Court, in its ruling last week, did not prohibit a citizenship question out of hand but dismissed the administration's provided rationale as insufficient.

However, Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, told Fox News on Tuesday that the Supreme Court was unlikely to change its mind. Clarke's team successfully challenged the Trump administration on the use of the citizenship question in federal court in California, and was one of several groups to bring such lawsuits.

“The Supreme Court’s ruling left little opportunity for the administration to cure the defects with its decision to add a citizenship question and, most importantly, they were simply out of time given the impending deadline for printing forms,"" Clarke said.

Experts agreed that any delay could gum up the U.S. Census Bureau's finely calibrated timetable for the 10-year count. Monday was the deadline to start printing the 600 million documents that will be mailed to 130 million households for next April's census count.

CAL THOMAS: CENSORING THE CENSUS IS ABOUT POLITICS, NOT THE LAW

For months, the Trump administration had argued that the courts needed to decide quickly whether the citizenship question could be added to the 2020 census because of the looming deadline.

""I think it's very important to find out if somebody is a citizen as opposed to an illegal,"" Trump told reporters Monday. ""There's a big difference to me between being a citizen of the United States and being an illegal.""

Former President Barack Obama's administration didn't ask the citizenship question in the 2010 census. The citizenship question was last asked on the census in 1950, but beginning in 1970, a citizenship question was asked in a long-form questionnaire sent to a relatively small number of households, alongside the main census. In 2010, there was no long-form questionnaire.

""There is no credible argument to be made that asking about citizenship subverts the Constitution and federal law,"" Chapman University law professor and constitutional law expert John Eastman told Fox News.

From a logistical standpoint, any delay ""would be a nightmare,"" said John Thompson, who served as Census Bureau director during Obama's second term.

The bureau already has been in the process of signing almost 250 office leases across the U.S. and has hired 1,500 specialists partnering with community organizations to encourage people to participate in the census. More than 170,000 recruits already have filled out applications for the almost half-million positions being created for the count. The bureau has helped set up more than 1,500 committees nationwide working to get everyone to respond.

Furthermore, Congress would have to change the law for the count to be delayed because Title 13 of the U.S. Code mandates that it take place on April 1, 2020, Thompson said.

""I don't think there's any ambiguity, but I'm not a lawyer,"" Thompson said.

Fewer people are expected to fill out the questionnaires using paper than in years past because the bureau for the first time is relying on most respondents to use the Internet to answer questions. Still, printed postcards and letters are to be sent out next March reminding residents it's time to answer the questionnaire, and those who don't respond digitally are expected to be mailed paper questionnaires.

As recently as last week, the Trump administration's solicitor general wrote in court papers that the Census Bureau needed to finalize the questions by June. Any changes to the paper questionnaire after June would impair the bureau's ability to conduct the count in a timely manner, wrote the solicitor general, Noel Francisco.

More than two dozen Democrats in the U.S. Senate last week sent a letter urging Ross to drop any further pursuit of the citizenship question because it would delay the bureau's ability to conduct the count.

""The 2020 Census is less than half a year away, and any unnecessary delay in operations would impact the ability of the Census Bureau to count every person in our country,"" the letter read.

This past May, Montana Republican Sen. Steve Daines introduced legislation that would require the census to include a citizenship question.

That's why I'm introducing this bill to require a citizenship question on the census - and ensure that states harboring millions of illegal immigrants are not rewarded with additional taxpayer dollars.""

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., sued Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig to obtain six years of President Trump's tax returns.

The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., is the latest step in a months-long battle with the Trump administration over the president's tax records. Democrats want the court to enforce a subpoena requesting the returns.

Mnuchin rejected the subpoena in May, citing guidance from the Department of Justice. At the time Mnuchin said the request lacked a ""legitimate legislative purpose.""

Democrats argue in the court filing that the committee has the right to access Trump's private tax information under Section 6103 of the U.S. tax code, which says, ""Treasury 'shall furnish' the Committee with 'any' requested tax return information"" from any U.S. citizen, including the president.

The filing states that the law was ""intended to provide the Committee with unfettered access to tax return information necessary to carry out its broad mandate to oversee Treasury, the IRS, and the Nation's tax laws. ""

Committee Republicans have sided with Mnuchin, calling the request baseless and dangerous. Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, the top Republican on Ways and Means, also said the lawsuit is motivated by partisanship and circumvents the usual committee process for requesting taxpayer information.

""The Democrats' partisan, flawed lawsuit continues their unprecedented and illegitimate pursuit to expose President Trump's private tax information,"" Brady said in a statement. ""This is a dangerous course of action.""

But many Democrats, including committee member Bill Pascrell, D-N.J., cheered the lawsuit as the next logical step in the effort to reveal details of Trump's business dealings both as a candidate and while in office.

""We are here today because Donald Trump and his enablers have sneered at our laws and avoided the thinnest accountability for their corruption,"" Pascrell said in a statement. ""The Ways and Means Committee must file this action to stand for rule of law."""
Bipartisan bill aims to stop child pornography trafficking on Defense Department's network,https://www.cnn.com,['Anna Laffrey'],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/02/politics/house-bill-defense-department-network-child-pornography/index.html,"Washington (CNN) A bipartisan group of lawmakers on Tuesday introduced a bill that would crack down on the use of the Department of Defense internet network for trafficking child pornography.

US Immigration and Customs Enforcement identified over 5,000 individuals, several of whom are affiliated with the Defense Department, who subscribe to child pornography websites in an investigation called ""Project Flicker."" A subsequent inquiry by the Defense Criminal Investigative Service tagged hundreds of Defense Department affiliates as suspects in child pornography cases, according to a news release.

The bill, introduced by Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a Virginia Democrat, and Rep. Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican, would help the Defense Department stamp out use of its computers and network to access and share child pornography. The legislation would bolster training, improve technical capacities and require collaboration with both law enforcement and social service providers.

Spanberger, a former federal agent who worked on child exploitation and child pornography cases, called the abuse and exploitation of children through pornography ""horrific crimes.""

""The notion that the Department of Defense's network and Pentagon-issued computers may be used to view, create, or circulate such horrifying images is a shameful disgrace, and one we must fight head on,"" Spanberger said in a statement.

President Trump has a history of treating nonpolitical events like they're campaign rallies, especially if there is a large crowd on hand. His Fourth of July speech from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial will be just such a setting.

A White House official who declined to be named said the speech will be about celebrating America, the flag and members of the military — not political. But all assurances about what Trump will say or do need to be taken with a grain of salt.

Asked Monday whether he thought he ""can give a speech that can reach all Americans,"" Trump said yes, he thought he could. But 17 seconds into answering the question, the president launched into an attack on Democrats, whose ideas for health care would ""destroy the country.""

Even before he utters a single word, Trump's decision to deliver a speech on the National Mall on the Fourth of July injects a political figure (and a deeply polarizing one at that) into what has traditionally been a day where presidents have stayed away.

A political speech could also cause legal problems for the Trump administration. Walter Shaub, a former head of the Office of Government Ethics and now with Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, wrote that Trump's event could quickly fall afoul of ethics laws and laws preventing the spending of government resources for political purposes if Trump or others on the stage start attacking Democrats or talking about his reelection campaign.

'Against The Grain Of History'

In the past, many presidents have skipped town. Others laid low.

The last U.S. president to speak on the National Mall on the Fourth of July was Harry Truman in 1951, marking the 175th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.

Richard Nixon was in California in 1970 when some of his allies hosted an ""Honor America Day"" on the Mall for the Fourth of July. Nixon had a video message piped in to those gathered. There were protests, and the whole thing ended in a cloud of tear gas.

And that's it. Until Trump.

""President Trump is going against the grain of history, what the Fourth of July has meant in the past,"" said Patrick Maney, a presidential historian at Boston College.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Maney said, the Fourth of July was the one day of the year when people in rural areas would be sure to come into town centers to gather and even listen to local politicians.

""It brought people together in a way that no other holiday even including Christmas did,"" said Maney.

This community focus continues to this day, with small parades and fireworks displays at local parks and schools all over America. In short, Independence Day has never really been about Washington, D.C., or the president of the United States.

The Vision

Inspired by Bastille Day celebrations in France, President Trump wants a big display of American military might, complete with military bands, military jet flyovers and tanks, which will be stationary owing to the risk of damaging streets and grass.

There will also be fireworks, which both Trump and the companies donating the pyrotechnics say will be the biggest display in Washington, D.C., ever — even bigger than the bicentennial (where, incidentally, President Gerald Ford didn't speak).

All of this is tacked on to the traditional Fourth of July fireworks display and symphony performance that have been happening on the Mall every year for decades and will proceed.

Looking To D-Day As An Example

It would be a mistake for Trump to deliver partisan remarks on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, says Barry Bennett, a Republican consultant who worked on the Trump campaign in 2016.

""I hope it doesn't turn into a political rally,"" Bennett said. ""I don't think it will. I think that his vision is that it is a 'celebrate America' speech.""

Bennett points to the remarks Trump delivered in Normandy last month to mark the D-Day anniversary. Trump kept to the script, using soaring language to describe the heroism of those who fought in World War II.

""And I hope that they replicate that for the Fourth of July,"" Bennett said.

Though, minutes before the D-Day speech, with lines of headstones in the shot behind him, Trump did a TV interview in which he hit Democrats and called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi a ""disaster.""

Past Politicization

Whatever the White House's intentions, there's a fairly long list of times when a nonpartisan or nonpolitical event took a turn with Trump at the microphone. Here are a few:

July 1, 2017: Celebrate Freedom Rally

The event at the Kennedy Center leading into Independence Day was described as a salute to America's veterans.

""For my very first Independence Day celebration as president, there is no place I'd rather be than with you,"" Trump told the supportive crowd.

But before long, the message of appreciation had moved on to an attack on the media.

""The fake media is trying to silence us but we will not let them,"" Trump said. ""The fake media tried to stop us from going to the White House, but I'm president and they're not. We won, and they lost.""

White House via YouTube

July 24, 2017: National Scout Jamboree

Early in his speech to thousands of Boy Scouts gathered for their annual jamboree, Trump asked, ""Who the hell wants to speak about politics when I'm in front of the Boy Scouts, right?""

He answered his own question. Trump talked about politics at length, including his efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and his big win on election night 2016.

""We won Florida. We won South Carolina. We won North Carolina we won Pennsylvania. We won and won,"" Trump said as part of a lengthy riff.

Trump also told an off-color story about a friend of his from New York.

The Boy Scouts quickly apologized, insisting their organization is ""wholly non-partisan.""

Presidents don't bring politics to the troops, especially when they are deployed overseas. It is a long-standing norm that Trump violated in a big way in his only visit as president with troops deployed in a combat zone. Trump's visit came in the midst of a government shutdown over his desire for funding to build a border wall, which he brought up in remarks before uniformed troops.

""You know, when you think about it, you're fighting for borders in other countries and they don't want to fight — the Democrats for the border of our country,"" Trump said. ""Doesn't make a lot of sense."""
Dems step up oversight amid detention center firestorm,https://www.politico.com,['Sarah Ferris'],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/02/democrats-summon-dhs-leaders-1395859,"The House Oversight Committee, chaired by Rep. Elijah Cummings, is demanding acting DHS head Kevin McAleenan to appear before the panel. | Alex Wong/Getty Images congress Dems step up oversight amid detention center firestorm Elijah Cummings is summoning top DHS leaders to testify, including the acting head of DHS.

Top House Democrats are escalating their response to Donald Trump’s handling of the migrant crisis at the border, making a direct plea to the president to improve conditions and ramping up their oversight of agencies at the center of a growing political firestorm.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi wrote to Trump this week urging his administration to guarantee certain standards — like water, hygiene and sanitation — for detained migrants, just days after losing a legislative battle with Senate Republicans over those same protections. The letter comes after a 14-minute call with the president on Friday, according to an aide.

Story Continued Below

Pelosi also sent a ""Dear Colleague"" letter on Tuesday to mobilize her caucus on the issue of border detention facilities, writing, ""Every day that goes by, we have even greater cause for concern and urgency to enact the protections for children and families.""

And on Tuesday, a key House committee summoned a pair of top officials from the Department of Homeland Security to testify on Capitol Hill amid a slew of political crises, including new photos of ""dangerous overcrowding"" in U.S. facilities and a secret Facebook group in which some agents mocked dead migrants.

The House Oversight Committee is demanding to hear from the acting head of DHS, Kevin McAleenan, who has been at the forefront of the White House’s response to the recent surge of migrants at the border.

McAleenan's handling of the border crisis drew further criticism on Tuesday, after a damning inspector general’s report found “dangerous overcrowding” and “prolonged detention of children” in a facility in Texas.

Democrats also summoned Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, which has been consumed this week with another scandal — a Facebook group with thousands of current and former agents posting racist and sexist images of Democratic lawmakers and making fun of a recent photo of a father and daughter who were found drowned in the Rio Grande.

Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings said on Tuesday that he plans to investigate the matter, and sent a letter to Facebook officials requesting all posts and comments — as well as deleted content — from the 3-year-old Facebook group.

Democrats first issued invitations to McAleenan and Morgan last week, according to the committee. But it’s not clear that either will respond willingly, as neither has confirmed attendance.

The committee has given both officials until Wednesday to respond to its request for testimony. Though Cummings has not threatened to subpoena them if they refuse to confirm their attendance, he has shown that he's willing to attempt to compel testimony if witnesses snub his panel. Last week, Cummings subpoenaed Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway for refusing to appear at a hearing about her alleged violations of the Hatch Act.

Democrats announced the hearing, which is scheduled for July 12, at the same time they released a damning inspector general’s report that found “dangerous overcrowding” and “prolonged detention of children.”

Among the findings is a disturbing photo that shows mothers and young children packed into tight rooms in a Rio Grande Valley detention center, where they appeared to sleep on concrete floors.

Cummings described the Trump administration's response at the border as “open contempt for the rule of law and for basic human decency.”

“The Trump Administration’s actions at the southern border are grotesque and dehumanizing,” the Maryland Democrat wrote in a release announcing the hearing. “The Committee needs to hear directly from the heads of these agencies as soon as possible in light of the almost daily reports of abuse and defiance.”

The Congressional Hispanic Caucus reacted with fury to the inspector generals’ findings on Tuesday, describing the 16-page report as full of “egregious violations” of human rights, such as denying migrants’ access to showers and hot meals.

The report also found that 165 children had been in custody of the border patrol agency longer than a week — far above the 72-hour court mandated limit.

House Democratic leaders have sought an aggressive response to the border crisis, seeking new conditions to strengthen oversight of the Trump administration.

But an emergency aid package signed into law this week largely ignored those requests, which were demanded by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and progressive leaders. Instead, the White House agreed to certain administrative changes that would, for example, require officials to notify Congress when a child has died in custody.

Correspondence shows how climate change deniers got into EPA fuel economy rollback fight,https://electrek.co,"['Renogy Watts Volts Monocrystalline Solar Starter Kit', 'Chargepoint Home Wifi Enabled Electric Vehicle', 'Ev']",07-03-2019,2019,7,https://electrek.co/2019/07/03/climate-change-deniers-epa/,"In the ongoing saga of the Trump administration’s efforts to roll back fuel economy standards, it’s been known that automakers sought to ease the rising MPG requirements set by the Obama administration. But a new report reveals how a number of climate change deniers injected themselves into the conversation, pushing the administration to go “much further” than planned.

Recently released government emails show how these deniers even went so far as to call automakers “the opposition,” according to a new report from the New York Times.

Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute — described by the Times as “a free-market think tank in Washington that disputes that climate change is a problem” — did just that in a May 2018 email to an EPA official, among others.

Ebell, who leads the climate change-denying “Cooler Heads Coalition,” wrote that the administration should stick to the rollback. He was also, unsurprisingly, selected to lead the Trump administration’s EPA transition team in 2016.

As the administration finalizes its plan to roll back fuel economy standards, the automakers are concerned about a “split market” between California and states which plan to follow higher standards, and the other states. Last month, 17 automakers wrote a letter asking to stop the planned rollback.

Prior to that, in a letter sent to Trump this May, Ebell and his group wrote about the automakers’ pushback. From the Times:

“Their main concern is the expected legal battle with California,” they wrote. “In fact, what many liberal California politicians really want to do is ban gasoline-powered cars altogether.” Their letter went on to say: “You should dismiss this concern. We agree that in an ideal world, California would negotiate with you in good faith, but we all know that is not a reality in this current political climate.”

The administration still hasn’t shown any signs of pulling back.

As National Highway Traffic Safety Administration deputy administrator Heidi King simply told the Times, “In my experience, these rules tend to go to the courts regardless.” The NHTSA is making the new rules in conjunction with the EPA.

The Times also notes how another conservative group, American Commitment, generated “almost 1,600 public comments in support of the rollback, or 13 percent of the 12,000 comments received and posted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.”

Many of these particular comments came with the same boilerplate language accusing Obama and California as wanting to ban the internal combustion engine, and so forth.

Even the oil companies seem to want no part of these efforts. BP sent a letter to EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler in June that found the oil giant siding with the automakers, asking the administration to focus on improving fuel economy, the Times said.

Electrek’s Take

As unsurprising as any of this might be to anyone who’s been following what’s going on with the fuel economy rollback — or with the current EPA and administration in general — it’s still gross beyond belief. A group of people that has absolutely no business even being involved in these decisions instead has an incredible amount of influence.

We’ve reached a point where even BP — BP! — is pushing back against the administration’s efforts.

Automakers are still not without blame in their role here. Not by a long shot, not at all. They’re the ones who opened this Pandora’s box and pushed the EPA to reduce emissions standards the first chance they got.

But now, at this point in time, it seems clear that if it were just a discussion between automakers that have realized the error of their ways and an administration that actually cared about listening to their concerns about what might happen to the market… or an EPA that cared about reducing emissions… or improving the environment… things could be at least a little different. There could be some sort of “compromise,” at a minimum.

But it’s not.

If you’re looking for a glimmer of hope on this, look to King’s quote about how “these rules tend to go to the courts regardless.” California and 17 other states already filed suit against the EPA last year for its proposed rollback. Upon finalization of the plan, legal challenges against the rollback only seem set to increase.

States will be leading the way in that regard, but after all this, wouldn’t it be something if the automakers stepped up with a legal pushback of their own? If the rules are indeed finalized as expected, we’re curious to see what the next move will be from the industry as they face the dreaded “split market.” After all, there’s nothing stopping them from wanting to meet the Obama-era standards on their own.

These USDA employees face a stark choice: Move to Kansas City or be fired,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Joe Davidson', 'Columnist Focusing On Federal Government Issues']",07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/07/01/these-usda-employees-face-stark-choice-move-kansas-city-or-be-fired/,"

Columnist

The Agriculture Department is offering employees a rare choice: accept a forced transfer to a post 1,000 miles away or be fired.

The Trump administration’s plan to move two agencies from the District to the Kansas City area includes a document with two blank boxes on it, sent to employees on June 13. Check one, it instructs: Accept the transfer by July 15 or “be separated by adverse action procedures.”

That means getting fired, with an opportunity to appeal the dismissal through what could be an expensive process. Getting fired could also make it more difficult to find another federal job in an area where the government dominates.

Although a limited number of buyouts and early retirement opportunities will be available for what union officials expect to be fewer than 15 percent of those affected, and while some USDA employees might find work in government positions elsewhere in the D.C. area, the disruption to employees generally will be substantial.

“Adverse action” can have another meaning that goes beyond the affected employees and more broadly hits taxpayers, organizations and businesses. In addition to the big hassle for workers, relocations could have an adverse impact — a major brain drain — on the work of the two agencies, the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture.

Union officials estimate a strong majority of employees will decline reassignment. If that happens, the work of the small but important agencies could be seriously upset. Even before Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced the Kansas City region as the new location, but after officials said the agencies would be moving out of the District, department employees quit in droves, my colleague Ben Guarino reported last month.

“The current and projected attrition will curtail research data products that encompass commodity estimates, agricultural sector forecasts, food and farm economic and statistical indicators for U.S. agriculture, conservation, and food policy and markets,” said Kevin Hunt, a 10-year USDA employee, speaking as acting vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Local 3403 representing research service staff.

What the government calls “directed reassignments” to a different city are “very rare in the federal government. That's not something that is a common practice,” said Joanna Friedman, a federal employment lawyer with the Federal Practice Group. “This is unprecedented.”

When the Pentagon closed bases around the country starting in 2005, it forced many defense civilians to make a similar choice. “We lost a lot of talent in geographic moves,” said Jeffrey Neal, formerly the top personnel officer at the Defense Logistics Agency and the Department of Homeland Security. “A 20 percent take-up rate is typical.”

Not only are government transfers like the USDA’s uncommon, but the size makes this one especially unusual. Typically, they are much smaller, said Neal, now a senior vice president with the ICF consulting firm. “Years ago, people were more likely to move with their jobs,” he added. “With most people living in two-wage-earner households, it is far more difficult to just pack up and go.”

Many, perhaps most, affected USDA employees are considering a third option — quit and find new work.

“I will be unemployed beyond Sept. 30,” which is the deadline for the District-based workers to report to the new location, Hunt said, “unless I can find another job.”

Of the 547 employees the department wants to move for the two agencies combined, 253 are with the Economic Research Service, 77 percent of its 329-person workforce. An additional 294 are with the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, 93 percent of its 315-person staff. News of the move prompted a surge of support for the union. Employees at the National Institute voted 137-2 to join AFGE two weeks ago. Last month’s vote at the economic service was 138-4.

When Perdue announced the moves to the Kansas City area, he said, “We did not undertake these relocations lightly, and we are doing it to enhance long-term sustainability and success of these agencies. The considerable taxpayer savings will allow us to be more efficient and improve our ability to retain more employees in the long run.”

But the USDA estimate of nearly $300 million in savings over 15 years is way off, according to an analysis by the Milwaukee-based Agricultural and Applied Economics Association. Instead, it would cost taxpayers between $83 and $182 million, the analysis found. The USDA underestimated the true cost in part because it did not account for “the lost value of research from staffers who resign or retire rather than move,” the association reported.

A group of Democratic senators, including all four from Maryland and Virginia, has introduced legislation to keep the headquarters of the two agencies within the D.C. area.

Andrew Crane-Droesch, an economist with the research service, said he is not moving and is now looking for another job in the D.C. area. “Definitely the choice we face is move to Kansas City or lose our jobs,” he said. “I’m certainly not happy. I love my job, but I can’t move to Kansas City, and moreover, I don’t want to even if I could.”

Like Crane-Droesch, these staffers “have families, they are part of a community and they’ve been dedicated public servants,” said Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), chairman of the House Oversight and Reform subcommittee on government operations. “They deserve better than having such a radical and consequential do-or-die decision, which is hardly a fair choice, thrown at them at the last minute.”

Ted Cruz & Migrant Donations -- Senator Asks DHS to Create Process for Collecting Donations,https://www.nationalreview.com,"['Mairead Mcardle', 'Jim Geraghty', 'David French', 'Kevin D.

(Mike Segar/Reuters)

Senator Ted Cruz on Monday sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security asking for the creation of a process that would allow DHS to accept donations meant for migrants in U.S. custody.

Currently, no such process for collecting a distributing privately donated aid exists, which has caused generous citizens who have offered supplies to overcrowded migrant-detention facilities to be turned away.

Curz called on Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan to “establish and publicize a process for accepting donations from charitable organizations, faith-based organizations, and NGOs to aid individuals in CBP custody.”

DHS facilities are at “peak or beyond peak capacity,” Cruz said, because of the “crisis on our southern border.” Even with the $4.6 billion in emergency humanitarian aid approved by Congress to address the influx of migrants at the border, the Department can surely accept the “generosity of the American people” as well, he said.

A Texas state lawmaker first drew attention to the donation issue when he revealed that he’d tried to donate items to a Texas detention facility and was told by a Border Patrol representative, “We don’t accept donations.”

“It just befuddles me and I think it’s just heartbreaking to know that there’s so many people that want to help, and that help is being denied for no definable reasons that anybody’s been able to communicate,” Democratic state representative Terry Canales said."
Commerce Dept. staff told to continue treating Huawei as blacklisted: report,https://thehill.com,[],07-03-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/finance/451528-commerce-dept-staff-told-to-continue-treating-huawei-as-blacklisted-report,"A senior Commerce Department official reportedly told agency staff this week to continue treating Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei as blacklisted, after President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump appears to contradict officials, calls reports on 2020 census 'fake' Fox's July 4 coverage to highlight charity for families of wounded, fallen service members Why Kim gets Trump's love and Khamenei doesn't MORE said he would allow U.S. companies to sell products to the company.

Reuters reported that John Sonderman, the deputy director of the Commerce Department’s Office of Export Enforcement, wrote in an email to staff on Monday that Huawei remains ""on the Entity List” and application should be considered on merit.

""Evaluate the associated license review policy under part 744,” Sonderman wrote, according to Reuters, referring to regulations surrounding the entity list and a ""presumption of denial"" licensing policy for blacklisted companies.

Huawei was added to the department’s entity list in May, which is seen as a death sentence for included groups as U.S. companies are banned from doing business with them. The Commerce Department subsequently implemented a 90-day extension before Huawei would be added to the list to give U.S. companies time to adjust.

However, Trump seemed to walk back his administration’s crackdown on Huawei over the weekend while attending the Group of 20 summit in Japan, saying he would allow U.S. companies to sell products to Huawei. Trump noted that “we're talking about equipment where there’s no great national security problem with it.”

The president's announcement drew sharp bipartisan backlash on Capitol Hill, with lawmakers questioning whether the administration had given up a bargaining chip with China amid a long-running trade war. The announcement also left the status of Huawei on the entity list in question.

Larry Kudlow Lawrence (Larry) Alan KudlowMORE, the top White House economic adviser, on Sunday tried to cut down on the confusion around Huawei’s status.

Kudlow told CBS’s ""Face the Nation"" that “anything to do with national security concerns will not receive a new license from the Commerce Department. I think that’s very important. I think people have to understand that.”

The administration has been working with foreign allies over the past several months urging them to ban Huawei from their networks, with the U.S. arguing that Huawei is an arm of the Chinese government and a danger to U.S. data and intellectual property.

Huawei has been cautious in responding to the announcement, with a Huawei spokesperson telling The Hill earlier this week that “we acknowledge President Trump’s comments related to Huawei over the weekend and have nothing further to add at this time.”"
Ground Truthing USDA’s June Acreage Report,https://www.fb.org,"['Credit', 'U.S. Department Of Agriculture']",,,,https://www.fb.org/market-intel/ground-truthing-usdas-june-acreage-report,"The 2019 growing season will go down as one of the most challenging planting seasons on record due to spring flooding and persistent rainfall across the Midwest. Planting progress for corn and soybeans was historically delayed, i.e., Crop Planting Delays Reach Historic Levels Resulting in High Levels of Uncertainty for 2019, and current expectations are for prevent plant crop insurance claims to exceed $1 billion and reach a record-high of 10 million acres.

USDA’s June World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates recognized the challenges faced in the 2019 crop year and adjusted corn planted acreage down to 89.8 million acres, a reduction of 3 million acres from the department’s March estimate, and also reduced the crop yield from 176 bushels per acre to 166 bushels per acre.

USDA reversed course in its annual survey-based June Acreage Report. For the 2019/20 crop year, USDA indicated corn planted area at 91.7 million acres, up 3% or 2.6 million acres from prior-year levels, and down only slightly from March intentions of 92 million acres planted. Importantly, USDA’s June corn acreage estimate was up from the June WASDE projection and well above the average pre-report estimate of 86.6 million acres. Figures 1 and 2 highlight USDA’s corn acres planted or intended to be planted and the year-over-year change from 2018.

Following continued declines in new-crop soybean prices – due to substantially lower Chinese demand – USDA revealed soybean acres planted at 80 million acres, down 9.2 million acres, or 10%, from 2018 and down 4.6 million acres from March intentions. Soybean plantings in 2019 are expected to be the lowest since 2013, and plantings are expected to be lower in all 29 soybean-producing states. Figures 3 and 4 highlight USDA’s soybean acres planted or intended to be planted and the year-over-year change from 2018.

USDA Will Reinterview

It is an understatement to say USDA’s report surprised the corn market. New-crop corn futures fell by more than 19 cents and represented a $2.6 billion-reduction in the value of new-crop corn (based on WASDE production estimates). USDA acknowledged as much, indicating that 83% of the intended corn acreage had been planted at the time of the survey – well below the 10-year average.

In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the crop size and planted area, USDA announced that it will resurvey farmers in advance of the August 12 Crop Production report. Farmers in 14 states will be reinterviewed to determine their planted area of corn, soybeans and sorghum. Figure 5 identifies the states subject to acreage resurveys.

State Farm Bureau Perspective

To provide some additional perspective on corn and soybean acres planted, remaining to be planted or prevented from being planted, state Farm Bureaus in the reinterview region were contacted to get their ground-level perspective. Their responses follow.

Illinois – Corn Acres Unchanged and Soybean Acres Down 5%

A central Illinois farmer reported to me over this past weekend, that he had one field he originally planned to plant to corn, then was prevented-planting of corn on that field, and now he has just finished planting soybeans on that field. [Market Intel note: The planting of soybeans may have been motivated by the planting requirement associated with the Market Facilitation Program.]

Indiana – Corn Acres Up 3% and Soybean Acres Down 11%

Farmers in Indiana have given up on the hope of getting any more corn planted and did so several weeks ago. Prevent planted acres are all around the state, particularly in central and southern Indiana, where farmers have experienced rainfall far above normal. Corn can be seen in the state just popping out of the ground to knee high. Anticipated yields at this time will be far less than the 10-year average for farmers.

Kansas – Corn Acres Up 8% and Soybean Acres Down 1%

While a majority of intended Kansas corn acres have been planted, many of those acres went in during and after the USDA Risk Management Agency’s late planting period. In a few counties, up to 25% of the crop was either prevented from being planted or the planted corn is now under water.

The bulk of intended soybeans in Kansas are in or going in but a significant portion is later than intended; an early frost could be devastating.

Kansas grain sorghum planting is wrapping up, and it is suspected that at least in some areas of the state, forage crops may be substituted for intended grain sorghum acreage.

The Kansas cotton crop went in extremely late and estimates are that only about 50% to 60% of intended acres got planted this spring.

All crops are behind and will require near optimal temperatures and measured amounts of precipitation throughout the growing season. Again, an earlier than normal frost could be devastating.

Michigan – Corn Acres Unchanged and Soybean Acres Down 9%

There were a lot of acres planted over the weekend in central Michigan, but anything planted to corn recently will go to silage, not grain. The large dairy presence and need for forage in this area has caused a lot of farmers to keep planting corn with no intention of harvesting it for grain. Based on some informal surveys done a few weeks ago, I would estimate that around 65% of originally intended acres were planted to corn for grain.

Soybean progress is harder to estimate because there were still soybeans being planted over the weekend. It varies quite a bit across the state but the southeast and central [parts of the state] are probably the hardest-hit areas. Our media staff is creating a member survey that will go out tomorrow to help give us a better idea of actual acreage.

I think one thing that would help make USDA’s resurvey more accurate is if they give clear direction on how farmers should report prevent plant acreage, especially prevent plant land that gets planted to corn as a cover crop for silage.

Missouri – Corn Acres Down 3% and Soybean Acres Down 9%

Extreme flooding along the Mississippi, Missouri and internal state tributaries has wreaked havoc with corn planting in Missouri. Some land is still either covered or partially covered with water and will not be planted. April and the first half of May corn plantings were detrimentally impacted by frequent heavy rains causing thousands of acres to be replanted and/or forcing many farmers to leave undesirable stands due to the lateness of the season. Corn planted the last 10 days of May and into the first three weeks of June had better stands. 25-30% of the corn is normal, 50% is intermediate with very uneven stands and 20-25% is replant.

Ohio – Corn Acres Down 6% and Soybean Acres Down 6%

It is tough to nail down how accurate the latest USDA planting report is. Some of our economists don't believe it is super far off, but if we ask our farmers they claim much less has been planted. They are not thrilled to see the price slide with this latest report.

I was in Ottawa County in northwest Ohio yesterday and their Soil and Water in the county estimates that only 4% of the corn was planted and 30% of their beans. I would say that is definitely worse than most, but many of the surrounding counties experienced very serious planting issues as well. During my drive through northwest Ohio yesterday I saw a lot of weeds and barren fields.

If Ohio does not have a record for prevented plant acreage I will be surprised. And for crops that are planted, they are weeks behind, struggling to come up or already in need of replant. And how much can be replanted at this point? Probably not much.

South Dakota – Corn Acres Down 9% and Soybean Acres Down 22%

It looks like South Dakota will set the record for prevented planting acres by far. As always, there are differences around the state, but it sounds to me that on average the state will only be around 60% planted. On our farm, we were right at 50%. Some areas of the northeast part of the state are 80% to 90% percent planted. Down by Mitchell and Chamberlain areas, and between Pierre and Huron, some producers couldn't plant anything at all. There are some areas where you can drive several miles and not see a planted field.

Summary

USDA currently projects corn acres at 91.7 million acres, up 3% from prior-year levels, and soybean acres at 80 million acres, down 10% from 2018. However, given the historical delays in planting at the time of USDA’s acreage survey, USDA announced intentions to resurvey farmers in advance of the August Crop Production report. Feedback from state Farm Bureaus confirms the need to resurvey crop acreage, points to potential yield issues due to unfavorable growing conditions and supports a more substantial reduction in corn acres planted."
Trump Says Conditions Are 'Disgraceful' in Major U.S. Cities,https://www.usnews.com,[],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2019-07-02/president-trump-says-conditions-are-disgraceful-in-major-us-cities,"President Donald Trump said Monday that U.S. cities struggling with challenges on the streets are ""usually sanctuary cities run by very liberal people."". The Associated Press

President Donald Trump said federal intervention might be needed to clean up the streets in major U.C. cities and appeared to boast about reducing homelessness in Washington during an interview with Fox News on Monday.

In an interview taped in Japan with host Tucker Carlson, the U.S. president addressed foreign policy and the power of big tech companies before the conversation turned toward the conditions in major U.S. cities.

After Carlson said that Osaka and Tokyo – two cities Trump visited during his trip to Japan for the G-20 meeting – were clean and didn't have graffiti or ""junkies,"" Trump agreed that U.S. cities such as New York and Los Angeles had major issues with what Carlson called ""filth.""

""It's a phenomena that started two years ago. It's disgraceful,"" Trump said.

""You can't have what's happening – where police officers are getting sick just by walking the beat,"" Trump continued. ""I mean, they're getting actually very sick.""

Although Trump didn't explicitly use the phrase ""homelessness"" during the interview, he appeared to blame the homeless population for playing a role in ruining cities and implied that many of them choose to be homeless out of personal preference.

""Some of them have mental problems where they don't even know they're living that way,"" Trump said. ""In fact, perhaps they like living that way. They can't do that. We cannot ruin our cities.""

He also suggested the federal government might get involved in decreasing the homeless population in major cities – though he didn't specify how. ""We're looking at it very seriously,"" he said. ""We may intercede. We may do something to get that whole thing cleaned up. It's inappropriate.""

Trump also boasted about cleaning up the streets of Washington after he became president.

""You know, I had a situation when I first became president,"" Trump said. ""We had certain areas of Washington, D.C., where that was starting to happen, and I ended it very quickly. I said, 'You can't do that.'""

Homelessness in the capital region has indeed decreased since Trump took office – dropping from 8,350 in 2016 to 6,904 in 2018, according to the National Alliance to End Homelessness . But advocates for the homeless in Washington seem baffled by the president's comments, crediting the drop in homelessness to initiatives such as permanent housing and substance abuse treatment.

""I don't have a clue to what he's referencing,"" Michael L. Ferrell, the executive director of the service nonprofit D.C. Coalition for the Homeless, told The Washington Post . ""Those resources definitely predate the Trump administration.""

Trump said most U.S. cities are doing ""great,"" while adding that those struggling with challenges on the streets are ""usually sanctuary cities run by very liberal people."" He also appeared to suggest the U.S is going through an alarming increase in homelessness.

""We've never had this in our lives before in our country,"" he said.

Data from the National Alliance to End Homelessness, however, suggests otherwise.

Although homelessness did increase slightly by 0.3% between 2017 and 2018, it's been on a general downward trend for the past decade, according to the National Alliance ."
Vintage EPA photos reveal what US waterways looked like before pollution was regulated,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Aylin Woodward'],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.businessinsider.com/vintage-epa-photos-reveal-us-waterways-before-pollution-was-regulated-2019-6,"Just over 50 years ago, Ohio's Cuyahoga river caught fire.

The disaster prompted a public outcry that in part led to the formation of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1970. The EPA was charged with regulating the country's polluted air and waterways, among other environmental objectives.

Soon after its founding, the agency dispatched 100 photographers to capture the US' environmental issues as part of a photo project called Documerica. The photographers took about 81,000 images, more than 20,000 of which were archived. At least 15,000 have been digitized by the National Archives, and the images now function as a kind of time capsule, revealing what states from California to New York looked like between 1971 and 1977.

His letter to acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan comes amid increased scrutiny of the treatment of migrants in U.S. custody. News reports this month have detailed poor conditions at detention facilities, and prompted a lawmaker visit to some centers this week.

Cruz asked the agency to establish and publicize a process of accepting donations from charities, faith-based organizations, and nongovernmental organizations ""to aid individuals in CBP [Customs and Border Protection] custody.""

Cruz noted in his letter that DHS facilities are “at peak or beyond peak capacity,” and praised Congress for approving $4.6 billion in emergency humanitarian aid for the border.

""Many Americans, however, also want to provide more direct and tangible help—they want to donate basic items such as diapers and toothbrushes to children in CBP custody,"" he wrote. ""Organizations are currently having difficulties making donations because DHS and CBP currently lack procedures to accept their donations.""

DOJ pushes Congress to permanently close loophole for knock-off fentanyl,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Clare Hymes'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/doj-pushes-congress-to-permanently-close-loophole-for-knock-off-fentanyl/,"The Department of Justice is calling on Congress to enact into law a temporary order from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) classifying fentanyl-like drugs as controlled substances. The 2018 order, which closed a legal loophole in U.S. drug laws that make Americans vulnerable to what are essentially knock-off versions of the opioid, was imposed on an emergency basis for two years and is set to expire in February 2020.

The drugs were previously able to dodge federal law due to their chemical makeup, which has slight modifications from the fentanyl compound. Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, is about 100 times stronger than morphine, and its analogues can be even more potent.

""From a policy and regulatory perspective, fentanyl-like substances need to be permanently scheduled as a class,"" said Katie Crytzer, the acting deputy assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Policy at the Department of Justice. At a briefing with reporters Monday, she called the classification an ""urgent and necessary first step.""

John Martin, assistant administrator at the DEA, cited statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing more than 70,000 people died from drug overdoses in 2017. Nearly 48,000 of those deaths were caused by opioids, with approximately 29,000 stemming from use of fentanyl or fentanyl-like substances, Martin said.

If the government's current order expires without a plan in place to set permanent controls, Crytzer said, ""the department, its prosecutors and law enforcement would enter relatively unknown territory."" Crytzer said a lapse could have a serious impact on any ongoing or impending prosecutions.

According to the Executive Office for United States Attorneys, there were 863 federal defendants in fiscal year 2018 whose principal charge was related to fentanyl. However, the office only began including fentanyl analogues in their tracking as of October 2018.

The illicit substances are engineered to skirt and exploit gaps in U.S. drug laws, and largely enter the U.S. from foreign sources like Chinese criminal organizations, Mexican cartels and other traffickers. Officials say the analogues coming in from China are more potent, but traffickers from Mexico bring larger quantities of the drugs into the country.

""I can personally tell you how savvy these drug traffickers are,"" said Amanda Liskamm, director of opioid enforcement and prevention efforts in the deputy attorney general's office. ""When there is a gap in U.S. law they take full advantage of it, which results in more drugs and more deaths.""

Officials say the 2018 order has led to a ""significant decrease"" of fentanyl-like substances on the streets, and law enforcement is hoping that a more permanent continuation of the blanket classification will keep it that way. They noted that since the temporary emergency order has been in effect, law enforcement has only encountered three new fentanyl-related substances. Before the order, there were new analogues being discovered on a monthly basis.

Although Congress has been vocal on working to curb the opioid epidemic, they have yet to mark up the Stopping Overdoses of Fentanyl Analogues Act, or SOFA Act, which would permanently close this particular gap. Some hesitancy stems from concerns about how blanket scheduling could affect researchers, but Martin said that DOJ and DEA are working on an intergovernmental solution that benefits the researchers.

""They have some concerns but from where I'm standing, or sitting, I think we're trying to eliminate I guess the perception out there in the research community that it's going to be a hindrance for them to conduct research,"" Martin said. ""We absolutely don't want that perception to be there."""
Trump tweet breaks Interior Department webpage,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-tweet-breaks-interior-department-webpage,"A tweet from President Trump’s account generated so much web traffic to the Department of Interior’s press release regarding Fourth of July celebrations that it broke the webpage.

“What to Expect At This Year’s Annual Fourth of July Celebration,” the article was titled.

Trump’s tweet gained more than 6,000 likes and 2,000 retweets in less than 20 minutes.

The link to the press release was broken for about 30 minutes. It has since been fixed.

Trump has been hyping up his first-ever “Salute to America” event on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. — an event that will feature U.S. Army Abrams Tanks and shutdown the airspace around Washington during and after Trump’s speech.

Fresh Trouble: DOJ Subpoenas Boeing about Dreamliner Safety,https://marketrealist.com,['Anirudha Bhagat'],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://marketrealist.com/2019/07/fresh-trouble-doj-subpoenas-boeing-about-dreamliner-safety/,"Subpoenaed over Dreamliner safety

The Boeing Company (BA) has encountered yet another problem—this time with its twin-aisle 787 Dreamliner planes. The US Department of Justice has reportedly subpoenaed the airplane maker regarding an ongoing investigation about 787 Dreamliner safety issues.

According to the Seattle Times, the Department of Justice is seeking records relating to 787 Dreamliner productions at Boeing’s South Carolina plant. The Federal Aviation Administration has been investigating two battery overheating incidents from 2013, following which Dreamliner planes remained grounded for several months.

The Department of Justice is investigating the allegations of the New York Times, which raised questions about the production process at Boeing’s South Carolina plant. In April, the Times made allegations about “shoddy work” and “flawed quality control” at the plant based on over one hundred pages of company documents, internal emails, and federal records.

The news agency stated that managers had pressured employees to finish work quickly to avoid production delays. In doing so, managers even ignored safety issues raised by employees. According to the Times‘ June 28 article, the Federal Aviation Administration has confirmed three complaints registered by employees at the South Carolina plant since September last year.

Fresh trouble for Boeing

The Department of Justice’s subpoena over Dreamliner planes has brought new trouble for Boeing, which is already facing worldwide criticism and criminal investigation over its fast-selling 737 MAX jets’ safety issues. The 737 MAX planes have been grounded worldwide since mid-March following two deadly accidents that occurred within the span of five months.

Due to their worldwide grounding, air carriers have denied taking deliveries of the MAX planes until safety concerns are cleared, thereby hurting Boeing’s overall shipments. In May 2019, the company’s overall commercial aircraft deliveries fell 56% year-over-year to 30 planes from 68 in May 2018.

Orders for Boeing 737 MAX planes have remained frozen since mid-March. The company has received some respite via several major orders for its Dreamliner jets in the last three months. During the first half of 2019, the company won ~55 orders for 787 Dreamliner planes. Therefore, any fresh findings regarding safety loopholes in the new model will likely severely impact Boeing’s commercial airplane orders and deliveries, hurting its financial results.

Stock performance

Shares of Boeing fell 2% on July 1. The stock has underperformed the iShares US Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA), which allocates funds to companies engaged in the manufacturing, assembling, and distribution of aerospace and defense equipment. Boeing has returned 10.5% YTD (year-to-date), while ITA has returned 22.8%.

The stock’s YTD gains are much lower than those of its peers. Lockheed Martin (LMT), General Dynamics (GD), and United Technologies (UTX) have returned 38%, 16.1%, and 23.3%, respectively, YTD."
"VA, Verizon to offer new telehealth access for veterans",https://www.healthcareitnews.com,[],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/va-verizon-offer-new-telehealth-access-veterans,"The Department of Veterans Affairs and Verizon are teaming up to offer veterans who are customers of the telecommunications giant unlimited access to department's VA Video Connect telehealth app.

WHY IT MATTERS

The platform connects veterans with their health care team using encryption to ensure a secure and private session, and users can then participate in video appointments or engage with health professionals using the built-in chat feature.

The partnership gives vets access across Verizon's nationwide 4G LTE network without incurring data charges. They can visit the VA Video Connect test site on their mobile device to test whether their device is compatible with the platform.

Customers using devices running Apple's iOS software can download the app via Apple's App Store, and for all other users, a telehealth session launches automatically after a user selects an emailed session.

The app is just one of several available from the VA, including an online scheduling application and an ""Ask a Pharmacist"" app, along with a variety of apps targeting mental health and wellness.

THE LARGER TREND

Telehealth is set for a major expansion in the U.S. This past month the Federal Communications Commission announced the agency would vote to advance a $100 million Connected Care Pilot Program, enabling telehealth expansion for low-income Americans nationwide, including veterans and others in medically underserved areas.

The partnership with Verizon comes as the VA navigates a complex digital transformation, including the $16 billion implementation of the Cerner electronic health records system, which is slated to go live across care sites by 2028.

However, the lack of interoperability between the Department of Defense and VA remains a major stumbling block, which the two entities hope will be smoothed through the creation of a special office, the Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization office, to help centralize decision-making.

Further complicating matters was the first House VA Subcommittee on Technology Modernization hearing, held in September 2018, which revealed that officials and congressional members are not on the same page when it comes to governance and EHR interoperability.

ON THE RECORD

""VA's telehealth app for streaming live video sessions between patients and health care providers is another testament to our shared journey to fully integrated, seamless access to health care for our Veterans, no matter where they live,"" VA Secretary Robert Wilkie said in a statement.

""Regardless of whether they live in city centers or rural areas, Veterans should be able to access the VA's telehealth resources,"" added Mike Maiorana, senior vice president of public sector for Verizon.

Cruz: Overwhelmed DHS must start accepting private donations,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/cruz-overwhelmed-dhs-must-start-accepting-private-donations,"A Republican senator from a southern border state has urged the Department of Homeland Security to start accepting private donations, hoping the money will improve holding conditions and give Customs and Border Protection facilities on the U.S.-Mexico border additional needed help.



Senator Ted Cruz sent acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan a letter Tuesday urging him to create a process for the federal entity to accept money and supplies from faith-based groups, non-governmental organizations, and charities.

""Even with the additional supplemental emergency funding, I am confident that DHS and CBP can still use the generosity of the American people to help manage the humanitarian crisis on our border,"" Cruz wrote in the letter.

Cruz said he made the request because he had heard of individuals who wanted to help improve conditions inside the overcrowded facilities at ports of entry, but Border Patrol stations lacked a way to do so.

""This desire is laudable,"" Cruz wrote. ""But I understand that many of these organizations are currently having difficulties making donations because DHS and CBP currently lack procedures to accept their donations.""

The second-term senator did not make a recommendation for how DHS should go about making the operational change.

McAleenan is meeting with government officials in Honduras and El Salvador the first half of this week to discuss root causes and solutions to ""irregular migration"" from the northern region of Central America. DHS has not indicated if it will consider Cruz's request.

More than 600,000 people have been taken into custody by Customs and Border Protection personnel at and between ports of entry in the first eight months of fiscal 2019, which is more than the previous 12 months. More than half of that group are families.

CBP has said its facilities were designed for single adults to be held for up to 72 hours before being transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement for deportation.

Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement is responsible for taking unaccompanied children from CBP but has not had the space to do so, leading to overcrowded facilities with inefficient care for those temporarily living there."
States sue EPA for tougher regulation of asbestos,https://thehill.com,[],07-01-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/451189-states-sue-epa-for-tougher-regulation-of-asbestos,"Eleven Democratic attorneys general from across the country have filed suit against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), arguing the agency has failed to effectively regulate asbestos.

The agency announced a rule in April to restrict the substance but stopped short of banning it outright, a move critics say could open the door to new uses of asbestos.

ADVERTISEMENT

The attorneys general had previously petitioned the EPA to create a new rule requiring data collection on the importation and use of asbestos, something the agency denied around the time in unveiled its new rule. The suit would force the agency to issue a new asbestos reporting rule.

Officials have known for decades that asbestos causes illnesses including lung cancer, mesothelioma and asbestosis. The EPA’s April rule was the first action the agency took on the substance in 30 years, but it was panned by critics as a half measure that could reintroduce some asbestos products to the market.

“This new rule makes it more difficult for industry to resume some abandoned uses of asbestos, but that is a half step at best,” Melanie Benesh, legislative attorney at the Environmental Working Group, wrote in a press release at the time. An outright ban “is the only way the public can trust industry will never again be able to use this dangerous material that has literally killed tens of thousands of Americans.”

The EPA has not ruled out an asbestos ban under its new rule.

“If there is any unreasonable risk, the EPA will regulate, and our regulation could take the form of a ban,” Alexandra Dapolito Dunn, assistant administrator of the EPA’s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention told The Hill in April.

But many Democrats say they’ve lost patience with the agency, expressing concern that agency scientists who recommended a full ban were ignored by top EPA officials. In May, House Democrats held a hearing on a bill that would force the agency to do so.

In addition to California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Washington and the District of Columbia are parties in the suit."
Trump administration drops bid to put citizenship question on 2020 Census,https://www.seattletimes.com,"['Matt Zapotosky', 'Tara Bahrampour', 'Ann E. Marimow', 'The Washington Post', 'This Story Was Originally Published At Washingtonpost.Com.']",07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation/2020-census-will-not-include-citizenship-question-doj-confirms/,"WASHINGTON – The Trump administration has dropped plans to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census, the Justice Department said Tuesday, just days after the Supreme Court described the rationale for the question as “contrived.”

The decision was made after officials determined that there would not be enough time to continue the legal battle and meet the printing deadlines for the census questionnaire, according to people familiar with the matter.

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement Tuesday that “I respect the Supreme Court but strongly disagree with its ruling regarding my decision to reinstate a citizenship question on the 2020 Census.”

The decision to eliminate the question was a victory for civil rights advocates concerned that the query would lead to an inaccurate count of immigrant communities that could skew political representation and federal funding.

“In light of the Supreme Court’s ruling, the government had no choice but to proceed with printing the 2020 census forms without a citizenship question. Everyone in America counts in the census, and today’s decision means we all will,” said Dale Ho of the American Civil Liberties Union, the lawyer who argued the Supreme Court case.

The fate of the question has been the subject of legal and political wrangling since March 2018, when Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced he planned to add it to the decennial survey, sparking a half-dozen lawsuits from states, cities, civil rights groups and others.

Just last week, President Donald Trump responded to the Supreme Court’s ruling temporarily blocking the question by saying he would seek to delay the census to give administration officials time to come up with a better explanation for why it should include a citizenship question.

Trump expressed disbelief again on Monday that the question could not be included and told reporters at the White House, “I think it’s very important – to find out if somebody is a citizen as opposed to an illegal? I think there’s a big difference, to me, between being a citizen of the United States and being an illegal.”

Instead of a delay, government lawyers by email notified those challenging the planned Census question of the administration’s decision to proceed without it.

The Census Bureau has started printing the questionnaires without the question, Ross said. He added that his “focus, and that of the bureau and the entire department, is to conduct a complete and accurate census.”

Soon after the Supreme Court ruled against the administration, Justice Department officials said privately they determined they would have no choice but to drop the question from the 2020 census.

That is because the printer had a deadline that was merely days away, and officials knew there was no way that the court process could resolve favorably for them before that deadline, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss still pending litigation.

When Trump tweeted that he would explore delaying the census, some Justice Department officials were left scratching their heads, they said, because such a move would be legally impossible.

The White House asked the Justice Department how it might be able to add the question, including by possibly delaying the census, and the department explained that it wasn’t realistic or tenable, given time constraints and the Supreme Court’s ruling, said a person familiar with the discussions, who spoke under condition of anonymity because the person wasn’t authorized to speak about it publicly.

“I have to think that sanity prevailed with respect to the incredible disruption to our representational democracy that delaying the census would have caused,” said Terri Ann Lowenthal, a former staff director of the House census oversight subcommittee. “I doubt anyone at the Justice or Commerce departments could figure out how to overcome the constitutional and statutory hurdles.”

Critics of the question, including some inside the Census Bureau, said it could cause an undercount of millions of people in immigrant communities who would be afraid to return the form, leading to an inaccurate that could skew representation and apportionment in favor of Republican areas.

The government had said it needed the question in order to enforce the Voting Rights Act, and Ross initially told Congress he decided to add it in response to a December 2017 request from the Justice Department. But documents uncovered in the lawsuits suggested Ross was pushing for it months earlier, and that he pressed the Justice Department to issue the request.

In the Supreme Court’s splintered ruling Thursday, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that federal agencies must offer “genuine justifications for important decisions, reasons that can be scrutinized by courts and the interested public.” He was joined in by the court’s four liberal justices.

Data from the census, which every U.S. household is required to fill out, is used by businesses and by the government to allocate hundreds of millions of dollars in federal spending per year; it is also used to determine Congressional apportionment and redistricting. The form that goes to all households has not included a question related to citizenship since 1950.

Thomas Wolf, of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, said Tuesday that the push to include such a question would have a lasting impact.

“Even if the citizenship question is dead, it has left damage in its wake. The question has not only distracted necessary attention for over a year from other key aspects of census preparation, but also raised widespread fears about the safety of participating in the census,” Wolf said in an e-mail.

“The administration must refocus its attention immediately on making sure that every person in this country is counted. It can start by launching a nation-wide advertising campaign to ensure everyone that no citizenship question will appear on the 2020 Census.”

The notice from the government came just hours before lawyers were scheduled for a conference call in a separate case in Maryland also challenging the Census question.

Judge George Hazel, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland in Greenbelt, was one of three federal judges who ruled earlier this year against the question, saying Ross violated administrative law and the enumeration clause of the Constitution by proposing to ask the citizenship status of household members on the form.

The issues before Hazel were different from those heard by the Supreme Court. The government’s path to adding the question had become more difficult in May after new evidence emerged showing a deceased Republican redistricting strategist had been in touch with some administration officials over adding the question.

The strategist, Thomas Hofeller, was author of a 2015 study that found adding the question would likely help Republicans and white voters in subsequent redistricting decisions; he had also been in touch with a census official about adding a citizenship question to the form, according to files found on hard drives belonging to him.

Hazel had ruled that plaintiffs had not provided sufficient evidence for charges that the government had conspired or intended to discriminate when it added the question, and plaintiffs had appealed.

After the Hofeller evidence emerged, however, Hazel said the new evidence merited further consideration, and a federal appeals court returned the case to his court. The Maryland case could have tied up the question in a separate legal battle that might have eventually reached the Supreme Court in its own right.

During the call with Hazel on Tuesday, government lawyers did not explain why the citizenship question was pulled off the table, said Denise Hulett, senior counsel with the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, who also was on the call.

She said Hazel asked for a written stipulation by Monday in the case before him that the Commerce Department “has given up its fight entirely” to include the question in the 2020 count.

Shankar Duraiswamy, the lead attorney in the Maryland case, called the Trump administration’s reversal Tuesday a victory for American democracy.

“A citizenship question would have risked a massive undercount in areas with large numbers of Latinos and immigrants, depriving them of their right to equal political representation and fair share of federal funding,” he said in an email.

Brazilian-Owned JBS Is Big Winner in USDA Pork Contracts,https://www.agriculture.com,[],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.agriculture.com/livestock/hogs/brazilian-owned-jbs-is-big-winner-in-usda-pork-contracts,"[Updated to include a response from the USDA at the bottom.]

A Brazilian-owned meat processing company undercut its competition by more than $1 per pound to win nearly $78 million in pork contracts through a federal program launched to help American farmers offset the impact from an ongoing trade war.

As a result, JBS USA has won more than 26% of the $300 million the USDA has allocated to pork so far – more than any other company, according to an analysis of bid awards by the Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting.

The USDA’s Trade Mitigation Program was announced last August, and included direct payments to farmers, as well as $1.2 billion in food purchases from farmers and ranchers whose crops normally benefit from international markets. The plan called for $558 million worth of pork purchases. The program is intended to help U.S. farmers and ranchers hurt by the ongoing trade disputes with China, Mexico, Canada, and other trading partners.

JBS bid an average of $2.56 per pound for 5-pound pork loin cuts, while its competitors bid an average of $3.80 per pound. The company bid as low as $2.02 for the cut, the Midwest Center found.

The analysis found that JBS bid 33% less on the contracts – undercutting its competitors, even Tyson Foods, the second-largest meat processor in the country.

JBS USA is the U.S. division of JBS SA, the world’s largest meat producer. The company owns more than 300 live hog operations in the United States.

It’s expanded its reach in the U.S. in the last decade, buying Swift & Co., Smithfield Beef Group, Inc., Pilgrim’s Pride poultry, and Cargill’s Pork business, in addition to other acquisitions abroad.

JBS’ facilities in Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, and California have won trade mitigation contracts with the USDA.

“Who’s the government going to purchase it from? The Brazilian-owned JBS or the Chinese-owned Smithfield? They’ve allowed enough concentration in the packing industry, you’re running out of choices,” said Brian Duncan, a hog farmer from northwest Illinois and vice president of the Illinois Farm Bureau.

Duncan raises 70,000 hogs each year, selling mostly to Tyson, but also to JBS’ Beardstown, Illinois, facility.

Greg Gunthorp, who raises hogs near Mongo, Indiana, said its JBS’ size that allows it to offer such low prices.

“They’re a huge global corporation,” he said. Because of that, they are less impacted by the demand problems purely American pork processors are facing. “To claim we’re bailing out the farmer and bailing out agriculture, and giving it to foreign multinational corporations is a joke.”

In an emailed statement, JBS stressed its American roots.

“We operate U.S. pork plants, processing American hogs raised by U.S. farmers – the true program beneficiaries,” said Nikki Richardson, a spokesperson for JBS USA. “Like other companies in the program, our sole intent for participating was to support U.S. producer prices and help our American producer partners. It was not a bailout.”

Little impact for U.S. farmers

The pork JBS is selling to the federal government comes from American farmers, the company said. JBS said its facilities in Worthington, Minnesota; Marshalltown, Iowa;, Ottumwa, Iowa; and Beardstown, Illinois work with more than 3,165 pork producers, paying $3.5 billion in livestock payments each year.

But many of those producers are on long-term pricing contracts with JBS and may not see much benefit from the USDA’s purchases.

“How does that trickle down to farmers raising pigs for them?” asked Gunthorp. “They’re on a contract. That contract’s not changing because JBS sold more pork to the government.”

Duncan said he hasn’t seen much uptick in prices because of the trade dispute commodity purchases.

“There was a slight run-up in price late last fall,” he said. “There was a rally and the rumor was the government was making some purchases.”

The first USDA awards for pork products were released in November. But Duncan said a bigger factor affecting hog prices has been the African swine fever that’s been hurting hog farmers in China and Southeast Asia since last August.

China’s hog population has dropped by 40 million.

The U.S. produces 74.3 million hogs annually, according to the USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service.

The disease has increased global demand for pork and could be an opportunity to sell more U.S. pork to Asian markets. But that depends on trade with China reopening.

“There’s opportunity there for us to be a major supplier,” said Duncan. “But I don’t know if this administration is going to let us take advantage of that opportunity.”

The USDA’s purchases represent such a small portion of U.S. hog production, it’s unclear they’ll make much difference.

Ted Schroeder, an agriculture economist at Kansas State University, said many of the impacted markets will barely notice these purchases.

“I just don’t see these programs being huge support for farmers,” said Scheoder.

While pork makes up nearly half the food to be purchased through the USDA trade mitigation program, it’s small in comparison with the amount of pork produced each year, Schroeder said.

“Once completed, it will have resulted in moving a week’s worth of U.S. pork production, which is significant during a challenging time,” said Jim Monroe, senior communications director for the National Pork Producers Council, referring to the first round of pork purchases. “Our preference is an end to trade disputes that have prompted retaliatory tariffs against U.S. pork from two of our largest export markets, Mexico and China.”

The U.S. Department of Agriculture has bought $748 million worth of food from farmers and ranchers, nearly two thirds of the original $1.2 billion goal according to the Midwest Center analysis.

That’s five times as much on food as the agency bought in the first six months of the program, according to analysis by the Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting.

The program was intended to be temporary relief for farmers struggling against the effects of the trade wars. On May 13 President Trump announced the USDA would buy another $1.3 billion in food from U.S. producers.

An agency spokesperson said in an email that the first round of commodity purchases won’t be completed until January 2020. The USDA has yet to give details on the second round of purchases.

JBS is under scrutiny by several U.S. senators who say the company shouldn’t be able to participate in the USDA program.

“It is counterproductive and contradictory for these companies to receive assistance paid for with U.S. taxpayer dollars intended to help American farmers struggling with this administration’s trade policy,” said the May 29 letter to Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue, from nine U.S. senators.

Following publication of this story, the USDA provided a response from Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue:

""We’re buying U.S. produced agricultural products. The premise behind procurement is to take product off the market and support prices. This will help U.S. Farmers,” said Perdue. “These are legal companies operating in the United States. This is no different than people buying Volkswagens or other foreign autos that are manufactured in the United States, where their executives may have been guilty of some issue along the way. They still buy the cars. JBS is a Brazilian company operating in the United States, buying product from U.S. farmers. What we do through these companies – it’s not to help the companies – they offer a bid to us based on buying U.S. farmers production. This helps U.S. Farmers by supporting prices. Companies are able to buy from our farmers more because we are buying that product and taking it off the market.”

A Fountain Inn family is calling for help from the Department of Veterans Affairs before they end up without a home. Jacob Skelly served five years in the military, including a tour in Iraq. His time in the service ended when he was honorably discharged and diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. He, his wife Autumn and their three kids now live in Fountain Inn. In large part, they rely on the money he collects the first of each month from the VA. ""He's 100 percent disabled, he's on a lot of medications and that's his money for our family,"" said Autumn, inside the family's home Tuesday. They checked their bank account Monday, but didn't find a check. Each month, it comes on the first. ""Find out didn't get paid,"" Skelly said. Nervous, they called the VA for answers. Autumn said she believes they were hacked and said the VA told them the account number for where that check had been deposited changed. ""They did an open investigation, but they told us that it could be six-eight weeks until we hear anything back,"" she said. Skelly said that isn't soon enough.

Carter Page FISA one step closer to fuller declassification,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-30-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/carter-page-fisa-one-step-closer-to-fuller-declassification,"The Justice Department declined on Friday to declassify any more information from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act documents related to the surveillance of former Trump campaign associate Carter Page.

Although the agency acknowledged in a court filing that one barrier to further transparency had expired, more obstacles remain following repeated pro-declassification statements from President Trump and the declassification authority he recently gave to Attorney General William Barr.

After dueling memos from Republicans and Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee in 2018, as well as Freedom of Information Act lawsuits from a number of media outlets and watchdog groups, the 412 pages of redacted Page FISA documents were released on July 21, 2018. The FISA documents were based in large part upon allegations stemming from an unverified dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele at the behest of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which had been hired by Perkins Coie, the law firm for the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee.

One of the groups using FOIA to fight for information on the Page FISA documents is the James Madison Project, which filed a federal lawsuit in D.C. District Court in 2017 seeking access to any FOIA documents “authorizing surveillance of President Trump, his presidential campaign, his private company, or his associates” as well as any FOIA applications for orders submitted to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.

While special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian election interference was still ongoing, the Justice Department contended that further information from the Page FISA could not be released, citing FOIA Exemption 7(A), which indicated that releasing the Page documents “could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings.”

But once Mueller’s investigation ended in March and his report was released in April, the DOJ noted that it was “evaluating the impact, if any, of the conclusion of the Special Counsel’s work in this investigation on this litigation.” In May, the department said that it had “preliminarily assessed that no further disclosures are likely to be appropriate at this time” but that the government was “still evaluating, however, the extent to which Exemption (b)(7)(A) continues to apply to at least some of the withholdings.”

On Friday, the Justice Department informed the court and the James Madison Project that it had concluded its “re-review of the responsive FISA records” and determined that Exemption 7(A) has “expired as to all instances where it was cited as a basis for withholding information”, which meant that release of Page FISA information would no longer interfere with an ongoing investigation. Still, the DOJ also said that “in each instance where Exemption 7(A) was cited, one or more other FOIA Exemptions were also asserted”, which means DOJ still has other justifications to keep the blacked out sections of the Page FISA secret. The memo said that at this time there was no “additional segregable information available for release.”

In April, Trump hinted that he might be moving toward declassifying more of this information himself. In an interview, Fox News host Sean Hannity asked Trump, “Will you declassify the FISA applications, Gang of Eight material, those 302s, or, you know, what we call on this program the ‘bucket of five’?”

Trump responded, “Yes. Everything is going to be declassified and more, much more than what you just mentioned. It will all be declassified.”

When the James Madison Project reached out to the DOJ to see if Trump’s interview meant that Trump was declassifying more information, they say they were told in late April that “the Department of Justice has not received a declassification order from President Trump and that the agency is not currently conducting a new declassification review.”

In late May, Trump gave Barr “full and complete authority to declassify information” related to the origins of the federal investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, and he “directed the intelligence community to quickly and fully cooperate with the Attorney General’s investigation.”

This has reportedly caused some consternation in the intelligence community, but it has not resulted in any significant public disclosures thus far.

Trump has been promising FISA declassification action for nearly a year now. On Sept. 17, 2018, the White House said that Trump was directing his agencies to ""provide for the immediate declassification"" of a number of materials, including ""pages 10-12 and 17-34 of the June 2017 application to the FISA court in the matter of Carter W. Page"" and ""all FBI reports of interviews prepared in connection with all Carter Page FISA applications.”

He backed away from the move a few days later. “I met with the DOJ concerning the declassification of various UNREDACTED documents. They agreed to release them but stated that so doing may have a perceived negative impact on the Russia probe. Also, key Allies’ called to ask not to release,” Trump tweeted. “Therefore, the Inspector General has been asked to review these documents on an expedited basis. I believe he will move quickly on this (and hopefully other things which he is looking at). In the end I can always declassify if it proves necessary. Speed is very important to me — and everyone!”

Despite these repeated pronouncements from Trump, nothing more has been revealed from the Page FISA documents since their redacted release nearly a year ago. Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s investigation into alleged FISA abuse and the relationship between Steele and the FBI has been ongoing since March 2018."
Vandal lists 'Putin' as 45th president on Eden Park monument,https://www.cincinnati.com,"['Cameron Knight', 'Published A.M. Et July']",07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/crime/crime-and-courts/2019/07/02/vandal-lists-putin-45th-president-park-monument/1625192001/,"CLOSE

The plaque in Presidential Grove in Eden Park was recently vandalized. (Photo: Used with permission)

A vandal has listed ""Putin"" as the 45th President of the United States on an Eden Park monument, park officials confirmed Monday.

A political statement writ in Sharpie got attention on Reddit Monday when someone posted a photo of the plaque in the park's Presidential Grove.

The simple lists of presidents ended with ""45 Putin,"" presumably referring to Russia President Vladimir Putin.

Trees have been planted in honor of each president at Presidential Grove since 1882. Many presidents handpicked the species of tree planted in the grove to represent them.

It's unclear when the vandalism took place, but the actual 45th President Donald Trump and Putin made headlines together last week at G-20 summit in Japan.

Trump was criticized for appearing to joke about Russia's meddling in the 2016 election with Putin.

Trump turned to Putin and wagged his finger with a smile.

""Don't meddle in the election, president,"" Trump said as cameras clicked and reporters shouted questions. Putin laughed.

Rocky Merz, business services division manager for the Cincinnati Park Board, said Monday he was aware of the vandalism and that it would be cleaned up Tuesday.

He explained Trump's nameplate was not damaged or removed from the plaque because the nameplates are only added at the end of a president's term. That president's tree is also planted at that time.

Merz said the plaque there has been vandalized many times over the years, and the targets have been presidents on both sides of the aisle.

Mark Sersansie might be forgiven for often looking over his shoulder.

He moved from Washington state to California in 2011 to work as a marketing director for a medical company caught up in the billion-dollar web of health care fraud spun by Michael Drobot of Pacific Hospital in Long Beach.

Derika Moses’ Los Angeles Superior Court case

It soon became apparent, Sersansie says, that unsavory things were happening.

Sersansie found his way to Bill Reynolds, an insurance fraud investigator who had been probing the scam since 2009. They worked with authorities and, in 2012, filed what’s known as a qui tam lawsuit — a type of whistleblower suit brought under the False Claims Act that rewards whistleblowers when the government recovers funds lost to fraud.

‘Lives at risk’

Originally filed under seal, the qui tam lawsuit was brought “to stop rampant insurance fraud achieved through the unlawful employment of ‘runners, cappers and steerers,’ overbilling, illegal kickbacks to doctors, and counterfeiting of medical implant hardware perpetrated by Defendant Hospitals and their surgeons, spinal surgery hardware distributors, and healthcare ‘marketers’ in the area of spinal fusion surgeries,” the suit says.

The unlawful scheme cheated the California Workers’ Compensation System, Medi-Cal and private insurers out of hundreds of millions of dollars, the suit alleges.

“This scheme has led to patients receiving dangerous medical implants that have a substantial likelihood of failure. Many patients received spinal fusion surgeries that utilized counterfeit screws and rods, placing patients’ lives at risk, and subjecting them to further surgeries to replace the counterfeit hardware.”

Sersansie and Reynolds provided a trove of nonpublic evidence, and say they are gratified that the Department of Justice pursued the insurance fraud angle so aggressively. Operation Spinal Cap targets a scheme that stretched over 15 years and generated nearly $1 billion in fraudulent claims to the federal and state governments, as well as to private insurers. The U.S. Department of Justice says it involved some $40 million in illegal kickbacks to doctors, chiropractors, marketers and other medical professionals.

But they are perplexed — and disturbed — that the counterfeit hardware assertions have been ignored.

“This stuff went all the way across the United States and, in my opinion, is a threat to public safety,” Reynolds said.

Reynolds found himself out of a job not long after he suggested that insurers should cover surgeries to have suspect hardware extracted, he said. And Sersansie said he and his family have suffered serious harassment and intimidation.

But neither has regrets. Many patients became addicted to pain pills after their operations, and many overdosed, they said.

“People are dying and no one’s doing anything,” Sersansie said. “Why aren’t these guys indicted? There are thousands of patients out there who aren’t getting help. The insurance carriers object to paying to reverse the surgery.

“I just want some justice for these people. They’re in pain. They deserve some relief.”

Follow-up

So whose job is it — if anyone’s — to tease out this piece of the puzzle?

The company accused in lawsuits of mixing genuine spinal hardware with cheap copies — Spinal Solutions in Murrieta — is now defunct.

A state inspection report of Spinal Solutions’ Murrieta office and stockroom from 2012 found disarray, including incomplete records and a failure “to properly maintain and document the device history of each spinal fixation system kit.” But officials with the California Department of Public Health say that the federal Department of Justice and the FBI took the lead in investigating the allegations.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it acted on tips received. It inspected Spinal Solutions’ Murrieta office and warehouse 10 times in 2011, finding unlabeled products and disorganization, according to documents released under the Freedom of Information Act.

The FDA issued a warning letter to Roger Williams and Spinal Solutions in 2012 “regarding the adulteration of certain spinal implant systems,” and sent a list of “objectionable conditions” witnessed by FDA inspectors, including a lack of adequate quality control procedures and device history records, spokeswoman Alison Hunt said by email.

Spinal Solutions completed a low-severity recall of some product due to a lack of labeling and use instructions in 2013, records show. The company shut down, and owner Williams filed for bankruptcy that same year.

To many, that doesn’t seem like enough. “There were a couple of people who put the FDA on the scent early on,” said Berger, the attorney for Reynolds and Sersansie. “They did a couple of visits to the facility, they sent warning letters about the storage process not being up to par, but they didn’t drill down on the counterfeit aspect.

“Why? That’s been a huge question in my mind for many years.”

Reynolds, the fraud investigator, has a simple theory. “The U.S. attorney took the path of least resistance,” he said. “And now these people in Wisconsin, in Texas, are walking around with time bombs in their bodies and they don’t even know it.”

The DOJ said it has been doggedly pursuing the criminal threads in this case. Assertions about criminal counterfeiting of hardware, when the hardware is in people’s bodies and record-keeping is as haphazard as it’s apparently been, are difficult to prove beyond reasonable doubt in court — and are beyond the scope of the criminal proceedings, court filings assert.

A federal judge said that, because of the complexity of restitution, civil litigation may provide a more appropriate remedy for victims.

In recent weeks, a patient in Wisconsin said he was contacted by an FDA criminal investigator. But, as a matter of longstanding policy, the FDA said it does not confirm or deny the existence of criminal investigations.

A waiting game

And so, they wait. And wonder.

Donald Harland lives in Wisconsin. He worked as a caregiver for a man who was 6-foot-4 and about 400 pounds. Harland was trying to help the man to his feet back in 2008 when the man slipped; Harland had to use all his strength to ensure that the man didn’t fall.

“I held my ground, holding him up, and then I heard a pop in my back,” he said. “I knew something was terribly wrong.”

Excruciating pain followed. Harland was told that surgery could offer relief. And it has been agony ever since.

Harland’s surgeon went to prison on unrelated health care fraud charges in 2014. But several of the surgeon’s former patients received letters from the hospital where their surgeries were performed in 2015, informing them of the counterfeit hardware concerns.

Record-keeping issues, and the apparent mix of genuine and other product, make it hard for people to know exactly what’s inside them, giving them doubts about any reassuring news.

“Like you, through recent news reports, Aurora Health Care was made aware of a lawsuit involving former medical device distributor Spinal Solutions,” said the letter to Jean Morin of Racine. “The lawsuit alleges that from 2007 to 2012, Spinal Solutions produced ‘counterfeit’ implantable hardware that was mixed in with genuine product. …

“Although we are able to identify the patients, such as yourself, who had surgeries involving Spinal Solutions hardware, based on the documentation we have, it is not possible to determine if any of those parts might have been the hardware referenced in the lawsuit,” the letter said.

Patients of former surgeon Cully White have formed a Facebook group to share information. Harland has finally found a surgeon willing to extract his hardware — but it’s unclear if his spine would be strong enough to support his weight without it.

“I’m trying not to let fear stop me,” Harland said.

Meantime, in California, the U.S. Department of Justice persuaded the court to freeze action on the civil lawsuits, so as not to interfere with its criminal investigation. And people remain in pain.

“I’ve spent five years trying to identify my screws,” said Joshua Lash, a former Los Angeles deputy sheriff. “I can’t. I have no idea what’s going on inside me.”

Lash, of San Bernardino, said his career was crushed by spinal surgery he never wanted. He still has pain at the incision site. He’s always dropping things. The simple act of sneezing causes agony.

“Unfortunately, the U.S. Attorney’s Office only focused on the fraud, not on the patients,” he said. “The FDA has been quite quiet, and hasn’t done anything to support us.

“There is something wrong with me,” said Lash, gazing thin-lipped at the X-ray of the screws embedded into his bone. “I need to get this stuff out. But I no longer trust doctors.”"
USDA opens temporary office for NBAF at K-State Office Park in Manhattan,https://www.wibw.com,['Becky Goff'],,,,https://www.wibw.com/content/news/USDA-opens-temporary-office-for-NBAF-at-K-State-Office-Park-in-Manhattan-512135031.html,"The USDA has recently opened a new, temporary office in the K-State Office park in support of NBAF in Manhattan.

This temporary office space which is located on the third floor, gives them a great view of their permanent facility.

Currently nearly forty employees are working from this new office location, all of which are employees of the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility, and will eventually move into the permanent facility in December 2020.

They have had a lot of success at recent job fairs, with getting lots of applicants, but Burton says they still have lots of openings.

“We have a lot of support staff, and a lot of positions that will be available in every department. Our IT is still doing a lot of interviewing and a lot of hiring, so pretty much opportunities in all areas.” USDA/APHIS NBAF Coordinator, Dr. Ken Burton says.

According to Burton, they plan to have more than eighty percent of their employees hired when they move to the permanent facility."
House Judiciary calls for DOJ inspector general investigation into discrimination claims at FBI Academy,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-29-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/house-judiciary-calls-for-doj-inspector-general-investigation-into-discrimination-claims-at-fbi-academy,"Bipartisan leaders of the House Judiciary Committee called for the Justice Department’s inspector general to open an investigation into allegations of discrimination against women at the FBI Academy earlier this week following a federal lawsuit alleging that Quantico is run like a “good old boy network.""

Sixteen former female trainees at the FBI filed a lawsuit in late May claiming that they and dozens of other women had been sexually harassed, subjected to a hostile work environment and outdated gender stereotypes, wrongly kicked out of the training program, unfairly forced to resign or made to think that the continuing the training would be futile, suffered retaliation, and more.

And top members of the congressional committee tasked with overseeing the FBI called the allegations “disturbing” and said that, if true, “such conduct cannot be tolerated.”

The letter, signed this week by two Democrats and two Republicans — Chairman Jerry Nadler of New York and ranking member Doug Collins of Georgia as well as Karen Bass of California and John Ratcliffe of Texas — said they believed America’s diversity should be reflected by the FBI’s agents, emphasized that the FBI’s selection process should be free from bias, and called on DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz to look into it.

“We must ensure potential agents not be deterred from applying because they fear the possibility of such treatment,” they wrote. “We believe these detailed allegations require an investigation into the FBI’s training and selection prices for new agents.”

A representative for the FBI told the Washington Examiner that the bureau is “unable to comment on litigation” but that “the FBI is committed to fostering a work environment where all of our employees are valued and respected.”

“Diversity is one of our core values, and to effectively accomplish our mission of protecting the American people we need people of different genders, backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives,” the representative said.

The federal lawsuit filed by female former trainees in May is directed at the training policies at the FBI and the conduct of its instructors at its agent training facility in Quantico, Virginia. The lawsuit claims FBI training guidelines are “highly subjective” and that “the uneven power dynamic at the FBI Academy puts female trainees at a distinct disadvantage.” And the lawsuit claims the subjective guidelines lets instructors misrepresent scenarios and fail women.

The complaint also alleges that when one of the women told former FBI Director James Comey of the allegations, Comey denied that discriminatory behavior was occurring and “instead suggested she use her ‘pain’ to reflect on her strengths and weaknesses.”

Mark Morgan, a former deputy assistant director at the FBI and the new acting chief of Customs and Border Protection, is also mentioned in the lawsuit.

David Shaffer, the attorney for the plaintiffs, told the Washington Examiner the FBI Academy relies upon “a completely subjective system that allows instructors to give rise to their own biases and beliefs with no accountability and oversight.”

Shaffer said that a common dynamic is that when a female trainee explains or defends her actions to an instructor, she is viewed being argumentative while when a male trainee does he is seen as standing up for himself.

Statistics provided by the FBI show that 20% of the special agents who are brought into the FBI are female. For the 2019 cycle, the FBI says that women made up 32% of those in the special agent basic field training course and 36% of those who had applied to be special agents. The FBI says that its 2019 target for female applications had been 33%, and the numbers reflect improvements from the 26% of special agent applications in the 2018 cycle and 22% in the 2017 cycle.

The FBI says that the total number of those who make it through the entire FBI special agent process — including application, training, and graduation — has held steady at just 6%.

If the DOJ inspector takes up the issue of discrimination at Quantico, it wouldn’t be the first time. A 2003 inspector general report which looked into allegations of disciplinary double standards at the FBI uncovered instances of instructors making inappropriate comments towards some trainees.

When asked by the Washington Examiner whether the DOJ inspector general would be launching an inquiry following the request from congressional leaders, the watchdog office declined to say.

Shaffer said that an inspector general investigation “should be done of course,” but he said that Congress needed to take action too.

“They need to be doing their oversight of the agency and asking the hard questions — and not relying on the FBI to investigate themselves,” Shaffer said.
