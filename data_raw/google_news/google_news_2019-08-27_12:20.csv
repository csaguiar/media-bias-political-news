Farmers’ Frustration With Trump Grows as U.S. Escalates China Fight,https://www.nytimes.com,['Alan Rappeport'],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/27/us/politics/trump-farmers-china-trade.html,"WASHINGTON — Peppered with complaints from farmers fed up with President Trump’s trade war, Sonny Perdue found his patience wearing thin. Mr. Perdue, the agriculture secretary and the guest of honor at the annual Farmfest gathering in southern Minnesota this month, tried to break the ice with a joke.

“What do you call two farmers in a basement?” Mr. Perdue asked near the end of a testy hourlong town-hall-style event. “A whine cellar.”

A cascade of boos ricocheted around the room.

American farmers have become collateral damage in a trade war that Mr. Trump began to help manufacturers and other companies that he believes have been hurt by China’s “unfair” trade practices.

More than a year into the trade dispute, sales of American soybeans, pork, wheat and other agricultural products to China have dried up as Beijing retaliates against Mr. Trump’s tariffs on Chinese imports. Lucrative contracts that farmers long relied on for a significant source of income have evaporated, with Chinese buyers looking to other nations like Brazil and Canada to get the commodities they need. Farm bankruptcy filings in the year through June were up 13 percent from 2018 and loan delinquency rates are on the rise, according to the American Farm Bureau."
Trump's wild foreign trip encapsulates the case for 2020 voters,https://www.cnn.com,['Analysis Stephen Collinson'],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/27/politics/donald-trump-france-2020-pitch/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump tried to explain his agitating approach to life, politics and the rest of the world in a flash of impatience during a blustery news conference in France .

""It's the way I negotiate. It's done me well over the years and it's doing even better for the country, I think,"" he said.

Trump's comment encapsulated the untamed personality that his fellow world leaders are beginning to get used to -- and work around after his 29 months in office.

But in a deeper sense, Trump also shed light on fundamental judgments about his tenure that voters must make before the 2020 election.

His political future could rest on whether a sufficient number of Americans decide that the Trumpian tumult of his first term expresses their frustration with the Washington establishment and has delivered the wealth, peace and patriotic pride that he promised in the 2016 campaign.

One big risk is that a majority of voters may simply be exhausted by the cacophony of the Trump era t hat was on display at the weekend at the G7 summit in France and involves chaos , head-spinning policy reversals, lying as a matter of course, perpetual cultural warfare and widening national divides.

In other words, is all Trump, all the time, ""doing even better for the country"" as the President insists?

A wild weekend

The President's weekend in Biarritz, France, was a classic example of his behavior overseas.

His policy choices on Iran, climate, trade with China and trying to get Russian President Vladimir Putin back into the summit despite the opposition of US allies, left America isolated on the global stage.

Yet his belligerence was also undeniably an expression of US power since foreign leaders who might not be able to live with Trump but can't live without America tried not to annoy him. True to his word, the President has made the world's most powerful nation unpredictable, leaving friends and rivals unsure of what it will do next.

And he made a series of bizarre claims and assertions that left his aides struggling to shape believable explanations -- including whether first lady Melania Trump had met North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. ( She has not, it turns out .)

Above all, Trump's behavior underscored how his combustible personality has transformed the United States from being one of the world's most stable influences into one of its most disruptive forces.

It was notable how summit host French President Emmanuel Macron played a stabilizing and convening role at the weekend, inserting his nation into the spot of the mature global power once reserved for the United States.

Trump chose instead to wage the bellicose daily combat that characterizes most days when he is at home in the White House and that has become the soundtrack of life in America.

Trump's base loves what he's doing

Trump made another notable comment in Biarritz.

""I don't do things for political reasons,"" he said in one of the least credible utterances of a presidency in which almost every decision seems calculated to please his most loyal voters.

After landing back in Washington on Tuesday night, Trump tweeted a highly produced campaign-style video showing him side-by-side with world leaders that suggested that he was at the center of events unifying the G7 -- even though in terms of policy and temperament he was often on the outside.

While Trump's behavior horrifies the East Coast establishment, his bull-in-a-china shop performance in France is the key to his appeal among the Trump base.

Upsetting leaders of states whom Trump thinks have long exploited US generosity and defense guarantees is just fine with the ""Make America Great Again"" fans who flock to his rallies. Trump's statement on climate change -- that he won't lose US wealth on ""dreams, on windmills"" -- was calculated to play to his blue-collar supporters in industrial Midwest swing states.

The President's ""America First"" policy in which the US wins and other states lose has proven to be an effective political strategy among voters who support the President.

Some conservative media, meanwhile, took at face value his comments on Monday morning that China had got in touch overnight for new talks -- playing into his claims of being a great dealmaker even though an objective analysis might find little support for such claims.

Trump's relentless attack on the media, including a tweet which claimed improbably that world leaders had asked him why reporters hated America, also plays well with his base. While he peddles obvious falsehoods -- for instance, over the reasons why Russia was thrown out of the G8 summit -- his long crusade against what he calls ""fake news"" means that his supporters are disposed to believe whatever he says.

But there were also signs in recent days that Trump's erratic methods are catching up with him.

His gyrations over China -- from fury to adopting a softly softly approach and buttering up Chinese President Xi Jinping -- have left his strategy on the trade war mired in confusion. Barring an unlikely climbdown by either side, there is no obvious way out of an escalation that could damage the world economy, hurt US consumers and prejudice Trump's reelection hopes.

Trump's unrestrained behavior also took the focus off some of the weekend successes that he could benefit 2020 campaign.

He agreed with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that the two sides are close to a trade deal. While there are many details that are unclear about the scope of the pact, it would be a strong data point for him to trumpet on the campaign trail -- even if, like other Trump-era trade agreements, it fails to live up to his spin.

Trump's careful openness to a French effort to broker a meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani could be spun as a potential sign of statesmanship and a payoff for his maximum pressure campaign and cool fears of war.

Yet the story of Trump's latest world trip concerned the apparent instability of his character, the coherence of his White House messaging and whether he was up to the job.

The President's habitual challenges to the truth may also be hurting his foreign policy.

When the word of a communist Chinese government is trusted as much among such an audience as that of a pro-business Republican President, it's a sign of how Trump's reshaping of truth has cost him politically.

Foreign policy rarely decides elections. And Trump's performance at the G7 summit will be a distant memory in November 2020.

But his showing in France does help clarify the choice for those voters who are undecided about Trump and adds to a mountain of evidence about his character and fitness for office. Trump's unsteady performance was the latest example of his conduct that left him open to ridicule abroad. There was more ammunition for his critics on this score last week when he canceled a separate trip to Denmark because its prime minister would not sell Greenland to the US.

Democratic presidential candidates -- especially former Vice President Joe Biden -- are using such infringements of international etiquette to build their case that Trump is an embarrassment as America's outside face to the world and is therefore not fit for a second term.

Biden has been behaving almost like a shadow President, attempting to draw a favorable contrast with Trump. He went out of his way to note on Saturday that he would observe the old convention of not commenting on a President when he is on foreign soil -- an almost quaint step in the Trump era.

The former vice president had however already set the stage to argue that Trump's performance overseas was unacceptable with a Friday statement blasting the President's ""irrational and self-defeating campaign to make America less secure and less respected in the world."""

Opinion | My Final Break With the Trump State Department,https://www.nytimes.com,['Bethany Milton'],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/26/opinion/trump-state-department.html,"When President Trump allowed a crowd to chant “Send her back!” about a sitting member of Congress — espousing an ideology in which naturalized American citizens, at least those who don’t fit a certain profile, are held to different and dangerous standards — he wasn’t thinking about me. He’s rarely thinking about me, the white American-born daughter of two American-born citizens.

But he is often thinking and talking about at least some of the tens of thousands of people I’ve helped immigrate to the United States — legally and permissibly — over my 11 years as a consular officer in the Foreign Service. From 2014 to 2016, I oversaw immigrant visa processing at the U.S. Consulate General in Mumbai, India. Every day, my team and I saw dozens of families destined to move to the United States as green card holders: older parents going to spend their final years surrounded by grandchildren, spouses matched up through online matrimonial sites, parents with kids in tow who had been waiting patiently since the early 1990s for their chance to join a sibling.

I also oversaw immigrant visa operations in Kigali, Rwanda, from 2018 to 2019, helping Rwandans and Congolese reunite with family members in the United States. Their stories often had a darker tone: marriages brokered in refugee camps, siblings separated by war, children born of rape. But the one thing that united almost every visa applicant I ever saw was the belief that life was going to be better in America. What a rude surprise, then, for them to face elected national leadership that targets them in such gruesome ways.

When a diplomat joins the State Department, she sits through two presentations toward the end of her weekslong orientation class. One is an afternoon session about the State Department’s storied dissent channel, which lets employees speak out internally about foreign policy decisions free from the fear of retaliation. How to use it, when to use it, what it means. The other is a much shorter presentation, one that lasts all of 15 seconds: “The day you can no longer publicly support your administration’s policies is the day you need to resign.”"
Why some lesbians don’t want Pete Buttigieg to be president,https://www.politico.com,['Maggie Severns'],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/27/lesbians-pete-buttigieg-2020-president-1475900,"Several lesbian activists say that while they are glad South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is running for the Democratic nomination, they most want a woman to be president in 2020, after Hillary Clinton’s stinging loss in 2016. | Mary Schwalm/AP Photo 2020 Elections Why some lesbians don’t want Pete Buttigieg to be president Lesbian political activists are divided over which glass ceiling to aim for in the 2020 presidential race.

Campbell Spencer, a lesbian and political consultant, moved to Washington in the 1990s to work in LGBTQ advocacy. She wooed gay and lesbian voters for Al Gore, worked a stint in the Obama White House and now serves on the board of the LGBTQ Victory Fund, which this year issued its first-ever endorsement of a presidential candidate: Pete Buttigieg.

But Spencer herself will not be voting for Buttigieg.

Story Continued Below

“Mayor Pete, he’s a trailblazer,” Spencer said in an interview. “But I’m one of these women who thinks we are way overdue for having a woman in the White House. That’s a lens through which I’m going to filter my decision.”

Buttigieg, the openly gay mayor of South Bend, Ind., has drawn notable support from gay voters and donors for his presidential bid. But interviews with a dozen prominent Democrats in the LGBTQ community spotlight a remarkable collision of goals and ideals in the community of lesbian political activists this year. As the 2020 field slowly winnows, people are divided over which glass ceiling to break first.

The majority of the women POLITICO interviewed for this story did not want to speak on the record, citing a desire not to damage Buttigieg’s campaign. But especially when compared with the laborious ascent of Hillary Clinton, Buttigieg’s swift rise in national politics hints of male favoritism, some said. Others applauded his run — but feel more strongly about the need to elect a female president.

“It feels like a slap in the face to just go directly to the white gay guy, when for decades you’ve been trying to elect a woman and it didn’t happen last time,” said one lesbian Democrat who works in national politics. “If Pete Buttigieg is elected it won’t feel like a vindication of Hillary Clinton. If a woman is elected, it will.”

LGBTQ voters made up a relatively small 6 percent of the electorate in the 2018 midterm elections but voted overwhelmingly for Democratic candidates, according to exit polls. And gay donors are a formidable source of campaign funds in the Democratic Party: One in six of Barack Obama’s top campaign bundlers in 2012 were openly gay, according to a Washington Post analysis at the time.

The LGBTQ community has been an important launch pad for Buttigieg’s presidential bid. He has fundraised at the homes of several prominent gay donors — such as television producers Ryan Murphy and Richie Jackson, each of whom have hosted Buttigieg for events in their homes this year — and received campaign checks from power players including Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes and lesbian megadonor Laura Ricketts.

But the broad 2020 Democratic field includes historic diversity and choice for LGBTQ voters looking for new representation in the White House, or at least on the Democratic debate stage.

“There are black gay men and Latina lesbians — we have all these identities,” said Annise Parker, the former Houston mayor who is now president and CEO of the LGBTQ Victory Fund. “I talk to donors who are really glad that Pete’s running, but want Julián Castro to be on the debate stage. Or who say, ‘I want Cory Booker or Kamala Harris to be on stage.’ I say that’s a great thing.”

Parker, who became the first lesbian elected to lead a major American city only a decade ago, said she plans to vote for Buttigieg. But she also feels the pull of electing the first female president.

“As a woman, as a lesbian, as someone who was all in for Hillary Clinton and as someone who was a historic first myself, I would love to see a woman at the top of the ticket,” Parker said.

“And talking with other women inside the community and not, we understand the importance of Pete’s candidacy — but dammit, we’re half the population. It’s time” for a woman president, Parker continued.

Several lesbian donors and activists interviewed by POLITICO said they see in this election a continuation of the gender politics of 2016, when Clinton’s nomination was a vindicating moment for many Democratic women — and Trump’s position as the GOP nominee heightened the stakes of the race, as well as the burn of Clinton’s loss.

“To have a woman candidate finally running for president was extraordinarily galvanizing to substantial portions of the women’s community and the lesbian community,” said Elyse Cherry, a Massachusetts-based lesbian community activist and former member of Clinton’s New England finance committee. “When she lost, people were even more galvanized.”

Cherry pushed to build a movement for same-sex marriage in Massachusetts, starting in the early 1990s when the idea was a political outlier. She chaired the board for MassEquality, which advocated for the state’s gay marriage law and worked to guard it from challenges in the years after it was enacted.

Cherry plans to vote for her senior senator, Elizabeth Warren.

“Having a woman, finally, as our president is important to me,” Cherry said. “The mistake is to suggest that we all stay in one lane — for example that if you’re gay you should be supporting gay candidates, or if you’re a woman you should be supporting women candidates.”

LPAC, an organization that focuses on building power among LGBTQ women, has not endorsed a candidate, but its endorsement discussions will begin at an upcoming board meeting, the group’s president Stephanie Sandberg said, adding that there is a ""strong possibility"" that LPAC will endorse a candidate.

Nabeela Rasheed, a Chicago-based lawyer and activist backing Buttigieg, said “there is absolutely a conversation that’s happening” among lesbian donors in her area about the value of supporting a female candidate over Buttigieg.

“I don’t think the county is ready for a West Coast Democrat, and a female at that. And I don’t think this country can take an East Coast female either. They need someone who understands Main Street,” Rasheed said. So Rasheed — who is of Pakistani descent — has been raising money for Buttigieg and trying to introduce as many women of color to his campaign as possible.

Buttigieg surprised observers by surging to national prominence this spring and raising $24 million between early April and the end of June, the most money of any candidate in the field.

One foundation for his success was a bloc of openly gay male donors and fundraisers who threw their support behind his campaign early in the race. Among the people who have already raised more than $25,000 for Buttigieg’s campaign were Terrence Meck, co-founder of the nonprofit The Palette Fund; and Alex Slater, founder of the Washington, D.C.-based Clyde Group.

Other high-profile gay donors, such as software entrepreneur Tim Gill and philanthropist David Bohnett, have donated to former Vice President Joe Biden, who was an early proponent of same-sex marriage in Washington.

Kelly Dermody, a former Hillary Clinton bundler and employment lawyer who has represented women in sexual harassment cases, said that while Buttigieg’s candidacy is “exciting,” federal lawmakers who are running have more experience.

Dermody is backing Kamala Harris, who she believes is the strongest candidate, in part because of her experience as a woman and person of color. She said that one highlight of the 2020 campaign for her has been Harris’ husband, Douglas Emhoff, a frequent presence at campaign stops and an unbridled booster of his wife on social media.

“It’s just been really nice seeing him at various events and see what it looks like to have a female leader have the support of a strong male partner,” Dermondy said. “He has his own job and he’s a real star lawyer in his own world, but he also has embraced this [campaign].”"
Justice Department to seek death penalty against Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect,https://www.cnn.com,['Amir Vera'],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/26/us/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-death-sentence/index.html,"(CNN) The Justice Department is planning to seek the death penalty against the suspected shooter in the Pittsburgh Tree of Life Synagogue massacre.

Robert Bowers

Federal prosecutors will seek the death penalty on charges that include obstruction of free exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death, use and discharge of a firearm to commit murder and possession of a firearm during a violent crime.

Prosecutors say their intent to seek the death penalty is justified because Bowers' anti-Semitic views played a role in the shooting, the shooting was intentional and he showed no remorse, according to a federal notice to seek the death penalty.

Bowers has been indicted on 63 federal charges, including hate crime charges, according to a superseding indictment issued in January 2019. Of the 63 charges, 22 counts carry the death penalty, a Justice Department news release in January said."

Jill Biden to reluctant Democrats: ‘Swallow a little bit’ and vote for Joe,https://www.marketwatch.com,"['Steve Goldstein', 'European Markets Editor']",08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/jill-biden-to-reluctant-democrats-swallow-a-little-bit-and-vote-for-joe-2019-08-20,"Getty Images Jill Biden, wife of Former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, greets supporters at a campaign rally for her husband at Teamsters Local 249 Union Hall in Pittsburgh.

Dr. Jill Biden on Monday night made a very direct pitch on why Democrats should vote for her husband to be the party’s presidential nominee.

“Your candidate might be better on, I don’t know, health care, than Joe is, but you’ve got to look at who’s going to win this election,” the former Second Lady said at an event in Nashua, New Hampshire. “And maybe you have to swallow a little bit and say, ‘OK, I personally like so and so better,’ but your bottom line has to be that we have to beat Trump.”

Former Vice President Joe Biden is ahead in polls — the RealClearPolitics average has him at 30.5% nationally, ahead of Sen. Elizabeth Warren at 17.3% and Sen Bernie Sanders at 16%. That lead though is narrower in New Hampshire, with Biden holding just a 2-point advantage over Sanders in the Granite State, and a 6-point lead over Warren.

In head to head polls, all of the Democratic front-runners are beating President Donald Trump. Fox News last week had Biden with a 12-point advantage over the president, and leads of 9 points for Sanders, 7 points for Warren and 6 points for Sen. Kamala Harris.

Meanwhile the Biden campaign released its first television ad, which will run in Iowa and will cost “high six figures.”"
National Space Council meeting highlights moon and Mars plan – plus nuclear power,https://www.geekwire.com,['Alan Boyle'],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.geekwire.com/2019/national-space-council-meeting-highlights-moon-mars-plan-plus-nuclear-power/,"The latest meeting of the National Space Council provided a forum to build support for NASA’s twin-focus plan to send astronauts to the moon in preparation for trips to Mars – and for the idea of using nuclear-powered rockets to get there.

In contrast to some of the council’s past meetings, today’s session at the National Air and Space Museum’s Udvar-Hazy Center in Virginia produced no Space Policy Directives with capital letters. Instead, administration officials – led by Vice President Mike Pence – summarily approved a set of recommendations aimed at fostering cooperation with commercial ventures and international partners on NASA’s moon-to-Mars initiative.

The recommendations give NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine a 60-day timeline for designating an office and submitting a plan for sustainable lunar surface exploration and the development of technologies and capabilities for crewed missions to Mars. At the next National Space Council meeting, Bridenstine is tasked with presenting a plan “to stabilize the Space Launch System and Orion programs and prevent future cost and schedule overruns.”

Bridenstine pointed out that NASA is already working on elements of Project Artemis, which aims to send the “next man and the first woman” to the moon by 2024.

He referred to last week’s announcement that NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama would be in charge of developing a crew-capable lunar lander – one of the pieces in the Artemis puzzle that still has to be identified. Bridenstine also obliquely addressed the rivalry between Marshall and Johnson Space Center in Texas, promising that JSC “is going to be very involved” in lander development.

Pence said Bridenstine told him that with Congress’ support, “we can actually start ‘bending metal’ on the lander in the next year … whatever that means.” For what it’s worth, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin space venture is among several companies proposing lander concepts for moon missions.

NASA’s first heavy-lift Space Launch System “will be fully assembled by the end of this year,” Pence said, in preparation for an uncrewed test flight around the moon and back that’s set for next year. That mission, known as Artemis 1, is to be followed by a crewed circumlunar mission scheduled for as early as 2022 (Artemis 2) and then the first crewed lunar landing since Apollo (Artemis 3).

Today’s recommendations call on Bridenstine to specify the “current projected launch windows” for Artemis 1 and Artemis 2 at the next council meeting.

Looking further ahead, the vice president said the moon would serve as a “training ground for the infinite frontier of space,” with a multi-month expedition at the lunar south pole serving as a highlight.

Other officials on the council provided updates on initiatives to streamline the regulatory process for space operations – and to address the national security challenges posed by China and Russia.

The acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, said that the intelligence community, the National Reconnaissance Office and the Defense Department have agreed upon a “unified defense concept of operations” in the event of an attack on space assets.

“Should conflict extend to space, the NRO will take direction from the commander of U.S. Space Command and execute defensive space operations based on a jointly developed playbook and informed by a series of exercises and war games,” he said.

The newly reorganized U.S. Space Command is due to swing into operation on Aug. 29 under the command of Air Force Gen. John “Jay” Raymond. During today’s meeting, Maguire and Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, both called for the speedy creation of a Space Force, which is currently being considered in Congress.

Space nuclear power figured prominently in today’s discussion: White House science adviser Kelvin Droegemeier announced that a working group organized by the Office of Science and Technology Policy has completed a set of guidelines for the safe use of nuclear power sources in space – ranging from the radioisotope thermoelectric generators that have long been a part of missions beyond Earth orbit to specially built nuclear reactors for spacecraft.

Hours later, the White House issued the guidelines in the form of a presidential memorandum to federal agencies. The memo lays out radiation safety standards for space nuclear systems, and states that presidential approval would be required to launch a system that makes use of nuclear fission. Federal officials have been given a year to draw up a report identifying additional guidelines for nuclear systems.

Nuclear fission reactors have never been flown in space, although at one time such a system was proposed for a NASA mission called the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter. Researchers at NASA and other federal labs are studying a concept that could lead to nuclear reactors being placed on the moon and Mars.

Bridenstine said nuclear-powered propulsion systems would be “absolutely a game-changer”:for space travel. Rex Geveden, CEO of BWX Technologies, said nuclear propulsion could reduce the travel time for a Mars-bound crew from six or seven months to three or four months. That would reduce the radiation risk for astronauts heading to Mars – and Bridenstine noted other benefits as well.

“It’s not just for reducing the radiation dose for humans flying through deep space, but also national security implications,” he said. “How do we maneuver within low Earth orbit, or cislunar orbits, so that ultimately we can move quickly to various spots based on the threats that we heard about today?”

Bridenstine and Geveden agreed that nuclear power could facilitate applications ranging from off-grid power for combat operations, to directed-energy weapons, to planetary defense against asteroids, to the removal of orbital debris.

Anthony Scaramucci Calls Trump's Visit To El Paso Hospital A 'Catastrophe',https://www.huffpost.com,['Trends Reporter'],08-10-2019,2019,8,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/anthony-scaramucci-trump-el-paso-catastrophe_n_5d4e7bfae4b0820e0af5dd3e,"Anthony Scaramucci, who worked for his pal Donald Trump in the White House for all of 11 days, called the president’s visit to an El Paso, Texas, hospital a “catastrophe.”

“So, look, the president didn’t do well on the trip” Wednesday, the short-time White House communications director told Chris Matthews on MSNBC’s “Hardball” on Thursday.

The president was supposed to comfort victims of the Walmart mass shooting that killed 22 people and help the country heal. Instead he boasted about the size of the crowd at his campaign rally in the city earlier in the year, blasted El Paso native and Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke as “crazy,” and gave a big grinning thumbs-up while posing for a photo with a baby orphaned in the El Paso attack.

“The facts are he did not do well on the trip, because if the trip is being made about him and not the demonstration of compassion and love and caring and empathy for those people, then it becomes a catastrophe for him, the administration, and it’s also a bad reflection on the country,” Scaramucci said.

Scaramucci also tore into White House aides who trashed Trump anonymously to the press about how poorly the president came off in El Paso. He called aides “cowards” for picking up the phone to complain to a reporter — and not call the president on his behavior. “They should tell the guy the truth,” he added.

Scaramucci last month called the president’s vicious attacks on four Democratic congresswomen of color “racist and unacceptable.”

How many migrants show up for immigration court hearings?,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Salvador Rizzo', 'Reporter For The Fact Checker']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/06/26/how-many-migrants-show-up-immigration-court-hearings/,"“The vast majority never show up for their hearing, you know, a year, 18 months, down the road.”

— Vice President Pence, in an interview on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” June 23, 2019

Pence: “What we want: To end the days where people believe they can come into the country, make a claim of asylum from oppression or deprivation or violence in Central America or elsewhere, and then be released into the country on their own recognizance only to vanish into the nation.”

Jake Tapper, CNN: “Well, most of them do show up to their hearings.”

Pence: “Ninety percent of the people never show up for their hearing in the months ahead. ... The overwhelming majority, plus-90 percent, don’t show up.”

— Exchange on CNN’s “State of the Union,” June 23, 2019

As the Trump administration calls for tighter immigration laws, officials from the president on down claim almost all migrants are gaming the system because they fail to show up for court.

The nation’s nearly 400 immigration judges are under a mountain of backlogged cases, and hundreds of thousands of Central Americans continue to arrive at the border each year. Because of a lack of holding capacity and a court settlement requiring the release of children, U.S. immigration authorities allow many migrant families into the country while they wait for hearings.

On CBS, Pence claimed that “the vast majority” never show up. On CNN, he said the rate of no-shows was “plus-90 percent.”

The rate of no-shows is far below 90 percent, according to the Department of Justice’s most recent annual figures. When using the Justice Department’s preferred metric, 44 percent of migrants who were not in custody failed to show up for their court proceedings.

That’s half the rate Pence claimed. And some researchers say that the Justice Department numbers don’t tell the whole story and that the real rate is less than 44 percent.

The Facts

A migrant either attends a court hearing or doesn’t attend. It’s a yes-or-no question that lends itself to simple math. Yet the numbers vary widely.

Because immigration court records are secret, the government’s statistics are difficult to verify. Some of them measure a subset of immigration cases and tell one story. Some numbers crunched by researchers tell another story. The picture can be blurry because an immigration case may involve several hearings over more than one year.

We reviewed statistics from the Justice Department (which runs the immigration courts), the Department of Homeland Security (which oversees the border) and independent researchers analyzing court records.

The Justice Department reports no-show statistics based on “initial case completions,” a metric that doesn’t count some migrants who show up for court but have their cases postponed or who don’t get a resolution. Completed cases sometimes are reopened and result in different outcomes.

Pence’s claim distorts what acting Homeland Security secretary Kevin McAleenan told the Senate Judiciary Committee in a June 11 hearing. The panel chairman, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), asked “what percentage of the people show up for the asylum hearing?”

“So, it depends on the demographic, the court, but we do see too many cases where people are not showing up,” McAleenan said. “We did an expedited pilot with family units this year with ICE [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] and the immigration courts. Out of those 7,000 cases, 90 [percent] received final orders of removal in absentia, 90 percent.”

He added, “That is a recent sample from families crossing the border.”

Notice how McAleenan framed his answer. The 90 percent rate he gave was based on a sample of 7,000 cases being fast-tracked through the immigration courts, not all cases.

A representative for Pence told us he “was referring to a pilot program launched under DHS,” the same one McAleenan brought up to the Senate Judiciary Committee.

But Pence did not hedge his comments as McAleenan did and instead indicated that 90 percent of all migrants never show up for court. When CNN anchor Jake Tapper challenged him, Pence dug in. “The overwhelming majority, plus-90 percent, don’t show up,” he said.

Graham’s question was about asylum hearings, not about all immigration cases. From fiscal 2013 through 2017, asylum applicants received deportation orders “in absentia” in 6 percent to 11 percent of cases per year, according to the most recent statistics yearbook from the Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review. The term “in absentia” is used when someone didn’t show up to court.

Let’s take a look at the different statistics measuring court appearance rates for migrants.

McAleenan

In September, the Justice Department began to prioritize immigration cases for family units “with the goal of completing these cases within a year of initiation,” a DHS official told us. This fast-track initiative is sometimes called the “rocket docket.”

“As of April 2019, out of approximately 7,700 total removal orders for rocket docket cases, over 6,700 were in absentia,” the DHS official told us. That’s 87 percent.

When Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) challenged these numbers at the June 11 hearing, McAleenan said, “I gave you the recent numbers of over 7,000 families that we put through a process to try to get court results more quickly: 90 percent of them did not show up for their hearings.”

McAleenan didn’t claim that this no-show rate of 90 percent applies broadly to all migrants. He was talking strictly about the rocket docket.

These figures come from the Justice Department, which reports court appearance rates on the basis of initial case completions, as we’ve noted. That measure will not count migrants who show up for court but whose hearings are postponed or whose cases remain pending.

“Early numbers from a ‘rocket docket’ is a really horrible place to get in absentia rates, since those who are fighting their cases have not had sufficient time to be resolved and rocket dockets tend to cause more in absentia orders,” Sarah Pierce, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, wrote in an email.

“Since the docket is brand-new, pretty much the only cases which had ended [as of April] were the ones where the person missed court, so that number ignored the huge number of pending cases where the family had appeared but the case was ongoing,” Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, an analyst at the American Immigration Council, wrote in an email.

“As we’ve seen, many migrants who claim asylum and are permitted into the U.S. often disappear before a judge decides the case in court,” the DHS official said. “This act directly undermines legal immigration procedures. We have and continue to take unprecedented action to ensure the integrity of the immigration process.”

Justice Department

The Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) publishes yearly statistics detailing the number of migrants who were issued deportation orders after failing to show up for court. These numbers are based on initial case completions. Pierce said “these rates only count final decisions, not pending cases in which people are attending their hearings.”

“I usually try to use older FYs [fiscal years] to talk about in absentia rates, because for the older numbers there’s been more time for the slower-moving cases in which people are attending to resolve,” she added.

The EOIR statistics include four categories: “never detained,” “released,” “unaccompanied alien children” and “asylum.” They also include a total for all cases.



(Executive Office for Immigration Review/Department of Justice)

Judges ordered in absentia removals in 14 percent of all cases in fiscal 2013, a rate that grew to 28 percent in fiscal 2017.

An EOIR fact sheet from May highlights that 44 percent of non-detained migrants were ordered out of the country after missing their court dates. That means 56 percent, a majority, did show up.

When we previously asked EOIR about this, a spokeswoman for the office told us the asylum category includes some migrants who are in custody and thus are unable to skip their court dates.

Focusing on migrants who aren’t detained is a reasonable way to assess the data when trying to determine how many skip their hearings, though we note that the asylum category includes a mix of people who are both detained or released (there’s no breakdown in the EOIR yearbook).

The Justice Department for this fact-check highlighted other data points. Spokesman Alexei Woltornist said “only 13 out of every 100 credible fear claims are granted asylum” and sent us this flow chart. (That’s notable, but asylum grant rates don’t indicate how many migrants attend their court hearings.)

Back to the rocket docket. It’s a pilot program in 10 cities. Woltornist said the rate of in absentia deportation orders for family units had decreased to 82 percent as of June 14. An EOIR table shows that 56,286 cases had been opened on the rocket docket, 13,313 of them had been initially completed, and judges had issued 10,877 in absentia removal orders. (A footnote says that EOIR relies on DHS officials to identify family units and that these numbers don’t include all the families currently in immigration court proceedings nationwide.)

TRAC

Researchers at the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at Syracuse University in a June 18 report found that 81 percent of migrant families attended all their court hearings, measuring from September through May.

“Thus, court records directly contradict the widely quoted claim that ’90 Percent of Recent Asylum Seekers Skipped Their Hearings,’” the report says, linking to an article about McAleenan’s testimony on June 11.

How is it possible that 81 percent of families attend all their hearings, when the Justice Department says the attendance rates are much lower? (And not just the Justice Department — an older data set from TRAC covering 2014 to 2018 shows that 49 percent of families attended their hearings.)

Susan B. Long, the co-director of TRAC and a managerial statistics professor at Syracuse University, said the difference is in counting all ongoing cases instead of only completed cases. “We didn’t remove anything,” she said. “It’s exactly how the data is recorded.”

Of 46,743 families, 85.5 percent attended their initial hearing and 81 percent attended all their hearings, according to TRAC. “Most have had only one scheduled hearing,” Long said. For those families with legal representation, the attendance rate was 99.9 percent at the first hearing and 99 percent for all hearings, the TRAC report says.

Woltornist, the Justice Department spokesman, said, “I don’t know exactly where they got the numbers.” The TRAC report says researchers obtained records from the nation’s immigration courts by filing requests to EOIR under the Freedom of Information Act.

The Pinocchio Test

This game of telephone went badly awry.

McAleenan gave flawed statistics in response to Graham’s question. They were not about asylum hearings and they covered only those families with cases on the rocket docket. That’s a pilot program in 10 cities, so it doesn’t represent what’s happening nationwide.

The numbers McAleenan gave ran from September to April. A small share of the rocket docket cases had been completed in that period. Because of the way the Justice Department reports court appearance rates for migrants — based on completed cases — the numbers from McAleenan presented an inflated picture of how many skip their hearings. In absentia cases are closed right away; ongoing cases in which families initially show up for court are not factored into the statistics.

But this is a fact-check of the vice president, who went on national television and claimed “plus-90 percent” of migrants skip their court hearings. It’s a Four Pinocchio claim relying only on the Justice Department’s figures.

We noted flaws in McAleenan’s numbers, but he disclosed that he was talking about a pilot program limited to 7,000 cases. Pence did not make the same distinction on CBS or CNN. He spoke in terms of all immigration cases nationwide.

The Justice Department’s preferred metric shows that 44 percent of migrants who are not in custody miss their court hearings. That’s half the rate Pence claimed.

TRAC’s analysis shows that when counting court appearances instead of completed cases, and when counting all family units instead of only those on the rocket docket, the vast majority of migrant families attended their hearings from September through May.

Toledo. Fck me. — Tim Ryan (@TimRyan) August 5, 2019

That’s how the Ohio congressman and longshot presidential hopeful reacted to President Trump’s prepared speech in which he mistakenly referred to Toledo, not Dayton, as the location of one of the weekend’s two deadly mass shootings.

“May God bless the memory of those who perished in Toledo. May God protect them. May God protect all of those from Texas to Ohio. May God bless the victims and their families,” Trump said from the White House.

Watch the speech:

As with seemingly everything Trump says or does, the reaction was swift. Check out how abruptly Toledo began trending on Google GOOG, +1.53% :

To be fair, it wasn’t a good day for septuagenarian politicians, in general.

Joe Biden also took some hits after he got the locations wrong when addressing the shootings on Sunday night. In pool comments reported by the Hill, Biden referred to “tragic events” in Houston and Michigan before correcting himself.

Trump says tweeting is his ‘ONLY FORM OF DEFENSE’ against hostile press,https://www.rt.com,[],,,,https://www.rt.com/usa/465447-trump-twitter-press-defense/,"Trump explained his penchant for Twitter, arguing that the platform allows him to fight back against biased media coverage. He said his prolific and often divisive tweeting wouldn’t be necessary if the press covered him fairly.

Questioned about his controversial tweets and their effect on the country’s political climate, President Donald Trump told C-SPAN’s Steve Scully that he simply needed a way to counter the “fake news” media.

If I got fair coverage I wouldn’t even have to tweet. It’s my only form of defense. If the press covered me fairly, I wouldn’t need that. But they don’t cover me fairly.

He complained that instead of covering the contents of a speech he gave in Jamestown, the media fixated on a protester who interrupted his address.

“It wasn’t like, ‘Gee we have 25,000 people going crazy. There was one person,” he stressed, describing the media’s infatuation with the incident as “terrible” and “sad.”

Many of Trump’s most controversial tweets have taken aim at the news outlets. He recently fired off a series of posts attacking the “Fake News Media,” claiming that traditional news outlets have lost “tremendous credibility” and are not as “important or powerful” as social media.

Some of his criticisms may be warranted, however, given the media’s proclivity for pushing anti-Trump narratives – even when the facts aren’t on their side. In one recent and particularly glaring example, a Vox journalist boldly claimed that Donald Trump suggested he was a “9/11 first responder” – despite the fact that the clip posted by the reporter himself shows the president saying the exact opposite.

Trump has been battling the US media and its “fake news” since before he took office, going so far as to refuse questions from journalists and news outlets that he perceives as hostile. Critics, especially in the media, say that Trump’s contempt for the press is due to the fact that the president doesn’t want to be transparent.

This article is more than 4 weeks old

Donald Trump lashed out again on Saturday on the subject of impeachment and the former special counsel Robert Mueller’s testimony on Capitol Hill, which the president called “the greatest display of ineptitude [and] incompetence that the Halls of Congress have ever seen”.

Trump 'rat-infested' attack on Elijah Cummings was racist, Pelosi says Read more

“Truth is, he had no facts on his side,” the president tweeted on Saturday. “Nothing he could do!”

Mueller appeared before the House judiciary and intelligence committees on Wednesday.

As promised, he discussed plentiful facts about Russian election interference, links between Trump and Moscow and instances of potential obstruction of justice by the president.

But he did not stray beyond the contents of his 448-page report, which was published with redactions in April.

That meant that while Mueller repeated that he did not find evidence of a conspiracy between Trump and Moscow, he also repeated that he did not exonerate the president over matters of obstruction of justice.

Amid widespread discussion of the 74-year-old former FBI director’s halting performance and uncertain demeanour, the Washington Post reported on Saturday that “some lawmakers are privately wondering whether there was some truth to … rumours” that Mueller “might not be as sharp as he once was”.

We may decide to recommend articles of impeachment at some point, we may not, it remains to be seen Jerrold Nadler

A spokesman for Mueller declined to comment, the Post said.

Trump seemed to seize on such reports: “The [Democrats] are now coming out of shock from the terrible Mueller performance, and are starting to spin impeachment all over again. How sick [and] disgusting and bad for our country are they. What they are doing is so wrong, but they do it anyway. [Democrats] have become the do nothing party!”

As the House went into recess on Friday for a six-week summer break, more than 100 Democrats had come out in support of taking steps toward impeachment.

No formal process to remove the president has been initiated but on Friday the House judiciary committee, which would initiate proceedings, filed a new lawsuit in an effort to obtain secret grand jury material underlying Mueller’s report. The suit mentioned the word impeachment 76 times.

The committee member Eric Swalwell said: “This is an impeachment investigation [about] whether we should recommend articles of impeachment to our caucus.”

The committee chair, Jerrold Nadler of New York, said before Mueller’s testimony there was plentiful evidence Trump had committed “high crimes and misdemeanours”, the constitutional standard for impeachment. On Friday, though, he said “too much has been made of the phrase ‘impeachment inquiry’.

“We are using our full Article I powers to investigate the conduct of the president and to consider what remedies there are,” Nadler said, referring to the constitution. “Among other things we will consider are, obviously, recommending articles of impeachment.”

He added: “We may decide to recommend articles of impeachment at some point, we may not, it remains to be seen.”

At her weekly news conference, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said: “We will proceed when we have what we need to proceed, not one day sooner.”

The new court petition is among a half-dozen legal actions pursued by House Democrats, who contend that Trump is obstructing their constitutional duty to conduct oversight by withholding documents and preventing witnesses from testifying.

Senior figures including Pelosi have noted that the third article of impeachment against Richard Nixon was his obstruction of Congress. The 37th president resigned before he was officially impeached.

Next week, Nadler is expected to file a lawsuit to try to enforce a subpoena against Donald McGahn, the former White House counsel and a key Mueller witness. It challenges the White House claim that its former employees have “absolute immunity” from testifying before Congress.

After Mueller testified, Pelosi told Democrats that if they wanted to come out publicly in favour of impeachment, to do it in a way that did not make it a moral imperative. The next morning, she told lawmakers to say what they wanted on the subject but in way that did not challenge other Democrats’ views.

Pelosi’s comments were relayed to the Associated Press by three people unauthorised to speak publicly. Some Democrats grumbled that the investigations were becoming “endless”, one source said. But others said Democrats were elected in large part because voters want them to stand up to Trump."

Except for one little problem.

The presidential seal that lit up the screen behind him was doctored to include the two-headed eagle on the Russian coat of arms, holding a set of golf clubs. The Washington Post also pointed out that the seal featured a banner reading “45 es un titere,” Spanish for “45 is a puppet.”

Here’s the full speech.

A White House spokesperson told the Washington Post they did not see the fake seal before it was displayed on-screen.

CNN reported the person responsible for the mistake was fired.

“One of our video team members did a Google Image search for a high-res png (file) presidential seal,” a source told CNN, adding that the individual “did the search and with the pressure of the event, didn’t notice that it is a doctored seal.”

Here's the 1 Robert Mueller testimony moment all the late night hosts picked up on,https://mashable.com,['Sam Haysom'],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://mashable.com/article/robert-mueller-testimony-late-night-segments/,"Wednesday was a long day.

It was especially long for former special counsel Robert Mueller, who testified before two Congressional committees for a solid six hours. It was also a long day for Donald Trump, who — despite saying he ""wasn't going to be watching"" the testimony — basically spent all of Wednesday live-tweeting it.

Obviously six hours makes for a lot of footage to wade through, with plenty of moments to pick up — Twitter chose this one. Despite this, the majority of the late night show segments on Mueller's testimony had one thing in common: The hosts all picked up on the same exchange, which took place between Mueller and Republican Ken Buck.

Here's the moment, during which Mueller confirms Trump could be charged with obstruction of justice after he leaves office.

We've rounded up what late night show hosts Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, and Seth Meyers had to say about it below...

Stephen Colbert

""Now, according to Justice Department guidelines, you can't indict a sitting president — not allowed to do it,"" says Colbert at 5:17 in the Late Show clip above. ""But that doesn't last forever.""

Colbert then plays the clip featuring the Buck/Mueller exchange, before suggesting a new campaign slogan for the president: ""Trump 2020: I'm too pretty for jail.""

Jimmy Kimmel

""A poorly selected question from Congressman Ken Buck made it clear that Trump might need to win in 2020 just to stay out of jail,"" says Kimmel at 1:25 above, before rolling the same clip.

""And that's when you could hear Melania cheering loudly from down the block,"" he jokes.

Seth Meyers

""Oh, those were very fast yesses,"" says Meyers on Late Night after rewatching Buck's exchange with Mueller.

""That guy was a Republican. He was a Republican who accidentally got Robert Mueller to say on national television that after Trump leaves office, he could be charged with a crime.

‘A Constant Game of Musical Chairs’ Amid Another Homeland Security Shake-Up,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Zolan Kanno-Youngs', 'Maggie Haberman']",06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/us/politics/mark-morgan-ice-cbp.html,"In an interview on Tuesday for a coming book about the president’s immigration policies, Mr. Trump acknowledged the tumult among his top immigration officials.

“I do burn out on people, I do. If somebody’s not really great, I do,” the president said during the interview in the Oval Office. He did not directly address the turnover at Customs and Border Protection, but said he had made “good changes” in the people who run his immigration agencies.

“I understand what I want,” he said. “And we’re starting to get there.”

The White House directed Kevin McAleenan, the acting secretary of homeland security, to replace Mr. Sanders with Mr. Morgan after multiple White House officials expressed displeasure that Mr. Sanders was not being aggressive enough at the southwestern border, administration officials said. Mr. McAleenan complied, hoping to diminish friction with the White House, officials said.

Mr. McAleenan resisted an earlier push by Stephen Miller, the architect behind Mr. Trump’s immigration policy, to appoint Mr. Morgan as the head of Customs and Border Protection, according to current and former homeland security officials.

In 2017, shortly after he took office, Mr. Trump forced out Mr. Morgan as Border Patrol chief. But Mr. Morgan won the approval of the White House after backing the president’s aggressive policies on television. In one appearance on Fox News, Mr. Morgan said that when he looked into the eyes of detained migrant children, he saw a “soon-to-be MS-13 gang member.”

In a letter to Customs and Border Protection employees on Tuesday, Mr. Sanders confirmed his departure.

“Although I will leave it to you to determine whether I was successful,” Mr. Sanders, a former chief technology officer at the Transportation Security Administration who helped spearhead the agency’s PreCheck program, wrote, “I can unequivocally say that helping support the amazing men and women of C.B.P. has been the most fulfilling and satisfying opportunity of my career.”"
Judge rules Democrats’ emoluments lawsuit against Trump can proceed,https://www.marketwatch.com,['Associated Press'],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/judge-rules-democrats-emoluments-lawsuit-against-trump-can-proceed-2019-06-25,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge ruled Tuesday that a lawsuit that accuses President Donald Trump of profiting off the presidency in violation of the Constitution’s emoluments clause can move forward.

U.S. District Judge Emmett G. Sullivan of the District of Columbia ruled against Justice Department lawyers who sought a mid-case appeal to a higher court and a stay on proceedings in the meantime.

The case brought by nearly 200 congressional Democrats argues that Trump has been accepting gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval. Trump, unlike modern presidents before him, has declined to fully divest from his businesses.

The lawmakers say Trump’s unwillingness to ask permission is akin to denying lawmakers the right to do their jobs.

The judge’s decision clears the way for the lawmakers to begin issuing subpoenas for information as early as Friday.

Tuesday’s ruling came as Trump was heading to a roundtable event and fundraiser with supporters at his namesake hotel in Washington, just steps from the White House.

“This case should have been dismissed,” said Justice Department spokeswoman Kelly Laco. “It presents important questions that warrant immediate appellate review and is another impractical attempt to disrupt and distract the President from his official duties. The Department of Justice will appeal the court’s decision.”

The Trump Organization did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi welcomed the ruling. As the Trump administration largely stonewalls congressional investigations, House Democrats have increasingly turned to the courts for relief. It’s the latest of several recent court rulings in their favor.

“No one is above the law — not even the president,” Pelosi said in a statement. “Once again, the courts have resoundingly reaffirmed our efforts to hold the President accountable for corruption, and ensure that the President acts in the public interest, not his own interest.”

One of the lead lawmakers in the suit, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., tweeted, “This tremendous victory assures that President Trump will be held accountable to the Constitution & the American people — a historic triumph for legally mandated transparency.”

The case argues that the president has received foreign government favors, such as Chinese government trademarks for his companies, payments for hotel room stays and event-space rentals by representatives of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and proceeds from Chinese or Emirati-linked government purchases of office space in Trump Tower.

Ethics experts say the Revolutionary War-era Emolument Clause was written into the U.S. Constitution to ensure that government officials act with the interests of the American public in mind instead of their own pocketbooks.

Unlike prior presidents, Trump chose not to divest from his assets and he remains the owner of the Trump Organization, a sprawling business empire with 550 entities in more than 20 countries that include branded hotels, golf courses, licensing deals and other interests. His Washington, D.C., hotel is near the White House and has become a magnet for foreign governments, previously hosting groups tied to Kuwait, Bahrain, Turkey, Malaysia and Saudi Arabia."

LIVE: Robert Mueller Testimony: Former Special Counsel Speaks About His Report,https://www.youtube.com,[],,,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAOwsv26wK4,"Streamed live on Jul 24, 2019

Robert S. Mueller III, the former special counsel, testifies before the House Judiciary Committee and House Intelligence Committee about his report on the investigation into the 2016 election and President Donald Trump.



Mueller has vowed to keep his testimony limited to the contents of his report, which was released to the public in April with some information redacted. Ahead of Wednesday’s hearing, the Department of Justice advised Mueller his testimony “must remain within the boundaries of your public report because matters within the scope of your investigation were covered by executive privilege.”

Judge Rejects Government’s Request to Halt Emoluments Suit Against Trump,https://www.nytimes.com,['Sharon Lafraniere'],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/us/politics/trump-emoluments-lawsuit.html,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge refused on Tuesday to halt a lawsuit by congressional Democrats alleging that President Trump has illegally profited from his business while in office, and ordered evidence gathering to begin on Friday.

The Justice Department said it would appeal the ruling by Judge Emmet G. Sullivan of United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Many legal experts predict that the extraordinary contest over whether Mr. Trump has violated the so-called emoluments clauses of the Constitution will eventually reach the Supreme Court.

The president’s lawyers had asked Judge Sullivan to delay the lawsuit, which was filed by nearly 200 congressional Democrats, while they appealed his earlier rulings to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. But in a 12-page opinion, Judge Sullivan said the president had failed to meet the high standard required to put aside the usual procedure of appealing a judicial decision at the end of a case."

Mueller to Testify on Russia Probe Before Congress,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Erin Banco', 'National Security Reporter']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.thedailybeast.com/mueller-to-testify-on-russia-probe-before-congress,"Special Counsel Robert Mueller has agreed to testify before Congress on July 17 on his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, the House Judiciary Committee and House Intelligence Committee announced Tuesday night.

In a joint statement, House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler and House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff said that Mueller had agreed to testify in an open session.

“Americans have demanded to hear directly from the Special Counsel so they can understand what he and his team examined, uncovered, and determined about Russia’s attack on our democracy, the Trump campaign’s acceptance and use of that help, and President Trump and his associates' obstruction of the investigation into that attack,” they said.

The committees issued subpoenas Tuesday to compel Mueller’s testimony, according to the joint statement. The decision to compel Mueller to testify is a landmark move that will put an end to a months-long saga on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers have for weeks fought to get access to information about whether President Trump obstructed justice.

Part of the congressional efforts, which took place over the last several months, have consisted of suing for documents related to the president and subpoenaing former Trump officials to testify about their time working with the president. But the White House has put forward a strategy of stonewalling Congress at every move, exerting executive privilege and preventing former officials and staffers from testifying.

Mueller’s appearance will mark the first time that anyone from the special counsel’s office has appeared before Congress to testify about the Russia investigation. Throughout the past two years the office has remained steadfast in its silence—only once commenting on a news report. And Congress will be able to question the man at the helm of that investigation about why he and his team said in their report that they could not absolve the president.

Members of both committees are likely to pepper Mueller with questions about what evidence they collected in considering whether President Trump obstructed justice. Lawmakers may also ask why the special counsel’s office decided to allow the president to prepare written answers to interview questions and how Mueller worked with Attorney General Bill Barr in preparing the release of the report. But the former special counsel is not likely to answer questions from Congress about anything outside of the scope of what is written in the report.

Still, Democrats view Mueller’s mere presence in front of Congress, on national television, as a win.

Democratic aides have told The Daily Beast over the last several months that if all else failed, they would at least be able to get Mueller to testify publicly about the report. “That’s all we need,” one aide said earlier this month, adding that the Democrats could win simply by having the former special counsel answer questions in a public setting about the report. “Most Americans haven’t read the Mueller report,” another aide said.

But the negotiations to get Mueller into Congress proved to be more difficult than some lawmakers anticipated. On Tuesday, the committees wrote Mueller a letter, saying they had “consistently communicated” their intention to issue subpoenas, if necessary. “We now understand it is necessary to do so,” the letter said, at the same time acknowledging the former special counsel’s preference of not testifying in front of Congress.

“Nevertheless, the American public deserves to hear directly from you about your investigation and conclusions,” the letter said.

The committee has been working with the Department of Justice on negotiating terms for Mueller’s appearance over the last several weeks. The negotiations have been prolonged in part because of Mueller’s announcement that he would leave the Department of Justice and retire to private life. In his press conference last month in which he announced his resignation, Mueller said he did not wish to appear in front of Congress.

“I hope and expect this to be the only time that I will speak to you in this manner. I am making that decision myself. No one has told me whether I can or should testify or speak further about this matter,” Mueller said in a prepared statement at the time. “There has been discussion about an appearance before Congress. Any testimony from this office would not go beyond our report. It contains our findings and analysis and the reasons for the decisions we made. We chose those words carefully and the work speaks for itself. And the report is my testimony.”

But Mueller’s press conference left lawmakers on Capitol Hill wanting more. In his statement, Mueller also said: “If we had had confidence that the President clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so.”

That remark set off a firestorm of requests from Democrats on the Hill demanding that the House move to impeachment proceedings, saying Mueller’s non-exoneration of Trump was what they needed to move forward. (Mueller and his team had also written in the report that they could not clear the president of wrongdoing.)

Negotiations about Mueller’s potential appearance initially were conducted between the Judiciary Committee and representatives of DOJ. Several weeks into that process, the committee began working with Mueller directly. The negotiations included extensive conversations about how Mueller would testify, including the possibility of him appearing behind closed doors."
Trump renews racist attack on Squad: 'They're not capable of loving the US',https://www.theguardian.com,['Jon Swaine'],07-21-2019,2019,7,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/21/trump-racist-squad-democrats-omar-ocasio-cortez-tlaib-pressley,"This article is more than 1 month old

The furore over Donald Trump’s racist slurs against four Democratic congresswomen intensified on Sunday, as the president resumed attacking them and posting far-right material online.

Trump claimed in a tweet that he did not believe representatives Ayanna Pressley, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib were “capable of loving our country”.

The allegation, made without evidence, was the latest in a series of grave attacks Trump has directed at the four ethnic-minority congresswomen, who hail from the left of the Democratic party and have been sharply critical of his presidency.

Last week, Trump said the congresswomen should “go back” to the countries they came from, despite three of the four having been born in the US and the fourth, Omar, being a US citizen who came to America as a child refugee.

Trump supporters at a rally in North Carolina responded to his criticisms of Omar, who fled war in Somalia, by chanting “send her back”. Following widespread condemnation, Trump falsely claimed he had tried to halt the chants.

Republicans in Washington have largely supported Trump through the controversy. When the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives voted to officially condemn his racist remarks, only four of 197 Republicans joined the rebuke.

On Sunday, Elijah Cummings, a Democrat from Maryland, said statements made by Trump and his supporters reminded him of abuse he received as a black child in the 1960s, at the height of the struggle for civil rights.

“I heard the same kind of chant, ‘Go home, you don’t belong here.’ And they called us the N-word over and over and over again,” Cummings told ABC’s This Week. He said some of his constituents were scared of the president.

Trump and his aides say he is targeting the congresswomen purely because of their criticism of contemporary America. The Democrats’ defenders note that Trump, the author of a book titled Crippled America, repeatedly assailed the US under Barack Obama and campaigned for the White House on a promise to “make America great again”.

In remarks released on Sunday, Mike Pence, the vice-president, defended Trump but did not reiterate the president’s most controversial comments. Asked if the congresswomen could be critical of the US and stay in the country, Pence told CBS: “Of course they can stay … they’re American citizens.”

Stephen Miller, a senior White House aide, and Mercedes Schlapp, a senior adviser on Trump’s re-election campaign, also appeared on Sunday TV shows to attack the congresswomen – who are known as “the Squad” – and to claim Trump is not racist.

Amid criticism of his handling of the supporters in North Carolina, Trump said he had disagreed with their chant, having given no hint of this during the event or in remarks praising the crowd afterwards. He later hailed them as “incredible patriots”.

Pence said on Sunday Trump “might make an effort to speak out about it” if a similar chant broke out in future.

Trump attracted further criticism over the weekend by sharing a series of tweets by Katie Hopkins, a far-right British commentator, with his 62 million followers.

One of Hopkins’s posts called for a British leader to echo Trump’s “Don’t like this country? Then leave” rhetoric. Another criticised Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, who has been repeatedly insulted by Trump.

Hopkins, a former reality TV contestant, was fired by LBC radio after calling for a “final solution” during an anti-Muslim tirade in response to the deadly suicide bombing at a concert in Manchester in May 2017.

She had previously likened immigrants to cockroaches in a newspaper column, stating they were “spreading like the norovirus” and proposing gunships should be used to stop them crossing the Mediterranean.

When pushed, some Republicans, particularly those from swing states likely to decide the outcome of next year’s election, have distanced themselves from Trump’s remarks.

Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican of Wisconsin, said he disagreed with the president’s allegation about the congresswomen being incapable of loving the US.

“That’s his opinion. I don’t agree with it,” Johnson told CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday.

But Trump’s tactics were defended by many others including Rick Santorum, a former senator and presidential candidate.

“He says things to bring attention to these issues. And I know it’s hair-on-fire time for everybody on the left, but we’re talking about it,” Santorum told CNN.

While some Democrats echoed suggestions that Trump was cleverly setting a political trap, Ocasio-Cortez dismissed concerns that the president was playing what she called “3-D racism chess”.

The New York congresswoman said in a tweet: “He’s simply an impulsive racist, one who leaves his party scrambling to excuse bigotry and scam the country.”"
