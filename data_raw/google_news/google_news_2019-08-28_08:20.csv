President Trump is so eager to complete hundreds of miles of border fence ahead of the 2020 presidential election that he has directed aides to fast-track billions of dollars’ worth of construction contracts, aggressively seize private land and disregard environmental rules, according to current and former officials involved with the project.

He also has told worried subordinates that he will pardon them of any potential wrongdoing should they have to break laws to get the barriers built quickly, those officials said.

Trump has repeatedly promised to complete 500 miles of fencing by the time voters go to the polls in November 2020, stirring chants of “Finish the Wall!” at his political rallies as he pushes for tighter border controls. But the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has completed just about 60 miles of “replacement” barrier during the first 2½ years of Trump’s presidency, all of it in areas that previously had border infrastructure.

The president has told senior aides that a failure to deliver on the signature promise of his 2016 campaign would be a letdown to his supporters and an embarrassing defeat. With the election 14 months away and hundreds of miles of fencing plans still in blueprint form, Trump has held regular White House meetings for progress updates and to hasten the pace, according to several people involved in the discussions.

When aides have suggested that some orders are illegal or unworkable, Trump has suggested he would pardon the officials if they would just go ahead, aides said. He has waved off worries about contracting procedures and the use of eminent domain, saying “take the land,” according to officials who attended the meetings.

“Don’t worry, I’ll pardon you,” he has told officials in meetings about the wall.

“He said people expected him to build a wall, and it had to be done by the election,” one former official said.

Asked for comment, a White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Trump is joking when he makes such statements about pardons.

Deputy White House press secretary Hogan Gidley said Tuesday that the president is protecting the country with the addition of new border barriers.

“Donald Trump promised to secure our border with sane, rational immigration policies to make American communities safer, and that’s happening everywhere the wall is being built,” Gidley said. He called internal criticisms of the president “just more fabrications by people who hate the fact the status quo, that has crippled this country for decades, is finally changing as President Trump is moving quicker than anyone in history to build the wall, secure the border and enact the very immigration policies the American people voted for.”

“President Trump is fighting aggressively for the American people where other leaders in the past have rolled over, sold out, and done absolutely nothing,” he said.

Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper is expected to approve a White House request to divert $3.6 billion in Pentagon funds to the barrier project in coming weeks, money that Trump sought after lawmakers refused to allocate $5 billion. The funds will be pulled from Defense Department projects in 26 states, according to administration officials who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the matter.

Trump’s determination to build the barriers as quickly as possible has not diminished his interest in the aesthetic aspects of the project, particularly the requirement that the looming steel barriers be painted black and topped with sharpened tips.

In a meeting at the White House on May 23, Trump ordered the Army Corps and the Department of Homeland Security to paint the structure black, according to internal communications reviewed by The Washington Post.

Administration officials have stopped trying to talk him out of the demands, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is preparing to instruct contractors to apply black paint or coating to all new barrier fencing, the communications show.

Trump conceded last year in an immigration meeting with lawmakers that a wall or barrier is not the most effective mechanism to curb illegal immigration, recognizing it would accomplish less than a major expansion of U.S. enforcement powers and deportation authority. But he told lawmakers that his supporters want a wall and that he has to deliver it.

Trump talked about the loud cheers the wall brought at rallies, according to one person with direct knowledge of the meeting.

Former White House chief of staff John F. Kelly would often tell administration officials to disregard the president’s demands if Kelly did not think they were feasible or legally sound, according to current and former aides.

During a conference call last week, officials at U.S. Customs and Border Protection told Army Corps engineers that the hundreds of miles of fencing must be completed before the next presidential election, according to administration officials with knowledge of the call who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal communications.

“Border Patrol insists on compressed acquisition timelines, and we consent. Their goal is to get contracts awarded, not for us to get a quality contract with a thoroughly vetted contractor,” said one senior official who is concerned the agency has been hurried to hand out contracts as quickly as possible.

Military officials expect more contract protests because the arrangements have been rushed, the official added. The Army Corps already has had to take corrective actions for two procurement contracts, after companies protested.

The companies building the fencing and access roads have been taking heavy earth-moving equipment into environmentally sensitive border areas adjacent to U.S. national parks and wildlife preserves, but the administration has waived procedural safeguards and impact studies, citing national security concerns.

“They don’t care how much money is spent, whether landowners’ rights are violated, whether the environment is damaged, the law, the regs or even prudent business practices,” the senior official said.

CBP has suggested no longer writing risk-assessment memos “related to the fact that we don’t have real estate rights and how this will impact construction,” the official said.

While Trump has insisted that the barriers be painted, the cost of painting them will reduce the length of the fence the government will be able to build. According to the internal analysis, painting or coating 175 miles of barriers “will add between $70 million and $133 million in cost,” trimming the amount of fencing the Army Corps will be able to install by four to seven miles.

In June, teams of U.S. soldiers painted a one-mile section of fence in Calexico, Calif., at a cost of $1 million. The coating, known as “matte black” or “flat black,” absorbs heat, making the fence hot to the touch, more slippery and therefore tougher to climb, according to border agents.

At Trump’s behest, the Army Corps also is preparing to instruct contractors to remove from the upper part of the fence the smooth metal plates that are used to thwart climbers. The president considered that design feature unsightly, according to officials familiar with his directives.

Instead, contractors have been asked to cut the tips of the steel bollards to a sharpened point. Trump had told aides this spring he thought the barrier should be spiked to instill a fear of injury.

The change in the bollard design is likely to reduce the overall length of the barrier by two to three miles, according to the administration’s cost assessments.

CBP has used a pointed design in the past, according to agency officials, either by installing a pyramid-shaped cap or making what the agency refers to as a “miter cut” in the metal.

Trump remains keen to tout incremental progress toward his wall-building commitments, and in recent weeks, top Homeland Security officials have taken to Twitter to promote the advances.

In recent days, DHS leaders including acting CBP chief Mark Morgan and the top official at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Ken Cuccinelli, have tweeted photos of border fence construction, echoing promises that 450 miles of new barrier will be completed by next year. Another senior administration official credited both men with injecting urgency, saying that “things are starting to crank away,” even though Cuccinelli’s agency is not involved in the project.

Dan Scavino Jr., the White House social media director, has asked for video footage and photos of equipment digging up the desert and planting the barriers so that administration officials can tweet about it, aides said.

Administration officials involved in the project also defended the president’s use of eminent domain laws to speed the process.

“There is no more constitutionally permissible public purpose for eminent domain than national defense,” said a current administration official who was not authorized to speak on the record about the contracting process.

“Our intention is to negotiate with every property owner, and every property owner will receive fair market value for the land,” the official said. “But the land that is needed is not replaceable land. This is not like building a hospital or even a school. There is no alternative land to the border.”

CBP and Pentagon officials insist they remain on track to complete about 450 miles of fencing by the election. Of that, about 110 miles will be added to areas where there is currently no barrier. The height of the structure will vary between 18 and 30 feet, high enough to inflict severe injury or death from a fall.

The Border Patrol’s strategic planning and analysis office has not made a final decision on the black paint or other White House design requests .

“Ultimately, we’ll do our assessment and determine what is the best for us operationally,” said Brian Martin, the office’s chief, adding that the agency is waiting to get border agents’ feedback on whether the coating would be beneficial.

Martin also said CBP would continue to install anti-climb panels on portions of the barrier already under contract, calling the design “very vital to overall effectiveness.” But he and other CBP officials said that some new portions of barriers will have the panels and that others will not, a determination that he said will be guided by necessity, not aesthetics.

Trump has recently urged the Army Corps to award a contract to a company he favors, North Dakota-based Fisher Industries, though the firm has not been selected. Fisher has been aggressively pushed by Trump ally Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), who briefly held up the confirmation of a Trump budget office nominee last month in an attempt to put pressure on the Army Corps.

Cramer demanded to see the contracts awarded to Fisher’s competitors, lashing out at the “arrogance” of the Army Corps in emails to military officials after he was told the bidding process involved proprietary information that could not be shared. The CEO of Fisher Industries is a major backer of Cramer and has donated to his campaigns.

[These photos show private border barriers being built on private land]

Cramer visited the El Paso area Tuesday to tour border facilities and view a span of privately funded border fencing Fisher built as a showcase for what it claims are superior construction techniques. Cramer posted videos of his tour to social media. He undertook the tour “to see the crisis at our border firsthand.”

The senator had asked Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite, the commander of the Army Corps, to meet him at the site, but Semonite is traveling in Brazil, where the Trump administration has offered to help fight wildfires in the Amazon.

In an email to The Post, Cramer said he met with CEO Tommy Fisher on Tuesday at a span of fencing the company built on private land; he said Army Corps officials joined them at the site.

“The agents on the ground said the walls have been very helpful in slowing illegal crossings,” Cramer wrote. “I’m not a wall-building expert, but at the pace of the last few years, it’s hard to see how 450 miles gets built with the same process. . . . I wish DHS would engage a whole bunch of builders and innovators rather than rely on the same decades old bureaucracy.”

Cramer said he shared the president’s “frustration” with the pace of progress.

Several administration officials who confirmed the White House’s urgency said they expect to be able to deliver on Trump’s demands because the actual construction of the barriers is typically the last step in the process.

“There is a long lead time to acquiring land, getting permits and identifying funding,” the official said. “I think you will see a dramatic increase in wall construction next year because all of the work over the past two years has primed the pump.”"

"Trump mocks NYT's Bret Stephens: My resort doesn't have 'bedbugs,' but he's 'loaded up with them!'",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Joseph Wulfsohn', 'Joseph A. Wulfsohn Is A Media Reporter For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-nyt-bret-stephens,"President Trump slammed New York Times columnist Bret Stephens, suggesting he's ""loaded up"" with bed bugs.

After the president floated the idea of hosting next year's G-7 summit at his Doral resort, a report resurfaced that his resort settled a lawsuit in 2017 after a New Jersey man named Eric Linder alleged he woke up one morning at Trump's property with bites all over his body.

Trump denied of having any bed bugs at his resort Tuesday morning, blaming ""Radical Left Democrats"" for spreading ""nasty rumors.""

However, the president took the opportunity on Tuesday night to repeat his denial about the alleged bed bug problem and hit one of his outspoken critics from the Times.

NEW YORK TIMES NEWSROOM HIT WITH BED BUG INFESTATION: REPORT

""A made up Radical Left Story about Doral bedbugs, but Bret Stephens is loaded up with them!"" Trump tweeted. ""Been calling me wrong for years, along with the few remaining Never Trumpers - All Losers!""

The op-ed columnist had been widely-mocked after he responded to a Twitter user who jokingly referred to him as a bed bug in reaction to reports of a pest infestation at the Times newsroom.

""The bedbugs are a metaphor. The bedbugs are Bret Stephens,"" George Washington University associate professor Dave Karpf quipped.

This tweet apparently angered Stephens enough for him to email both Karpf and the GWU provost, which Karpf shared on Twitter Monday night.

""Someone just pointed out a tweet you wrote about me, calling me a 'bedbug,'"" Stephens began the email. ""I'm often amazed about the things supposedly decent people are prepared to say about other people – people they've never met – on Twitter. I think you've set a new standard.""

The Times columnist went on to invite Karpf to his home, meet his wife and children, and then ""call me 'bedbug' to my face.""

""That would take some genuine courage and intellectual integrity on your part,"" Stephens told the college professor. ""I promise to be courteous no matter what you have to say. Maybe it will make you feel better about yourself.""

Stephens has since deactivated his Twitter account."
Trump's strange relationship with Putin is back in the spotlight,https://www.cnn.com,['Analysis Stephen Collinson'],08-28-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/28/politics/donald-trump-russia-vladimir-putin-g7-golf-resort-2020-election/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump is setting up another obliteration of American norms by pushing his Miami golf resort as the venue for the next G7 and proposing an invitation to Russia.

If Trump as summit host ignores the substantive opposition to his plans, he will deliver a bold repudiation of political establishments at home and in the West months before he asks his voters to mobilize in huge numbers to hand him a second term.

In arguing Russia's cause, the President is yet again indulging his bizarre and unexplained deference to Russian President Vladimir Putin , who appears devoted to undermining the democratic values the G7 represents.

By bringing the G7 entourage to Doral, Trump would trample ethics concerns and even the Constitution's most important safeguards against presidential corruption by using his power to drum up millions of dollars for his own business.

The President's ambitious and controversial blueprint for the summit is his most tangible achievement from his dizzying and divisive visit to this year's G7 summit in France last weekend.

The renewal Trump has in mind for 2020 would underline how he has engineered a sharp redirection of American foreign policy values and often flouted the customs of the presidency itself.

And it would show how he rarely respects, or even recognizes, the potential conflicts of interest or simple propriety inherent in his use of his podium to market his hotels and resorts.

Russia wasn't at the summit but Trump made sure it wasn't forgotten

Trump spent much of his time in Biarritz over the weekend, in public and private, calling for Russia to be restored to the grouping despite resistance from some G7 allies.

An invitation for Russia -- kicked out of the then-G8 for annexing Crimea in 2014 -- would risk validating Putin's land grab, which redrew the borders of Ukraine and post-Cold War Europe.

An invitation to an unrepentant strongman such as Putin would be more than just a poke in the eye for America's traditional European allies and a classic Trump disruption play.

It would also symbolically repudiate the legacies of every US president from Franklin Roosevelt to George H.W. Bush, who collectively presided over the defeat of authoritarianism in Europe, perhaps America's greatest 20th-century achievement.

Trump's almost obsessive habit of pushing Russia's foreign policy goals is one of the most curious aspects of a presidency that almost daily defies belief and convention. As the summit's host next year he has wide discretion over both the venue and any guests invited to attend even if they are not formally members of the G7 structure.

CNN reported on Tuesday that in addition to his public advocacy, Trump ardently pressed for Putin's return to what would be the G8 in sometimes-bitter exchanges with fellow leaders in France.

There was especially sharp pushback from German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, two diplomatic sources and a senior US official familiar with the exchanges told CNN's Pamela Brown and Kevin Liptak.

Trump then went on to press Russia's case in his closing summit news conference, and sidestepped the question of Crimea by falsely claiming Putin had ""outsmarted"" his predecessor Barack Obama by capturing the territory from Ukraine.

""I think it would be better to have Russia inside the tent than outside the tent,"" Trump said in France.

Trump argues that on key world issues it is important to have Russia's input and that the cause of peace would be advanced by the return of one of the two top nuclear powers.

But leaders critical of his push pointed out that Russia had become even more anti-democratic since being ousted from the group -- which unites the world's most powerful market economies which are also democracies and respect Western values.

Trump's new push for Russia's readmission seems illogical because tensions are spiking between Moscow and the West over Russia's role in Syria, missile competition and Ukraine. Two US senators have just been refused visas to enter Russia

Why would the US want Russia back in the club?

JUST WATCHED Trump privately clashed with G7 leaders over Putin Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump privately clashed with G7 leaders over Putin 02:15

All this raises the question of why a Russian return to a reconstituted G8 is in US interests.

""Why would we then want to turn around and say, 'Oh, come on back in' ?"" asked former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a CNN political commentator.

""They would have to change a number of things about who they are to get back in,"" Kasich added. ""They have got to earn their way back in.""

Russia might not even be the most appropriate new member. If the G7 prizes newcomers with economic clout and democratic political systems, a case might be made for India to join next.

There is little enthusiasm on Capitol Hill for Trump's embrace of Putin -- at least not unless Russia exits Crimea.

Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida was asked on Tuesday whether he would like to see Russia back.

""I'd rather not. I don't like Vladimir Putin,"" Rubio said. ""We can't ignore Russia or stop dealing with them. But we should do it with clear eyes.""

Democratic senators, led by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, warned in a letter that readmitting Russia would be ""contrary to our values and a clear abdication of the United States' responsibilities as the world's leading democracy.""

Trump's behavior threw the spotlight back on his strange accommodation of Putin -- whose government is accused of interfering in the 2016 election to help him get elected.

Speculation is again rampant over the President's motivations, including whether past business relationships with Russia or fears that he is compromised in some way, might be at play.

Special counsel Robert Mueller did not clear up such questions in his final report, though he provided evidence about Trump's business ventures connected to Russia dating back to 2013.

While Mueller did not establish that the Trump campaign had conspired or coordinated with the Russian government on its election interference, he concluded that it expected to benefit electorally from the operation.

Putin and Trump have met several times since the 2016 election but the Russian leader has not made what would be a politically explosive visit to the United States.

An invitation to Putin in the heat of the 2020 campaign next summer would be a huge propaganda coup for Russia and would inevitably spark speculation about what Trump was hoping for in return. Some critics would be sure to accuse him of angling for more Russian help in his reelection bid.

Trump's motives are impossible to know for sure. Perhaps he also wants to flaunt his wealth to Putin at Doral. Maybe he believes the Russian leader would be an ally in a room of prime ministers, presidents and chancellors where he is often isolated. Trump could see Russia's return as another blow against the enduring Western establishment he has frequently criticized.

Giving Doral a boost

Trump's approach to the G7 might be popular with base voters who revel in his trashing of political and diplomatic conventions and with whom Trump has kept faith with his disruptive behavior.

It would also be a proud personal moment to shepherd world leaders at Doral, which bears his name and was once a regular stop on the PGA Tour before struggling in recent years.

But bringing thousands of fee-paying officials to the resort could trigger another fight over constitutional prohibitions on presidents receiving payments from foreign powers or profiting from their office.

Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, vowed to press the administration on a decision that he said would be ""one of the most egregious examples of corruption and self-dealing in a presidency replete with them.""

""Trump is using the office to line his own pockets at the expense of the American people and our standing in the world,"" Wyden said in a statement. ""Requiring our allies to spend money at the president's hotel to attend the G-7 would be an insult to them and a violation of our Constitution's emoluments clause.""

Trump insisted in France that he does not want to hold the G7 summit in Doral to enrich himself and claimed he had sacrificed billions of dollars to serve as President. In a staggering infomercial-like performance during the news conference, he touted the claims of Doral to host the summit.

He cited its luxury villas, proximity to an airport, easy-to-secure location close to Miami and even its ballroom and parking accommodation.

""My people came back, they took tours, they went to different places,"" Trump said. ""And they came back and they said, 'This is where we'd like it to be.' ""

The idea that only Doral is suited to hold the summit is absurd, given the proliferation of resorts and convention centers across the nation. Past presidents have hosted G8/G7 summits in Denver or Houston or at Sea Island, Georgia.

Obama presided over the last US-based edition at the presidential retreat at Camp David in Maryland in 2012 -- a meeting, incidentally, that Putin declined to attend."
"As Puerto Rico Braces For Storm, DHS, FEMA To Move $271 Million To Border Operations",https://www.npr.org,['Claudia Grisales'],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.npr.org/2019/08/27/754838143/as-puerto-rico-braces-for-storm-dhs-fema-to-move-271-million-to-border-operation,"As Puerto Rico Braces For Storm, DHS, FEMA To Move $271 Million To Border Operations

Enlarge this image toggle caption Carlos Giusti/AP Carlos Giusti/AP

As a major storm heads for Puerto Rico, the Department of Homeland Security and its Federal Emergency Management Agency said Tuesday they will move $271 million in funds to support President Trump's border enforcement efforts.

The Department of Homeland Security said it will transfer the emergency funds — including $155 million from FEMA's disaster relief fund — to support new Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention beds as well as facilities for related court cases, according to documents obtained by NPR.

In a July notification to Congress about the transfer, DHS said the $155 million comes from recoveries of prior year funds and that ""absent significant new catastrophic events"" the department believes the fund will still have enough money to operate.

Congressional Democrats slammed the move on Tuesday, which comes at the peak of hurricane season and as Tropical Storm Dorian was poised to reach hurricane levels.

""The Trump administration's plan to divert money away from FEMA at the start of hurricane season to continue its efforts to separate and jail migrant families is backwards and cruel,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said. ""Taking these critical funds from disaster preparedness and recovery efforts threatens lives and weakens the government's ability to help Americans in the wake of natural disasters. Congress appropriated these funds to meet the American peoples' priorities and I strongly oppose this effort to undermine our constitutional authority.""

DHS alerted Congress to the move in a 15-page notification dated July 26, which NBC first reported earlier Tuesday. The agency is required to give Congress a 30-day notice to the plans.

Democrats, opposed to the move, waited to respond until the end of that notification period in hopes of delaying the costly action, a congressional source familiar with the plans said.

""I have significant concerns about the intended use of funds, and consequently, about the tradeoffs between that use and activities that would otherwise be funded from the source accounts,"" California Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, chair of a House Appropriations subcommittee, told DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan in an Aug. 23 letter.

Roybal-Allard said the the reprogramming was unnecessary and the Trump administration was overstepping its authority. She noted that DHS components such as the U.S. Coast Guard could be hampered by the move.

She added she was concerned about implementation of the agency's immigration enforcement operations, which often ignores its budget directives from Congress and lack transparency. She urged McAleenan to work with the House Appropriations Committee to restore their partnership.

""I am greatly concerned that during the course of this administration, there has been a growing disconnect between the will of Congress, as represented by ICE funding levels in enacted appropriations bills signed by the President, and the Department's Immigration enforcement operations, which often lack justification,"" Roybal-Allard said.

Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., also slammed the move Tuesday.

""Once again, this administration is endangering America by moving funds away from emergency management for their extremist border agenda,"" he said. ""President Trump and his administration are not just endangering the lives of the children and families they seek to harm in the name of deterrence. By shortchanging preparedness, they're endangering the lives of millions of Americans who live in hurricane zones as well.""

The DHS notification to Congress expired on Sunday, the agency said in a statement Tuesday. The Department also defended the move, saying it is necessary to deal with the influx of migrants.

""Given the rise of single adults crossing the border, ICE has already had to increase the number of detention beds above what Congress funded,"" DHS said in its statement. ""Without additional funding for single adult detention beds and transportation from the U.S. Border Patrol to ICE detention facilities, ICE will not be able to support the influx of migrants from U.S. Customs and Border Protection apprehensions.""

In its notification, DHS cited ""a security and humanitarian crisis on the southern border"" and the ""high volume of aliens presenting themselves at ports of entry or entering illegally ... and being released into the interior of the United States while they wait sometimes years for a final resolution of their case."" The shift in the funds would help DHS address the ""crisis,"" the department says, under authority provided in the fiscal year 2019 DHS appropriations act.

As a result, DHS said it will transfer funds from its FEMA disaster relief fund and other accounts to the new border effort.

Of the overall $271 million total, the agency said it will move $155 million to establish and operate temporary Migrant Protection Protocol, or MPP, Immigration Hearing Facilities along the Southwest border. Another $116 million will be used to pay for new detention beds, the agency said.

""MPP court docket backlogs will continue to grow and ICE will not be able to effectively and efficiently move single adult migrants between detention centers and courtrooms without the funding,"" the agency said. ""This realignment of resources allows DHS to address ongoing border emergency crisis by alleviating the surge along the Nation's Southwest Border while minimizing the risk to overall DHS mission performance.""

Supporters of the administration's immigration policies say Democrats have left the administration little choice but to take this action.

Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies, who is in regular discussions with the administration, said the transfer of the funds is necessary because ICE is so over budget due to the border crisis. They have to find the money from somewhere because Congress hasn't given them what it needs, she said.

""ICE's priority caseload is growing, but the Democratic majority in the House does not support the level of enforcement that they consider to be the bare minimum for public safety and maintaining the most basic integrity of the law,"" she said.

""The border influx has strained ICE capacity,"" she said. ""Under the law, their detention capacity is set by Congress. They have to balance the criminal cases, border cases and other priorities like worksite operations and fugitives. And on top of that some people are mandatory to detained, such aggravated felons and prior deportees.""

Joe Walsh Says Trump Is ‘Unfit’ to Be President. Some Say the Same About Him.,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Matt Stevens', 'Annie Karni']",08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/27/us/politics/joe-walsh-president-racist-tweets.html,"Mr. Walsh has not deleted his offending tweets, choosing instead to apologize for some of them. But his long, searchable trail means Mr. Walsh has spent the opening days of his campaign addressing his own record rather than mounting a coherent attack on Mr. Trump.

“I wouldn’t call myself a racist, but I would say, John, I’ve said racist things on Twitter,” Mr. Walsh said in an interview with the MSNBC host John Heilemann on Monday.

The difference between him and the president, Mr. Walsh said in an interview with ABC, is that Mr. Trump has “never apologized for anything he’s done or said.”

But asked by The Washington Post about a tweet in which he deployed an expletive used by Mr. Trump to describe Haiti, Mr. Walsh said that while his word choice was perhaps “a little too provocative,” he stood by his description.

Amid his media blitz, Mr. Walsh received bad news about his own radio broadcast. In a statement Monday, Salem Radio Network announced that it would exercise its right to cancel national distribution of Mr. Walsh’s radio program, effective in 30 days.

A company official said any broadcaster who becomes a bona fide candidate for office must leave the air or risk exposing stations to the Federal Communications Commission’s equal time provision, under which any other declared candidate could demand airtime equal to that afforded to Mr. Walsh.

Mr. Walsh has tried to portray himself as someone who experienced an awakening — a firebrand populist who contributed to a divisive climate that helped elect Mr. Trump, but who was now putting his own career on the line to atone for his role in the Trump ascendancy."
Homeland Security moves $155 million from FEMA disaster relief for immigration enforcement,https://www.cnn.com,"['Geneva Sands', 'Priscilla Alvarez']",08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/27/politics/fema-immigration-enforcement-dorian/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Trump administration plans to shift at least $155 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency disaster relief fund to support its policy of returning some migrants to Mexico.

The Department of Homeland Security has informed Congress it will reprogram and transfer $271 million in total to its immigration enforcement agency from elsewhere in the department, including the FEMA money, according to documents obtained by CNN.

The moves comes as Tropical Storm Dorian nears hurricane strength as it approaches Puerto Rico.

Last week, the administration announced its intention to hold migrant families indefinitely, aimed at scrapping a settlement that put a 20-day limit on family detention.

DHS notified Congress of its plan to reprogram and transfer funds from agencies over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, DHS' enforcement arm, on July 26, according to a DHS official. The department plans to transfer around $116 million for ICE detention beds, as well as transportation and deportation, the official said.

The department will not pull funds for detention beds from the US Secret Service, the Office of the Inspector General, and the Office of Intelligence and Analysis.

""In this case, this is a must-pay bill that needed to be addressed,"" said the official.

""We would not say that this is with no risk,"" said the official, who added that it was done in ways to ""minimize the risk"" to agencies that are losing funding.

FEMA said in a statement to CNN, ""This transfer of funds to support the border emergency will leave a remaining balance of $447 million in the DRF (Disaster Relief Fund) Base account. Based on DHS and FEMA's review of historical emergency spending from the DRF Base account, this amount will be sufficient to support operational needs and will not impact ongoing long-term recovery efforts across the country. The DRF Majors account, which provides funding for ongoing recovery efforts, including those supporting communities impacted by the 2017 disasters, has a current balance of approximately $27 billion and is not impacted by the reprogramming.""

It's not uncommon for departments, including DHS, to reprogram funds. DHS, in particular, has previously reprogrammed funds for detention beds, for example.

The reprogramming of money to Immigration and Customs Enforcement is sure to receive pushback from Democratic lawmakers who've criticized the agency.

In a letter to acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, Democratic Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard of California, chair of the House Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, opposed the reprogramming of funds, saying she had ""significant concerns about the intended use of funds"" and the shifting of funds from other components.

House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson said in a statement that the administration is ""flouting the law and Congressional intent to fund its extremist indefinite detention immigration policies.""

""Taking money away from TSA and from FEMA in the middle of hurricane season could have deadly consequences. Congress should work to undo the damage this Administration is continually doing to our homeland security infrastructure,"" the Mississippi Democrat added.

DHS plans to transfer $23.8 million from the Transportation Security Administration for immigration enforcement, according to a document obtained by CNN.

Earlier this year, funds for additional detention beds -- as the administration has repeatedly pushed for -- became a sticking point in appropriations negotiations.

Democrats argued that by allowing ICE to up the number of detention beds, the agency would have the capacity to pursue a broader population of undocumented immigrants, including those without criminal records. But Republicans view the number of detention beds as central to limiting the release of detained undocumented immigrants into the US as they await hearings.

In the end, the spending bill included funding for an average 45,274 detention beds per day, with the intent to return to 40,520 by the end of the fiscal year, which is the level funded in the last fiscal year, but short of the administration's request of 52,000 detention beds. The reprogramming of funds will up ICE's bed count to roughly 50,000.

In recent months, however, the agency has been consistently holding more people in detention: As of August 10, 55,530 people were in immigration detention, according to the agency.

The latest shift in funds will also pull more money from FEMA -- $3.4 million for detention efforts.

Additionally, $4.3 million will be transferred from DHS' cyber agency.

DHS resources have been stretched thin amid an influx of migrants at the southern border. So far this fiscal year, more than 760,000 migrants have been arrested for crossing the border illegally. Many of them turn themselves in to agents.

In May, the Trump administration asked Congress for $4.5 billion in emergency funding. The request included additional detention beds. That part of the request was not fulfilled."

OAN's Jack Posobiec: AG Barr Will Have To Decide Fate Of McCabe Indictment,https://www.realclearpolitics.com,[],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/08/27/oan_jack_posobiec_ag_barr_will_have_to_decide_fate_of_mccabe_indictment.html,"OAN's Jack Posobiec: AG Barr Will Have To Decide Fate Of McCabe Indictment

One America News Network's Jack Posobiec explains how it came to be Attorney General Bill Barr's decision whether to prosecute former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.





POSOBIEC: Recently news broke that the Department of Justice is currently weighing an indictment of former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.

McCabe, of course, was instrumental in authorizing and running the political espionage campaign against President Trump. And he also helped to give Hillary Clinton a legal pass on her unlawful classified e-mail server. McCabe was recommended for criminal referral by the inspector general of the DOJ Michael Horowitz. This we learned was for lying repeatedly to FBI investigators about the source of a leak inside his office to The Wall Street Journal, including lying under oath.



At one point, McCabe even attempted to hold a conference call to berate his underlings for the leak getting out. This, of course, was all a sham. He knew exactly where the source of the leak had been because he himself was the source of the leak and knowingly and deliberately misled investigators. Now, McCabe's lawyers are meeting with the DOJ to urge them to drop the indictment.



But as we learn more about the Department of Justice's deliberations on whether or not to file an indictment against McCabe a disturbing pattern has emerged.



We've seen that the grand jury that was seated early on in the investigation has expired. One prosecutor, David Kent, assigned to the case has now been reassigned. And one Kamil Shields, a prosecutor, has left the Department of Justice altogether.



Now, Washington D.C. U.S. Attorney Jessie Liu has punted, essentially, the decision to prosecute to main Justice and to Barr's deputy Jeffrey Rosen. This, of course, is the same Jessie Liu who was involved in the decision to prosecute fully the Awan brothers and involved in protecting the leaker James Wolfe to the Senate Intelligence Committee.



Jessie Liu is previously a member of the DOJ's national security division. That's the very same division that was involved in the FISA warrants placed on President Trump's campaign in 2016. She certainly would have been very aware of and no doubt has been aware of Andrew McCabe throughout both their careers."

Why some lesbians don’t want Pete Buttigieg to be president,https://www.politico.com,['Maggie Severns'],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/27/lesbians-pete-buttigieg-2020-president-1475900,"Several lesbian activists say that while they are glad South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is running for the Democratic nomination, they most want a woman to be president in 2020, after Hillary Clinton’s stinging loss in 2016. | Mary Schwalm/AP Photo 2020 Elections Why some lesbians don’t want Pete Buttigieg to be president Lesbian political activists are divided over which glass ceiling to aim for in the 2020 presidential race.

Campbell Spencer, a lesbian and political consultant, moved to Washington in the 1990s to work in LGBTQ advocacy. She wooed gay and lesbian voters for Al Gore, worked a stint in the Obama White House and now serves on the board of the LGBTQ Victory Fund, which this year issued its first-ever endorsement of a presidential candidate: Pete Buttigieg.

But so far, Kamala Harris has wowed Spencer more than any other candidate in the race.

Story Continued Below

“Mayor Pete, he’s a trailblazer,” Spencer said in an interview. “But I’m one of these women who thinks we are way overdue for having a woman in the White House. That’s a lens through which I’m going to filter my decision.”

Buttigieg, the openly gay mayor of South Bend, Ind., has drawn notable support from gay voters and donors for his presidential bid. But interviews with a dozen prominent Democrats in the LGBTQ community spotlight a remarkable collision of goals and ideals in the community of lesbian political activists this year. As the 2020 field slowly winnows, people are divided over which glass ceiling to break first.

The majority of the women POLITICO interviewed for this story did not want to speak on the record, citing a desire not to damage Buttigieg’s campaign. But especially when compared with the laborious ascent of Hillary Clinton, Buttigieg’s swift rise in national politics hints of male favoritism, some said. Others applauded his run — but feel more strongly about the need to elect a female president.

“It feels like a slap in the face to just go directly to the white gay guy, when for decades you’ve been trying to elect a woman and it didn’t happen last time,” said one lesbian Democrat who works in national politics. “If Pete Buttigieg is elected it won’t feel like a vindication of Hillary Clinton. If a woman is elected, it will.”

LGBTQ voters made up a relatively small 6 percent of the electorate in the 2018 midterm elections but voted overwhelmingly for Democratic candidates, according to exit polls. And gay donors are a formidable source of campaign funds in the Democratic Party: One in six of Barack Obama’s top campaign bundlers in 2012 were openly gay, according to a Washington Post analysis at the time.

The LGBTQ community has been an important launch pad for Buttigieg’s presidential bid. He has fundraised at the homes of several prominent gay donors — such as television producers Ryan Murphy and Richie Jackson, each of whom have hosted Buttigieg for events in their homes this year — and received campaign checks from power players including Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes and lesbian megadonor Laura Ricketts.

But the broad 2020 Democratic field includes historic diversity and choice for LGBTQ voters looking for new representation in the White House, or at least on the Democratic debate stage.

“There are black gay men and Latina lesbians — we have all these identities,” said Annise Parker, the former Houston mayor who is now president and CEO of the LGBTQ Victory Fund. “I talk to donors who are really glad that Pete’s running, but want Julián Castro to be on the debate stage. Or who say, ‘I want Cory Booker or Kamala Harris to be on stage.’ I say that’s a great thing.”

Parker, who became the first lesbian elected to lead a major American city only a decade ago, said she plans to vote for Buttigieg. But she also feels the pull of electing the first female president.

“As a woman, as a lesbian, as someone who was all in for Hillary Clinton and as someone who was a historic first myself, I would love to see a woman at the top of the ticket,” Parker said.

“And talking with other women inside the community and not, we understand the importance of Pete’s candidacy — but dammit, we’re half the population. It’s time” for a woman president, Parker continued.

Several lesbian donors and activists interviewed by POLITICO said they see in this election a continuation of the gender politics of 2016, when Clinton’s nomination was a vindicating moment for many Democratic women — and Trump’s position as the GOP nominee heightened the stakes of the race, as well as the burn of Clinton’s loss.

“To have a woman candidate finally running for president was extraordinarily galvanizing to substantial portions of the women’s community and the lesbian community,” said Elyse Cherry, a Massachusetts-based lesbian community activist and former member of Clinton’s New England finance committee. “When she lost, people were even more galvanized.”

Cherry pushed to build a movement for same-sex marriage in Massachusetts, starting in the early 1990s when the idea was a political outlier. She chaired the board for MassEquality, which advocated for the state’s gay marriage law and worked to guard it from challenges in the years after it was enacted.

Cherry plans to vote for her senior senator, Elizabeth Warren.

“Having a woman, finally, as our president is important to me,” Cherry said. “The mistake is to suggest that we all stay in one lane — for example that if you’re gay you should be supporting gay candidates, or if you’re a woman you should be supporting women candidates.”

LPAC, an organization that focuses on building power among LGBTQ women, has not endorsed a candidate, but its endorsement discussions will begin at an upcoming board meeting, the group’s president Stephanie Sandberg said, adding that there is a ""strong possibility"" that LPAC will endorse a candidate.

Nabeela Rasheed, a Chicago-based lawyer and activist backing Buttigieg, said “there is absolutely a conversation that’s happening” among lesbian donors in her area about the value of supporting a female candidate over Buttigieg.

“I don’t think the county is ready for a West Coast Democrat, and a female at that. And I don’t think this country can take an East Coast female either. They need someone who understands Main Street,” Rasheed said. So Rasheed — who is of Pakistani descent — has been raising money for Buttigieg and trying to introduce as many women of color to his campaign as possible.

Buttigieg surprised observers by surging to national prominence this spring and raising $24 million between early April and the end of June, the most money of any candidate in the field.

One foundation for his success was a bloc of openly gay male donors and fundraisers who threw their support behind his campaign early in the race. Among the people who have already raised more than $25,000 for Buttigieg’s campaign were Terrence Meck, co-founder of the nonprofit The Palette Fund; and Alex Slater, founder of the Washington, D.C.-based Clyde Group.

Other high-profile gay donors, such as software entrepreneur Tim Gill and philanthropist David Bohnett, have donated to former Vice President Joe Biden, who was an early proponent of same-sex marriage in Washington.

Kelly Dermody, a former Hillary Clinton bundler and employment lawyer who has represented women in sexual harassment cases, said that while Buttigieg’s candidacy is “exciting,” federal lawmakers who are running have more experience.

Dermody is backing Harris, who she believes is the strongest candidate, in part because of her experience as a woman and person of color. She said that one highlight of the 2020 campaign for her has been Harris’ husband, Douglas Emhoff, a frequent presence at campaign stops and an unbridled booster of his wife on social media.

“It’s just been really nice seeing him at various events and see what it looks like to have a female leader have the support of a strong male partner,” Dermondy said. “He has his own job and he’s a real star lawyer in his own world, but he also has embraced this [campaign].”

CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to better reflect Campbell Spencer's preferences on the 2020 Democratic field. So far, she is most impressed by Kamala Harris, but she says she has not made a final decision about who to support."

Opinion | My Final Break With the Trump State Department,https://www.nytimes.com,['Bethany Milton'],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/26/opinion/trump-state-department.html,"When President Trump allowed a crowd to chant “Send her back!” about a sitting member of Congress — espousing an ideology in which naturalized American citizens, at least those who don’t fit a certain profile, are held to different and dangerous standards — he wasn’t thinking about me. He’s rarely thinking about me, the white American-born daughter of two American-born citizens.

But he is often thinking and talking about at least some of the tens of thousands of people I’ve helped immigrate to the United States — legally and permissibly — over my 11 years as a consular officer in the Foreign Service. From 2014 to 2016, I oversaw immigrant visa processing at the U.S. Consulate General in Mumbai, India. Every day, my team and I saw dozens of families destined to move to the United States as green card holders: older parents going to spend their final years surrounded by grandchildren, spouses matched up through online matrimonial sites, parents with kids in tow who had been waiting patiently since the early 1990s for their chance to join a sibling.

I also oversaw immigrant visa operations in Kigali, Rwanda, from 2018 to 2019, helping Rwandans and Congolese reunite with family members in the United States. Their stories often had a darker tone: marriages brokered in refugee camps, siblings separated by war, children born of rape. But the one thing that united almost every visa applicant I ever saw was the belief that life was going to be better in America. What a rude surprise, then, for them to face elected national leadership that targets them in such gruesome ways.

"A recession in 2020 would hurt Trump, but it wouldn't necessarily sink his reelection",https://www.cnbc.com,['Jacob Pramuk'],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/27/recession-would-likely-hurt-trump-in-2020-but-he-could-still-win.html,"President Donald Trump answers questions from reporters as he meets with Romania's President Klaus Iohannis in the Oval Office of the White House In Washington. August 20, 2019. Kevin Lamarque | Reuters

Fears about a flagging economy have jumped to the top of President Donald Trump's mind. As unusual bond market moves have prompted concerns about looming economic trouble, the president said ""we are very far from a recession."" Trump has pointed to a ""strong"" U.S. economy — the strongest in the world, he says — held back from soaring growth only by what he calls a ""clueless"" Federal Reserve and a news media hellbent on feeding the narrative of a downturn. At the G-7 meetings in France this weekend, he proclaimed the U.S. economy is ""the talk of the world!"" Trump has reason to fret. He has built his argument for reelection on American prosperity. His hopes for winning the race may hinge in no small part on stopping the U.S. from tumbling into a recession before November 2020.

Only two presidents since World War II — Democrats Harry Truman and Jimmy Carter — have run for reelection in the same year as a recession. While Truman won and Carter lost, history suggests an economic slump would damage Trump's chances in what will already be a tough 2020 race. Incumbents have a harder time winning amid a down economy because they need to find other issues to draw voters, said Lynn Vavreck, an American politics and public policy professor at UCLA. Trump is ""better positioned than most"" to withstand a slowdown because he ran on identity-focused issues like immigration in 2016, ""but without a good economy it will be harder for him to swing marginal voters,"" she said. Metrics such as the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index help track consumers views' on and expectations for the economy. The metric typically plummets during recessions. Over the survey's history back to the mid-20th century, it has ""largely"" found that ""if the index is low, the incumbent doesn't get reelected,"" said Richard Curtin, director of surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan. Recession fears climbed this month for a variety of reasons. Trade tensions with China exploded Friday: Trump said U.S. companies are ""hereby ordered"" to find an alternative to operating in the country, and the Trump administration hiked tariff rates on Chinese goods. A day earlier, a key indicator found the manufacturing sector contracted for the first time in 10 years, adding to concerns about the economy. Meanwhile, corporate profit growth has proven sluggish — though not as bad as some had feared. Trump may not need to worry just yet. Though some early warning signs of a slowdown have emerged, history suggests it could take until after the election in 2021 for a recession to hit. U.S. gross domestic product rose a solid 2.1% in the second quarter. On Wednesday, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected long-term growth of 1.8%, even though it expects Trump's trade conflicts to drag on economic growth. While 1.8% growth is lower than the long-term U.S. historical average, it would comfortably keep the U.S. ahead of a recession. Uncertainty created by the Trump administration's trade war with China helped to send consumer sentiment lower in August to a level not seen since the beginning of the year, but it still sits well above levels typically seen during recessions. The current sentiment reading would suggest a good case for reelection for an incumbent president, Curtin said.

He notes that Trump's presidency has thrown out some traditional expectations for how voters will react to a president's first term. For instance, views on the economy have become more partisan: Democrats are less likely to have positive feelings about the economy while Trump is in office than they were when Republican President Ronald Reagan was in the White House. Despite the economy's solid standing now, parts of Wall Street see a rising risk of a recession in the next year. Since the possibility has vexed Trump, CNBC looked back at how other presidents fared while running for reelection under the shadow of a recession.

Truman triumphs, Carter falters

U.S. presidents have rarely run for reelection during a full blown recession since the mid-20th century. Truman was the first president after World War II to run for a second term during a recession. He did not actually win a first election — he started 1945 as President Franklin Roosevelt's vice president before taking over when the president died only three months into his fourth term.

History best remembers Truman's 1948 victory for the photo of him gleefully holding up a Chicago Daily Tribune newspaper with the headline ""DEWEY DEFEATS TRUMAN"" — a projection based on the conventional wisdom that Republican New York Gov. Thomas Dewey would beat him. The result is also significant because he won easily despite a recession. The downturn's timing may explain Truman's success. It did not hit until November 1948, the month of the election, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. Not only did Truman comfortably win another term in the White House, but also his Democratic Party flipped control of both chambers of Congress. It gained 75 House seats and nine Senate seats. Carter did not have the same luck. The brief recession during his reelection year of 1980 started in January and ended in July — four months before Americans cast their ballots, according to NBER. It followed the 1979 energy crisis, when oil prices spiked and panic about the availability of gasoline spread in the U.S. Carter had encouraged Americans to live more modestly, a push Reagan targeted during his campaign. Republican Reagan trounced Carter, who won only six states. At the same time, the GOP gained more than 30 House seats and a dozen Senate seats. A few factors could explain why an election-year recession appeared to hurt Carter and not Truman. Due to how the government reports economic data, it can take months after a recession starts to confirm it. Voters also may not feel the effects of job losses or lower wages — or a recovery on the other end — until later. In Truman's case, Americans may not have known the recession started when they cast their ballots. When Carter stood for a second term, they may have had no idea that it ended.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon filed the suit Tuesday in federal court in Medford on behalf of Maria Qarrillo Soto, 48, who has lived in Oregon for 30 years. The lawsuit follows a similar complaint the ACLU filed in federal court in Colorado earlier this month on behalf of a Texas-born resident who also was denied a U.S. passport.

Soto, a married mother of two grown daughters who lives in White City, was denied a U.S. passport in 2018 despite providing government officials with the original birth certificate and copies of her Social Security card, driver’s license and marriage certificate and medical records from her pregnancy, according to her attorney, Leland Baxter-Neal of the ACLU.

The government denied the passport, writing to her that the material she presented was “not sufficient to establish your identity,’’ according to a letter from the U.S. Department of State.

Someone applying for a U.S. passport must establish their identity through submission of a previous passport, or other state, local or federal government-issued photo identification, the letter said.

Soto had been denied a U.S. passport in 1994 after she applied for one the prior year.

“There’s no reasonable explanation for denying her passport,’’ Baxter-Neal said Tuesday.

The State Department said it doesn’t comment on pending lawsuits.

Soto was born in Los Angeles County Hospital in April 1971 to her migrant parents from Mexico, father Felix Carrillo Arrellano and mother Guadalupe Barjaas Macias, according to the suit. At the time of her birth, her last name was misspelled on her birth certificate as “Qarrillo,’’ not Carillo.

She used “Qarrillo” until she married and took her husband’s name, using “Qarrillo’’ on her Social Security card, driver’s license and other identification, her lawyer said.

“The misspelling of her name is like a quirk in the case but everything she submitted proves her identity,’’ Baxter-Neal said.

Her parents, who are now deceased, worked in agriculture in Los Angeles and returned their daughter to Mexico to be raised by her maternal grandparents when she was between 1 month and 3 months old. During her childhood, Soto returned to the United States about once a year between ages 8 and 17, crossing the border by presenting her birth certificate, according to the suit.

Soto returned to live in the United States in 1989 at age 18, settling in Klamath Falls, Oregon. That year, she married Jose Alfredo Soto Toriz. In 1990, she petitioned for an immigrant visa for her husband as the spouse of a U.S. citizen, presenting proof to the government of her citizenship. The petition was approved and her husband was granted residency in 1995, according to her attorney.

When Soto applied for a U.S. passport in 1993, she submitted a photocopy of a certified copy of her birth certificate from Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center. The State Department sent her a letter on June 3, 1994, requesting additional documentation about her birth, her family and upbringing and her application was denied when Soto didn’t provide additional records to the government, the suit says.

At that time, Soto didn’t send her original birth certificate in, fearful she wouldn’t get it back, her lawyer said.

She applied a second time for a U.S. passport in February 2018, submitting a certified copy of her birth certificate, a copy of her Social Security card and her driver’s license. Because of the State Department’s earlier denial, it informed her that she needed to fill out an additional form – a “Supplemental Questionnaire to Determine Identity’’ – for the passport.

So she sent the completed form and additional documentation – her original birth certificate, her marriage certificate, a letter confirming her education in Mexico, medical records related to her pregnancy and a letter from her church, where she provides Bible study classes, according to Baxter-Neal.

But the government found that still wasn’t enough and denied her request on July 2, 2018, according to the suit.

Soto had hoped to travel to Peru with her husband.

“We’re suing to make sure she’s able to travel in the future like every other U.S. citizen,’’ Baxter-Neal said.

The ACLU argues that President Donald Trump’s administration is blocking U.S. passports more frequently for Latin Americans. The group pointed to a report by The Washington Post last summer about a surge in passport denials for Latin Americans born along the United States’ southern border.

“The idea that all people should be treated fairly and equally is fundamental to our democracy, and we must fight against the Trump administration’s attempts to divide us based on skin color or accents,’’ Baxter-Neal said in a statement.

Trump complains on Twitter about media's coverage of crowd size at Elizabeth Warren's campaign events,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Savannah Behrmann', 'Published P.M.

(Aug. 26) AP, AP

WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump tweeted Tuesday, complaining about the media coverage of crowd sizes at Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s campaign events.

""They do stories so big on ... Warren’s crowd sizes, adding many more people than are actually there, and yet my crowds, which are far bigger, get no coverage at all. Fake News!"" Trump tweeted.

An estimated 15,000 people attended a Warren rally in Seattle on Sunday, according to a report by Bloomberg News.

It is also reported that she drew an estimated 12,000 people in St. Paul, Minn., just a week before.

Trump's latest dissatisfaction with the media's crowd size coverage comes as polls show the Massachusetts senator is on the rise in the 2020 Democratic primary field. Both Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., have jumped to a virtual tie with front-runner former Vice President Biden in a new poll released Monday by Monmouth University.

However, focusing on crowd size is nothing new for Trump as he has a history of boasting about the attendance at his campaign rallies and speeches.

Footage and images of Trump's inauguration in 2017 showed that the National Mall was partially empty during the ceremony. One expert cited by the New York Times estimated that Trump drew an audience about a third the size of President Barack Obama’s first inauguration in 2009.

Immediately after Trump's inauguration then-White House press secretary Sean Spicer insisted that Trump had drawn “the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period.” Then, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway famously defended Spicer’s claims by referring to them as “alternative facts.”

Additionally, it was later reported that a government photographer edited images of Trump’s inauguration to make the crowd size appear larger than it actually was after the president was unhappy with how the event looked in photos.

Recently, after critics pushed the hashtag ""#emptyseatmagatour"" to the top of Twitter’s trending topics following footage showing some empty seats at a New Hampshire event, the president shared photos of the event later that night and pointed out the audience size in a series of tweets.

Biggest crowd EVER, according to Arena people. Thousands outside trying to get in. Place was packed! Radical Left Dems & their Partner, LameStream Media, saying Arena empty. Check out pictures. Fake News. The Enemy of the People! https://t.co/KkZWspM93a — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2019

Offline, Trump has also remarked about the size of his crowds at various events.

While in Texas after Tropical Storm Harvey in August 2017, Trump stood on a platform and exclaimed, “What a crowd, what a turnout.”

More recently, when visiting a hospital treating victims of the El Paso mass shooting, Trump used the opportunity to talk about how much larger his crowd had been during a rally in in the Texas city months earlier compared to the crowd at a competing rally held at the same time by Democratic presidential candidate and El Paso native Beto O’Rourke.

John Kasich says he doesn't see a path for him to defeat Trump 'right now',https://www.cnn.com,['Kate Sullivan'],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/27/politics/john-kasich-no-path-to-defeat-trump-right-now-cnntv/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Former Ohio Gov. John Kasich said Tuesday that he doesn't currently see a path that would lead him to defeat President Donald Trump for the 2020 Republican presidential nomination.

Kasich, who ran against Trump in the 2016 Republican primary, told CNN's John Berman on ""Anderson Cooper 360"" that he doesn't see a path ""right now,"" but added, ""That doesn't mean there wouldn't be a path down the road.""

""But right now, I don't see it,"" he said.

Now a CNN senior political commentator, the former governor said his full explanation for why he doesn't see a path is a ""complicated, long answer"" that can't be laid out ""in a few seconds"" on television."

I think John's point is right. Abdication is a word I have used. Essentially the United States has gone from being the principal architect and general contractor of world order to now becoming the principal disruptor. The problem for the Europeans and the Japanese and others is they lack the capacity to subjects duty substitute for us. They do what they can. $20 million for Amazon fires which is a literal drop in the bucket. Without the United States in the driver's seat, we don't make a lot of progress. The gap between the challenges and the international responses is growing. That's the historical judgment about the G-7, which looks like a tired gathering.



I think the two immediate things I would highlight are the president walked back two big issues. The trade war, for the moment, with China and the threat of actual war with Iran. On both of those, I think there was a change from where he showed up in France and where he ended."

VA secretary rejects Obama religious expression rules: 'They did not know the makeup of the force',https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Christopher Vondracek']",08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/aug/27/robert-wilkie-va-secretary-rejects-obama-religious/,"Robert Wilkie, the soft-spoken and managerial-minded secretary of Veterans Affairs, went public in a big way this summer when he said he refused to be “bullied” by a federal lawsuit claiming a Bible on display at a New Hampshire VA hospital violated the separation of church and state.

In an interview with The Washington Times in his office at the Department of Veterans Affairs, Mr. Wilkie said displaying a Bible in a VA hospital is a matter of liberty and that the Obama administration erred in trying to eliminate religious symbols from the veterans health care system.

“The last administration … had a very ahistoric approach [to veterans],” Mr. Wilkie said. “They did not know the makeup of the force. They did not know the history of this country when it came to religious foundations, the religious support for those in uniform.”

He said he grew up in a military family in North Carolina and believes the vast majority of veterans “identify themselves religiously.”

Meanwhile, a federal judge in New Hampshire will soon decide whether a Bible in a bolted-down display case in the lobby of a Manchester hospital funded by taxpayer dollars represents constitutionally protected speech.

A group of veterans, with support from the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, filed a lawsuit in May to remove the Bible.

“The placement of the Christian Bible, here, is in violation of that fundamental proscription, that the government may not establish any religion,” the lawsuit states.

Mr. Wilkie, noting the department’s murky directives on religious memorabilia, said he empathized with VA administrators who initially removed the Bible decorating the POW/MIA memorial table before replacing the book. The Bible was donated by a World War II veteran who had survived a German prisoner of war camp.

“I think the leadership of the VA hospital was still not sure how to act given the directives of the last administration,” Mr. Wilkie said.

The VA secretary accused the Obama administration of banning the Army Chaplain Corps — which currently numbers 800, including student chaplains — from distributing religious materials, including Bibles, Torahs and Korans, to veterans, even those who request them.

The previous administration, he said, even forbade revelers from singing Christmas carols in VA hospitals.

“The underlying notion here is that there is a group of people who want to eliminate all indicia of religion and spirituality from the public square,” Mr. Wilkie said. “And they’ve used the military as their hobby horse, and that, to me, is a great disservice to the vast majority of those who served.”

Michael L. Weinstein, a lawyer and founder of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, said his organization is looking forward to its day in court.

“I find it very ironic that VA Secretary Wilkie believes that upholding the separation of church and state regarding religious displays in VA facilities represents the interest of only a narrow number of people,” Mr. Weinstein said via email. “The Veterans Administration is what is called a ‘state actor’ and therefore must completely comply with the No Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights of our U.S. Constitution.”

The VA has a number of policies on religious expression. A 2016 inspector general’s report found no evidence that those policies contributed to religious insensitivity, and Secretary David J. Shulkin at the time wrote that policies “generally aligned” with applicable federal laws.

However, the inspector general’s report noted that the VA had not adequately updated a variety of policies related to religious expression, including directive 0022 on religious symbols. In one instance, the inspector general found that a VA guidance on maintenance at national cemeteries hadn’t been updated in 22 years.

According to multiple press reports at the time, the Obama administration adopted rules meant to curtail reported instances of proselytizing at military bases and hospitals. Mr. Wilkie’s staff said those strictures will stay in place.

“I also want to make clear that a lot of people will try to say that [the VA’s memo on Bibles and public display] constitutes proselytization,” said John Mashburn, a senior adviser to Mr. Wilkie. “[But] the VA kept in places its prohibition against proselytization.”

Mr. Wilkie had served as a legal aide to various Republican members of Congress, including Jesse Helms and Trent Lott, before his March 2018 promotion from an undersecretary post in the Department of Defense to head of the Department of Veterans Affairs. He was named acting VA secretary before the nomination of presidential physician Ronny Jackson was scuttled by reports that Dr. Jackson created an abusive work environment and drank on the job.

The secretary said the spirituality of veterans is inseparable from the task of healing, especially during a crisis of depression, addiction and suicide.

“What I consider to be the bizarre argument that men and women who’ve been sent to the most dangerous corners of the Earth, the most miserable places on the planet, would walk by a Bible on a table dedicated to missing men and go to pieces by the sight of that Bible when so many of them have been under fire in Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, Liberia, [just] goes counter to all logic,” Mr. Wilkie said.

The VA secretary noted that the Army Chaplain Regimental Corps crest reads “Pro Deo et Patria.” He said any decision to remove the Bible in New Hampshire would diminish that motto.

“For veterans, we’re not going to deprive them of that [spiritual] comfort during what is often a very, very trying time,” he said.

Bernie Sanders picks up union endorsement in visit to Pittsburgh,https://triblive.com,['Tom Davidson'],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://triblive.com/local/pittsburgh-allegheny/bernie-sanders-picks-up-union-endorsement-in-visit-to-pittsburgh/,"TribLIVE's Daily and Weekly email newsletters deliver the news you want and information you need, right to your inbox.

Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders picked up the endorsement of a Pittsburgh-based union Monday after a Downtown stop.

The United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America endorsed Sanders, a Vermont senator who is among those leading a crowded field seeking the Democratic nomination to challenge President Donald Trump in 2020.

“Bernie understands the need for workers to have a democratic, independent union movement that is unafraid to challenge corporate America’s stranglehold on our economy,” said UE General President Peter Knowlton in a news release.

The UE, based in Pittsburgh, is holding its annual convention. It represents 35,000 workers in a wide variety of manufacturing, public sector and private service-sector jobs.

Sanders earned the endorsement in part for his stance on health care. The union said it shares his stance that there should be a single-payer system in the country.

Sanders said in a news release that he was humbled to receive the endorsement.

“We are running a true working-class campaign, which speaks directly to workers and confronts the massive inequality we see in our society today,” he said.

It was Sanders’ second campaign visit to Pittsburgh this year.

A Monmouth University poll released this week said 20% of Democratic voters supported Sanders and U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, while 19% backed former Vice President Joe Biden, making the race a statistical dead heat. The poll had a margin of error of 5.7 percentage points.

Biden kicked off his presidential campaign in Pittsburgh in April.

Brighton water treatment plant out of compliance with EPA standards for 3 consecutive years,https://www.thedenverchannel.com,[],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/brighton-in-violation-of-epa-drinking-water-standards-for-3-consecutive-years-according-to-report,"BRIGHTON, Colo. -- We knew the water in Brighton was expensive, now - it turns out - it could be dangerous, too.

The same city that could see its mayor recalled over sky-high water bills now admits it was out of compliance with EPA water treatment standards for 3 years.

The water scandal continues to mystify even some who sit on the current council.

""The residents don't trust the city,"" said councilman Matt Johnston. ""I, as a city council representative, do not trust our city.""

The latest issue to surface is an EPA summary which concludes Brighton had ""Significant/Category 1"" violations for 12 consecutive quarters.

A city spokeswoman said late Monday those violations are for treated discharge that goes back into the river, not the drinking water.

But, Brighton's former city manager said late Monday that the reverse osmosis treatment facility also supplies Brighton with drinking water, so any violation at the plant should be concerning.

""Someone's at serious risk if the plant is that out of compliance,"" said former city manager Philip Rodriguez, who was fired in the midst of this scandal back in July. ""Either Brighton or its neighbors downstream.""

The city told Denver7 on Tuesday those issues were resolved and the treatment facility is now in compliance.

""We cannot say that 100% for sure all of our water is safe,"" Johnston said. ""We can't say that.""

And, in fact, just last week the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment required Brighton to send a letter to residents warning them about a dangerous back flow issue that could impact the drinking water supply.

For homeowner's like Jeremy Torgerson, it's mind-boggling.

""You don't want to cook with it, give it to your kids, your dog or anything,"" Torgerson said. ""I don't know how many more punches the residents have to take from their own city before we finally decide that we've had enough.""

The ongoing scandal has resulted in a flood of problems at city hall including the discovery of a $70 million fund from possible water billing overcharges and the subsequent firing of the city manager.

And now – there will be a recall election of the current mayor who insists the water is safe.

""The water here in Brighton is safe,"" said Mayor Ken Kreutzer. ""I drink it. My children drink it. My grandson drinks it. This is another gross exaggeration.""

But Johnston and others, like Torgerson, are no longer going with the flow. They insist city hall is corrupt.

""I'm tired of the backroom,"" Johnston said. ""It's time for the public to know everything about our water system - if it's safe, if it's clean, where the money's at and what it's being spent for.""

And while the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment hasn't issued a boil order, Johnston believes it's only a matter of time.

""This is a pre-boil warning type of scenario,"" Johnston said.

""The city government no longer functions,"" Torgerson said. ""This a basic function of a utility department to make sure the water that goes out is safe. They overcharge, and now we have to drink bottled water.""

Johnston says those who are sick should be particularly cautious.

""They're going through chemotherapy, and they do not know if they should be boiling their water at this point,"" Johnston said."
Weill Family Foundation announces public-private partnership with Energy Department on artificial intelligence,https://www.cnbc.com,['Riya Bhattacharjee'],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/26/weill-foundation-announces-public-private-partnership-with-dept-of-energy-on-artificial-intelligence.html,"The Department of Energy and the Weill Family Foundation on Monday signed a memorandum of understanding for a new public-private partnership which will use the agency's artificial intelligence capabilities for biomedical research.

Former Citigroup CEO Sandy Weill and Energy Secretary Rick Perry told CNBC's ""Closing Bell "" in an exclusive interview that the partnership aims to improve the diagnosis of brain diseases and neurological disorders, which would result in more effective treatment.

""As one looks at science and the development of new science, especially AI and computing, you really need to have partners to make things work."" Weill said. ""It's too expensive for anybody to try to do it by themselves.""

The partnership between the federal government and the Weill Family Foundation, involves Lawrence Livermore, Lawrence Berkeley and Argonne National laboratories, and was announced during a roundtable on DOE-fueled artificial intelligence at Lawrence Livermore Lab in Livermore, California.

The Department of Energy is currently home to the fastest supercomputers in the world.

The partnership aims to have new computers ready by 2022 that would run 15 times faster than current speeds.

""It will really break the logjam, especially as it related to neurodegenerative diseases,"" Weill said. ""And with everybody doing better, with the cancer research and with cardiovascular research, people are going to live longer. And we are all going to get these neurodegenerative diseases over time. And what we are working on is to prevent that because it would just be too costly.""

Perry said in the next 18 to 24 months, the department will have computers coming on board that will be between 50 to 100 times faster than today's computers. ""The improvement in health care, particularly in brain science, is going to be monumental, it's going to be world changing,"" Perry said.

Weill added it was important for the U.S. to beat China in this field.

When asked about current U.S.-China trade relations, Weill said it was important for the United States and China to figure out a way to get along with each other. ""With the two countries partnering for the future, I think we will end up with a better world, a safer world."""
Trump still hasn't realized that being president restricts what you should say and do,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/trump-still-hasnt-realized-that-being-president-restricts-what-you-should-say-or-do,"As the Washington Examiner argues in an editorial, it would be unethical and ill-advised to host next year's G-7 Summit at President Trump's Doral resort. But the fact that Trump has been making the pitch not only signals a willingness to personally enrich himself through the office of the presidency, but also gets at a much deeper problem.

Since taking office, Trump has never been able to grasp that being president, in addition to coming with new powers, also comes with certain restrictions about what he should say or do. There are statements and actions that may be acceptable or even innocuous outside the context of being commander in chief that become wildly inappropriate when done by a president. This has been a central problem in many of the controversies that have consumed his presidency.

His business actions and aggressive pitches of his properties can create conflicts of interest. His rant about ""disloyal Jews"" has much more weight coming as a president with an influential following. His regular Twitter tantrums aren't the same as when he was a private citizen; they can move markets and uproot our nation's foreign policy.

Regardless of whether one believes the actions outlined in Robert Mueller's report amount to obstruction of justice, it's clear that he would have had significantly less to work with had Trump recognized that as president, his words have more serious ramifications. His chat with James Comey about ""loyalty"" and his tweets about witnesses, among other actions, were clearly improper even if one doesn't believe they were illegal.

As he enters the 2020 election, his biggest vulnerability may be his utter inability to grasp the gravity of the office — specifically, the ways in which it limits what you can say or do."
State Department says removal of 'Palestinian Territories' from website isn't policy change,https://www.cnn.com,"['Jennifer Hansler', 'Andrew Carey']",08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/26/politics/state-department-website-palestinian-territories/index.html,"(CNN) The State Department on Monday denied that the removal of a listing for the Palestinian Territories from its website constituted a change in policy.

""Website is being updated. There has been no change to our policy,"" a State Department official said in a statement. Asked whether the listing would be added back to the website, the official reiterated that the site is being updated.

It is unclear when exactly the listing for the territories, which was once included as one of the ""countries and other areas"" under the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, was removed. It was active until at least February 2019, according to an archived version of the page. The State Department unveiled its modernized website in June 2019, and the link for the Palestinian Territories now redirects to a message about that modernization.

""Welcome to state.gov. We recently modernized our website. Part of this modernization was to reduce the number of pages on the current state.gov website by not moving items that are in existence on our archive sites. This keeps the content on the current state.gov current while older content remains intact and fully accessible on our archive sites,"" the message says.

The omission of the Palestinian Territories drew outrage from Palestinian officials.

Department of Energy awards Fermilab $3.5 million for quantum science,https://news.fnal.gov,[],,,,https://news.fnal.gov/2019/08/department-of-energy-awards-fermilab-3-5-million-for-quantum-science/,"The U.S. Department of Energy has awarded researchers at its Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory more than $3.5 million to boost research in the fast-emerging field of Quantum Information Science.

“Few pursuits have the revolutionary potential that quantum science presents,” said Fermilab Chief Research Officer Joe Lykken. “Fermilab’s expertise in quantum physics and cryogenic engineering is world-class, and combined with our experience in conventional computing and networks, we can advance quantum science in directions that not many other places can.”

As part of a number of grants to national laboratories and universities offered through its Quantum Information Science-Enabled Discovery (QuantISED) program, DOE’s recent round of funding to Fermilab covers three initiatives related to quantum science. It also funds Fermilab’s participation in a fourth initiative led by Argonne National Laboratory.

For a half-century, Fermilab researchers have closely studied the quantum realm and provided the computational and engineering capabilties needed to zoom in on nature at its most fundamental level. The projects announced by the Department of Energy will build on those capabilities, pushing quantum science and technology forward and leading to new discoveries that will enhance our picture of the universe at its smallest scale.

“Fermilab is well-versed in engineering, algorithmic development and recruiting massive computational resources to explore quantum-scale phenomena,” said Fermilab Head of Quantum Science Panagiotis Spentzouris. “Now we’re wrangling those competencies and capabilities to advance quantum science in many areas, and in a way that only a leading physics laboratory could.”

The Fermilab-led initiatives funded through these DOE QuantISED grants are:

Large Scale Simulations of Quantum Systems on High-Performance Computing with Analytics for High-Energy Physics Algorithms

Lead principal investigator: Adam Lyon, Fermilab

The large-scale simulation of quantum computers has plenty in common with simulations in high-energy physics: Both must sweep over a large number of variables. Both organize their inputs and outputs similarly. And in both cases, the simulation has to be analyzed and consolidated into results. Fermilab scientists, in collaboration with scientists at Argonne National Laboratory, will use tools from high-energy physics to produce and analyze simulations using high-performance computers at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. Specifically, they will simulate the operation of a qubit device that uses superconducting cavities (which are also used as components in particle accelerators) to maintain quantum information over a relatively long time. Their results will determine the device’s impact on high-energy physics algorithms using an Argonne-developed quantum simulator.

Partner institution: Argonne National Laboratory

Research Technology for Quantum Information Systems

Lead principal investigator: Gustavo Cancelo, Fermilab

One of the main challenges in quantum information science is designing an architecture that solves problems of massive interconnection, massive data processing and heat load. The electronics must be able to operate and interface with other electronics operating both at 4 kelvins and at near absolute zero. Fermilab scientists and engineers are designing novel electronic circuits as well as massive control and readout electronics to be compatible with quantum devices, such as sensors and quantum qubits. These circuits will enable many applications in the quantum information science field.

Partner institutions: Argonne National Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Chicago

MAGIS-100 – co-led by Stanford University and Fermilab

Lead Fermilab principal investigator: Rob Plunkett

Fermilab will host a new experiment to test quantum mechanics on macroscopic scales of space and time. Scientists on the MAGIS-100 experiment will drop clouds of ultracold atoms down a 100-meter-long vacuum pipe on the Fermilab site, and use a stable laser to create an atom interferometer which will look for dark matter made of ultralightweight particles. They will also advance a technique for gravitational-wave detection at relatively low frequencies.

This is a joint venture under the collaboration leadership of Stanford University Professor Jason Hogan, who is funded by grant GBMF7945 from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. Rob Plunkett of Fermilab serves as the project manager.

Other participating institutions: Northern Illinois University, Northwestern University, Stanford University, Johns Hopkins University, University of Liverpool

Fermilab was also funded to participate in another initiative led by Argonne National Laboratory:

Quantum Sensors for Wide Band Axion Dark Matter Detection

Lead principal investigator: Peter Barry, Argonne

Researchers are searching high and low for dark matter, the mysterious substance that makes up a quarter of our universe. One theory proposes that it could be made of particles called axions, which would signal their presence by converting into particles of light, called photons. Fermilab researchers are part of a team developing specialized detectors that look for photons in the terahertz range — at frequencies just below the infrared. The development of these detectors will widen the range of frequencies where axions may be discovered. To bring the faint signals to the fore, the team is using supersensitive quantum amplifiers.

Other participating institutions: National Institute of Standards and Technology, University of Colorado"

Still, the question remains – where did the money that catalyzed Bitcoin’s surge in 2019 come from? Rumors and internet conspiracies circulate, suggesting that inside information leaked from Facebook about the launch of its Libra cryptocurrency and created a trend change before the announcement and the associated hype.

When it comes to altcoins, the downtrend seems to have been halted this week as Binance announced the launch of a digital currency lending system, with its first two products being BNB and USDT. Surprisingly, users will be able to lend ETC, which explains its price increase. Wanchain also stood out this week, gaining more than 100% and occupying the 88th spot on the list of the top 100 cryptocurrencies.

Nevertheless, Bitcoin has maintained its dominance, and it’s still too early to talk about a change in the trend with respect to the altcoin markets, as Bitcoin hasn’t yet completed its move which began at the beginning of the year.

The trading volume is declining, and investors fear this trend will continue. Of course, there may also be those who are already plotting another move behind the scenes. Events such as Telegram’s coin launch, a recession, or the Bitcoin halving could certainly send Bitcoin’s price to new heights. The future won’t be boring, that’s for sure.

Meanwhile, the Kleiman v. Wright case is also seemingly coming to an end, as a judge ruled against Wright, who might have to pay 500,000 BTC to the brother of an old business partner. The sum is currently worth upwards of $5 billion, and almost half of that might need to be used to pay taxes, which could impact Bitcoin’s price in the short term.

Bitcoin Should Be Regulated Like Other Electronic Financial Services: US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, said that Bitcoin should be regulated like any other electronic financial service in existence today.

Tether Plans to Issue CNHT, a CNY-Pegged Stablecoin. The issuer of the most popular stablecoin on the market, Tether, is reportedly working on a new stablecoin called CNHT. It will be pegged to the official fiat currency of China, the yuan. The news was confirmed by Dong Zhao, a shareholder of Bitfinex.

Altcoins Comprise Only 10% of the Crypto Market, Not 30%. According to a new study, the relative share of all altcoins in the overall cryptocurrency market isn’t 30%, but merely 10%. This suggests that Bitcoin’s dominance rate is close to 90%. The research factored in liquidity, maintaining that the latter is key in generating accurate market cap numbers.

Scientists fight Trump EPA 'secret science' proposal to exclude certain research,https://thehill.com,[],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/459044-scientists-fight-trump-epa-secret-science-proposal-to-exclude,"Scientists on Tuesday pushed back against a Trump administration proposal that would block the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from relying on studies that don’t make their underlying data public.

Critics say the proposal, introduced by former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott PruittControversial husband and wife EPA duo to leave Washington Environmentalists renew bid to overturn EPA policy barring scientists from advisory panels Six states sue EPA over pesticide tied to brain damage MORE in 2017 to battle what he called ""secret science,"" risks eliminating major studies from consideration as the EPA considers new policies.

Current EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler Andrew Wheeler Five things to watch as Trump heads to G-7 summit Controversial husband and wife EPA duo to leave Washington The Hill's Morning Report - Trump touts new immigration policy, backtracks on tax cuts MORE had asked the EPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB) to weigh how the agency could work to deal with the numerous studies that anonymize or withhold sensitive data in order to protect personal information and confidential business information, an issue before the panel on Tuesday. ADVERTISEMENT

“If this is such a good idea, why is it proposed just for EPA rather than as legislation or regulation applying to all health-regulating agencies?” asked Roy Gamse, a former deputy assistant administrator at EPA.

Gamse joined multiple outside scientists using Tuesday's meeting to push the advisory panel to reject the proposal in its entirety.

“Imagine the Food and Drug Administration being forbidden to approve new drugs unless the research justifying their use were subject to these same regulatory prohibitions. ... Drug approvals would likely grind to a halt. As would EPA regulations for air quality standards, hazardous materials exposures, pesticides exposures, drinking water concentrations, etc.,” Gamse said.

Board members are working to create a tiered approach that might make the EPA’s proposed rule more functional. Studies with particularly sensitive data might be allowed higher levels of protection, such as hiding data behind a password-protected website.

“Many of the SAB members were very supportive regarding the importance of scientific transparency,” a spokesman for the EPA said in a statement to The Hill. “Today we heard a good discussion as the Board grapples with the details of how best to implement this proposed rule. EPA looks forward to getting the final consultation with all these ideas included.”

Some of the board members were indeed supportive of the effort.

Richard Williams, a board member and former economist with the Food and Drug Administration, said the proposal would be needed to avoid poorly performed studies that produce bad statistics.

“This is what this is trying to get after,” Williams said, adding that a tiered system will help the EPA use whatever studies it deems necessary.

Critics say the board has largely been sidelined by the EPA, as it has been asked to review only a narrow piece of the proposal.

The board somewhat rejected that call at its last meeting when it voted to review the proposal more broadly in addition to trying to find ways to deal with personal and business data.

Some have also voiced concerns that the board won’t finish its review of the EPA proposal in time to have an impact on the final rule, which is expected later this year.

“EPA’s reticence to give SAB the answers it needs to evaluate the rule further exemplifies that this rule presents a solution in search of a problem,” Genna Reed, lead science and policy analyst for the Union of Concerned Scientists said during the meeting’s public comment portion.

“The rule as drafted would waste enormous resources, make data more vulnerable to misuse and exploitation, and make it nearly impossible for the EPA to use the best available science to inform mission-critical decisions. We ask that the EPA fully utilize the SAB and consider its advice on this rule in its entirety,” she said.

Reed said the EPA’s proposal lacks basic information, such as a definition for data or how it could be replicable.

Critics have also raised concerns about the qualifications of those appointed under the Trump administration compared to previous board members. They noted that Pruitt barred scientists from the board if they received EPA grants, calling it a conflict of interest.

A report from the Government Accountability Office found more industry group representation on the board under Trump. It also said the EPA did not follow the process for selecting the “best qualified and most appropriate candidates” for the SAB and “did not ensure that all appointees met ethics requirements.”

Many of the board members on Tuesday questioned how they could even create a system that would allow for use of studies that shield sensitive information.

“I think the comments made from SAB members really illustrated exactly how messy the proposed rule is. Many of the members have trouble answering the simple charged questions that were proposed without going down rabbit holes on the glaring issues with the rule,” Reed said."
State Department announces new head of policy planning,https://www.politico.com,['Eliana Johnson'],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/26/state-department-office-of-policy-planning-peter-berkowitz-1475732,"Peter Berkowitz came to the State Department from Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. | Mark Wilson/Getty Images Foreign Policy State Department announces new head of policy planning

The State Department on Monday announced the political scientist Peter Berkowitz as the head of policy planning, a post that puts him in charge of long-term strategic thinking for the department.

Berkowitz, who was already working in the Office of Policy Planning, will replace his former boss, Kiron Skinner, who was dismissed earlier this month over concerns about her management style.

Story Continued Below

The announcement came in an internal email to select State Department officials on Monday morning, according to one of those officials.

Berkowitz, who has taught both constitutional law and political philosophy, came to the State Department from Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. He is the author of four books on subjects ranging from conservatism and progressivism to the ethics of Nietzsche.

Under former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the Department of Policy Planning — which has historically operated as the State Department’s internal think tank — played a key role in the day-to-day management of the department.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who works closely with a team of special envoys, has returned it to its traditional role of churning out papers and proposals on long-range strategic issues.

Sens. Blumenthal and Klobuchar Call on Justice Dept. to Investigate Ticketing Industry: Exclusive,https://www.billboard.com,['Dave Brooks'],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/touring/8528501/ticket-industry-investigation-doj-senators-letter,"Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., holds up her hand to speak as she shares a note with Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., right, during a Senate Judiciary Committee markup meeting on Capitol Hill on Sept. 13, 2018 in Washington, DC.

Democratic law makers say the 2010 Live Nation/Ticketmaster merger was ""bad for consumers"" and want the consent decree extended.

Two Democratic U.S. senators are asking the Department of Justice to open an investigation into ticketing, saying they have ""serious concerns that online ticket markets are not working for American consumers.""

While the letter from Sens. Richard Blumenthal of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota asks assistant attorney general Makan Delrahim with the DOJ's antitrust division to look at overall competition in the ticketing business, the letter is squarely aimed at one company: Live Nation. The concert promoter merged with Ticketmaster in 2010 and has operated under a DOJ consent decree, set to expire in July, that bars Live Nation from withholding concerts and tours from buildings that don’t use Ticketmaster, or retailiating when venues go with a competitor.

""The consent decree has been criticized as ineffective, and there have been disturbing reports that Live Nation has flouted its conditions,” the letter reads, saying the soon-to-expire deal -- negotiated between Live Nation’s attorneys and former assistant attorney general Christine Varney -- leaves ""Live Nation’s dominance virtually unchallenged.”

Blumenthal and Klobuchar want the DOJ to ""investigate the state of competition in the ticketing industry"" and potentially extend the consent decree past July 2020, a move Live Nation would likely oppose. The requested anti-trust inquiry comes at a time when senators and presidential candidates are calling for investigations of large tech companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook for monopolistic business practices with Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris arguing the tech giants should be broken up.

""The Department of Justice should act to reinvigorate competition in the ticket market to help consumers,” reads Blumenthal and Klobuchar's five-page letter, calling for the DOJ to ""enforce the terms of the Ticketmaster-Live Nation consent decree, including the anti-retaliation merger conditions” and ""not hesitate to seek appropriate remedies to ensure compliance with the merger conditions.”

Live Nation’s compliance with the 2010 decree has been under investigation for several years, amid complaints from competitors about the company’s dominance in live music, sources tell Billboard. DOJ officials have never charged Live Nation with violating the consent decree and aren't expected to before the decree expires next year. Without any formal charges that Live Nation broke the agreement, it's unlikely DOJ officials would be able to convince a judge to find Live Nation in contempt of the agreement, or to extend the consent decree any further, sources tell Billboard.

Critics of the consent decree said its enforcement mechanism is weakened because Live Nation is allowed to prioritize tours for venues that use Ticketmaster, just as AEG tries to do with its tours. That makes proving that Live Nation retiliated against a venue increasingly difficult, although several promoters and competing ticketing companies have met with DOJ officials to express their concerns.

The 2010 deal also required Ticketmaster to license its technology to competitor AEG to create its own rival ticketing system, although AEG’s former CEO Tim Leiweke ended the license and pursued an agreement with Outbox, Cirque du Soleil’s ticketing system and later with Veritix, owned by Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert. The agreement also required Ticketmaster to spin off ticketing firm Paciolan to a company owned by cable giant Comcast and ticketing companies like Eventbrite, Ticketfly and SeatGeek who have won clients from the Ticketmaster, but no company has come close to challenging Ticketmaster’s dominance in live entertainment.

That’s brought increased scrutiny to Ticketmaster and a series of critical reports, cited by the senators in their letters, from groups like the American Antitrust Institute and the U.S. Government Accountability Office, as well as media reports about the company’s adherence to the decree and growing business in the secondary market.

Blumenthal also wants the DOJ to ""conduct an investigation into the state of competition in the ticketing marketplace"" looking at ""the effects of past consolidation and an assessment of how the available antitrust enforcement tools may be used to help restore competition.""

Live Nation declined to comment for this story."
Trump claims he has 'absolute right' to order US companies out of China under 1977 law,https://www.cnn.com,['Veronica Stracqualursi'],08-24-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/24/politics/trump-china-trade-war-emergency-economic-powers-act/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump claimed he has the ""absolute right"" to ""order"" US companies to stop doing business with China that would involve using his broad executive authority in a new and unprecedented way under a 1977 law.

On Friday, China unveiled a new round of retaliatory tariffs on about $75 billion worth of US goods, the latest escalation in an on-going trade war that's putting a strain on the world's two largest economies. In response, Trump wrote on Twitter later Friday: ""Our great American companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China including bringing ...your companies HOME and making your products in the USA.""

When leaving the White House for the G7 summit in France, Trump told reporters, ""I have the absolute right to do that, but we'll see how it goes."" He later explained that he was referring to the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), and in a Friday tweet wrote: ""For all of the Fake News Reporters that don't have a clue as to what the law is relative to Presidential powers, China, etc., try looking at the Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977. Case closed!""

Trump's latest comments again raise questions as to how far the President's authority goes under the IEEPA . In May, Trump threatened to slap Mexico with punitive tariffs unless it slowed the passage of migrants from Central America to the US. The IEEPA, according to the Congressional Research Service, has never been invoked to impose tariffs, and Trump ultimately drew back at the last minute.

The IEEPA, passed in the wake of Watergate and Vietnam, gives Trump ""broad authority to regulate a variety of economic transactions following a declaration of national emergency,"" according to an analysis by the CRS.

Those presidential powers can be used ""to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat....to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States.""

Under the IEEPA, the President has to consult with Congress before invoking his authority and, after declaring a national emergency, send a report to Congress explaining why.

This authority has been used frequently; there have been 54 national emergencies, 29 of which are ongoing. In the first use of the IEEPA, during the Iran hostage crisis in 1979, President Jimmy Carter imposed trade sanctions against Iran, freezing Iranian assets in the US, according to CRS.

Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas and a CNN legal analyst, told CNN in May that what Trump wanted to do under the law with Mexico may have been within the authority given to the White House by Congress -- though it might not have been what Congress ever intended.

""The idea behind these authorities is that the President is better situated to make those kinds of determinations than Congress, especially when they're time-sensitive,"" Vladeck told CNN at the time. ""So I think the President's conduct may well be within the letter of the law here. But, as with the National Emergencies Act, I very much doubt this kind of exercise of the authority conferred by the statute is what Congress had in mind.""

On Saturday, Vladeck again weighed in, tweeting: ""One of the enduring phenomena of the Trump era is going to be the list of statutes that give far too much power to the President, but that many didn't used to worry about—assuming there'd be political safeguards. Today's entrant: The International Emergency Economic Powers Act.""

Under the law, though, Congress can end an emergency with a joint resolution.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, who has mounted a longshot bid against Trump for the 2020 Republican presidential nomination, called it ""outrageous"" that a US President would tell US companies how to conduct business."
Department of Energy Announces $21.4 Million for Quantum Information Science Research,https://www.energy.gov,[],,,,https://www.energy.gov/articles/department-energy-announces-214-million-quantum-information-science-research,"WASHINGTON, D.C.—Today, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced $21.4 million in funding for research in Quantum Information Science (QIS) related to both particle physics and fusion energy sciences.

“QIS holds great promise for tackling challenging questions in a wide range of disciplines,” said Under Secretary for Science Paul Dabbar. “This research will open up important new avenues of investigation in areas like artificial intelligence while helping keep American science on the cutting edge of the growing field of QIS.”

Funding of $12 million will be provided for 21 projects of two to three years’ duration in particle physics. Efforts will range from the development of highly sensitive quantum sensors for the detection of rare particles, to the use of quantum computing to analyze particle physics data, to quantum simulation experiments connecting the cosmos to quantum systems.

Funding of $9.4 million will be provided for six projects of up to three years in duration in fusion energy sciences. Research will examine the application of quantum computing to fusion and plasma science, the use of plasma science techniques for quantum sensing, and the quantum behavior of matter under high-energy-density conditions, among other topics.

Fiscal Year 2019 funding for the two initiatives totals $18.4 million, with out-year funding for the three-year particle physics projects contingent on congressional appropriations.

Projects were selected by competitive peer review under two separate Funding Opportunity Announcements (and corresponding announcements for DOE laboratories) sponsored respectively by the Office of High Energy Physics and the Office of Fusion Energy Sciences with the Department’s Office of Science.

A list of particle physics projects can be found here and fusion energy sciences projects here, both under the heading “What’s New.”

Dudley encourages the Fed to help sway the 2020 election against Trump,https://www.cnbc.com,['Jeff Cox'],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/27/dudley-encourages-the-fed-not-to-play-along-with-trumps-trade-war.html,"William C. Dudley, president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Former New York Fed President Bill Dudley is calling on the central bank not to help President Donald Trump fight his trade war with China.

In a sharply worded commentary to his one-time colleagues, Dudley urged Fed officials not to lower interest rates simply as a backstop while the president continues his tit-for-tat tariff battle with the Chinese that has escalated in recent days.

""Central bank officials face a choice: enable the Trump administration to continue down a disastrous path of trade war escalation, or send a clear signal that if the administration does so, the president, not the Fed, will bear the risks — including the risk of losing the next election,"" he wrote in a post on the Bloomberg News site.

Dudley went so far as to suggest the Fed could — and should — try to influence the next election against Trump.

""After all, Trump's reelection arguably presents a threat to the U.S. and global economy, to the Fed's independence and its ability to achieve its employment and inflation objectives,"" he wrote. ""If the goal of monetary policy is to achieve the best long-term economic outcome, then Fed officials should consider how their decisions will affect the political outcome in 2020.""

A Fed spokesman said the central bank does not use politics as a guide for its decisions.

""The Federal Reserve's policy decisions are guided solely by its congressional mandate to maintain price stability and maximum employment. Political considerations play absolutely no role,"" the official said in a statement.

Some economists criticized Dudley's statement as inappropriate for a former central banker.

""We fear that the opinion column ... is likely to prove counterproductive for the current Fed leadership, which we are confident had no hand in the production of the opinion piece and has had to deny immediately that 'political considerations' play any part in policymaking,"" Krishna Guha, head of global policy at central bank strategy at Evercore ISI, said in a note.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment."
United States Department of Defense Increases Deployment of Rekor Technology,https://finance.yahoo.com,[],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-states-department-defense-increases-113000911.html,"Expands use of Rekor’s proprietary vehicle recognition software to enhance existing camera networks following successful initial engagement

COLUMBIA, MD / ACCESSWIRE / August 27, 2019 / Rekor Systems, Inc, (REKR) (‘Rekor”) a Nasdaq company focused on bringing smarter, faster, cost-competitive solutions to the worlds of public safety and customer experience, announced today it has received a purchase order from the Department of Defense (DoD) to provide an additional 200 camera licenses for the Company’s vehicle recognition system. The DoD has now doubled its total camera licenses from Rekor, having originally purchased 200 licenses to use the Company’s machine-learning enabled vehicle recognition system in May of this year.

“We believe that both the initial selection and the rapid subsequent second purchase by the DoD confirms what we’ve long known about our technology - that it is the most robust vehicle recognition system on the market and a critical tool to support the important work of the world’s preeminent defense department,” said Robert A. Berman, President and CEO of Rekor. “Our solutions are easy to integrate, highly scalable and very cost efficient. By deploying our software within their existing infrastructure, our customers, including the DoD, can markedly enhance the functionality of their existing IP cameras by adding the most powerful vehicle recognition system in the world. What’s more, it’s all done without sacrificing any of the functionality of the existing system or the need to purchase new, expensive hardware.”

Rekor’s software enables automatic license plate and vehicle recognition through virtually any IP camera. Its industry-leading artificial intelligence-based solutions can be hosted locally or in the cloud. Enabled by machine learning from its robust and growing database covering over 70 countries, Rekor’s software can identify in real time vehicle license plate data, color, make, model and body type.

Rather than buying expensive cameras that take weeks or months to ship and install, Rekor’s software can be deployed to any existing IP camera immediately. This can represent a potential savings of tens of thousands of dollars per camera, as well as greater flexibility to expand or decrease usage as needed without large capital expenditures on hardware. It also eliminates the need for two separate cameras - one for lice plate reading functionality, one for general surveillance recording - as Rekor’s solution can be used to collect license plate data and information such as the make, model, and color of a vehicle using the same camera that provides surveillance monitoring.

DOJ Increases Power Of Agency Running Immigration Court System,https://www.npr.org,['Richard Gonzales'],08-23-2019,2019,8,https://www.npr.org/2019/08/23/753912351/doj-increases-power-of-agency-running-immigration-court-system,"DOJ Increases Power Of Agency Running Immigration Court System

Enlarge this image toggle caption Susan Walsh/AP Susan Walsh/AP

The Trump administration is making changes to the agency that operates the nation's immigration court system, a move immediately denounced by the immigration judges' union as a power grab.

The agency is called the Executive Office for Immigration Review and it is an arm of the Justice Department. Under the interim rule announced Friday, the agency's director will have the power to issue appellate decisions in immigration cases that have not been decided within an allotted timeframe. It also creates a new office of policy within EOIR to implement the administration's immigration policies.

The head of the immigration judges' union accused the administration of trying to strip power away from judges and turn the immigration court system into a law enforcement agency.

""In an unprecedented attempt at agency overreach to dismantle the Immigration Court, the Department of Justice, Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) today published a new interim rule, effective next Monday, which takes steps to dismantle the Immigration Court system,"" Judge Ashley Tabaddor, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, said in a statement. ""DOJ's action ends any transparency and assurance of independent decision making over individual cases.""

The new rule, first reported by The Associated Press, comes after the administration announced an effort to decertify the immigration judges' union. The judges, 440 in total, are employees of the Justice Department and not part of the independent judiciary. The Trump administration has also imposed quotas on judges in an effort to speed up deportations and reduce the backlog of more than 900,000 cases pending in immigration courts.

Tabaddor said the administration is trying to concentrate its power over immigration proceedings.

""The new rule is a wolf in sheep's clothing,"" Tabaddor said. ""While couched in bureaucratic language, the impact of this regulation is to substitute the policy directives of a single political appointee over the legal analysis of non-political, independent adjudicators.""

The EOIR did not respond to a call for comment.

Earlier this week, the EOIR sent the immigration judges a newsletter containing a blog post from VDare, an anti-immigration website, which included an anti-Semitic reference, according to Tabaddor. After she protested, Justice Department officials said some information included with the newsletter had been compiled by a third-party contractor and should not have been distributed.

""The Department of Justice condemns anti-Semitism in the strongest terms,"" Kathryn Mattingly, a spokeswoman for EOIR told BuzzFeed."

Federal environmental regulators have joined critics of Miami-Dade’s proposal to run a major freeway through wetlands, saying the plan to construct the Kendall Parkway poses “substantial and unacceptable adverse secondary impacts to the Greater Everglades.”

In a letter last week to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Environmental Protection Agency said a six-lane toll in West Kendall would produce direct impacts to 350 acres of freshwater wetlands in the Bird Drive Basin, an area that’s key to guaranteeing drinking water for Miami and the Florida Keys. The EPA considers the area an “aquatic resource of national importance.“

The questions from the EPA are only the latest hurdles for a project that already under fire from legal challenges, political disputes and forecasts that traffic improvements would be limited.

The letter was sent in response to a permit application to build over the wetlands by Miami-Dade Expressway Authority, or MDX, the county toll agency that proposed the roadway.

In the Aug. 23 letter, the EPA said that MDX proposal came up short of analysis on several fronts: There was not sufficient information on alternatives to minimize environmental impacts. The agency had failed to show that the project complies with environmental regulation that would allow for the degradation of wetlands. The EPA also asked MDX to explain if it had considered the effects from potential induced development in the areas that surround the proposed highway.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is in the midst of reviewing MDX’s application to build over protected wetlands. Public comments closed on Aug. 23. The Corps will make the final decision on issuing a permit.

Javier Rodriguez, the MDX director, downplayed the letter during a meeting of the board Tuesday, only the second since a Florida judge reinstated the government agency after a new state law dissolved it for a new toll board called the Greater Miami Expressway Agency. The law, signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis and backed by Miami-Dade Republicans in Tallahassee, is suspended pending an appeal of the Aug. 9 lower-court decision that declared the legislation unconstitutional.

Rodriguez said the MDX can provide EPA administrators the information needed to answer questions raised by the regulator. “They basically asked for information. We have that information,” Rodriguez said. “Our study effectively addresses all the concerns they have.”

The EPA letter draws the latest fault line in a highway debate that has divided some of Miami-Dade’s most prominent Republicans. On the one side is county Mayor Carlos Gimenez, the MDX’s appointed chairman who has led the charge to win county approval of the highway and tried to rally public support behind the $1 billion effort.

On the other is U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, who got his political start in Miami and touted the EPA’s letter in a Twitter post over the weekend all but declaring the 836 project dead. “Without EPA concurrence,” Rubio wrote, the Army Corps “will not approve #CleanWaterAct permits for #KendallParkway construction in Bird Road Basin.”

Gimenez questioned the confrontational role his fellow Republican has taken toward the 836 extension while not objecting to a trio of new toll roads approved by the Florida legislature this year for Florida. “He’s very focused on the Kendall Parkway, but he’s not focused at all on hundreds of miles of highway running through environmentally sensitive land,” Gimenez said during a break in the meeting. Rubio’s office had no immediate comment.

Bird Drive Basin was once part of the Shark River Slough, the main artery for water flow in the Everglades. It’s used to recharge the region’s shallow Biscayne aquifer, the only drinking water source for communities in Miami-Dade and Miccosukee Tribe. It’s also home to native animals, wading birds and rare plants.

“Freshwater wetlands are essential to the region because they provide important water quality and wildlife benefits, and serve as a filtration system that protect bodies of water,” Jeaneanne Gettle, Director of EPA’s Water Division in Atlanta, wrote in the letter.

Because of its key location and the functions that it serves, Bird Drive Basin is part of the Everglades Restoration Plan, and was earmarked for restoration work to reestablish water flow south through the river of grass. Much of that land is already owned by the South Florida Water Management District and the U.S. Department of the Interior. The Miccosukee also own land acquired to restore the tribe’s historic homelands.

Environmentalists and a developer sued MDX and Miami-Dade, arguing the project would violate the county’s growth management plan. They warned that allowing the road to get so close to the Everglades would encourage more suburban sprawl and development that could endanger protected wetlands.

South Florida water managers and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection had already raised red flags over the lack of details about the impact of the road on natural resources, water supply and flood control."
