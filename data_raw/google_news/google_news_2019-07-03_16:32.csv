The National Rifle Association aired an avalanche of TV ads and pushed its 5 million-plus members to the polls for Donald Trump in 2016, propelling him in the Rust Belt states that delivered him the presidency.

Now, the gun rights group is in total meltdown — and senior Republicans and Trump 2020 officials are alarmed.

Story Continued Below

In recent weeks, the NRA has seen everything from a failed coup attempt to the departure of its longtime political architect to embarrassing tales of self-dealing by top leaders. The turmoil is fueling fears that the organization will be profoundly diminished heading into the election, leaving the Republican Party with a gaping hole in its political machinery.

With the Chamber of Commerce and Koch political network withdrawing from their once-dominant roles in electing conservatives, Republicans worry that three organizations that have long formed the core of their electoral infrastructure will be effectively on the sidelines.

The predicament has so troubled some Republicans that they are calling on the famously secretive NRA to address its 2020 plans. Within the past week, senators have privately expressed concerns about the group to National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Todd Young.

“No organization has been more important to conservative voter education and engagement than the NRA. We all hope they’re able to mount the kind of effort in the 2020 cycle they have in the past,” said Gregg Keller, a former American Conservative Union executive director. “But in case they can’t, given their current situation, I hope they’re being forthright about that within the movement so others can pick up the slack.”

“The situation,” he added, “has folks nervous.”

What makes the NRA such a potent force for Republicans, party officials said, are its reach into battlegrounds — such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina and Ohio — and the sway it holds with its members. The NRA’s appeals play a critical role in turning out sportsmen, many of whom have paid dues to the organization for years and regard it as an important part of their lives.

Chris LaCivita, a national GOP strategist who’s waged congressional and statewide campaigns in North Carolina, said he remains confident gun advocates will turn out to vote in 2020. But he said the NRA’s problems could hobble its mobilization efforts.

“Infighting and accusations playing out almost daily in the national media regarding the NRA have not been helpful. Clearly it will have an impact in the NRA's ability to raise money, which would be used in elections to turn out its membership,” LaCivita said.

With the organization mired in palace intrigue and confronting a daily barrage of negative publicity, some NRA officials are skeptical a 2020 plan will emerge. Many Republicans are convinced the job of turning out Second Amendment supporters will fall to the cash-flush Republican National Committee, which is constructing a massive get-out-the-vote and data machine devoted to turning out conservatives.

Jane Timken, chairwoman of the Ohio GOP, said her organization would work closely with the RNC to microtarget firearm owners. The national party, Timken noted, has compiled extensive voter data through sources ranging from gun licenses to gun magazine subscriptions.

Concerns over the NRA intensified last week after the resignation of Chris Cox, who had been the head of its lobbying arm since 2002. Cox was well-liked by NRA staff and board members and had deep relationships with major donors and many of the party’s top strategists. He recently participated in 2020 planning meetings with the pro-Trump America First Action super PAC and the anti-tax Club for Growth. The groups discussed polling and opposition research, voter registration efforts, and ensuring smooth coordination.

With Cox gone, it's an open question who will oversee the NRA’s 2020 strategy.

“Chris Cox is the guy everybody dealt with,” said Steven Law, president of the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC closely aligned with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

Jason Ouimet, a director of federal affairs at the organization, is expected to assume Cox’s role on an interim basis, a person familiar with the move confirmed. Ouimet’s appointment, NRA officials said, is designed to temporarily stave off a mass staff exodus and calm both the organization's members and the broader conservative world.

""Anyone who chooses to discount us does so at their peril,"" Ouimet said in a statement after this story was published. ""The NRA is poised to mobilize the tens of millions of Second Amendment supporters in the upcoming elections.”

The organization's troubles are hard to overstate. The most serious threat is an investigation by New York state attorney general's office into its tax-exempt status. In April, NRA President Oliver North was ousted in an ugly public spectacle in which he declared the group was in a ""clear crisis."" News organizations have also reported that NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre used $275,000 of the group's money to buy luxury clothes at Zegna in Beverly Hills, Calif., and that the organization logged tens of thousands of dollars in other expenses that benefited its officials.

Trump weighed in on the NRA's problems Tuesday morning, tweeting that the group is a ""victim"" of ""political harassment by New York State and Governor Cuomo.""

…Texas will defend them & indemnify them against political harassment by New York State and Governor Cuomo. So many people are leaving New York for Texas and Florida that it is totally under siege. First New York taxes you too high, then they sue you, just to complete the job — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 2, 2019

Ken Blackwell, an NRA board member who is active with an array of conservative groups, disputed the idea that Cox’s departure and the subsequent turmoil would sideline the group in 2020. The NRA’s turnout efforts, he said, were largely orchestrated at the state and local levels.

“Chris was good at what he did, but he was not the reservoir of ground action,” Blackwell said. “This notion that there was someone sitting behind the green curtain in Washington driving the base turnout, it was a misnomer.”

Others argued that with Democratic presidential candidates vowing to enact stricter gun control laws, firearm owners will be sufficiently motivated to keep Trump in office.

Issues surrounding the Republican Party's outside infrastructure go beyond the NRA. The Chamber of Commerce, a key player in Republican politics over the past decade, spent just $10 million during the 2018 cycle, about a third of what it spent during the previous election cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The scale back has led many to believe the organization, a staple of the business community, is preparing to play a diminished role in 2020.

Other clues have emerged. In April, Chamber leaders told The Washington Post they were seeking to rebrand the organization as a bipartisan outfit. And in January, Rob Engstrom stepped down as national political director, a role the Chamber is in the process of filling. People familiar with the arrangement said Engstrom remains a consultant with the organization.

Scott Reed, the group’s chief political strategist, denied the group is retrenching. This fall, he said, the Chamber would launch a multimillion-dollar effort to defend the Republican Senate majority.

“We will be spending money earlier this cycle on the Senate than we’ve ever spent in the 100-year history of the Chamber,” he said.

Meanwhile, the Koch network is gradually shifting away from partisanship and toward policy issues like addressing poverty and drug addiction. The network, which like the Chamber has at times found itself at odds with the president, plans to sit out the 2020 presidential race and is recasting itself in a nonpartisan fashion.

Emily Seidel, chief executive of the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity, penned a memo last month in which she announced the outfit is open to backing candidates from either party.

The new approach has rankled some longtime Koch donors, who complain the powerful network — which played a pivotal role in helping Republicans capture the Senate majority — is abandoning the GOP.

Koch officials dispute that they are pulling back, noting they’ve endorsed a handful of GOP senators who align with the network’s goals. When the network gathered in Colorado Springs, Colo., over the weekend, its members were joined by a small group of Republicans facing reelection, including Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin and Georgia Sen. David Perdue.

The uncertainty surrounding all three groups is likely to increase pressure on America First Action, a super PAC devoted to backing Trump.

""If a void needs to be filled in 2020, we will fill it and continue to work with those allies that are willing to step into the breach to help reelect Donald Trump,"" America first spokeswoman Kelly Sadler said..

To others, though, the developments are a potential sign of danger ahead. David McIntosh, the president of the Club for Growth and a former Republican congressman, said he was particularly troubled by the Koch network's decision to refocus its efforts. After Barack Obama's 2008 election, he noted, the network filled a vacuum by providing the devastated party with much-needed infrastructure.

“Right now, the party is functioning,"" McIntosh said. ""But if you see another collapse or if we lose the White House, I think you’re going to see Republicans frankly in a world of hurt without a major funding group like that.”"
Tyler Skaggs tribute hashtag overtaken by Trump haters,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Ryan Gaydos', 'Ryan Gaydos Is An Editor For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/tyler-skaggs-angels-tribute-hashtags-trump,"Baseball fans on Tuesday used #RIP45 on Twitter to pay tribute to Los Angeles Angels pitcher Tyler Skaggs, who was found dead in his hotel room prior to a game against the Texas Rangers.

However, some on the social media network who saw the trend thought President Trump, the 45th president of the United States, had died while others took delight in that notion.

GIANCARLO STANTON, MIKE TROUT LEAD TRIBUTES AFTER SUDDEN DEATH OF ANGELS PITCHER TYLER SKAGGS

Many others objected to those who had hijacked the tribute thread to joke about the death of the president and used their own platform to strike back.

Skaggs, 27, was found unresponsive in his Texas hotel room, stunning the Major League Baseball community and leading to the postponement of Monday’s game between the Angels and Rangers.

The cause of death wasn’t immediately made known. Police said no foul play was suspected.

LOS ANGELES ANGELS PITCHER TYLER SKAGGS DEAD AT 27

Born in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Woodland Hills, Skaggs was a first-round draft pick of the Angels out of Santa Monica High School in 2009. The Angels traded Skaggs to Arizona in 2010, and he started his big-league career with 13 appearances over two seasons for the Diamondbacks. The Angels reacquired him in December 2013, and he had won 25 games over five seasons with the club.

Skaggs had been a regular in the Angels' starting rotation since late 2016 when he returned from Tommy John surgery. He struggled with injuries repeatedly over the past three seasons but persevered to become a valuable starter in Los Angeles' injury-plagued rotation. Skaggs started a career-high 24 games last season, going 8-10 with a 4.02 ERA. He missed playing time in April this season with a sprained ankle but came back strong.

Skaggs was part of the same Angels draft class as Trout, and they were roommates in the low minor leagues before Skaggs was traded to Arizona. They played on the same team in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in 2010.

Opinion | Trump Needs His Base to Burn With Anger,https://www.nytimes.com,['Thomas B. Edsall'],07-03-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/03/opinion/trump-republican-base.html,"Republicans cross-pressured by partisan loyalty, on one hand, and aversion to Trump on the other, Kane added, “may instead opt to abstain from voting at all.”

In the calculus of elections, an abstention from voting amounts to a gain of one vote, while a conversion — from Republican to Democrat or vice versa — amounts to two: one lost by the other side and one gained for yours.

Julie Wronski, a political scientist at the University of Mississippi, who wrote the “Ingroup Lovers or Outgroup Haters?” paper with Kane and Lilliana Mason of the University of Maryland, noted in an email that

in all of our statistical models, the effect of voters’ party ID was larger than the effect of their group feelings. So while warmth toward groups like blacks and Muslims can make voters amenable to Democratic candidates, it’s unclear whether these feelings can override the strong and longstanding influence of partisanship.

Wronski pointed out in an email that Trump is campaigning

largely on issues of white identity. And given the exchange Thursday night between Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on school busing, it appears the Democratic Party is going to also focus on identity-based issues in 2020. Thus, it is looking like feelings toward the groups targeted by the candidates will matter.

All of which helps explain Trump’s shift to rolling back gay and lesbian rights, for example, after many decades of supporting just those causes.

In the midst of the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump described himself as a “real friend” of the LGBTQ community. Since taking office, however, the Trump administration has argued that the 1964 Civil Rights Act rights law does not protect gay workers from discrimination and that transgender people should be barred from military service.

There is an underlying political logic to the switch from Trump’s campaign stance to his policies once he won the White House. As he heads into the 2020 election, his “base,” the voters essential to his re-election, are hostile not only to gay men and lesbians, but to racial and ethnic minorities as well."

The host of “Fareed Zakaria GPS,” was also critical of asylum rules that he called “vague, laxed and being gamed.” Zakaria said asylum was initially intended for a small number of people in the most extreme circumstances, not as a process of immigration in itself. He said the rules need to be “substantially tightened.""

He pointed out that “many” current asylum-seekers often have “suspiciously similar stories” and employ “identical phrases.”

“Democrats have spent most of their efforts on this topic, assailing the Trump administration for its heartlessness,” he said. “Fine. But that does not address the roots of this genuine crisis. If things continue to spiral downward and America's southern border seems out of control, Trump's tough rhetoric and hard-line stance will become increasingly attractive to the public.”

A federal judge in Seattle on Tuesday blocked a Trump administration policy that would keep thousands of asylum-seekers locked up while they pursue their cases, saying the Constitution demands that such migrants have a chance to be released from custody.

"After nearly two years, State Dept. responds to inquiry over alleged alcohol poisonings of US tourists",https://www.cnn.com,"['Michelle Kosinski', 'Zachary Cohen']",07-03-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/03/politics/state-department-tainted-alcohol-mexico/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Nearly two years after receiving an inquiry from Senate Homeland Security Committee chairman Ron Johnson, the State Department is finally revealing details about its investigation into multiple deaths and illnesses that occurred shortly after Americans drank alcohol at Mexican resorts , CNN has learned.

The response, obtained by CNN, said that two bars were ultimately shut down by Mexican authorities after the State Department pressured them to inspect a number of establishments.

It was sent to Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, last month by the State Department's Office of Inspector General. Johnson first wrote to enquire about the cases involving allegations of tainted alcohol in October 2017.

The timing of the OIG's response coincides with a more recent string of mysterious tourist deaths in the Dominican Republic

In several of those cases, families have alleged that the victims became ill just after consuming alcohol, leading the FBI to look into whether tainted alcohol might be a factor there as well.

While there is no indication of a link between the incidents that occurred in Mexico and the more recent cases in the Dominican Republic, the response to Johnson's 2017 letter highlights several concerns related to the US government's handling of inquires involving American tourists abroad.

Johnson sent his letter to the State Department just months after the death of a 20-year-old woman from Wisconsin named Abbey Conner in January 2017.

She and her brother Austin lost consciousness soon after consuming alcohol at the pool bar in the Iberostar Paraiso del Mar on the first day of their family's vacation. Abbey was found face-down in the shallow end of the pool, nearly drowned, and died days later after being airlifted to a hospital in Florida.

""According to Ms. Connor's family, and other victims who have since come forward, the consumption of allegedly tainted alcohol at Mexican resorts has led to violence, physical abuse and even death,"" Johnson's letter to the State Department states. ""I respectfully ask the Office of the Inspector General to examine how the Department monitors, records and reports overseas incidents involving physical abuse or death after the consumption of potentially tainted alcohol.""

'Formal report would not be appropriate'

Despite prompting a wide-ranging probe into the issue, which included reviewing every complaint made to the State Department about possible bootleg alcohol, interviewing the people involved and significant coordination with the Mexican government, the Inspector General ultimately concluded that a ""formal report would not be appropriate.""

The response explains, ""OIG faced several challenges in completing this review, including the fact that victims often did not report incidents of unregulated alcohol to the department, which significantly limited the number of cases on which OIG could base any generalizable findings,"" it states.

""In addition, OIG's review was complicated by the fact that the guidance for consular personnel who face these types of situations is general and sometimes advisory, mainly because of the complex and variable nature of the incidents themselves.""

However, the lengthy response does detail the inner workings of how this inquiry was handled as a result of pressure on the State Department, and details some of the actions that were taken as a result of the review.

Ultimately, the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs did provide OIG with a list of 15 complaints that it has received since 2017 related to the consumption of unregulated alcohol by Americans in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo, the most visited by tourists from the US.

Two bars shut down

The State Department pressured the Mexican government to inspect 30 bars, restaurants and hotels. Two bars -- including one that served Abbey and Austin Conner -- have been shut down as a result. Raids were conducted by Mexican authorities that did end up finding ""a significant amount of alcohol of 'undetermined origin'"" and led to the identification of one supplier of questionably-sourced alcohol.

Ten thousand gallons of this alcohol was seized -- although according to the OIG, none tested positive for any dangerous substances.

And the State Department's work led to the Mexican government opening an office staffed with bilingual attorneys to help American tourists file police reports.

The response makes no mention, however, of multiple incidents reported in various media outlets that Mexican officials had, in other raids, seized hundreds of gallons of alcohol allegedly tainted with methanol, a toxic form of alcohol that is used in fuel, antifreeze, windshield wiper fluid and solvents. It can cause blindness and death.

Those findings are included in the Conner family's wrongful death lawsuit against Iberostar, filed last year.

The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, which has reported extensively on the Mexican cases, reports that it has heard from more than 200 people who believe they encountered tainted alcohol in Mexico, and the paper cites a 2017 Mexican government-spearheaded study that found that as much as 36% of all alcohol consumed throughout Mexico is produced illegally and unregulated.

The OIG's response did detail some of the difficulties American families of victims faced in getting help from the State Department while in Mexico, which some families described as ""insensitive,"" ""bureaucratic,"" or virtually nonexistent. At times families were told by State officials that they could not help them navigate the Mexican law enforcement or healthcare process.

The family of one woman who died was told the State Department couldn't help them at all submitting a police report when the Mexican government refused to let them file one.

In one case, a man had to wait until the next day for assistance filing a police report, despite reporting he was drugged and sexually assaulted after drinking tainted alcohol.

Yet despite recording the summaries of various reported cases, OIG did not express an opinion as to whether extensive handling of alleged cases of tainted alcohol in Mexico falls under the State Department's area of responsibility.

""OIG cannot draw definitive conclusions about any individual consular officer's compliance with Department policies in these cases,"" their response to Johnson's letter says, since State Department guidance on this issue remains vague.

An official with the inspector general's office told CNN their investigation is now closed.

""We were really limited by our jurisdiction, in what we could look at,"" the official said. ""We mostly had to focus on the actions of the State Department. And it did put a lot of pressure on the Mexican government to do thorough inspections.""

The official said the Mexican government was receptive to the US's urgings to do something about‎ the problem, but added, ""Mexico doesn't want to lose tourist dollars. It's a huge source of revenue.""

Gary Davidson, an attorney for the family of Abbey Conner, continues to seek answers and compensation for the family's loss. ""There is basically homemade liquor down there, circulating in the community of hotels -- and a lot of the hotels are buying it,"" he told CNN."
Justice Department watchdog to investigate decision to cancel FBI headquarters plan,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"[""Jonathan O'Connell"", 'Reporter Covering Economic Development With A Focus On Commercial Real Estate', 'The Trump Organization', 'July At Am']",07-03-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/justice-department-watchdog-to-investigate-decision-to-cancel-fbi-headquarters-plan/2019/07/03/76971d76-9d85-11e9-9ed4-c9089972ad5a_story.html,"The Justice Department’s inspector general will investigate the FBI’s role in dropping plans a decade in the making to move its headquarters to the Washington suburbs, he told Congress in a letter Tuesday.

The inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, told House committee leaders that he is initiating a review of actions at the DOJ and FBI that led to the canceling of the plans in favor of building a smaller replacement for the J. Edgar Hoover Building downtown and dispersing other FBI staff elsewhere.

The review could produce new revelations about the Trump administration’s stunning reversal of bipartisan plans for the development of a new, highly secure campus that would have gotten the bureau out of the fast-deteriorating Hoover building.

Democratic leaders of two committees, Elijah E. Cummings (Md.) and Gerald E. Connolly (Va.) of the Oversight Committee and Peter A. DeFazio (Ore.) and Dina Titus (Nev.) of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, have pressed Horowitz to investigate. They redoubled their efforts after the head of the General Services Administration was found by her agency’s inspector general to have misled Congress about the White House’s involvement in the decision-making.

Democrats allege that Trump used the decision to put his own financial interests ahead of the needs of the FBI and taxpayers, which administration officials deny. The GSA is the landlord to Trump’s D.C. hotel, located just down the street from the Hoover building, and redeveloping the Hoover site could introduce a new hotel competitor. Trump also told The Washington Post before running for office that he was considering bidding for the FBI project as well.

Under Trump, the FBI and GSA have both resisted responding to document requests made by Democrats on the Hill.

“For months, our Committees have investigated the Administration’s sudden change of heart on a federal property across the street from the President’s namesake hotel, but because the FBI has withheld key decision-making documents from Congress, we have been left with many unanswered questions,” the House committee leaders said in a statement.

In April testimony to Congress, FBI Director Christopher A. Wray defended the decision to keep the headquarters in downtown Washington and reaffirmed it as his preference. “It is absolutely the FBI’s view, the FBI’s choice, the FBI’s preference to build a new building . . . at our current location,” he said.

For a decade before Trump’s election, the FBI had been working with the GSA and Congress on the suburban headquarters plan. Citing security concerns with staying downtown and lack of large development sites nearby, the FBI and GSA pursued large plots of land near the Capital Beltway and suburban Metro stations, ultimately narrowing its search to sites in Greenbelt and Landover in Maryland and Springfield, Va.

But six months into the Trump administration, the FBI and GSA ditched those plans and announced they preferred to keep a smaller downtown headquarters and move 2,300 headquarters staff members out of the Washington area altogether — to Alabama, Idaho and West Virginia.

GSA chief Emily Murphy testified that Wray — not Trump or a White House official — asked that the FBI remain downtown if possible, downplaying any White House role in the decision-making.

The FBI backed her assertion, but the inspector general found that Murphy misled Congress about the White House’s involvement, including an Oval Office meeting with Trump about the project that she omitted. Murphy denied misleading Congress, maintaining that the decision about where to put the FBI was made before that meeting.

The GSA maintains that the government could see cost savings under the new plan, but federal real estate experts have said the government’s expectations of cost savings weren’t likely to come true based on unrealistic expectations on the administration’s part about how little its plan will cost. The GSA inspector general found that the Trump administration plan could cost hundreds of millions of dollars more and accommodate 2,300 fewer employees."
Patriotism To Partisanship: Trump Inserts Himself Into July 4th Celebrations,https://www.npr.org,['Tamara Keith'],07-03-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/2019/07/03/738139123/on-july-4-trump-could-continue-pattern-of-politics-in-unexpected-places,"Patriotism To Partisanship: Trump Inserts Himself Into July 4th Celebrations

Enlarge this image toggle caption Mark Wilson/Getty Images Mark Wilson/Getty Images

President Trump has a history of treating nonpolitical events like they're campaign rallies, especially if there is a large crowd on hand. His Fourth of July speech from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial will be just such a setting.

A White House official who declined to be named said the speech will be about celebrating America, the flag and members of the military — not political. But all assurances about what Trump will say or do need to be taken with a grain of salt.

Asked Monday whether he thought he ""can give a speech that can reach all Americans,"" Trump said yes, he thought he could. But 17 seconds into answering the question, the president launched into an attack on Democrats, whose ideas for health care would ""destroy the country.""

Even before he utters a single word, Trump's decision to deliver a speech on the National Mall on the Fourth of July injects a political figure (and a deeply polarizing one at that) into what has traditionally been a day where presidents have stayed away.

A political speech could also cause legal problems for the Trump administration. Walter Shaub, a former head of the Office of Government Ethics and now with Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, wrote that Trump's event could quickly fall afoul of ethics laws and laws preventing the spending of government resources for political purposes if Trump or others on the stage start attacking Democrats or talking about his reelection campaign.

'Against The Grain Of History'

In the past, many presidents have skipped town. Others laid low.

The last U.S. president to speak on the National Mall on the Fourth of July was Harry Truman in 1951, marking the 175th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.

Richard Nixon was in California in 1970 when some of his allies hosted an ""Honor America Day"" on the Mall for the Fourth of July. Nixon had a video message piped in to those gathered. There were protests, and the whole thing ended in a cloud of tear gas.

And that's it. Until Trump.

""President Trump is going against the grain of history, what the Fourth of July has meant in the past,"" said Patrick Maney, a presidential historian at Boston College.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Maney said, the Fourth of July was the one day of the year when people in rural areas would be sure to come into town centers to gather and even listen to local politicians.

""It brought people together in a way that no other holiday even including Christmas did,"" said Maney.

This community focus continues to this day, with small parades and fireworks displays at local parks and schools all over America. In short, Independence Day has never really been about Washington, D.C., or the president of the United States.

The Vision

Inspired by Bastille Day celebrations in France, President Trump wants a big display of American military might, complete with military bands, military jet flyovers and tanks, which will be stationary owing to the risk of damaging streets and grass.

There will also be fireworks, which both Trump and the companies donating the pyrotechnics say will be the biggest display in Washington, D.C., ever — even bigger than the bicentennial (where, incidentally, President Gerald Ford didn't speak).

All of this is tacked on to the traditional Fourth of July fireworks display and symphony performance that have been happening on the Mall every year for decades and will proceed.

Looking To D-Day As An Example

It would be a mistake for Trump to deliver partisan remarks on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, says Barry Bennett, a Republican consultant who worked on the Trump campaign in 2016.

""I hope it doesn't turn into a political rally,"" Bennett said. ""I don't think it will. I think that his vision is that it is a 'celebrate America' speech.""

Bennett points to the remarks Trump delivered in Normandy last month to mark the D-Day anniversary. Trump kept to the script, using soaring language to describe the heroism of those who fought in World War II.

""And I hope that they replicate that for the Fourth of July,"" Bennett said.

Though, minutes before the D-Day speech, with lines of headstones in the shot behind him, Trump did a TV interview in which he hit Democrats and called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi a ""disaster.""

Past Politicization

Whatever the White House's intentions, there's a fairly long list of times when a nonpartisan or nonpolitical event took a turn with Trump at the microphone. Here are a few:

July 1, 2017: Celebrate Freedom Rally

The event at the Kennedy Center leading into Independence Day was described as a salute to America's veterans.

""For my very first Independence Day celebration as president, there is no place I'd rather be than with you,"" Trump told the supportive crowd.

But before long, the message of appreciation had moved on to an attack on the media.

""The fake media is trying to silence us but we will not let them,"" Trump said. ""The fake media tried to stop us from going to the White House, but I'm president and they're not. We won, and they lost.""

White House via YouTube

July 24, 2017: National Scout Jamboree

Early in his speech to thousands of Boy Scouts gathered for their annual jamboree, Trump asked, ""Who the hell wants to speak about politics when I'm in front of the Boy Scouts, right?""

He answered his own question. Trump talked about politics at length, including his efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and his big win on election night 2016.

""We won Florida. We won South Carolina. We won North Carolina we won Pennsylvania. We won and won,"" Trump said as part of a lengthy riff.

Trump also told an off-color story about a friend of his from New York.

The Boy Scouts quickly apologized, insisting their organization is ""wholly non-partisan.""

Presidents don't bring politics to the troops, especially when they are deployed overseas. It is a long-standing norm that Trump violated in a big way in his only visit as president with troops deployed in a combat zone. Trump's visit came in the midst of a government shutdown over his desire for funding to build a border wall, which he brought up in remarks before uniformed troops.

Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-says-citizenship-question-being-dropped-from-2020-census-ny-attorney-generals-office,"The New York attorney general’s office said Tuesday the Justice Department has decided to print the 2020 Census without the citizenship question sought by the Trump administration, ending a contentious legal dispute over an issue that could soon affect the makeup of Congress and the Electoral College.

The Supreme Court ruled last week that the question couldn't be added for now, but left open the possibility that additional arguments could change its mind. Civil rights groups argued that the Trump administration's reasons for including the question were merely pretextual efforts to discourage illegal immigrants from responding to the Census.

Population counts from the Census are used to apportion House seats among the 50 states, and a new electoral map based on the Census will be in effect for the 2024 presidential election. States receive votes in the Electoral College equal to the number of members in their congressional delegation, counting both House and Senate seats.

In a tweet on Monday, Daniel Jacobson, who worked in the White House Counsel’s Office under President Obama, said a trial attorney at the Justice Department told him that ""the printer has been instructed to begin the printing process"" without the citizenship question.

""We won,"" Jacobson wrote.

In a statement to Fox News, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross tied the decision to the Supreme Court's ruling.

“I respect the Supreme Court but strongly disagree with its ruling regarding my decision to reinstate a citizenship question on the 2020 Census,"" Ross said. ""The Census Bureau has started the process of printing the decennial questionnaires without the question. My focus, and that of the Bureau and the entire Department is to conduct a complete and accurate census.”

For his part, House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., issued a less-than-celebratory statement calling for answers, even as he praised the decision to scrap the citizenship question.

""I am encouraged that Administration officials dropped President Trump’s unconstitutional plan to postpone the Census just because he lost the Supreme Court case,"" Cummings said. ""The Trump Administration put our country through more than a year of wasted time and squandered resources—all in the service of an illegal attempt to add a discriminatory question based on a pretext.""

Cummings continued: ""The Attorney General and the Secretary of Commerce must now turn over all of the documents our Committee has subpoenaed on a bipartisan basis.""

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y, added, ""The exclusion of the citizenship question from the census is a victory for our democracy and for fair representation of all communities in this country.""

President Trump had tweeted that he had asked lawyers if the count can be delayed until the Supreme Court can reevaluate the matter, based on additional evidence supporting the administration's justifications for adding the citizenship question.

The Supreme Court, in its ruling last week, did not prohibit a citizenship question out of hand but dismissed the administration's provided rationale as insufficient.

However, Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, told Fox News on Tuesday that the Supreme Court was unlikely to change its mind. Clarke's team successfully challenged the Trump administration on the use of the citizenship question in federal court in California, and was one of several groups to bring such lawsuits.

“The Supreme Court’s ruling left little opportunity for the administration to cure the defects with its decision to add a citizenship question and, most importantly, they were simply out of time given the impending deadline for printing forms,"" Clarke said.

Experts agreed that any delay could gum up the U.S. Census Bureau's finely calibrated timetable for the 10-year count. Monday was the deadline to start printing the 600 million documents that will be mailed to 130 million households for next April's census count.

CAL THOMAS: CENSORING THE CENSUS IS ABOUT POLITICS, NOT THE LAW

For months, the Trump administration had argued that the courts needed to decide quickly whether the citizenship question could be added to the 2020 census because of the looming deadline.

""I think it's very important to find out if somebody is a citizen as opposed to an illegal,"" Trump told reporters Monday. ""There's a big difference to me between being a citizen of the United States and being an illegal.""

Former President Barack Obama's administration didn't ask the citizenship question in the 2010 census. The citizenship question was last asked on the census in 1950, but beginning in 1970, a citizenship question was asked in a long-form questionnaire sent to a relatively small number of households, alongside the main census. In 2010, there was no long-form questionnaire.

""There is no credible argument to be made that asking about citizenship subverts the Constitution and federal law,"" Chapman University law professor and constitutional law expert John Eastman told Fox News.

From a logistical standpoint, any delay ""would be a nightmare,"" said John Thompson, who served as Census Bureau director during Obama's second term.

The bureau already has been in the process of signing almost 250 office leases across the U.S. and has hired 1,500 specialists partnering with community organizations to encourage people to participate in the census. More than 170,000 recruits already have filled out applications for the almost half-million positions being created for the count. The bureau has helped set up more than 1,500 committees nationwide working to get everyone to respond.

Furthermore, Congress would have to change the law for the count to be delayed because Title 13 of the U.S. Code mandates that it take place on April 1, 2020, Thompson said.

""I don't think there's any ambiguity, but I'm not a lawyer,"" Thompson said.

Fewer people are expected to fill out the questionnaires using paper than in years past because the bureau for the first time is relying on most respondents to use the Internet to answer questions. Still, printed postcards and letters are to be sent out next March reminding residents it's time to answer the questionnaire, and those who don't respond digitally are expected to be mailed paper questionnaires.

As recently as last week, the Trump administration's solicitor general wrote in court papers that the Census Bureau needed to finalize the questions by June. Any changes to the paper questionnaire after June would impair the bureau's ability to conduct the count in a timely manner, wrote the solicitor general, Noel Francisco.

More than two dozen Democrats in the U.S. Senate last week sent a letter urging Ross to drop any further pursuit of the citizenship question because it would delay the bureau's ability to conduct the count.

""The 2020 Census is less than half a year away, and any unnecessary delay in operations would impact the ability of the Census Bureau to count every person in our country,"" the letter read.

This past May, Montana Republican Sen. Steve Daines introduced legislation that would require the census to include a citizenship question.

""This is America,"" Daines told Fox News at the time. ""We are a sovereign nation. It's absurd that we don't know how many citizens and non-citizens are living in this country. That's why I'm introducing this bill to require a citizenship question on the census - and ensure that states harboring millions of illegal immigrants are not rewarded with additional taxpayer dollars.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., sued Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig to obtain six years of President Trump's tax returns.

The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., is the latest step in a months-long battle with the Trump administration over the president's tax records. Democrats want the court to enforce a subpoena requesting the returns.

Mnuchin rejected the subpoena in May, citing guidance from the Department of Justice. At the time Mnuchin said the request lacked a ""legitimate legislative purpose.""

Democrats argue in the court filing that the committee has the right to access Trump's private tax information under Section 6103 of the U.S. tax code, which says, ""Treasury 'shall furnish' the Committee with 'any' requested tax return information"" from any U.S. citizen, including the president.

The filing states that the law was ""intended to provide the Committee with unfettered access to tax return information necessary to carry out its broad mandate to oversee Treasury, the IRS, and the Nation's tax laws. ""

Committee Republicans have sided with Mnuchin, calling the request baseless and dangerous. Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, the top Republican on Ways and Means, also said the lawsuit is motivated by partisanship and circumvents the usual committee process for requesting taxpayer information.

""The Democrats' partisan, flawed lawsuit continues their unprecedented and illegitimate pursuit to expose President Trump's private tax information,"" Brady said in a statement. ""This is a dangerous course of action.""

But many Democrats, including committee member Bill Pascrell, D-N.J., cheered the lawsuit as the next logical step in the effort to reveal details of Trump's business dealings both as a candidate and while in office.

""We are here today because Donald Trump and his enablers have sneered at our laws and avoided the thinnest accountability for their corruption,"" Pascrell said in a statement. ""The Ways and Means Committee must file this action to stand for rule of law."""
Bipartisan bill aims to stop child pornography trafficking on Defense Department's network,https://www.cnn.com,['Anna Laffrey'],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/02/politics/house-bill-defense-department-network-child-pornography/index.html,"Washington (CNN) A bipartisan group of lawmakers on Tuesday introduced a bill that would crack down on the use of the Department of Defense internet network for trafficking child pornography.

US Immigration and Customs Enforcement identified over 5,000 individuals, several of whom are affiliated with the Defense Department, who subscribe to child pornography websites in an investigation called ""Project Flicker."" A subsequent inquiry by the Defense Criminal Investigative Service tagged hundreds of Defense Department affiliates as suspects in child pornography cases, according to a news release.

The bill, introduced by Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a Virginia Democrat, and Rep. Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican, would help the Defense Department stamp out use of its computers and network to access and share child pornography. The legislation would bolster training, improve technical capacities and require collaboration with both law enforcement and social service providers.

Spanberger, a former federal agent who worked on child exploitation and child pornography cases, called the abuse and exploitation of children through pornography ""horrific crimes.""

""The notion that the Department of Defense's network and Pentagon-issued computers may be used to view, create, or circulate such horrifying images is a shameful disgrace, and one we must fight head on,"" Spanberger said in a statement.

DOJ inspector general completed FISA abuse investigation: GOP congressman,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-inspector-general-completed-fisa-abuse-investigation-gop-congressman,"The Justice Department inspector general's investigation of potential abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is complete, a Republican congressman said, though a report on its findings might not be released for a month.

House Judiciary Committee member John Ratcliffe of Texas said Monday he’d met with DOJ watchdog Michael Horowitz about his FISA abuse report last week. Ratcliffe said in a Fox News interview they’d discussed the timing, but not the content of his report and Horowitz “related that his team’s investigative work is complete and they’re now in the process of drafting that report.”

“I would expect that a draft of that would be completed in short order,” Ratcliffe said.

The DOJ inspector general’s investigation, launched in March 2018, has centered on whether the FBI and DOJ filing of four FISA applications and renewals beginning in October 2016 to surveil former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page was abuse of the FISA process. The applications relied heavily upon an unverified dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele, who was hired by Fusion GPS. The opposition research firm was hired by Marc Elias of the Perkins Coie law firm at the behest of the Clinton presidential campaign.

Ratcliffe said he was doubtful that Horowitz’s report would be made available to the public or the Congress anytime soon.

“He did relay that as much as 20% of his report is going to include classified information, so that draft report will have to undergo a classification review at the FBI and at the Department of Justice,” Ratcliffe said. “So, while I’m hopeful that we members of Congress might see it before the August recess, I’m not too certain about that.”

Horowitz’s last high-profile probe, which looked into the handling of the Clinton email investigation by the DOJ and FBI, resulted in a 568-page tome released in June 2018.

Ratcliffe said Monday that he believed Horowitz’s findings will be significant and that the report likely presents a problem for Democrats.

“Right now we already know Bob Mueller — Bob Mueller has told us — that a Democratic administration started an investigation into a conspiracy with Russia that didn’t exist. That’s bad enough. It would be a whole lot worse if it turns out that that same Democratic administration continued that investigation by breaking rules at the FISA Court,” Ratcliffe said.

Ratcliffe said that if Horowitz concludes that the FISA process was indeed abused then “you can pretty much put a pin in any impeachment balloon, because it’d be hard for the Democrats to say that they started an investigation that they shouldn’t have, and that they continued it by breaking the rules, but they want to impeach a president for trying to obstruct that investigation that never should’ve started.”

Horowitz had reportedly been “homing in” on Steele for months, and sources close to Steele expressed his willingness to meet with Horowitz in June.

It's not just Republican members of Congress who have cast doubt on Steele's dossier. Watergate journalist Bob Woodward has been calling it “garbage” for more than two years, and former CIA Moscow station chief Daniel Hoffman told the Washington Examiner that “I called what bullshit the dossier was a year and a half ago … It’s likely FSB [the successor agency to the KGB] disinformation.”

A number of Steele’s biggest claims — including the allegation stemming from “Kremlin insiders” that former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen had met in Prague with Putin associates and foreign hackers — were knocked down by special counsel Robert Mueller's report.

Horowitz had reportedly been “homing in” on Steele for months, and sources close to Steele expressed his willingness to meet with Horowitz in June.

Other possible targets of the DOJ inspector general inquiry likely included the approvers and signers of the four FISA warrant applications and renewals from October 2016 through June 2017, including former FBI Director James Comey, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and the former Acting Attorney General and now current FBI General Counsel Dana Boente, the only signer of a Page FISA application who is still in office.

A federal lawsuit was recently filed by a conservative legal group to attempt to compel the Federal Elections Commission to rule on allegations that the Clinton campaign and the DNC broke campaign rules by allegedly hiding payments that were made to Fusion GPS."
These USDA employees face a stark choice: Move to Kansas City or be fired,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Joe Davidson', 'Columnist Focusing On Federal Government Issues']",07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/07/01/these-usda-employees-face-stark-choice-move-kansas-city-or-be-fired/,"

Columnist

The Agriculture Department is offering employees a rare choice: accept a forced transfer to a post 1,000 miles away or be fired.

The Trump administration’s plan to move two agencies from the District to the Kansas City area includes a document with two blank boxes on it, sent to employees on June 13. Check one, it instructs: Accept the transfer by July 15 or “be separated by adverse action procedures.”

That means getting fired, with an opportunity to appeal the dismissal through what could be an expensive process. Getting fired could also make it more difficult to find another federal job in an area where the government dominates.

Although a limited number of buyouts and early retirement opportunities will be available for what union officials expect to be fewer than 15 percent of those affected, and while some USDA employees might find work in government positions elsewhere in the D.C. area, the disruption to employees generally will be substantial.

“Adverse action” can have another meaning that goes beyond the affected employees and more broadly hits taxpayers, organizations and businesses. In addition to the big hassle for workers, relocations could have an adverse impact — a major brain drain — on the work of the two agencies, the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture.

Union officials estimate a strong majority of employees will decline reassignment. If that happens, the work of the small but important agencies could be seriously upset. Even before Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced the Kansas City region as the new location, but after officials said the agencies would be moving out of the District, department employees quit in droves, my colleague Ben Guarino reported last month.

“The current and projected attrition will curtail research data products that encompass commodity estimates, agricultural sector forecasts, food and farm economic and statistical indicators for U.S. agriculture, conservation, and food policy and markets,” said Kevin Hunt, a 10-year USDA employee, speaking as acting vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Local 3403 representing research service staff.

What the government calls “directed reassignments” to a different city are “very rare in the federal government. That's not something that is a common practice,” said Joanna Friedman, a federal employment lawyer with the Federal Practice Group. “This is unprecedented.”

When the Pentagon closed bases around the country starting in 2005, it forced many defense civilians to make a similar choice. “We lost a lot of talent in geographic moves,” said Jeffrey Neal, formerly the top personnel officer at the Defense Logistics Agency and the Department of Homeland Security. “A 20 percent take-up rate is typical.”

Not only are government transfers like the USDA’s uncommon, but the size makes this one especially unusual. Typically, they are much smaller, said Neal, now a senior vice president with the ICF consulting firm. “Years ago, people were more likely to move with their jobs,” he added. “With most people living in two-wage-earner households, it is far more difficult to just pack up and go.”

Many, perhaps most, affected USDA employees are considering a third option — quit and find new work.

“I will be unemployed beyond Sept. 30,” which is the deadline for the District-based workers to report to the new location, Hunt said, “unless I can find another job.”

Of the 547 employees the department wants to move for the two agencies combined, 253 are with the Economic Research Service, 77 percent of its 329-person workforce. An additional 294 are with the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, 93 percent of its 315-person staff. News of the move prompted a surge of support for the union. Employees at the National Institute voted 137-2 to join AFGE two weeks ago. Last month’s vote at the economic service was 138-4.

When Perdue announced the moves to the Kansas City area, he said, “We did not undertake these relocations lightly, and we are doing it to enhance long-term sustainability and success of these agencies. The considerable taxpayer savings will allow us to be more efficient and improve our ability to retain more employees in the long run.”

But the USDA estimate of nearly $300 million in savings over 15 years is way off, according to an analysis by the Milwaukee-based Agricultural and Applied Economics Association. Instead, it would cost taxpayers between $83 and $182 million, the analysis found. The USDA underestimated the true cost in part because it did not account for “the lost value of research from staffers who resign or retire rather than move,” the association reported.

A group of Democratic senators, including all four from Maryland and Virginia, has introduced legislation to keep the headquarters of the two agencies within the D.C. area.

Andrew Crane-Droesch, an economist with the research service, said he is not moving and is now looking for another job in the D.C. area. “Definitely the choice we face is move to Kansas City or lose our jobs,” he said. “I’m certainly not happy. I love my job, but I can’t move to Kansas City, and moreover, I don’t want to even if I could.”

Like Crane-Droesch, these staffers “have families, they are part of a community and they’ve been dedicated public servants,” said Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), chairman of the House Oversight and Reform subcommittee on government operations. “They deserve better than having such a radical and consequential do-or-die decision, which is hardly a fair choice, thrown at them at the last minute.”

House committee sues Trump admin for president's tax returns,https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-committee-sues-trump-admin-for-presidents-tax-returns,"Failing to obtain President Trump’s tax returns via request or subpoena, the Democrat-led House Ways and Means Committee is now suing for them.

In a lawsuit filed Tuesday, the committee claimed the Trump administration was violating federal law by refusing to comply with its demands. A statute allows the committee to request an individual’s tax return information, but Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin shot down the request.

“In refusing to comply with the statute, Defendants have mounted an extraordinary attack on the authority of Congress to obtain information needed to conduct oversight of Treasury, the IRS, and the tax laws on behalf of the American people who participate in the Nation’s voluntary tax system,” the lawsuit said.

DEM WANTS TRUMP OFFICIALS JAILED FOR NOT TURNING OVER TAX RETURNS

The White House fought back, with an administration source telling Fox News that “the Justice Department will litigate this, but yes it will be challenged.”

Deputy Press Secretary Steven Groves said: “While the crisis at our southern border worsens, Democrats continue to focus their efforts on Presidential harassment. Chairman [Richard] Neal’s willingness to use his powerful Committee to go after his political opponents is a danger to democracy. The Committee has no legitimate legislative purpose for which it can demand the President’s tax returns, and it is evident that they are only interested in partisan games. The only thing more political than the Committee’s crusade for the President’s tax returns is its sham lawsuit.”

The committee claimed the law gave it “unfettered access to tax return information,” but Mnuchin had claimed the panel lacked a legitimate legislative purpose, which the Supreme Court said was necessary to make such inquiries. The committee claimed the law did not permit the Treasury Department to refuse and did not require any such legislative purpose.

Mnuchin was named as a defendant in the case, as was IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, as well as the IRS and Treasury Department. The IRS and Treasury Department did not immediately respond to Fox News' requests for comment.

University of Iowa Law Professor Andy Grewal, who has written on the subject, said Tuesday he predicted the House committee may find early success in the lawsuit, but that the Supreme Court ultimately would rule that it did not have the power to bring the lawsuit.

“I would not be surprised if a district court orders the Treasury to turn over the returns,” Grewal tweeted. “But my prediction is that in this lawsuit or another, the Supreme Court says that the legislature lacks standing to sue the executive branch (ie, the case gets tossed out).”

In a separate comment to Fox News, Grewal warned of the precedent the lawsuit could set if it's successful.

""The committee has asserted an extraordinarily broad understanding of its own powers, saying that no one -- not the executive branch, not even the Supreme Court -- can question its motives,"" he said. ""Acceptance of that position would mean that Congress could issue subpoenas even when motivated by racism and bigotry. Courts may be hesitant to accept such a broad construction of the House's investigatory power.""

Despite claiming that it did not require any legislative purpose, the committee did claim it had one. The complaint alleged that the panel needed Trump’s tax return information because it was “investigating the IRS’s administration of various tax laws and policies relating to Presidential tax returns and tax law compliance by President Trump, including whether the IRS’s self-imposed policy of annually auditing the returns of sitting Presidents is working properly[.]”

Trump has said in the past that the reason he did not release his tax returns during the 2016 campaign, per tradition, was because he was under audit. The lawsuit cited a similar comment by Trump in April 2019, where he said he would not give Congress his tax returns while under audit.

The lawsuit also claimed the committee urgently needed the president's tax return information because of the consideration of tax legislation that ""would govern the next Presidential election,"" including bills that would require candidates in 2020 to disclose their tax returns.

TRUMP TAX RETURN STRATEGY COULD BACKFIRE, RECENT COURT DECISIONS INDICATE

Committee member Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., D-N.J., claimed that the lawsuit was a necessary measure due to the administration’s refusal to comply.

“Litigation is always a last resort. We are here today because Donald Trump and his enablers have sneered at our laws and avoided the thinnest accountability for their corruption. The Ways and Means Committee must file this action to stand for rule of law,” he said in a statement. “Despite Republicans’ efforts to cover-up, Americans cry out for oversight and voted in a new House to enforce that demand in November.”

Republicans on the committee, meanwhile, have been looking to take their own action. Top GOP member Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, said after the lawsuit was filed that he was introducing a resolution against it.

“The Democrats’ partisan, flawed lawsuit continues their unprecedented and illegitimate pursuit to expose President Trump’s private tax information,” Brady said in a statement. “This is a dangerous course of action. For this reason, I am introducing a resolution to preserve the integrity of the People’s House from the attacks of the elite few and restore the voice of every American.”

Dems step up oversight amid detention center firestorm,https://www.politico.com,['Sarah Ferris'],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/02/democrats-summon-dhs-leaders-1395859,"The House Oversight Committee, chaired by Rep. Elijah Cummings, is demanding acting DHS head Kevin McAleenan to appear before the panel. | Alex Wong/Getty Images congress Dems step up oversight amid detention center firestorm Elijah Cummings is summoning top DHS leaders to testify, including the acting head of DHS.

Top House Democrats are escalating their response to Donald Trump’s handling of the migrant crisis at the border, making a direct plea to the president to improve conditions and ramping up their oversight of agencies at the center of a growing political firestorm.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi wrote to Trump this week urging his administration to guarantee certain standards — like water, hygiene and sanitation — for detained migrants, just days after losing a legislative battle with Senate Republicans over those same protections. The letter comes after a 14-minute call with the president on Friday, according to an aide.

Story Continued Below

Pelosi also sent a ""Dear Colleague"" letter on Tuesday to mobilize her caucus on the issue of border detention facilities, writing, ""Every day that goes by, we have even greater cause for concern and urgency to enact the protections for children and families.""

And on Tuesday, a key House committee summoned a pair of top officials from the Department of Homeland Security to testify on Capitol Hill amid a slew of political crises, including new photos of ""dangerous overcrowding"" in U.S. facilities and a secret Facebook group in which some agents mocked dead migrants.

The House Oversight Committee is demanding to hear from the acting head of DHS, Kevin McAleenan, who has been at the forefront of the White House’s response to the recent surge of migrants at the border.

McAleenan's handling of the border crisis drew further criticism on Tuesday, after a damning inspector general’s report found “dangerous overcrowding” and “prolonged detention of children” in a facility in Texas.

Democrats also summoned Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, which has been consumed this week with another scandal — a Facebook group with thousands of current and former agents posting racist and sexist images of Democratic lawmakers and making fun of a recent photo of a father and daughter who were found drowned in the Rio Grande.

Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings said on Tuesday that he plans to investigate the matter, and sent a letter to Facebook officials requesting all posts and comments — as well as deleted content — from the 3-year-old Facebook group.

Democrats first issued invitations to McAleenan and Morgan last week, according to the committee. But it’s not clear that either will respond willingly, as neither has confirmed attendance.

The committee has given both officials until Wednesday to respond to its request for testimony. Though Cummings has not threatened to subpoena them if they refuse to confirm their attendance, he has shown that he's willing to attempt to compel testimony if witnesses snub his panel. Last week, Cummings subpoenaed Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway for refusing to appear at a hearing about her alleged violations of the Hatch Act.

Democrats announced the hearing, which is scheduled for July 12, at the same time they released a damning inspector general’s report that found “dangerous overcrowding” and “prolonged detention of children.”

Among the findings is a disturbing photo that shows mothers and young children packed into tight rooms in a Rio Grande Valley detention center, where they appeared to sleep on concrete floors.

Cummings described the Trump administration's response at the border as “open contempt for the rule of law and for basic human decency.”

“The Trump Administration’s actions at the southern border are grotesque and dehumanizing,” the Maryland Democrat wrote in a release announcing the hearing. “The Committee needs to hear directly from the heads of these agencies as soon as possible in light of the almost daily reports of abuse and defiance.”

The Congressional Hispanic Caucus reacted with fury to the inspector generals’ findings on Tuesday, describing the 16-page report as full of “egregious violations” of human rights, such as denying migrants’ access to showers and hot meals.

The report also found that 165 children had been in custody of the border patrol agency longer than a week — far above the 72-hour court mandated limit.

House Democratic leaders have sought an aggressive response to the border crisis, seeking new conditions to strengthen oversight of the Trump administration.

But an emergency aid package signed into law this week largely ignored those requests, which were demanded by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and progressive leaders. Instead, the White House agreed to certain administrative changes that would, for example, require officials to notify Congress when a child has died in custody.

USDA’s June World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates recognized the challenges faced in the 2019 crop year and adjusted corn planted acreage down to 89.8 million acres, a reduction of 3 million acres from the department’s March estimate, and also reduced the crop yield from 176 bushels per acre to 166 bushels per acre.

USDA reversed course in its annual survey-based June Acreage Report. For the 2019/20 crop year, USDA indicated corn planted area at 91.7 million acres, up 3% or 2.6 million acres from prior-year levels, and down only slightly from March intentions of 92 million acres planted. Importantly, USDA’s June corn acreage estimate was up from the June WASDE projection and well above the average pre-report estimate of 86.6 million acres. Figures 1 and 2 highlight USDA’s corn acres planted or intended to be planted and the year-over-year change from 2018.

Following continued declines in new-crop soybean prices – due to substantially lower Chinese demand – USDA revealed soybean acres planted at 80 million acres, down 9.2 million acres, or 10%, from 2018 and down 4.6 million acres from March intentions. Soybean plantings in 2019 are expected to be the lowest since 2013, and plantings are expected to be lower in all 29 soybean-producing states. Figures 3 and 4 highlight USDA’s soybean acres planted or intended to be planted and the year-over-year change from 2018.

USDA Will Reinterview

It is an understatement to say USDA’s report surprised the corn market. New-crop corn futures fell by more than 19 cents and represented a $2.6 billion-reduction in the value of new-crop corn (based on WASDE production estimates). USDA acknowledged as much, indicating that 83% of the intended corn acreage had been planted at the time of the survey – well below the 10-year average.

In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the crop size and planted area, USDA announced that it will resurvey farmers in advance of the August 12 Crop Production report. Farmers in 14 states will be reinterviewed to determine their planted area of corn, soybeans and sorghum. Figure 5 identifies the states subject to acreage resurveys.

State Farm Bureau Perspective

To provide some additional perspective on corn and soybean acres planted, remaining to be planted or prevented from being planted, state Farm Bureaus in the reinterview region were contacted to get their ground-level perspective. Their responses follow.

Illinois – Corn Acres Unchanged and Soybean Acres Down 5%

A central Illinois farmer reported to me over this past weekend, that he had one field he originally planned to plant to corn, then was prevented-planting of corn on that field, and now he has just finished planting soybeans on that field. [Market Intel note: The planting of soybeans may have been motivated by the planting requirement associated with the Market Facilitation Program.]

Indiana – Corn Acres Up 3% and Soybean Acres Down 11%

Farmers in Indiana have given up on the hope of getting any more corn planted and did so several weeks ago. Prevent planted acres are all around the state, particularly in central and southern Indiana, where farmers have experienced rainfall far above normal. Corn can be seen in the state just popping out of the ground to knee high. Anticipated yields at this time will be far less than the 10-year average for farmers.

Kansas – Corn Acres Up 8% and Soybean Acres Down 1%

While a majority of intended Kansas corn acres have been planted, many of those acres went in during and after the USDA Risk Management Agency’s late planting period. In a few counties, up to 25% of the crop was either prevented from being planted or the planted corn is now under water.

The bulk of intended soybeans in Kansas are in or going in but a significant portion is later than intended; an early frost could be devastating.

Kansas grain sorghum planting is wrapping up, and it is suspected that at least in some areas of the state, forage crops may be substituted for intended grain sorghum acreage.

The Kansas cotton crop went in extremely late and estimates are that only about 50% to 60% of intended acres got planted this spring.

All crops are behind and will require near optimal temperatures and measured amounts of precipitation throughout the growing season. Again, an earlier than normal frost could be devastating.

Michigan – Corn Acres Unchanged and Soybean Acres Down 9%

There were a lot of acres planted over the weekend in central Michigan, but anything planted to corn recently will go to silage, not grain. The large dairy presence and need for forage in this area has caused a lot of farmers to keep planting corn with no intention of harvesting it for grain. Based on some informal surveys done a few weeks ago, I would estimate that around 65% of originally intended acres were planted to corn for grain.

Soybean progress is harder to estimate because there were still soybeans being planted over the weekend. It varies quite a bit across the state but the southeast and central [parts of the state] are probably the hardest-hit areas. Our media staff is creating a member survey that will go out tomorrow to help give us a better idea of actual acreage.

I think one thing that would help make USDA’s resurvey more accurate is if they give clear direction on how farmers should report prevent plant acreage, especially prevent plant land that gets planted to corn as a cover crop for silage.

Missouri – Corn Acres Down 3% and Soybean Acres Down 9%

Extreme flooding along the Mississippi, Missouri and internal state tributaries has wreaked havoc with corn planting in Missouri. Some land is still either covered or partially covered with water and will not be planted. April and the first half of May corn plantings were detrimentally impacted by frequent heavy rains causing thousands of acres to be replanted and/or forcing many farmers to leave undesirable stands due to the lateness of the season. Corn planted the last 10 days of May and into the first three weeks of June had better stands. 25-30% of the corn is normal, 50% is intermediate with very uneven stands and 20-25% is replant.

Ohio – Corn Acres Down 6% and Soybean Acres Down 6%

It is tough to nail down how accurate the latest USDA planting report is. Some of our economists don't believe it is super far off, but if we ask our farmers they claim much less has been planted. They are not thrilled to see the price slide with this latest report.

I was in Ottawa County in northwest Ohio yesterday and their Soil and Water in the county estimates that only 4% of the corn was planted and 30% of their beans. I would say that is definitely worse than most, but many of the surrounding counties experienced very serious planting issues as well. During my drive through northwest Ohio yesterday I saw a lot of weeds and barren fields.

If Ohio does not have a record for prevented plant acreage I will be surprised. And for crops that are planted, they are weeks behind, struggling to come up or already in need of replant. And how much can be replanted at this point? Probably not much.

South Dakota – Corn Acres Down 9% and Soybean Acres Down 22%

It looks like South Dakota will set the record for prevented planting acres by far. As always, there are differences around the state, but it sounds to me that on average the state will only be around 60% planted. On our farm, we were right at 50%. Some areas of the northeast part of the state are 80% to 90% percent planted. Down by Mitchell and Chamberlain areas, and between Pierre and Huron, some producers couldn't plant anything at all. There are some areas where you can drive several miles and not see a planted field.

Summary

USDA currently projects corn acres at 91.7 million acres, up 3% from prior-year levels, and soybean acres at 80 million acres, down 10% from 2018. However, given the historical delays in planting at the time of USDA’s acreage survey, USDA announced intentions to resurvey farmers in advance of the August Crop Production report. Feedback from state Farm Bureaus confirms the need to resurvey crop acreage, points to potential yield issues due to unfavorable growing conditions and supports a more substantial reduction in corn acres planted."
Whistleblower: Mike Pompeo Treats Security Detail Like “UberEats With Guns”,https://www.vanityfair.com,"['Condé Nast', 'Bess Levin', 'Tina Nguyen', 'Vanity Fair', 'Eric Lutz', 'Bess Levi', 'Alison Durkee']",,,,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/07/mike-pompeo-whistleblower,"If there’s one thing that unites Trump administration officials, it’s their well-documented belief that abusing government resources is a right, and that the purpose of their time in office is to enrich themselves as much as possible. That means a treasury secretary who sees no issue with using a government plane to get a better shot of the solar eclipse; a HUD secretary who dropped $31,000 on a new dining set for his office; a transportation secretary who promotes the family business that has paid her millions; a former VA chief who thought it was totally fine to take his wife on a taxpayer-funded European vacation; a former Health and Human Services secretary who spent $400,000 on private jets; and a former EPA administrator whose deluge of grift included directing his staff to “find reasons for [him] to travel to Oklahoma, so [he] could be in his home state for long weekends at taxpayers’ expense.” Oh, and a current secretary of state who allegedly views his security detail as his own personal concierge.

CNN reports that Democrats “on a key House congressional committee” are investigating claims from a State Department whistleblower who’s raised “multiple issues” over several months about Mike Pompeo and his family’s use of taxpayer-funded Diplomatic Security. Those issues allegedly include:

Tasking an agent with picking up Chinese food (without Pompeo in the car), leading to internal complaints by staff whose job it is to protect the secretary that they are effectively “UberEats with guns.”

Assigning a special agent to pick up the Pompeo family dog from the groomer.

Telling an agent to pick up Pomepo’s adult son from Union Station in D.C. and drop him off at home.

Lon Fairchild, the special agent in charge of the Diplomatic Security Service, did not deny that any of the personal errands—which former government ethics official Walter Shaub called “the very definition of misuse of position”—were carried about by his staff, but said in a statement, “I was head of Secretary Pompeo’s security detail since his first day on the job. At no point during my service did he or any member of his family ask me or any member of my team to act in any way that would be inconsistent with our professional obligation to protect the Secretary 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.” (A former senior official in the DSS told CNN the tasks would be inappropriate unless “some specific threat was identified that necessitated those trips.” Former secretary of state Warren Christopher had apparently wanted his agents to pick up groceries for him but was told that wasn’t their job, which one would think was obvious.)

In addition to the issue of Pompeo allegedly viewing protective agents as personal assistants, and a culture within Diplomatic Security “to try and please the secretary and avoid upsetting him,” there are reportedly also questions among agents as to why Pompeo’s wife, Susan, was assigned her own personal detail beginning in 2018, including when she is home in the United States:"

A PERSIAN GULF MYSTERY -- “To Evade Sanctions on Iran, Ships Vanish in Plain Sight,” by NYT’s Michael Forsythe and Ronen Bergman: “A week ago, a small tanker ship approached the Persian Gulf after a 19-day voyage from China. The captain, as required by international rules, reported the ship’s position, course, speed and another key detail: It was riding high in the water, meaning it was probably empty. Then the Chinese-owned ship, the Sino Energy 1, went silent and essentially vanished from the grid.

“It reported in again on Sunday, near the spot where it had vanished six days earlier, only now it was heading east, away from the Strait of Hormuz near Iran. If past patterns hold, the captain will soon report that it is riding low in the water, meaning its tanks are likely full. As the Trump administration’s sanctions on Iranian oil and petrochemical products have taken hold, some of the world’s shipping fleets have defied the restrictions by ‘going dark’ when they pick up cargo in Iranian ports, according to commercial analysts who track shipping data and intelligence from authorities in Israel, a country that backs the Trump crackdown.” NYT

U.S. states sue EPA for stricter asbestos rules,https://www.reuters.com,"['Jonathan Stempel', 'Min Read']",07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-asbestos-lawsuit/us-states-sue-epa-for-stricter-asbestos-rules-idUSKCN1TW3N6,"(Reuters) - Ten U.S. states and Washington, D.C. sued the Environmental Protection Agency to begin working on rules to tighten oversight of asbestos, and reduce the health risks that the substance poses to the public.

FILE PHOTO: A ""Danger Asbestos"" sign is seen as a demolition crew removes the remains of a demolished home, next to an occupied one, in a neighborhood filled with blight in Detroit, Michigan, November 24, 2015. REUTERS/Rebecca Cook/File Photo

The attorneys general from California and Massachusetts, Xavier Becerra and Maura Healey, said on Monday they are leading the case, after the EPA denied the states’ petition that it collect more data on asbestos.

A spokesman for the EPA and its administrator, Andrew Wheeler, said the agency does not discuss pending litigation.

Asbestos is a carcinogen once used widely in fireproofing and insulation. Many companies stopped using it by the mid-1970s after it was linked to mesothelioma and other types of cancer.

Federal law still allows limited uses of asbestos, and Congress in 2016 amended the federal Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to create a process for regulating the substance. Symptoms from asbestos exposure can take decades to surface.

“Asbestos is a known carcinogen that kills tens of thousands of people every year, yet the Trump administration is choosing to ignore the very serious health risks it poses,” Healey, a Democrat, said in a statement.

“There’s too much at stake to let the EPA ignore the danger that deadly asbestos poses to our communities, including to workers and children,” added Becerra, also a Democrat.

Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon and Washington state joined the lawsuit.

The EPA has said protecting people from asbestos exposure is a priority, including through an April rule giving it power to review asbestos products that were no longer on the market before they could be sold again in the United States.

In denying the states’ petition, the EPA determined that it was already aware of all current uses of asbestos, and had the essential information needed to assess the risks, according to the Federal Register.

But the states believe this denial was arbitrary and capricious, and violated the EPA’s obligations under the TSCA.

The lawsuit was filed late on Friday in the federal court in Oakland, California.

It is one of many lawsuits by Democratic-controlled or Democratic-leaning states challenging policies by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican, including the rolling back of some environmental protections.

The case is California et al v Environmental Protection Agency et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 19-03807."
Ted Cruz & Migrant Donations -- Senator Asks DHS to Create Process for Collecting Donations,https://www.nationalreview.com,"['Mairead Mcardle', 'Kevin D. Williamson', 'Jim Geraghty', 'David French', 'Douglas Murray', 'John Hirschauer', 'George Will', 'Jay Cost', 'John Mccormack', 'Read More']",07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/cruz-asks-dhs-to-create-process-for-collecting-donations-to-migrants-in-u-s-custody/,"Texas Senator Ted Cruz speaks in Houston, Texas, November 3, 2018. (Mike Segar/Reuters)

Senator Ted Cruz on Monday sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security asking for the creation of a process that would allow DHS to accept donations meant for migrants in U.S. custody.

Currently, no such process for collecting a distributing privately donated aid exists, which has caused generous citizens who have offered supplies to overcrowded migrant-detention facilities to be turned away.

Curz called on Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan to “establish and publicize a process for accepting donations from charitable organizations, faith-based organizations, and NGOs to aid individuals in CBP custody.”

DHS facilities are at “peak or beyond peak capacity,” Cruz said, because of the “crisis on our southern border.” Even with the $4.6 billion in emergency humanitarian aid approved by Congress to address the influx of migrants at the border, the Department can surely accept the “generosity of the American people” as well, he said.

A Texas state lawmaker first drew attention to the donation issue when he revealed that he’d tried to donate items to a Texas detention facility and was told by a Border Patrol representative, “We don’t accept donations.”

“It just befuddles me and I think it’s just heartbreaking to know that there’s so many people that want to help, and that help is being denied for no definable reasons that anybody’s been able to communicate,” Democratic state representative Terry Canales said."
Trump Says Conditions Are 'Disgraceful' in Major U.S. Cities,https://www.usnews.com,[],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2019-07-02/president-trump-says-conditions-are-disgraceful-in-major-us-cities,"President Donald Trump said Monday that U.S. cities struggling with challenges on the streets are ""usually sanctuary cities run by very liberal people."". The Associated Press

President Donald Trump said federal intervention might be needed to clean up the streets in major U.C. cities and appeared to boast about reducing homelessness in Washington during an interview with Fox News on Monday.

In an interview taped in Japan with host Tucker Carlson, the U.S. president addressed foreign policy and the power of big tech companies before the conversation turned toward the conditions in major U.S. cities.

After Carlson said that Osaka and Tokyo – two cities Trump visited during his trip to Japan for the G-20 meeting – were clean and didn't have graffiti or ""junkies,"" Trump agreed that U.S. cities such as New York and Los Angeles had major issues with what Carlson called ""filth.""

""It's a phenomena that started two years ago. It's disgraceful,"" Trump said.

""You can't have what's happening – where police officers are getting sick just by walking the beat,"" Trump continued. ""I mean, they're getting actually very sick.""

Although Trump didn't explicitly use the phrase ""homelessness"" during the interview, he appeared to blame the homeless population for playing a role in ruining cities and implied that many of them choose to be homeless out of personal preference.

""Some of them have mental problems where they don't even know they're living that way,"" Trump said. ""In fact, perhaps they like living that way. They can't do that. We cannot ruin our cities.""

He also suggested the federal government might get involved in decreasing the homeless population in major cities – though he didn't specify how. ""We're looking at it very seriously,"" he said. ""We may intercede. We may do something to get that whole thing cleaned up. It's inappropriate.""

Trump also boasted about cleaning up the streets of Washington after he became president.

""You know, I had a situation when I first became president,"" Trump said. ""We had certain areas of Washington, D.C., where that was starting to happen, and I ended it very quickly. I said, 'You can't do that.'""

Homelessness in the capital region has indeed decreased since Trump took office – dropping from 8,350 in 2016 to 6,904 in 2018, according to the National Alliance to End Homelessness . But advocates for the homeless in Washington seem baffled by the president's comments, crediting the drop in homelessness to initiatives such as permanent housing and substance abuse treatment.

""I don't have a clue to what he's referencing,"" Michael L. Ferrell, the executive director of the service nonprofit D.C. Coalition for the Homeless, told The Washington Post . ""Those resources definitely predate the Trump administration.""

Trump said most U.S. cities are doing ""great,"" while adding that those struggling with challenges on the streets are ""usually sanctuary cities run by very liberal people."" He also appeared to suggest the U.S is going through an alarming increase in homelessness.

""We've never had this in our lives before in our country,"" he said.

Data from the National Alliance to End Homelessness, however, suggests otherwise.

Although homelessness did increase slightly by 0.3% between 2017 and 2018, it's been on a general downward trend for the past decade, according to the National Alliance ."
House Democrats sue Treasury for Trump’s tax returns,https://nypost.com,['July'],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://nypost.com/2019/07/02/house-democrats-sue-treasury-for-trumps-tax-returns/,"WASHINGTON — House Democrats have upped the ante in their quest to see President Trump’s tax returns.

On Tuesday, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) sued the Treasury Department in order to force the Internal Revenue Service to hand over the president’s returns.

Trump has never publicly released any of his tax returns, a break from presidential candidate tradition. He initially said during the 2016 campaign cycle that he would not be releasing them because he was under audit.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin — one of the president’s longest-serving cabinet members — has denied multiple requests from Democrats to turn over the returns since the party took back the House in January.

He ignored a subpoena from Neal’s committee for six years of returns in May. He argued that the request lacked a “legitimate legislative purpose.”

In June, the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel issued a 33-page opinion backing Mnuchin, arguing that because Neal wanted to make the president’s tax returns public, the request lacked a legitimate legislative function.

The Democrats filed the lawsuit in the US District Court for the District of Columbia. It names the Treasury Department, the IRS, Mnuchin and Charles Rettig, commissioner of the IRS, as defendants.

White House Deputy Press Secretary Steven Groves labeled the filing a “sham lawsuit.”

“While the crisis at our southern border worsens, Democrats continue to focus their efforts on presidential harassment,” Groves told The Post via email.

“They are only interested in partisan games. The only thing more political than the committee’s crusade for the president’s tax returns is its sham lawsuit.”"
Vintage EPA photos reveal what US waterways looked like before pollution was regulated,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Aylin Woodward'],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.businessinsider.com/vintage-epa-photos-reveal-us-waterways-before-pollution-was-regulated-2019-6,"Just over 50 years ago, Ohio's Cuyahoga river caught fire.

The disaster prompted a public outcry that in part led to the formation of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1970. The EPA was charged with regulating the country's polluted air and waterways, among other environmental objectives.

Soon after its founding, the agency dispatched 100 photographers to capture the US' environmental issues as part of a photo project called Documerica. The photographers took about 81,000 images, more than 20,000 of which were archived. At least 15,000 have been digitized by the National Archives, and the images now function as a kind of time capsule, revealing what states from California to New York looked like between 1971 and 1977.

Many of the photos were taken before the implementation of rules meant to keep water and air free of contamination.

The images of polluted waterways are especially striking. The following Documerica photos reveal what US rivers, streams, and coastlines looked like before the EPA started regulating pollution."
Cruz asks DHS secretary to develop process to accept donations for detained migrants,https://thehill.com,[],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/451348-cruz-asks-dhs-secretary-to-develop-process-to-accept-donations-for-detained,"Sen.

His letter to acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan comes amid increased scrutiny of the treatment of migrants in U.S. custody. News reports this month have detailed poor conditions at detention facilities, and prompted a lawmaker visit to some centers this week.

Cruz asked the agency to establish and publicize a process of accepting donations from charities, faith-based organizations, and nongovernmental organizations ""to aid individuals in CBP [Customs and Border Protection] custody.""

Cruz noted in his letter that DHS facilities are “at peak or beyond peak capacity,” and praised Congress for approving $4.6 billion in emergency humanitarian aid for the border.

""Many Americans, however, also want to provide more direct and tangible help—they want to donate basic items such as diapers and toothbrushes to children in CBP custody,"" he wrote. ""Organizations are currently having difficulties making donations because DHS and CBP currently lack procedures to accept their donations.""

Attorneys who visited migrant children being held at a facility in Clint, Texas, told The Associated Press last month that children were going weeks without bathing and that they were fed only meals that included uncooked frozen food or rice."
"VA, Verizon to offer new telehealth access for veterans",https://www.healthcareitnews.com,[],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/va-verizon-offer-new-telehealth-access-veterans,"The Department of Veterans Affairs and Verizon are teaming up to offer veterans who are customers of the telecommunications giant unlimited access to department's VA Video Connect telehealth app.

WHY IT MATTERS

The platform connects veterans with their health care team using encryption to ensure a secure and private session, and users can then participate in video appointments or engage with health professionals using the built-in chat feature.

The partnership gives vets access across Verizon's nationwide 4G LTE network without incurring data charges. They can visit the VA Video Connect test site on their mobile device to test whether their device is compatible with the platform.

Customers using devices running Apple's iOS software can download the app via Apple's App Store, and for all other users, a telehealth session launches automatically after a user selects an emailed session.

The app is just one of several available from the VA, including an online scheduling application and an ""Ask a Pharmacist"" app, along with a variety of apps targeting mental health and wellness.

THE LARGER TREND

Telehealth is set for a major expansion in the U.S. This past month the Federal Communications Commission announced the agency would vote to advance a $100 million Connected Care Pilot Program, enabling telehealth expansion for low-income Americans nationwide, including veterans and others in medically underserved areas.

The partnership with Verizon comes as the VA navigates a complex digital transformation, including the $16 billion implementation of the Cerner electronic health records system, which is slated to go live across care sites by 2028.

However, the lack of interoperability between the Department of Defense and VA remains a major stumbling block, which the two entities hope will be smoothed through the creation of a special office, the Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization office, to help centralize decision-making.

Further complicating matters was the first House VA Subcommittee on Technology Modernization hearing, held in September 2018, which revealed that officials and congressional members are not on the same page when it comes to governance and EHR interoperability.

ON THE RECORD

""VA's telehealth app for streaming live video sessions between patients and health care providers is another testament to our shared journey to fully integrated, seamless access to health care for our Veterans, no matter where they live,"" VA Secretary Robert Wilkie said in a statement.

""Regardless of whether they live in city centers or rural areas, Veterans should be able to access the VA's telehealth resources,"" added Mike Maiorana, senior vice president of public sector for Verizon.

“What to Expect At This Year’s Annual Fourth of July Celebration,” the article was titled.

Trump’s tweet gained more than 6,000 likes and 2,000 retweets in less than 20 minutes.

The link to the press release was broken for about 30 minutes. It has since been fixed.

Trump has been hyping up his first-ever “Salute to America” event on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. — an event that will feature U.S. Army Abrams Tanks and shutdown the airspace around Washington during and after Trump’s speech.

They have had a lot of success at recent job fairs, with getting lots of applicants, but Burton says they still have lots of openings.

“We have a lot of support staff, and a lot of positions that will be available in every department. Our IT is still doing a lot of interviewing and a lot of hiring, so pretty much opportunities in all areas.” USDA/APHIS NBAF Coordinator, Dr. Ken Burton says.

DOJ pushes Congress to permanently close loophole for knock-off fentanyl,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Clare Hymes'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/doj-pushes-congress-to-permanently-close-loophole-for-knock-off-fentanyl/,"The Department of Justice is calling on Congress to enact into law a temporary order from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) classifying fentanyl-like drugs as controlled substances. The 2018 order, which closed a legal loophole in U.S. drug laws that make Americans vulnerable to what are essentially knock-off versions of the opioid, was imposed on an emergency basis for two years and is set to expire in February 2020.

The drugs were previously able to dodge federal law due to their chemical makeup, which has slight modifications from the fentanyl compound. Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, is about 100 times stronger than morphine, and its analogues can be even more potent.

""From a policy and regulatory perspective, fentanyl-like substances need to be permanently scheduled as a class,"" said Katie Crytzer, the acting deputy assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Policy at the Department of Justice. At a briefing with reporters Monday, she called the classification an ""urgent and necessary first step.""

John Martin, assistant administrator at the DEA, cited statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing more than 70,000 people died from drug overdoses in 2017. Nearly 48,000 of those deaths were caused by opioids, with approximately 29,000 stemming from use of fentanyl or fentanyl-like substances, Martin said.

If the government's current order expires without a plan in place to set permanent controls, Crytzer said, ""the department, its prosecutors and law enforcement would enter relatively unknown territory."" Crytzer said a lapse could have a serious impact on any ongoing or impending prosecutions.

According to the Executive Office for United States Attorneys, there were 863 federal defendants in fiscal year 2018 whose principal charge was related to fentanyl. However, the office only began including fentanyl analogues in their tracking as of October 2018.

The illicit substances are engineered to skirt and exploit gaps in U.S. drug laws, and largely enter the U.S. from foreign sources like Chinese criminal organizations, Mexican cartels and other traffickers. Officials say the analogues coming in from China are more potent, but traffickers from Mexico bring larger quantities of the drugs into the country.

""I can personally tell you how savvy these drug traffickers are,"" said Amanda Liskamm, director of opioid enforcement and prevention efforts in the deputy attorney general's office. ""When there is a gap in U.S. law they take full advantage of it, which results in more drugs and more deaths.""

Officials say the 2018 order has led to a ""significant decrease"" of fentanyl-like substances on the streets, and law enforcement is hoping that a more permanent continuation of the blanket classification will keep it that way. They noted that since the temporary emergency order has been in effect, law enforcement has only encountered three new fentanyl-related substances. Before the order, there were new analogues being discovered on a monthly basis.

Although Congress has been vocal on working to curb the opioid epidemic, they have yet to mark up the Stopping Overdoses of Fentanyl Analogues Act, or SOFA Act, which would permanently close this particular gap. Some hesitancy stems from concerns about how blanket scheduling could affect researchers, but Martin said that DOJ and DEA are working on an intergovernmental solution that benefits the researchers.

""They have some concerns but from where I'm standing, or sitting, I think we're trying to eliminate I guess the perception out there in the research community that it's going to be a hindrance for them to conduct research,"" Martin said. ""We absolutely don't want that perception to be there."""
EPA challenges Flint over staffing at water treatment plant,https://www.mlive.com,['Ron Fonger'],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.mlive.com/news/flint/2019/07/epa-challenges-flint-over-staffing-at-water-treatment-plant.html,"FLINT, MI -- More than three years after the city’s water crisis was recognized as a national emergency, Flint still doesn’t appear to have hired enough employees to insure its water treatment plant is properly operated, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says.

But a city spokeswoman says it’s the federal agency that “simply has its facts wrong.”

In a June 26 letter to Mayor Karen Weaver and the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, the EPA asks “what the city will do to demonstrate that the Flint (plant) has the necessary, capable and qualified personnel on board so that the (Dort Highway plant) is properly operated at all times.”

Reports from treatment plant operators to the state have shown an operator trainee quit, causing inadequate staffing; that employees have been scheduled to work up to 80 hours per week; and that workers are fatigued “due to low staffing and long work weeks.”

Defiant mayor will fight 'unwarranted' oversight of Flint water system ""This man-made crisis occurred because the state, over the stringent objections of the city and its people, imposed its misguided policies on the people of the city of Flint,"" Weaver's letter says. ""The city is committed to remediating and recovering from this crisis ... However, this proposed (order) does nothing to substantively further the city's recovery and instead appears to be retaliatory and punitive.""

City spokeswoman Candice Mushatt said administrative changes at EPA during the past several months have led to erroneous information in the letter.

“These concerns were addressed and discussed originally with EGLE ...,” Mushatt said in an email to MLive-The Flint Journal. “As a result and through our regular voluntary agreement tracking meetings with EGLE and reporting this information to the EPA during monthly calls, we were able to address those concerns.”

“The resolution through the city’s (Department of Public Works) director, was to implement a four-foreman schedule, which will limit overtime to one shift,” she said. “A new operator foreman was trained and a day shift operator was also assigned as foreman.”

In a Monday, July 1, posting on its web site, EGLE said a resolution to accept funding and pay for the continued training of plant operators was also headed to the Flint City Council at its next meeting, that operator trainees who passed written exams last month must next take physical exams, and that all foremen who took a certification exam on May 30 passed.

Flint to keep contractor at water plant after city staff fail operator exams ""The city intends to begin a new recruitment process to hire an internal, permanent (operator in charge),"" Weaver wrote in a June 11 letter to Eric Oswald, director of DEQ's Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance Division.

Flint’s staffing at the treatment plant has been a federal concern since the EPA issued an order in January 2016, spelling out required actions for the city water system.

In her June 26 letter to Weaver, Cheryl Newton, EPA’s deputy regional administrator, said Flint has worked to try to resolve its staffing issues but appeared reluctant to hire additional staff “for fear of having to lay them off when the (water system) becomes more automated.”

“However, the city has yet to demonstrate that this requirement has been met on a continuous basis,” Newton’s letter says of staffing issues. “While the city continues its efforts to hire and train staff, the ability to provide adequate coverage on an ongoing basis is an EPA concern.”

In 2017, EPA also raised what it called “continued and significant concerns” that too few people were working in the water system and asked the city for a plan “to ensure ... the necessary, capable and qualified personnel” are hired.

Mushatt said the city expects to respond to the Newton letter this week."
Cruz: Overwhelmed DHS must start accepting private donations,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/cruz-overwhelmed-dhs-must-start-accepting-private-donations,"A Republican senator from a southern border state has urged the Department of Homeland Security to start accepting private donations, hoping the money will improve holding conditions and give Customs and Border Protection facilities on the U.S.-Mexico border additional needed help.



Senator Ted Cruz sent acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan a letter Tuesday urging him to create a process for the federal entity to accept money and supplies from faith-based groups, non-governmental organizations, and charities.

""Even with the additional supplemental emergency funding, I am confident that DHS and CBP can still use the generosity of the American people to help manage the humanitarian crisis on our border,"" Cruz wrote in the letter.

Cruz said he made the request because he had heard of individuals who wanted to help improve conditions inside the overcrowded facilities at ports of entry, but Border Patrol stations lacked a way to do so.

""This desire is laudable,"" Cruz wrote. ""But I understand that many of these organizations are currently having difficulties making donations because DHS and CBP currently lack procedures to accept their donations.""

The second-term senator did not make a recommendation for how DHS should go about making the operational change.

McAleenan is meeting with government officials in Honduras and El Salvador the first half of this week to discuss root causes and solutions to ""irregular migration"" from the northern region of Central America. DHS has not indicated if it will consider Cruz's request.

More than 600,000 people have been taken into custody by Customs and Border Protection personnel at and between ports of entry in the first eight months of fiscal 2019, which is more than the previous 12 months. More than half of that group are families.

CBP has said its facilities were designed for single adults to be held for up to 72 hours before being transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement for deportation.

Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement is responsible for taking unaccompanied children from CBP but has not had the space to do so, leading to overcrowded facilities with inefficient care for those temporarily living there."

Fresh Trouble: DOJ Subpoenas Boeing about Dreamliner Safety,https://marketrealist.com,['Anirudha Bhagat'],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://marketrealist.com/2019/07/fresh-trouble-doj-subpoenas-boeing-about-dreamliner-safety/,"Subpoenaed over Dreamliner safety

The Boeing Company (BA) has encountered yet another problem—this time with its twin-aisle 787 Dreamliner planes. The US Department of Justice has reportedly subpoenaed the airplane maker regarding an ongoing investigation about 787 Dreamliner safety issues.

According to the Seattle Times, the Department of Justice is seeking records relating to 787 Dreamliner productions at Boeing’s South Carolina plant. The Federal Aviation Administration has been investigating two battery overheating incidents from 2013, following which Dreamliner planes remained grounded for several months.

The Department of Justice is investigating the allegations of the New York Times, which raised questions about the production process at Boeing’s South Carolina plant. In April, the Times made allegations about “shoddy work” and “flawed quality control” at the plant based on over one hundred pages of company documents, internal emails, and federal records.

The news agency stated that managers had pressured employees to finish work quickly to avoid production delays. In doing so, managers even ignored safety issues raised by employees. According to the Times‘ June 28 article, the Federal Aviation Administration has confirmed three complaints registered by employees at the South Carolina plant since September last year.

Fresh trouble for Boeing

The Department of Justice’s subpoena over Dreamliner planes has brought new trouble for Boeing, which is already facing worldwide criticism and criminal investigation over its fast-selling 737 MAX jets’ safety issues. The 737 MAX planes have been grounded worldwide since mid-March following two deadly accidents that occurred within the span of five months.

Due to their worldwide grounding, air carriers have denied taking deliveries of the MAX planes until safety concerns are cleared, thereby hurting Boeing’s overall shipments. In May 2019, the company’s overall commercial aircraft deliveries fell 56% year-over-year to 30 planes from 68 in May 2018.

Orders for Boeing 737 MAX planes have remained frozen since mid-March. The company has received some respite via several major orders for its Dreamliner jets in the last three months. During the first half of 2019, the company won ~55 orders for 787 Dreamliner planes. Therefore, any fresh findings regarding safety loopholes in the new model will likely severely impact Boeing’s commercial airplane orders and deliveries, hurting its financial results.

Stock performance

Shares of Boeing fell 2% on July 1. The stock has underperformed the iShares US Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA), which allocates funds to companies engaged in the manufacturing, assembling, and distribution of aerospace and defense equipment. Boeing has returned 10.5% YTD (year-to-date), while ITA has returned 22.8%.

The stock’s YTD gains are much lower than those of its peers. Lockheed Martin (LMT), General Dynamics (GD), and United Technologies (UTX) have returned 38%, 16.1%, and 23.3%, respectively, YTD."
Verizon is teaming up with the VA on a telehealth program,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Zachary Hendrickson'],07-01-2019,2019,7,https://www.businessinsider.com/verizon-department-of-veterans-affairs-telehealth-partnership-2019-7,"Verizon partnered with the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in a move that will give veterans who are also Verizon customers access to the VA's telehealth app VA Video Connect — which enables remote consultations with healthcare professionals — free of data charges via Verizon's 4G LTE network, per Health Data Management.

American Well

Here's what it means: The VA is doubling down on telehealth efforts to expand its reach among rural vets.

The VA conducted over 1 million telehealth consultations last year, and a strategic partnership with Verizon should help it reach its lofty telehealth goals. Six million unique patients received VA treatment last year — a difficult task given there are only 172 VA medical centers nationwide — and telehealth could effectively expand VA providers' reach: The VA aims for all of its care providers to be telehealth enabled by the end of fiscal year 2021, according to a 2018 Veterans Health Administration notice.

The VA is concerned that there are fewer care options for rural vets — but hopes 4G-powered telehealth could provide reinforcements. The VA's major telehealth investments are almost primarily geared toward addressing the needs of the 4.7 million US veterans living in rural areas: Rural veterans may need to travel great distances between their homes and points of care — a problem exacerbated by uncertainty around the 21% of rural hospitals currently facing closure. Also, 27% of rural vets don't use the internet at home, likely due in part to a lack of broadband coverage: Nearly 40% of individuals in rural communities don't have broadband access compared with 4% in urban areas, per The Conversation. Nevertheless, the VA has had success with telehealth in rural areas: Of the 1 million telehealth visits last year, over half were made by rural veterans.

The bigger picture: Verizon likely sees the massive VA patient base as a proof-of-concept for a larger telehealth play on the horizon.

Verizon isn't the only major telecom player interested in telehealth, but its superior 4G network could still give it the long-term edge. In addition to its partnership with Verizon, the VA has previously tied up with two other major players in the telecom space — T-Mobile and Sprint— on telehealth initiatives. However, Verizon performed better than the competition in terms of 4G mobile video streaming, and it also had the widest coverage area, according to insights from OpenSignal.

And free 4G access for veterans could be just the first step in a larger 5G telehealth play from Verizon.Of the three telecom providers linked up with the VA, only Verizon has a web presence fully dedicated to 5G in healthcare. As we've previously covered, 5G is the next step in mobile connectivity, and it's prepped to have a major impact on the efficacy and speed of digital health tools. I (Zach) think we could see Verizon leveraging 4G performance data from VA Video Connect in attempts to work out a more ambitious, paid contract to provide 5G digital health services to VA medical centers in the near future. However, Verizon will need to improve its 5G network before that point and could find itself competing with the reach of a potentially merged T-Mobile/Sprint.

DHS Inspector General Finds 'Dangerous Overcrowding' In Border Patrol Facilities,https://www.wbur.org,"['Joel Rose', 'John Burnett']",,,,https://www.wbur.org/npr/738179391/dhs-inspector-general-finds-dangerous-overcrowding-in-border-patrol-facilities,"The Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General is warning about ""dangerous overcrowding"" in Border Patrol facilities in the Rio Grande Valley of South Texas.

In a strongly worded report, the inspector general said the prolonged detention of migrants without proper food, hygiene or laundry facilities — some for more than a month — requires ""immediate attention and action.""

The report comes amid growing outrage over detention conditions for migrants and follows reports that migrant children were kept in squalid conditions without enough food and basic necessities in a Border Patrol station in West Texas.

Inspectors from DHS's Office of Inspector General in June visited Border Patrol facilities and ports of entry across the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, the busiest sector in the country for illegal border crossings.

""We are concerned that overcrowding and prolonged detention represent an immediate risk to the health and safety of DHS agents and officers, and to those detained,"" they wrote.

In its response to the report, the Department of Homeland Security says the surge of migrants crossing the Southern border has led to an ""acute and worsening crisis.""

""The current migration flow and the resulting humanitarian crisis are rapidly overwhelming the ability of the Federal Government to respond,"" DHS says.

In May, according to DHS, an average of more than 4,600 people a day crossed illegally or arrived at ports of entry without the proper documents, compared to less than 700 a day in the same period two years ago.

DHS says Customs and Border Protection facilities are at ""peak capacity"" and that the agency is adding detention capacity at three tent facilities in order to improve the conditions for migrants. CBP also says it ""continues to take steps to address the health and safety of those in custody,"" including by expanding medical services.

The inspector general's office released a report in May describing similarly dangerous overcrowding conditions in Border Patrol cells in the El Paso region.

The latest report from the Rio Grande Valley includes photos of migrants penned into overcrowded Border Patrol facilities — including one man pressing a cardboard sign to a cell window with the word ""Help.""

The inspectors quote one unnamed senior manager calling the situation a ""ticking time bomb.""

Inspectors found that hundreds of children were held for longer than the 72 hours, the maximum time federal rules allow. In some cases, kids were held for more than two weeks. And some adults were kept in standing-room-only cells, without access to showers, for more than a week.

Inspectors said Border Patrol management informed them there had been ""security incidents,"" such as detainees clogging toilets with Mylar blankets and socks in order to be released from their cells during maintenance.

""We ended our site visit at one Border Patrol facility early because our presence was agitating an already difficult situation,"" the inspectors wrote. ""Specifically, when detainees observed us, they banged on the cell windows, shouted, pressed notes to the window with their time in custody, and gestured to evidence of their time in custody (e.g., beards).""

This is not the way to move USDA agencies out of Washington,https://thehill.com,[],07-02-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/451238-this-is-not-the-way-to-move-usda-agencies-out-of-washington,"The public debate over the announced move of the USDA Economic Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture has focused on whether a move is sensible. Equally important is how this move has been planned and implemented.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue George (Sonny) Ervin PerdueThis is not the way to move USDA agencies out of Washington American farmers can't afford this administration's climate apathy Overnight Energy: New EPA rule could expand officials weighing in on FOIA requests | Trump plan to strip conservation fund gets bipartisan pushback | Agriculture chief downplays climate concerns MORE announced on June 13 that the 80 percent of staff at the two agencies will move to Kansas City by the end of September. He justified the move as putting the agencies closer to their agricultural constituency and as saving taxpayer money. I am one of the agricultural economists who wrote a critique of the USDA cost-benefit analysis, finding two major costs that were omitted from the USDA justification.

Our critique has been cited widely for disputing the USDA claim that the move would save taxpayer money. Two flaws in the measurement of costs drove our findings. The first was that the USDA analysis inflated the cost of remaining in Washington, D.C. It identified Kansas City as the least expensive place to locate outside of Washington that met its relocation criteria.

By failing to compare this to the least expensive place inside Washington, they stacked the deck. The USDA real estate cost estimate would fall by $57-92 million in current 2019 dollars if it had compared sites outside the Beltway to the kind of alternatives that the General Services Administration would have identified in the District of Columbia, had it been asked to do so.

The second big cost we identified — and the one that turned the bottom line to a negative for taxpayers — resulted not from where these agencies are located, but rather from how the whole move process is being managed. This is the cost to the nation of lost research output when highly skilled researchers quit. On June 26, officials from the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents staff at both agencies, announced that internal surveys indicate that 80 percent of ERS researchers plan to resign or retire rather than move.

Even if half to three-quarters of relocating ERS and NIFA employees were to depart, as our analysis assumed, rebuilding expertise and productivity would be no easy job. These employees are overwhelmingly Ph.D. holders. They are not local hires in the Kansas City area. They are experts recruited in a national market. To attract replacements, the ERS and NIFA will have to compete with universities, research institutes, corporations and other federal agencies. Based on how competitive is the Ph.D job market in agricultural economics, we estimated that it will take four years of hiring 75-100 researchers annually to rebuild those agencies. Most of the new hires will be newly minted Ph.Ds, so they will need several years each to build the expertise in national scale agricultural issues and analytical methods of the employees who are departing. We calculate the monetary value of the lost research that is either not conducted or that trainees conduct less efficiently at $141 million - 203 million in 2019 dollars.

What is the value of agricultural and food research not conducted? I have written elsewhere about how much of what we know about America’s food comes from USDA research. Measuring economic values is tricky when markets are missing, and economists delight in quibbling over methods. Where we all agree is that there is a hidden cost when important work ceases to be performed.

Indeed, the very reasons that the United States government has formed agencies to perform research are that 1) this work would either not be done or not done equally well in the private sector, and 2) the benefits of the research work exceed its cost to taxpayers. So, when staff vacancies interrupt that research, taxpayers lose.

Moving these agencies out of Washington, did not have to trigger a hemorrhage of expertise. We teach our undergraduate students that the functions of management are planning, implementation, and control. Had the consideration of an agency move begun as a planning process that engaged agency staff to weigh the benefits and costs of moving, they would have been aware, and they would have felt included and valued. Instead, they felt alarmed and alienated when Purdue announced on Aug. 8, 2018, that they would be relocated.

Many organizations with highly skilled employees make special efforts to retain experienced staff. A common way to do that while moving is to open a branch office and to entice seasoned employees to move with attractive incentives and time to work out the details.

Consider the gradual way that Amazon, which also relies upon a highly skilled workforce, is expanding into new facilities across the Potomac from where the USDA is extracting ERS and NIFA. Amazon is planning a ten-year buildup into its HQ2 in northern Virginia; USDA’s implementation approach was to give employees 32 days to decide and less than three months to pack up and move to Kansas City.

The sad truth is that if done right, the relocation of the ERS and NIFA outside of Washington, might have made sense for America’s taxpayers, farmers and food consumers. The plan’s failure to pass muster arises from the massive costs of alienating an expert workforce to the point that most quit. So far, about a quarter of ERS and NIFA employees are gone. The cost in lost staff and morale is high, but it is not too late to turn back.

We have reached the 11th hour. If Perdue wishes to hold on to USDA research capacity in agricultural markets, policy, and science, the time has come to cancel the relocation plan and stem the staff exodus. We may never know if moving these agencies outside Washington would have made sense for American’s taxpayers. What we do know is that as it has been managed, this move fails the benefit-cost test.

Elizabeth Warren says no wealthy donors as ambassadors in State plan,https://www.vox.com,['Jun'],06-28-2019,2019,6,https://www.vox.com/2019/6/28/19102522/elizabeth-warren-state-department-plan-2020,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) just released her vision for how she would run the State Department from the Oval Office — and it’s a dramatic change from how President Donald Trump has handled America’s diplomatic corps.

In a Friday Medium post, Warren vowed to pursue a “diplomacy-first strategy” as president as opposed to conducting US foreign policy mostly through the better-funded Pentagon. To do that, she says, her administration would invest much more in the current and future diplomats that serve in roughly 270 posts around the world.

“American security and prosperity depend on robust diplomacy,” she wrote. “Our diplomats are the front line of our engagement with the world.”

Her piece details that she won’t allow wealthy campaign donors to become ambassadors, how she aims to double the size of the diplomatic corps while improving diversity in its ranks, and how she’d create a diplomatic equivalent of ROTC programs in universities, among other moves.

It makes sense for Warren to put out a vision like this. First, having a plan for every aspect of governance is kind of her thing. Second, her overall foreign policy views prioritize diplomacy over using the military. And third, the Trump administration has caused much heartburn at the State Department by proposing lower budgets and failing to nominate qualified people for key positions, although that’s starting to change.

But because it’s a relatively short Medium post, the senator’s State Department plan is lacking many details about how, exactly, she would turn her aspirations into reality. There’s no mention about how she’d fight a GOP-led Senate to spend more and confirm nominees, there’s no real connection (yet) with how these views intersect with her thoughts on defense and development, and no discussion of tradeoffs she might face while prioritizing the State Department’s revamp.

Still, offering a State Department plan makes her the leading candidate on the issue during the 2020 cycle (for now). And what she offers are some concrete proposals that would let Warren put her mark on one of America’s oldest governmental professions.

How Warren wants to fix the State Department

Warren’s plan comes down to three main proposals that, if enacted, would substantially change the way the State Department has been managed under Trump — and that represent something of a departure from how the department was run under President Barack Obama, too.

1) No wealthy donors become ambassadors

This is likely the part of Warren’s plan that will get the most attention. There’s a long tradition of presidents in both parties nominating some of their richest financial supporters to plum ambassadorial posts. In Obama’s second term, for example, he named 31 campaign “bundlers” — people who raised at least $50,000 for his campaign — as an embassy’s top diplomat.

“Nearly all of these bundlers ... serve in Western European nations or other highly developed and stable countries such as Canada and New Zealand,” the Center for Public Integrity reported in January 2017.

Trump continued the practice by nominating 14 inauguration donors — who gave on average about $350,000 — as ambassadors. What’s worse, the people he nominated for top embassy posts were less qualified than in administrations past, as the February chart from Axios below shows. (The nominated ambassadors also gave more money to his campaign, on average, than previous rich donors gave other presidents.)

Warren says that trend would end under her watch. “I’ll make my ambassadorial appointments based on only one thing: finding the most qualified person for the job,” she wrote. “I won’t give ambassadorial posts to wealthy donors or bundlers — period,” she continued, calling on other candidates to promise the same.

That said, it’s somewhat easy for Warren to make this pledge. She’s already not taking money from high rollers or speaking at big fundraisers, so her bench of wealthy supporters is already thin. Still, her vow, if enacted, would end a long-standing problem of pay-for-play at some of America’s most important embassies.

2) Revamp the diplomatic corps

Warren blames Trump for many diplomats recently leaving the government, but she also notes that’s been a problem for a while. “Years of hiring freezes and spending cuts have caused many talented diplomats to head for the doors,” she wrote.

So Warren proposes two ways to change that: double the size of the foreign service and improve the diversity in the diplomatic corps.

Those go hand in hand. Right now, America’s diplomats are mainly white and male. “[T]he Foreign Service is not sufficiently representative of the American people with respect to race, gender, socioeconomic background, and regional origin,” a May 2018 Congressional Research Service report noted.

That means there’s a vast, untapped pool of people around the country that may be interested in a diplomatic posting. To reach out to them, Warren says she’ll “dedicate recruiting resources to applicants from HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities] and other minority-serving institutions, women’s colleges, and community colleges. And I’ll double the size of fellowships designed to recruit minority and low-income diplomats.”

She’ll also push for universities to have a ROTC-like program for diplomats as well as double the size of the Peace Corps.

Trump, meanwhile, has consistently proposed cuts to the State Deparment budget and recruited secretaries of state that seem intent on lowering diplomatic ranks. Multiple diplomats I’ve talked to since the start of this administration have consistently noted the poor morale among the corps and just how understaffed — and therefore overworked — they all are.

Warren’s changes, then, will certainly require tons of effort and a decent chunk of money (although surely a lot, lot less than the Pentagon spends). It’s unlikely she could completely alter the face of the US diplomatic corps in four or even eight years. But she seems intent on making structural tweaks quickly in hopes of long-term change.

3) Improve the lives of diplomats

Diplomats have to deal with two big institutional challenges. First, they work for a large, impersonal bureaucracy that doesn’t always let the best talent rise to the top. Second, their service in major cities around the world makes it harder to raise a family and strike a normal work-life balance.

Warren wants to alter all that.

She proposes creating a “core professional development curriculum” which would help diplomats improve in their jobs and prepare for more senior roles. That will help her make at least one Deputy Secretary — a position right under the secretary of state — a career ambassador, one of the corps’ top designations.

The senator also aims to “enhance workplace flexibility to retain a diverse workforce.” She’d do that, in part, by “expanding parental leave and preferential postings for new parents.” That means new mothers and fathers wouldn’t be penalized as much for starting a family in the hyper-competitive State Department. What’s more, raising a kid in a more developed country could make an upbringing easier than, say, growing up in a warzone.

None of this is to say Warren’s plan is perfect; no plan is. But even in a short Medium post, Warren has given more thought about what to do with the State Deparment than many (if not all) of her Democratic opponents. The question now is if any other presidential candidate — including Trump — can come up with a better plan in the months ahead."
