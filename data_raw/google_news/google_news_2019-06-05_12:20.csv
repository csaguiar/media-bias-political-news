D-Day -- the military term for the first day of the Normandy landings -- was the largest amphibious invasion ever undertaken and laid the foundations for the Allied defeat of Germany in World War II.

It paved the way for Allied success on the Western Front in World War II, turning the tide of the war against the beleaguered Axis powers.

The invasion took place on June 6, 1944, and saw of tens of thousands of troops from the United States, the UK, France, Australia and Canada landing on five stretches of the Normandy coastline -- codenamed Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword beaches.

Planning for D-Day began more than a year in advance, and the Allies carried out substantial military deception -- codenamed Operation Bodyguard -- in order to confuse the Germans as to when and where the invasion would take place.

The operation was originally scheduled to begin on June 5, when a full moon and low tides were expected to coincide with good weather, but storms forced a 24-hour delay.

A Washington Post argument against impeachment: Trump is who he is,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Howard Kurtz', 'Howard Kurtz Is A Fox News Analyst', 'The Host Of']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/a-washington-post-argument-against-impeachment-trump-is-who-he-is,"The debate over impeachment is growing both deafening and dispiriting.

On one side, liberal pols and pundits argue that the Democrats have an absolute duty to make the move against Donald Trump because he's so obviously broken the law — never mind Bob Mueller's lack of charges — and is so awful that history demands action, regardless of the political drawbacks.

Other pols and pundits on the left say impeachment would be futile and self-destructive, divide the country, obliterate the Democrats' agenda — and then ultimately fail in the Senate.

This has been cranked up across the media echo chamber for days, endless iterations of the same two arguments. It's gotten, honestly, rather boring.

EVENING NEWSCASTS INCREASED 'IMPEACHMENT' TALK FOLLOWING MUELLER REPORT, STUDY SAYS

And there's a surreal element to it as well. Impeachment is either very likely not going to happen (as long as Nancy Pelosi wields the gavel), or it will become an empty exercise (since 20 GOP senators would have to vote to dump Trump).

But now comes a different view, from one of Trump's least favorite newspapers.

Fred Hiatt, the Washington Post's longtime editorial page editor, has actually come out against impeachment. This is startling at first glance, because the Post's editorials, and Hiatt himself, have been harshly critical of Trump for years.

In fact, the editorial board wrote when Trump was nominated in 2016 that he was ""uniquely unqualified to serve as president. A Trump presidency would be dangerous for the nation and the world.""

And, Hiatt says, they were right. But here's the twist:

""We thought his unfitness was evident before he was elected, and Americans chose him anyway ...

""To impeach him now for what the electorate welcomed or was willing to overlook isn't the democratic response. The right response is to defeat him in 2020.""

Just in case anyone thought they were going soft on Trump.

Hiatt's argument, from the platform owned by Jeff Bezos, packs an added punch precisely because the paper has been so critical of Trump.

IMPEACHMENT DAM BREAKING AS PELOSI DEPUTIES TIP HAND: 'WE'VE ALREADY BEGUN'

Many of Trump's traits — the blustering style, the mixed business record, the anti-immigrant attacks, the womanizing background, the slams against fake news — were on ample display during the campaign. People didn't think they were getting a choirboy or even a polished political practitioner. They wanted a disruptor.

On Russian interference, Hiatt says ""the broad outlines were known before the election,"" such as Trump praising WikiLeaks for released the hacked Democratic emails.

On the Mueller report and alleged obstruction of justice, ""Mueller found no underlying crime that would explain an attempt to obstruct; and Trump in the end did not prevent Mueller from completing his work ... Are we going to impeach a president for wanting to obstruct?""

Of course, Hiatt says Congress should continue to investigate and see where that leads, but should seriously pause ""before impeaching Trump for the high crime of being who we knew he was before we elected him.""

Now I'm sure this piece wasn't popular among some Post readers who want the president driven from the public square today. Nor will it be embraced by most of the right, which believes Trump is doing a great job and there's no case for impeaching him on the merits.

But for open-minded folks, there's a strong case here for not using the Constitution as a last resort to overturn an election, especially with another election approaching that can render a verdict on the incumbent."
Republicans ready to quash Cuccinelli,https://www.politico.com,"['Burgess Everett', 'Eliana Johnson', 'Ted Hesson']",06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/04/cuccinelli-immigration-nomination-1353314,"The fight over Ken Cuccinelli's potential nomination to head U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is again pitting the president against his own party in Congress. | Matt Rourke/AP Photo congress Republicans ready to quash Cuccinelli The GOP-led Senate is relishing the chance to derail the nomination of Trump’s immigration pick.

Ken Cuccinelli has spent years attacking Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans. Now, it’s time for payback.

President Donald Trump wants Cuccinelli, who most recently led the anti-establishment Senate Conservatives Fund, to be director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. But there may be nobody in Washington whom McConnell and his allies would take more pleasure in defeating, and the bottom line is Cuccinelli has little chance of getting approved for the job, Republican senators said.

Story Continued Below

“He’s spent a fair amount of his career attacking Republicans in the Senate, so it strikes me as an odd position for him to put himself in to seek Senate confirmation,” said Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, who ran the GOP’s campaign arm for two election cycles. “It’s unlikely he’s going to be confirmed if he is nominated.”

Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the Senate GOP’s chief vote-counter, called the bid “a long shot,” adding, “They’ll go forward with it or they won’t, but I will suspect he’ll have plenty of obstacles once he gets here.”

The nascent nomination fight is again pitting the president against his own party in Congress. Just this spring, because of strong and very public opposition from Senate Republicans, Trump yanked his two preferred picks for the Federal Reserve’s board of governors before they even had been formally nominated.

And immigration has been a particular sore spot: Every leadership position at the Department of Homeland Security related to immigration is filled only by people serving in an acting capacity — and White House officials are mulling the prospect of having Cuccinelli do the same.

And immigration has been a particular sore spot: Every leadership position at the Department of Homeland Security related to immigration is filled only by an individual serving in an acting capacity — and White House officials are mulling the prospect of having Cuccinelli do the same.

Some senators are still hoping to persuade Trump not to formally nominate or appoint Cuccinelli, but if the president goes through with it, the former Virginia attorney general likely will be either rejected or blocked from a floor vote entirely.

White House officials said Cuccinelli, always spoiling for a fight, is enthusiastic about another clash with McConnell. In a statement for this story, Cuccinelli showed no signs of backing down.

“My focus right now is on achieving President Trump’s immigration goals. It would certainly be my hope that senators’ primary interest is in the accomplishment of policy rather than politics,” he said.

The pushback against Trump’s attempt to install an immigration hard-liner to run the country’s legal immigration system is the climax of Senate Republicans’ yearslong battle with Cuccinelli and his organization, which has tried to oust GOP incumbents in favor of more conservative challengers. Cuccinelli joined in 2014, shortly after McConnell trounced Senate Conservatives Fund-backed opponent.

Cuccinelli also has taken aim at some of the senators needed to confirm him — calling on McConnell to resign as majority leader, backing Roy Moore in Alabama’s Senate race to the chagrin of the GOP rank and file, and criticizing the record of Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) as a “major disappointment.”

“You’re always held to what you’ve said,” Burr said when reminded of Cuccinelli’s criticisms.

Though Cuccinelli was initially slated to be the Trump administration’s immigration czar, a position the president considered creating to oversee and coordinate immigration policy, the White House changed plans in late May. And even if he never actually takes charge at USCIS, White House officials said simply being discussed for a position that requires Senate confirmation could lend additional heft to an alternative role.

Trump has occasionally floated contentious appointments to Senate Republicans — including McConnell — with no intention of nominating the individuals, according to sources familiar with his remarks. He’d then tell aides he was doing so only to make subsequent nominees seem more palatable.

Whether the president is dangling Cuccinelli’s nomination in the same spirit is unclear, but Trump officials signaled his elevation after McConnell publicly panned Cuccinelli in remarks to reporters in April.

On Tuesday, McConnell reiterated in a brief interview his strong “lack of enthusiasm” for Cuccinelli.

“It seems to me to be very difficult [to confirm him], based upon what I have read that McConnell says. I get the opinion that McConnell is not going to bring it up,” Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said. “So if McConnell’s not going to bring it up, it ain’t going to come up.”

Grassley predicted Cuccinelli will be temporarily installed in an acting role. If Trump wants to avoid a fight with the Senate GOP, he may seek to install Cuccinelli at USCIS in an acting capacity, according to two current and former DHS officials with knowledge of the process.

Cuccinelli’s elevation itself is a blow to Grassley, whose former staffer Francis Cissna was ousted from USCIS despite Grassley’s pleas to keep him amid Trump’s broader purge of the Department of Homeland Security.

Grassley said Cissna was “trying to do everything Trump wants done but doing it in a lawful way. It seems to me we’re a government based on the rule of law. You ought to respect people who are trying to abide by it.”

USCIS, which oversees the country’s immigration and naturalization system, is led by acting Director Mark Koumans, who took the helm this month after Cissna was pushed out. The possibility that Cuccinelli could serve a long period of time as an acting official wouldn’t be unprecedented. Thomas Homan — a former ICE official — led that agency for a year and a half.

The Cuccinelli nomination reflects the persistent bind Trump has faced when it comes to immigration. Senate Republicans are reluctant to confirm the sorts of people who share his views, such as Cuccinelli and Kris Kobach, a former Kansas secretary of state who was considered as a replacement for former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.

Trump’s preferred Federal Reserve picks, Stephen Moore and Herman Cain, were scuttled by GOP resistance. And Cuccinelli could be headed for the same buzz saw, though one Senate Republican worried “then we get Kris Kobach, who’s probably worse.

“I don’t know why the president keeps putting these people out without just making a few phone calls and saying: ‘Can you confirm this person?’” the senator said.

Yet those like Nielsen who have gained Senate approval have quickly fallen out of favor with the president and his top immigration adviser, Stephen Miller.

And not all senators share leadership’s view. Some came to the Senate after the peak of Senate Conservatives Fund’s power earlier this decade.

“It’s the president’s call,” Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said. “I do worry sometimes that we’re going in a direction more where the only people that can be considered for appointments, you have to be computers or live in a cocoon or have never been active. That’s not realistic.”

Cramer was one of the leading opponents of Cain’s elevation to the Fed, which cratered in April. But he said that job is different than USCIS: “It’s not just the person but the position you consider them for.”

Trump opens up on reported 'nasty' comment about Meghan Markle,https://www.foxnews.com,['Vandana Rambaran'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-meghan-markle-nasty-piers-morgan-interview,"President Trump sat down with Piers Morgan for ITV's ""Good Morning Britain"" and clarified controversial comments last week about Meghan Markle.

Trump said he wasn't calling Markle nasty, but rather was just surprised to hear her comments about him, including her assertion that if he became president it would force Americans to relocate to Canada.

""I wasn’t referring to 'she’s nasty.' I said she was nasty about me. And essentially I didn’t know she was nasty about me,"" Trump told Morgan in the interview, set to air on Wednesday.

DONALD TRUMP SAYS HE NEVER CALLED MEGHAN MARKLE 'NASTY,' CALLS COMMENTS ABOUT DUCHESS 'FAKE NEWS'

In an interview published Friday, The Sun, a British tabloid, read aloud comments to Trump from a 2016 interview in which Markle, 37, accused him of being “misogynistic” and “divisive” during his 2016 presidential campaign.

“I’m voting for Hillary Clinton, not because she is a woman, but because Trump has made it easy to see that you don’t really want that kind of world that he’s painting,” Markle said in an interview on ""The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore"" while promoting her television series, ""Suits.""

“I didn’t know that,"" Trump said of her comments when asked about them, The Sun reported Friday. ""What can I say? I didn’t know that she was nasty.""

Markle skipped the initial reception attended by Trump, first lady Melania Trump, Queen Elizabeth, Prince Charles and Prince Harry on Monday at Buckingham Palace. She is on maternity leave with her 3-week old son.

The president and first lady have been visiting Britain on a three-day trip. Queen Elizabeth hosted the two at Buckingham Palace Monday night. Trump and Melania toured the Churchill War Rooms on Tuesday and hosted Prince Charles and Duchess of Camilla at dinner.

Despite Markle's absence, Trump insisted that there was no tension between him and her husband, Prince Harry.

""I congratulated him and I think he’s a terrific guy,"" Trump told ITV. ""The royal family is really nice.""

""In fact, he spent a lot of time talking to Ivanka and talking to my family. I went up -- he couldn’t have been nicer.""

Trump went on to praise Markle, saying: “You know what? She’s doing a good job, I hope she enjoys her life. ... I think she’s very nice.”"
"“Marla Was Under Duress”: Revealed in His Marla Maples Prenup, Donald Trump’s Draconian Art of the Marriage Deal",https://www.vanityfair.com,"['Gabriel Sherman', 'Vanity Fair', 'Bruce Handy', 'Joe Pompeo']",,,,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/06/marla-maple-prenup-donald-trump-marriage,"In the fall of 1993, Donald Trump was clawing out of the rubble of a cratering business career. Three of his Atlantic City casinos had gone bankrupt. He’d nearly defaulted on $3.4 billion in debt, and, humiliatingly, his creditors had put him on a living allowance: $450,000 a month. Bankers forced him to sell his 282-foot yacht, the Trump Princess, as well as the Trump Shuttle airline and stake in the Plaza hotel, which Trump had once called “the ultimate trophy in the world.” His relationship with Marla Maples had begun in Trumpian glory, with the words “Best Sex I’ve Ever Had” on the front page of the New York Post, but Maples had just given birth to their daughter, Tiffany, and was eager to get married. “I’m going to have to make a decision about Marla...what should I do?” Trump asked his mother around this time. He was 47 years old. Many people in the city believed he was finished.

A source recently passed me a revealing document from this era: Trump’s prenuptial agreement with Maples. Its draconian terms suggest a penuriousness at odds with his public image as a free-spending billionaire in his gilded triplex penthouse. And its confidential financial statements included in the agreement is a sketch of Trump’s immense privilege and the wealth he squandered, telling in both what it illuminates and what is obfuscates.

With Trump fighting House Democrats over the release of his tax returns, what we know about his opaque financial life has largely come from a paper trail unearthed by investigative reporters. Journalists at The New York Times have blazed much of this difficult terrain with bombshells such as the revelation that his father, Fred, bequeathed Trump more than $400 million in today’s dollars, and that IRS tax receipts indicate Trump lost more than more than $1 billion between 1985 and 1994. Dogged reporting by the Times and others revealed Trump’s core argument for being president—he’s a self-made billionaire who alone can solve the world’s most intractable problems—to be as credible as a degree from Trump University. But the deal he made with his second wife was, as a business proposition, a raging success, even though as a personal matter, it was as ugly as could be.

Even Donald Trump realized that, when it comes to romance, a prenup is a buzzkill. “A prenuptial is a horrible document,” he once told a reporter, “because it says, ‘When we get divorced, this is the way we’ll split things up.’ And when you’re a believer in positive thinking, it isn’t good. But it’s a modern-day necessity.”

Raoul Felder, the legendary divorce lawyer whose clients have included Trump’s own lawyer Rudy Giuliani, agreed. “A prenup sucks romance out of the relationship,” he told me. “It’s a prior agreement as to the disposition of money, assets, payments. You basically plan the divorce before you get married.”

Prenup negotiations require both parties to disclose to the other how much money they have. In the document, Trump stated he was worth $1.17 billion; Maples had $100,000 in the bank. But while Trump presented himself as a Master of the Universe, back and bigger than ever, he was, in all likelihood, not an actual billionaire when he signed the agreement. (He didn’t appear on the Forbes list between 1990 and 1995.) And Trump had financial incentive to inflate his wealth: if he understated his fortune, Maples could later claim in a divorce that Trump hid money from her at the time, which could void the prenup’s terms. “When you’re doing a prenup, the worry is you understate your assets. If you overstate it, then you’re protected,” a high-profile Manhattan divorce lawyer told me.

To keep himself in the nine-figure club, Trump provided extremely optimistic values for his real estate assets. For instance, he stated the Taj Mahal was worth $1.25 billion, even though it had trouble making debt payments virtually from the moment it opened. (In 2017 it sold for 4 cents on the dollar.) He valued the Trump Castle and Trump Plaza casinos $450 million and $650 million, respectively. (Both went bankrupt in 1992.) Trump’s accountants at Spahr, Lacher & Sperber didn’t vouch for his fuzzy math. “We have not audited or reviewed” the numbers Trump provided, they stated in a note attached to the financial report. They added: “Assets are presented at current values estimated by Trump using various valuation methods.”

The White House did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Trump, of course, overstated his net worth and business acumen since his first forays into Manhattan real estate in the 1970s. In a 1976 interview with the Times, he claimed to be worth “more than $200 million” when, in fact, he reportedly had taxable income of only about $75,000 in 1975. In subsequent years, he posed as a Trump Organization official to mislead Forbes editors, so they would include him on the magazine’s annual list of billionaires.

More than anything, the prenup shows how fiercely Trump wanted to protect the money he did have. Maples reportedly wanted $25 million, but Trump agreed to pay her only $1 million if they separated within five years, plus another $1 million to buy a house. Trump also would stop making $100,000 child support payments for Tiffany when she turned 21. The agreement states that Trump’s payments would cease earlier if Tiffany got a full-time job, enlisted in the military, or joined the Peace Corps. “The way it was drawn up is ironclad and shows how wary he was,” Felder told me after reviewing the prenup. “He was leaving nothing to chance.”

Maples agreed to these terms with the hope that Trump would renegotiate a better deal in five years. “We basically came to an agreement that for the first few years we would agree on something and then tear it up,” she told a journalist. “She was telling people it was love,” said a source who knew the couple well. Ultimately, Maples didn’t have much of a choice if she wanted to get married—which she desperately did. When she traveled, she brought along her wedding dress, so that she would be ready at a moment’s notice if Trump said he wanted to get married, said the source. Maples declined to comment."
"Before bashing Trump, European leaders need a history lesson",https://nypost.com,"['Michael Goodwin', 'June']",06-04-2019,2019,6,https://nypost.com/2019/06/04/before-bashing-trump-european-leaders-need-a-history-lesson/,"Over the next two days, the 75th anniversary of D-Day will be marked with solemn salutes for the undaunted courage of individual soldiers and sailors and the inspired leadership that assembled the armada that liberated Europe.

President Trump will take part in ceremonies in England and then in Normandy, France, where the German bunkers, bomb craters and the vast American cemetery stand in silent testament to the great alliance that came ashore and defeated Hitler.

Indeed it was great, perhaps the greatest wartime alliance in history, but could it be done again? If, God forbid, another Hitler were carving up Europe like warm bread, would a new international force respond to storm the beaches and save civilization?

Merely to ask the question is to suggest the unhappy answer. The West ain’t what it used to be.

This will come as news to many in London, Paris, Berlin, Amsterdam and Brussels, but Donald Trump didn’t cause the decline of the West. In fact, among his supporters, the decline of America largely explains why he was elected in the first place.

Yet to hear the London demonstrators and some foolish British politicians, Trump is the biggest problem in the world. If it weren’t for him, the lion and the lamb could lay down together.

Sure, all you would need is a new lamb each morning.

The modern world as we know it was born in the aftermath of World War II. Unprecedented levels of peace, prosperity and democracy spread across the globe and were guaranteed by financial and military institutions funded mostly by America.

But vigilance waned as memories dimmed, and much of Europe used the continent’s longest holiday from war to disarm and expand their welfare states. They assumed, correctly, that America would be there to protect them.

Then along comes Trump with his America First agenda and instantly he’s the skunk at their garden party. He demands, outrageously in their view, that Europe finally pay its fair share for the common defense, a promise often made but never kept.

They hate his insistence on border security, even as their nations are roiled by their own influx of uninvited migrants. They hate him for this and they hate him for that, but most of all, they hate him for being so damn American.

Give us a citizen of the world, they say, give us another Barack Obama. Give us somebody who flatters us and apologizes for America.

This hatred can appear to be a kind of sport for hooligans, with loud chants, quiet snubs and occasional milk shakes the weapons of choice. But this is no game.

The alienation is so deep and destructive that if Trump were at the helm of a new alliance in a time of global crisis, many of our old allies would spend their energies demonstrating against him and spewing nonsense, but few would pick up a gun or encourage others to do so. They would rather lose than fight beside him.

Trump Derangement Syndrome, you see, has gone international. He doesn’t deserve a state visit or even common courtesy because, according to London Mayor Sadiq Khan, America’s president “stands for the complete opposite of London’s values.”

see also London mayor takes victory lap after Trump nixes visit London Mayor Sadiq Khan said Friday that President Trump canceled...

Right, London’s values. Asian autocrats, Mideast butchers and Russian oligarchs are welcomed there with open arms, but the president of the United States is treated too often like a Third World thug.

Trump got it exactly right when he called Khan a shorter version of Bill de Blasio.

The anti-Semitic leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, boycotted the state dinner but appeared at a demonstration protesting Trump’s presence. Corbyn has laid a wreath on the graves of Arab terrorists and compared Israel to Nazis, but Trump is beneath him.

Prime Minister Theresa May, on her way out the door, behaved impeccably in hosting Trump, as did Queen Elizabeth and those in the royal family who understand what America means to the world.

But the likes of Khan and Corbyn stain historic memory and embarrass their nation. They are the ignorant elite, seeing a hamstrung America — and a diminished Israel — as good for the world.

They view their fellow countrymen who support Brexit as the British equivalent of deplorables.

They are not alone.

Consider that on the eve of Trump’s trip, German Chancellor Angela Merkel gave the commencement address at Harvard and got standing ovations for obvious criticisms of America’s president, though she never used his name. Naturally, Merkel also got applause from the American media for taking on the president they love to hate.

In another era, no foreign leader would dare think of coming to America to insult our president. But the “anything goes” habit has become so routine in the age of Trump that Merkel’s insufferable lecture came and went without much notice.

In Washington, mad-dog Democrats also threw off bipartisan traditions and good manners. Even as the president was out of the country, they continued to air their fantasies of deposing him, with some advocating a climb-the-ladder approach of first impeaching much of his cabinet.

Attorney General William Barr is at the top of their enemies list, a desperate-for-attention 2020 candidate called for the impeachment of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and others want Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to face the same music. They’ll come up with reasons later.

Two leaders of the House impeachment caucus, Rep. James Clyburn and Rep. Jerry Nadler, explained that they were going slowly because the public polls showed wide opposition to impeaching the president. So first, they’re going to have a trial and then hang him.

Clyburn said various committee investigations would “effectively educate the public” while Nadler put it this way: “The American people, right now, do not support it because they do not know the story. They don’t know the facts.”

Ah, yes, the rubes, bitter clingers and irredeemables should shut up and listen as their government betters instruct them in the inscrutable meaning of “high crimes and misdemeanors.”

Ironically, such fundamental unseriousness is made possible by the great victory achieved 75 years ago. You don’t have to romanticize war or the ordinary people who fought it to imagine how the 2,499 Americans who died on D-Day would view their nation today."
"DOJ reveals Dems acknowledged Barr subpoena was 'overbroad'; Nadler fires back, offers to meet 'without conditions'",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-fires-back-after-house-dems-announce-barr-contempt-vote-dubs-subpoena-unworkably-overbroad,"Hours after the Department of Justice (DOJ) slammed House Democrats for planning a contempt vote against Attorney General Bill Barr -- and charged that Democrats had privately admitted their subpoena requests were ""overbroad"" -- House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler announced late Tuesday that he is open to negotiating with the DOJ ""without conditions.""

The remarkable turn of events reopened the possibility that Barr's contempt vote may be postponed or canceled, if both sides return to the negotiating table. Nadler, however, pointedly refused to cancel the planned contempt vote prior to beginning any new negotiations, as the DOJ had demanded.

At the same time, Nadler criticized what he called DOJ ""brinksmanship,"" and blamed the Justice Department for purportedly cutting off negotiations on May 7.

The brouhaha began Tuesday morning with a DOJ letter, written by Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd, that blasted House Democrats and Nadler, D-N.Y., for announcing they would vote next week on whether to hold Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn in contempt.

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW SCHOLAR: CONGRESS HEADING INTO 'WORLD OF HURT' WITH BARR CONTEMPT VOTE

In its letter to Nadler, the DOJ publicly revealed that Democrats had acknowledged in a May 24 letter they were open to ""further negotiations"" regarding concerns that their subpoena demands were ""unworkably overbroad."" Nevertheless, Democrats announced just days later their plans to hold Barr in contempt for allegedly failing to comply with those demands.

The DOJ said it was ""prepared to resume negotiations with the committee regarding accommodation of its narrowed Subpoena"" -- as long as Democrats removed the ""threat of an imminent vote by the House of Representatives to hold the attorney general in contempt.""

""The department was disappointed by the committee's abrupt termination of ongoing negotiations aimed at reaching a reasonable accommodation that respects both sides' legitimate interests regarding the materials sought,"" Boyd wrote to Nadler. ""Further, the department is disappointed by news reports indicating that Democratic leaders have scheduled a contempt vote in the House of Representatives for June 11, 2019.""

In his response late Tuesday, Nadler took issue with the DOJ's characterization of Democrats' May 24 letter, and insisted that Democrats had ""always remained open to continuing negotiations. ... We are here and ready to negotiate as early as tomorrow morning.""

""I ... take exception to your characterization of how our prior accommodation efforts ended,"" Nadler wrote back to Boyd. ""Contrary to the account in your letter, the Committee has always remained open to continuing negotiations. We had an offer on the table late on the evening of May 7 when the Department suddenly declared an end to the accommodation process. My staff was still in their offices after the close of business hours awaiting a counteroffer when the Department broke off negotiations with a letter demanding that the contempt vote—scheduled to begin the next day— be cancelled if we wished to proceed with the accommodations process.""

Nadler continued: ""At any rate, we are ready to proceed without conditions—as shown by the initiative we took with our detailed May 24 offer. I should add that, contrary to your argument that the Committee’s continuing accommodation efforts somehow suggest that our prior requests were overbroad, our offer to compromise was intended to respond to your prior objections by seeking a middle ground. We urge the Department to do the same.""

The DOJ's letter, meanwhile, had called on the House Judiciary Committee to ""moot"" its May 8 vote to hold Barr in contempt, which the DOJ called ""premature and unnecessary."" That vote came after congressional Democrats subpoenaed Mueller's full and unredacted report on his probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 elections.

WHY DID MUELLER EDIT TRANSCRIPT OF VOICEMAIL WITH FLYNN LAWYER TO ELIMINATE KEY DISCLAIMERS?

Republicans have countered that federal law protecting secretive grand-jury information would prevent Barr from turning over the entirety of the report. The DOJ has offered Democrats the opportunity to review the report, minus those grand jury-related redactions, in a secure setting -- but those offers have been rebuffed. (In a rare public statement last week, Mueller specifically remarked, ""I certainly do not question the attorney general's good faith"" in deciding to make the report ""largely public."")

""It would hardly make sense for the full House of Representatives to act upon the committee's prior recommendation to hold the attorney general in contempt for not complying with a subpoena that even the committee now appears to acknowledge was overbroad in seeking immediate disclosure of the entirety of the special counsel's investigative files,” Boyd wrote.

That was a conspicuous reference to the previously unreported May 24 letter to the DOJ, in which the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee wrote to privately emphasize ""the Committee's willingness to engage in further negotiations to resolve this dispute"" -- only to resort to public political posturing, the DOJ charged.

The Democrat-led committee also offered to ""identify specific materials that if produced would be deemed to satisfy the subpoena"" in an effort to make the subpoena more workable, according to the DOJ, which quoted the Committee's letter verbatim.

""In your May 24, 2019, letter, the committee appears to recognize that the subpoena is unworkably overbroad and offers -- for the first time -- to narrow the subpoena's scope to cover a much more limited set of documents,"" the DOJ wrote. ""The department believes that the committee's new offer reflects a more reasonable request and could mitigate some of the legal barriers to disclosure that we have discussed.""

ANALYSIS: BARR DETERMINED TO FIND TRUTH BEHIND ORIGINS OF RUSSIA PROBE -- AND DEMS ARE WORRIED

The letter continued: ""The committee held its contempt vote only 19 days after issuing the subpoena. Traditionally, congressional committees have only proceeded with contempt votes after lengthy periods of negotiations have failed to reach an accommodation. For example, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee negotiated with the department over the Operation Fast and Furious subpoena for months, and only voted to cite Attorney General [Eric] Holder for contempt 252 days after issuing its subpoena.""

Since 1975, according to the DOJ, ""committees and subcommittees have averaged 103 days between issuing a subpoena to an executive branch official and holding a contempt vote. By any measure, the committee rushed its decision and bears responsibility for the termination of the accommodation process.”

But in his letter, Nadler took issues with those characterizations.

""We cannot agree that the House’s sense of urgency here is 'premature and unnecessary,'"" Nadler wrote. ""It has been over 100 days since we first initiated the accommodations process on February 22, 2019. The pace with which we are proceeding is consistent with the exceptional urgency of this matter: an attack on our elections that was welcomed by our President and benefitted his campaign, followed by acts of obstruction by the President designed to interfere with the investigation of that attack. All of this misconduct was documented by the Special Counsel in the documents we now seek.""

In a statement, House Judiciary Committee ranking member Doug Collins, R-Ga., highlighted the DOJ's revelation that Nadler apparently signaled a willingness to work with the DOJ.

“After racing to hold Attorney General Barr in contempt, Chairman Nadler finally seems ready to join the Justice Department at the negotiating table,"" Collins said. ""When Judiciary Democrats wield subpoena power like a sword instead of a plow, their investigations bear little fruit. The House Intelligence Committee has shown us that working with the Justice Department in good faith yields documents. Abusing subpoena and contempt authority, however, has left the Judiciary Committee with little to show for its obsessively unreasonable demands.""

As for McGahn, the White House has instructed its former top lawyer not to testify, saying he is legally immune from being compelled to testify about privileged discussions occurring in the course of his official duties. Democrats have responded that McGahn waived that privilege by agreeing to speak to Mueller.

Trump did not assert executive privilege to shield any aspect of the Mueller report itself, and has derided Democrats' efforts as politically motivated attempts to keep what he's called the ""Russia collusion hoax"" alive -- and to distract from or derail -- Barr's own ongoing probes into Justice Department and FBI misconduct.

News of the planned contempt vote came days after Barr said he has not received answers from the intelligence community that were ""at all satisfactory"" in the early stages of his review into the origins of the Russia investigation. Last month, Barr appointed the U.S. attorney from Connecticut, John Durham, to lead the investigation, which is to focus on the use of FBI informants and the alleged improper issuance of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants to monitor a variety of individuals, including former Trump aide Carter Page.

A Barr contempt vote would be historic, but not unprecedented. In 2012, the GOP-controlled House's vote to hold the attorney general at that time, Holder, in contempt for failing to comply with investigations into the Obama administration's failed gun-running sting operation, ""Fast and Furious."" Holder became the first-ever sitting Cabinet member to be held in contempt of Congress in that manner.

The resolution scheduled for a June 11 floor vote would allow the Judiciary Committee to pursue civil action to seek enforcement of its subpoenas in federal court.

Such an approach would rule out so-called ""inherent contempt,"" a process in which Congress technically can enforce contempt citations on its own -- whether by arrest or fine. In May, Barr reportedly joked about that possibility with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, asking, ""Did you bring your handcuffs?""

Shanahan surprised many, including some lawmakers on Capitol Hill, when he announced in April that he had ordered a review into the investigation and its findings regarding military awards and punishments for those involved.

He decided not to recommend any further punishments. Politico first reported Shanahan's decision.

""Following an extensive investigation into the attack, the Department of Defense identified numerous areas for improvement and lessons learned to help prevent this type of incident from occurring again in the future. After a thorough review of those reports, Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan concurred with all of the findings, awards and accountability,"" Pentagon spokesperson Cdr. Candice Tresch said in a statement.

Shanahan tasked Gen. Robert Brown, the commander of US Army Pacific, with conducting an independent review of the findings of the military's months-long investigation into the incident. That review recommended that no changes be made and Shanahan approved the findings on May 29, the officials tell CNN.

Thousands of Brits Protest Trump’s Visit Alongside 16-Foot Farting Presidential Robot,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Jamie Ross'],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.thedailybeast.com/donald-trump-in-britain-thousands-of-brits-protest-presidents-visit-alongside-16-foot-farting-robot,"LONDON—Thousands of Brits took to the streets here Tuesday, where they marched alongside a 16-foot farting robot of Donald Trump and held aloft huge photos of John McCain in an attempt to trigger the president.

The protests—which saw thousands brave the typical British weather shielded by umbrellas emblazoned with anti-Trump slogans, EU flags, and the LGBTQ rainbow symbol—went within meters of Downing Street, where the president must have heard creatively foul-mouthed chants, although he still insists there have been no protests against him at all.

Protesters were kept away from the gates of Downing Street for Trump’s arrival and departure for talks with Theresa May. However, the thousands occupied a large stretch of central London, marching from Trafalgar Square past the government buildings of Whitehall and eventually arriving outside parliament to hear a speech by Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn.

As always, the protesters in Britain clearly put a lot of effort into their preparations to mock Trump. The most eye-catching part of the parade was a huge robotic statue named the Trump Dump, which featured the gigantic president atop a golden toilet, with a smartphone in his agitating hand. It emitted farting noises and the catchphrase “no collusion.”

“I wanted to honor him by showing him in all his glory,” the monster’s creator, Don Lessem, explained to The Daily Beast, claiming it cost him $25,000 of his own cash. “It’s 16 feet, which is the size of his ego. We wanted to match that. It needs to be a little more orange I think, but we tried to do it as proportionally accurate as possible, so his penis is three millimeters.”

Lessem’s ultimate goal is to crowdfund an effort to bring the robot to Washington, D.C. for the July 4 celebrations, but he was proud to give it its “world debut” to coincide with the president’s trip to London.

There were thousands of slightly less extravagant attempts to ridicule the president during his visit. On Monday, he dubiously claimed that he had been greeted by “tremendous crowds of well wishers” rather than protests and that there was “great love all around” on his first state visit.

On the contrary, the crowd couldn’t have displayed any more antipathy for him, even though there appeared to be smaller numbers than a huge protest against him last year. Signs showed various degrees of exasperation, ranging from the playful “Who invited this wally anyway?” to the frank “You’re a racist twat, mate,” to the laconic “Fuck this fucking fucker.”

One popular choice appeared to be showing images of the late Senator John McCain, following reports last week that the White House ordered the USS John S. McCain to be hidden from Trump’s sight in Japan.

Jeffrey Kaser Paradi explained to The Daily Beast: “I never thought I’d be holding a photograph of a Republican ever in my life, but after last week when the White House instructed the Navy to cover up the name of the battleship for fear of triggering Donald Trump. You know, I’d just hate for him to see an image of him on his trip here to the U.K..”

The protest was largely good-natured and police seemed relaxed. It was clear that the protest was also about Britain’s own political crises, with the anti-Trump marchers displaying a lot of support for the European Union and the pro-Trump marchers being very supportive of Brexit.

There were some scenes in the crowd that perhaps went slightly too far when the two sides clashed. One small, paper U.S. flag was torn from one pro-Trump marcher and stomped upon, while a Make America Great Again hat was snatched from the head of a Trump supporter and dumped in a fresh pile of dung left behind by one of the police horses.

But the anti-Trump marchers’ activity was largely limited to chants and songs, a lot of which were based on classic British music. For example, a somewhat predictable remix of Pink Floyd’s “Another Brick in the Wall” that replaced the word “brick” with something a little ruder.

Trump supporters were vastly outnumbered, largely white and male, and they were significantly angrier than the anti-Trump marchers. They marched with QAnon and anti-George Soros flags, were abusive toward rival protesters, and many proudly espoused extreme right-wing views.

One group calling itself Scots for Trump gathered at the protest with a big banner and were led by a well-known activist, Alistair McConnachie, who has previously made headlines in Scotland for denying that Jews were murdered in gas chambers in Nazi Germany. “That’s not something I would speak about because whenever you speak about it only gets yourself into hot water,” he told The Daily Beast when questioned about it.

McConnachie’s main beliefs appeared to be supporting Trump for “standing up very strongly for the principle of borders,” while also campaigning vociferously against Scottish independence. Asked why he supports a rigid border system between Mexico and the U.S. but argues so strongly against it between England and Scotland, his only attempt at an explanation was that the Scottish border “only exists in the imagination.”

During a press conference with May later Tuesday, Trump wrongly claimed there were “thousands of people” on the streets cheering him on both days of his visit so far and that he didn’t see any protesters. He does have supporters, but from Tuesday afternoon’s evidence they appeared to be nothing more than a handful of oddballs with extreme views.

Trump could be confused or, more likely, willfully wrong. But if he wants to see the evidence for himself he need only pop outside, with an umbrella."
Talks Between Democrats and Justice Dept. in Doubt Over Barr Contempt Vote,https://www.nytimes.com,['Nicholas Fandos'],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/04/us/politics/trump-hope-hicks-annie-donaldson.html,"Under subpoenas issued by the Judiciary Committee, the two witnesses had been instructed to deliver on Tuesday a range of documents related to their work in the White House, including notes and records related to some of Mr. Trump’s attempts to thwart federal investigators — attempts documented by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, in the report he completed in March.

Mr. Nadler said that Ms. Hicks, who also served as a top aide on Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign, did produce some documents related to her work before the election. He called it a “show of good faith,” though a copy of a letter from Ms. Hicks’s lawyer obtained by The New York Times says she handed over only four documents containing email chains.

In addition to documents, the subpoenas call for Ms. Hicks and Ms. Donaldson to testify publicly this month — and there was no indication on Tuesday whether they would comply. Mr. Nadler made clear his position that both were still expected to show up before the panel. Ms. Hicks has been subpoenaed to appear on June 19 and Ms. Donaldson on June 24.

[Read the Judiciary Committee subpoenas for Ms. Hicks and Ms. Donaldson.]

But there appears to be little chance either former aide will testify, bolstering the case made by a growing number of House Democrats that the president is actively obstructing another branch of government from doing its constitutionally sanctioned oversight function, and that impeachment proceedings are the only proportional response.

The White House issued similar instructions not to cooperate last month to Mr. McGahn, who had served as one of the most important witnesses in Mr. Mueller’s investigation into obstruction of justice. He ultimately did not produce a single document or appear for a hearing. If it does not alter course for the Justice Department, the House is poised to hold Mr. McGahn in contempt of Congress next week, as well, and take the dispute to court to try to enforce its subpoena — steps that could soon follow for Ms. Hicks and Ms. Donaldson if they do not show up to the Judiciary Committee’s hearings.

With potential star witnesses off limits and Mr. Mueller reluctant to testify, Democrats have for now been left to try to figure out other ways to bring Mr. Mueller’s 448-page report to life. On Monday, Mr. Nadler announced that his committee would hold a series of hearings on the report with former federal prosecutors, legal experts and John W. Dean, who went to jail for his role in the Watergate affair.

Republicans, who remain closely aligned with the president, have repeatedly accused Democrats of being less interested in the truth than in manufacturing a conflict with the White House that could provide a pretext for impeachment. They painted the possibility of new talks between the two sides on Tuesday as further evidence Democrats had been acting irresponsibly."
"DOJ doesn't need to provide transcript of key Flynn phone call after all, judge rules",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-doesnt-need-to-provide-transcript-of-key-flynn-phone-call-after-all-judge-rules,"A federal judge said Tuesday that the Department of Justice no longer has to publicly file a transcript of a fateful phone call between former national security adviser Michael Flynn and the Russian ambassador to the United States, an abrupt and unexplained reversal from his previous order last month

The development comes as Republicans allege that a separate court-ordered transcript release in the case showed that Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report contained a conspicuously -- and allegedly deceptive -- edited version of a voicemail message from former Trump lawyer John Dowd to Flynn's lawyer, Rob Kelner.

U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan had previously directed prosecutors to release details of a December 2016 call in which Flynn discussed sanctions with Sergey Kislyak, then the Russian envoy to Washington.

EX-TRUMP LAWYER SLAMS MUELLER REPORT AS 'FRAUD,' CITES MISLEADING QUOTE

Sullivan had also given government attorneys until May 31 to produce redacted portions of Mueller's report that relate to Flynn as well as a transcript of a phone message a lawyer for Trump left for Flynn's attorney after Flynn had decided to start cooperating with prosecutors.

On Friday, prosecutors publicly filed the transcript of the call between the lawyers and said all of the information in the report that Flynn had provided had been unredacted. But they declined to produce a transcript of Flynn's call with Kislyak, saying they were not relying on that conversation to establish his guilt or to determine his sentence.

In a brief written order Tuesday, Sullivan said that ""upon consideration of the government's submissions in response to those orders, the government is not required to file any additional materials or information on the public docket."" He did not elaborate on why he had changed his mind, and apparently left open the possibility he might order the documents to be produced under seal in the future.

Flynn is awaiting sentencing before Sullivan after pleading guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI about his contact with Kislyak. He was supposed to be sentenced in December, but midway through the hearing, took the judge up on his offer to postpone it so that he could continue cooperating with prosecutors and earn credit toward a lighter sentence.

MUELLER REPORT REVEALS FLYNN WAS UNDER INVESTIGATION FAR EARLIER THAN PREVIOUSLY REPORTED

Meanwhile, Republicans have focused renewed attention on the transcript that was released Friday. Dowd, Trump's ex-lawyer, left the voicemail message for Kelner after Flynn exited a joint-defense agreement and agreed to cooperate with Mueller. Mueller's team analyzed the message as part of their inquiry into whether President Trump obstructed justice.

According to the Mueller report, Dowd said: ""I understand your situation, but let me see if I can’t state it in starker terms ... [I]t wouldn’t surprise me if you’ve gone on to make a deal with ... the government ... [I]f ... there's information that implicates the President, then we've got a national security issue ... so, you know ... we need some kind of heads up. Um, just for the sake of protecting all our interests if we can ... [R]emember what we’ve always said about the President and his feelings toward Flynn and, that still remains.""

But the full transcript revealed Dowd made clear he was not seeking confidential information -- and raised questions as to why Mueller would have omitted apparently exculpatory information. The transcript excerpt in the Mueller report attracted substantial press attention at the time.

The full quote reads, with emphasis added: ""Hey, Rob, uhm, this is John again. Uh, maybe, I-I-I-‘m-I’m sympathetic; I understand your situation, but let me see if I can’t … state it in … starker terms. If you have … and it wouldn’t surprise me if you’ve gone on to make a deal with, and, uh, work with the government, uh … I understand that you can’t join the joint defense; so that’s one thing. If, on the other hand, we have, there’s information that … implicates the President, then we’ve got a national security issue, or maybe a national security issue, I don’t know … some issue, we got to-we got to deal with, not only for the President, but for the country. So … uh … you know, then-then, you know, we need some kind of heads up. Um, just for the sake of … protecting all our interests, if we can, without you having to give up any … confidential information. So, uhm, and if it’s the former, then, you know, remember what we’ve always said about the President and his feelings toward Flynn and, that still remains, but — Well, in any event, uhm, let me know, and, uh, I appreciate your listening and taking the time. Thanks, Pal.""

Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., called for the release of “all backup and source information” for the Mueller report on Friday following the revelation of the edited transcript, and Dowd told Fox News the Mueller report was a ""fraud.""

Former Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, meanwhile, asserted on Fox News' ""Hannity"" Monday night that the quotation was ""distorted.""

""This is a very, very serious issue,"" he said. ""The distortion of the Dowd quote is very serious. Especially since, remember, that a report by a special counsel is always going to be one-sided. Therefore, you have to trust it.""

"Democrats grill FBI, DHS officials on white supremacy threat",https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/lawmakers-grill-trump-administration-officials-white-supremacy-threat/story?id=63478001,"House Democrats grilled officials from the FBI and Department of Homeland Security in a Tuesday hearing focused on how the Trump administration is addressing the growing threat of violent white supremacist extremists.

The House Oversight subcommittee on civil rights and civil liberties hearing, titled 'Confronting White Supremacy: Adequacy of the Federal Response,' was the latest effort by Democrats to spotlight ways they say the Trump administration has systematically cut back on resources used to address threats from domestic extremists even as the FBI has reported a 30-40% rise in domestic terrorism cases just since October.

Federal officials in attendance at Tuesday's hearing included FBI Assistant Director for Counterterrorism Michael McGarrity, FBI Deputy Assistant Director for Criminal Investigations Calvin Shivers and DHS Assistant Secretary Elizabeth Neumann.

Committee chairman Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., opened the hearing by raising issue with the amount of resources he says the FBI devotes towards investigating cases of international terrorism versus domestic terrorism.

Citing figures from the Anti-Defamation League, Raskin noted that from 2009-2018, far-right extremism was responsible for 73% of extremist murders, while international terrorism was responsible for 23% of terrorism deaths.

""The FBI has testified the bureau allocates its resources almost exactly backwards than the problem would suggest,"" Raskin said. ""Devoting 80% of field agents to stopping international terrorism including Islamic extremism and only 20% to stopping domestic terrorism including far right and white supremacist extremism.""

But McGarrity pointed to the success that FBI agents have so far had in disrupting potential domestic attacks in the past several months, and said successful arrests prior to domestic attacks actually outnumbered those arrested prior to attacks in international terror cases.

""In fiscal year 2018 FBI (Joint Terrorism Task Forces) across the country proactively arrested approximately 115 subjects of FBI domestic terrorism investigations before they could mobilize into violence,"" McGarrity said. ""So far (since Oct. 1 of last year), our JTTFs have disrupted approximately 66 subjects of FBI domestic terrorism investigations by arrest.""

Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, D-Fla., pressed Neumann on a report that the department recently disbanded and slashed funding for a section of the Office of Intelligence and Analysis, which focused on producing reports on domestic terrorism and which Democrats warn could result in a reduction of available data on threats from white supremacist groups.

Neumann countered that the funding dedicated to the department was only inflated due to millions in grant funding committed during the Obama administration, but later in the hearing gave a candid assessment regarding DHS' overall counterterrorism strategy, saying that the administration is actively working to find ways to improve its prevention strategy.

""We know we're not doing enough,"" Neumann said. ""Things haven't been institutionalized. In order for government to work, we have to institutionalize it, you either need to authorize it through Congress or you need to get it in executive order or national security presidential memoranda.""

House Homeland Security Committee, FILE

Following the terror attack on several mosques in New Zealand in March carried out by an alleged white supremacist, President Donald Trump told reporters he didn't see white nationalism as a rising threat to the U.S.

The hearing followed a briefing just two weeks earlier from a senior FBI counterterrorism official who gave sobering statistics to reporters regarding the domestic threat environment.

The official revealed the FBI currently has a total of just under 5,000 open terrorism cases, including 850 domestic terror-related cases, and acknowledged that far more Americans have been killed in domestic terror attacks than Islamic terror attacks since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.

According to the official, a significant issue that the bureau faces is that the federal criminal code has made it more challenging to bring charges against domestic terror suspects than in cases involving international terrorism or foreign terrorist organizations.

That's because, according to the FBI Agents Association, ""domestic terrorism"" itself is not a federal crime.

""Domestic terrorism is about political violence,"" Tom O'Connor, the president of the FBI Agents Association said in a statement to ABC News. ""Congress must do everything in its power to provide law enforcement with the tools needed to combat this threat to our country.""

Investigators often are forced to rely on other federal crimes to charge suspects with or rely on state or local laws, such as in the recent case of Coast Guard Lt. Christopher Hasson, who despite being accused in court of plotting mass murder ""on a scale rarely seen in this country,"" is currently facing only gun and drug charges from U.S. attorneys in Maryland.

And while then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions initially described the Charlottesville, Virginia attack by James Fields Jr., which resulted in the death of Heather Heyer, as ""the definition of domestic terrorism,"" Fields in March pleaded guilty to 29 counts of violating federal hate crime law.

The issue surfaced in a contentious exchange between Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and McGarrity, where McGarrity was pressed on why the 2015 Emanuel AME Church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, and last year's Tree of Life Synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh were treated as ""hate crime incidents"" rather than acts of domestic terrorism.

""That's not correct,"" McGarrity said, pointing out that while the attacks are considered instances of domestic terrorism by the Department of Justice, ""there's no domestic terrorism charge.""

In an emotional exchange on the subject later in the hearing, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-MI, read a death threat letter sent to her and fellow Muslim congresswoman Rep. Ilhan Omar that cited the New Zealand mosque attacks and remarked, ""the only good Muslim is a dead one.""

""How is that not enough to fall under domestic terrorism?"" Tlaib said through tears. ""How come we don't have enough tools right now to pull these people in?""

McGarrity expressed sympathy for Tlaib and urged her to bring her concerns directly to the Department of Justice, after earlier noting he personally would welcome Congress passing a law that makes domestic terrorism a federal crime.

“I will say as a former prosecutor and as a former investigator, I want every tool in the tool box,” McGarrity said."

Does VA have a secret wait list for health care? Key members of Congress want to know.,https://www.houstonchronicle.com,"['Joe Davidson', 'The Washington Post', 'Jordan Blum', 'Staff Writer', 'Chris Tomlinson', 'Mick Lasalle', 'Nicole Hensley', 'Chandler Rome']",06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/article/Does-VA-have-a-secret-wait-list-for-health-care-13938065.php,"WASHINGTON - Key members of Congress want the Trump administration to address charges of a ""secret"" Veterans Affairs wait list that has a higher number of patients seeking medical care than information publicly available.

Allegations about significantly different data regarding veterans awaiting treatment on internal and public records were made by Jereme P. Whiteman, VA's national director of clinic practice management, in a Washington Post Federal Insider column published online Monday.

The article reported on a letter he sent to VA Secretary Robert Wilkie last week that said, ""In September last year I discovered a secret VA wait list. I disclosed this wait list within my VHA chain of command. Since that date I have been retaliated against by officials within my chain of command. Furthermore, the agency has taken steps to conceal this wait list from the public.""

The monthly number of veterans awaiting care on the internal list is about three times greater than the numbers on the public list.

A VA spokesman said Whiteman's allegations are false. ""VA's electronic wait list (EWL) has two components - one administrative and one clinical,"" said Curt Cashour, the department's press secretary.

The clinical number is public and shows the number of veterans waiting for medical care. ""The administrative component of the EWL has nothing to do with waits for medical treatment,"" he added, ""and tracks routine actions, such as facility and provider transfer requests.""

Top Democrats on the House and Senate veterans' affairs committees are not satisfied with that response.

In a letter sent Tuesday to Wilkie, Rep. Mark Takano, D-Calif., chairman of the House committee, and Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, the ranking Democrat on the Senate panel, said Cashour's explanation ""is, at best, confusing.""

""We, therefore, ask VA to provide - by the end of this week - a more thorough explanation for the existence of two sets of reports on wait time for veterans' health care. In fulfilling this request, VA should provide the House and Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs with the reports described by the article and the appropriate VA officials should make themselves available for a briefing to the Committees.""

A statement from the office of Rep. Phil Roe of Tennessee, the top Republican on the House panel, said, ""Dr. Roe has asked VA about these allegations and will continue looking into them.""

Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-Va., chairman of the House Oversight and Reform subcommittee on government operations, said the ""allegations of a secret internal wait list for veterans - that exceeds the public wait list by three-fold - are deeply disturbing. . . . Congress must get to the bottom of these claims by verifying the accuracy of these internal VA documents and ensuring transparency and accountability for our nation's veterans and the American people.""

Connolly praised whistleblowers and said they ""must be protected"" against reprisals by managers. In addition to reporting his charges about the dual wait lists with VA's Office of the Medical Inspector and the department's Office of Inspector General, Whiteman has filed retaliation complaints with the VA whistleblower protection office and the Office of Special Counsel, which protects whistleblowers across the government.

Inspector General Michael Missal said his office received Whiteman's information and is considering the next steps for his office.

In one example of retaliation, Whiteman said he led a team that implemented a text messaging system to remind patients of their appointments. It cut the number of missed sessions and saved the department millions of dollars. Although he was the team leader, he was the only member who did not get a performance award for the project.

Whiteman's allegations come five years after a national uproar over phony wait lists rocked the VA. That scandal pushed then-VA Secretary Eric Shinseki from office and led to a series of agency reforms. Robert McDonald, who followed Shinseki in office, apologized to veterans in September 2014 congressional testimony and promised to rebuild trust.

He said the VA increased primary care staffing, developed an automated system for tracking new patients and contacted 266,000 veterans ""to get them off wait lists and into clinics.""

On Tuesday, Cashour said the VA now is ""seeing more patients than ever before, more quickly than before."" According to Cashour:

- VA completed more than 58 million internal appointments in fiscal 2018, 623,000 more than the previous year.

- All VA health care facilities now provide same-day services in primary and mental health.

- VA is posting online wait times for every one of its medical centers across the country, and they are updated weekly.

- Regularly updated access data are available online for all VA medical centers and community-based outpatient clinics.

""Veterans are more satisfied with wait times,"" Cashour said, ""than they have been previously."""

Even after spending a year and a half in prison in Tehran, I knew that if I wanted to go on writing about Iran, I would be a target for plenty of public attacks despite the abuse I had suffered at the hands of the Islamic Republic. And so it has been.

But I never imagined the U.S. State Department would be funding my attackers.

Last week, several astute Iran watchers drew attention to a series of inflammatory tweets associated with the Iran Disinformation Project, a State Department-funded initiative that its website claims “brings to light disinformation emanating from the Islamic Republic of Iran via official rhetoric, state propaganda outlets, social media manipulation and more.”

So the @StateDept uses taxpayer money to fund online attacks on @HRW because the organization is researching the human cost of US sanctions in #Iran.



Is this even legal? https://t.co/PGVuizRq93 — Negar Mortazavi (@NegarMortazavi) May 30, 2019

What other @StateDept funded organizations claiming to promote democracy in #Iran are using taxpayer money to harass, intimidate, threaten and slander American journalists & academics?

Follow the money folks. — Farnaz Fassihi (@farnazfassihi) May 31, 2019

On Friday, in response to the complaints, the State Department suspended the initiative’s funding “until the implementer takes necessary steps to ensure that any future activity remains within the agreed scope of work,” a department official said.

One of the “steps” thus far has been to delete many of the tweets in question. But that is hardly sufficient.

Ironically, the Iran Disinformation Project was funded by the State Department’s Global Engagement Center, which was begun to combat online extremism and propaganda.

The targets of the tweets included think-tank analysts, human rights activists and journalists (including me). The common thread is that we are all perceived by regime change proponents and supporters of the Trump administration’s so-called maximum pressure policy to be soft on Iran because we are critical of crushing economic sanctions and the threat of the use of military force against it.

For these thought crimes, we are branded by @IranDisinfo and similar social media accounts as Tehran’s “mouthpieces,” “apologists,” “collaborators,” and “lobbyists” in the West.

I won’t speak for others who have been attacked, and my own views are irrelevant to this situation. From what I can see, though, we all appear to share the view that Iran should be secular and democratic. The main difference between us and those spreading these falsehoods against us is how we envision that change in Iranian politics coming about.

As a matter of principle, I try to avoid impeding anyone else’s right to free expression — even when it’s used to attack me. If a claim against me is demonstrably false, I will state it clearly and openly. Yet, I believe it’s important to allow others — even faceless ones hiding behind anonymous social media accounts — the opportunity to criticize me, my work and my credentials. It’s part of what you sign up for when you take this job.

I also openly acknowledge that others who have been abused by Iran (such as me) have the right to hold whatever political positions they choose and the right to defend and promote them passionately. Yes, even if it means they advocate war or sanctions directed at the people of that country. They have their views and I have mine.

Slander and libel are a different story, however, and @IranDisinfo may have crossed the line.

What Bahman Kalbasi, one of the #IranDisinfo mouthpieces in @BBC doesn't tell you, is that the number of Jews in #Iran before the Islamic Revolution was around 100K. After the mass executions, assassinations, and confiscation of properties, now the number is less than 10K. https://t.co/rfhb6kwFk1 — IranDisinfo (@IranDisinfo) May 28, 2019

In the past 16 months, thousands of protestors have been arrested in #Iran, and most are anonymous. @sepehrifar of @hrw, a supporter of so-called Moderates within the regime, instead of documenting+proving these human rights violations, is working hard to prove @JZarif's claims. https://t.co/CvWzqULihT — IranDisinfo (@IranDisinfo) April 25, 2019

So we’re faced with the irony that an initiative aimed at combating Tehran’s disinformation campaigns is resorting to disinformation campaigns of its own, using taxpayer funds to spread lies about U.S. citizens. We need programs that fight the spread of falsehoods and propaganda, but such efforts shouldn’t combat lies with other lies — and certainly not with public funding.

This is just one more small incident in the long moment of reckoning our democracy is facing. It will pass quickly, but it’s an important stress test.

How can individuals who are not willing to adhere to the norms of American civil society be entrusted with resources to promote civil society in other countries?

The State Department can easily fix the problem. It needs to perform a transparent assessment of who received the funding and why. Once the facts are clear, the grant should be terminated.

Transparency and accountability are fundamental to the rule of law. Anyone who claims otherwise cannot be entrusted with taxpayer money to promote American ideals — at home or abroad.

At the heart of the matter lies a fundamental question: Do we support our long-cherished ideals of democratic fair play or the “by any means necessary” approach that is becoming more prevalent in the current political climate?

Put personal politics aside for a moment and look back through history. Do peddlers of disinformation contribute or detract from our health as a society? The answer is obvious, and the State Department should take a clear stance on the side of honest and responsible discourse.

If the State Department declines to address the issue, Congress should investigate.

EPA sued for keeping scientists off advisory committees,https://thehill.com,[],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/446897-epa-sued-for-keeping-scientists-off-of-advisory-committees,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was reportedly sued on Monday by a nonprofit over a directive keeping many scientists off of agency advisory panels, according to Reuters.

The suit, filed in Manhattan federal court by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), alleges that an Oct. 31, 2017, directive from former EPA chief Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott PruittEPA sued for keeping scientists off advisory committees EPA sued for keeping scientists off advisory committees Overnight Energy: EPA head accuses media of not reporting agency's achievements | Leaked FDA study finds cancer-linked chemicals in food supply | Wheeler calls Flint water 'safe to drink' MORE overturned decades of EPA practices “for no good reason” and without required public comment.

The NRDC claimed that the directive has been used to remove qualified scientists from the agency's roughly 23 advisory committees, allowing EPA to replace scientific advisers with industry representatives, Reuters reported.

The nonprofit environmental advocacy group seeks to set aside the directive and all decisions that have been based on it.

A spokesperson for the EPA told The Hill it does not comment on pending litigation.

Pruitt's 2017 directive bars anyone who receives EPA grant money from serving on advisory panels, citing a need for the committees to be more independent.

The former EPA chief, who resigned in July 2018 amid a growing number of ethics and spending scandals, argued that serving on a committee like the Science Advisory Board would be a conflict of interest for someone receiving agency money to conduct scientific research.

“We want to ensure that there’s integrity in the process, and that the scientists who are advising us are doing so with not any type of appearance of conflict,"" Pruitt said at the time. ""And when you receive that much money … there’s a question that arises about independence.""

Opponents countered that Pruitt wanted to increase representation from the fossil fuel industry and other Trump administration allies on the influential committees.

Since the directive took effect, representation for regulated industries and their allies has grown on the committees, at the expense of academics and researchers, The Hill reported in February.

A legal challenge to the directive fell short that month.

Judge Trevor McFadden, a Trump appointee to the District Court for the District of Columbia, dismissed the lawsuit from public health groups, saying it does not dictate who can be appointed to advisory boards.

The laws and regulations at issue “do not dictate whom administrators must, or even should, appoint to federal advisory committees,” McFadden wrote in a ruling dismissing the case.

“To say that certain individuals may not serve is very different than saying that the rest must serve,"" he wrote. ""Agency heads retain substantial discretion to determine membership on federal advisory committees.”"

Treasury officials also said travel permissions would be denied for private and corporate aircraft and boats, though commercial flights would continue. “Cuba continues to play a destabilizing role in the Western Hemisphere, providing a communist foothold in the region and propping up U.S. adversaries in places like Venezuela and Nicaragua by fomenting instability, undermining the rule of law, and suppressing democratic processes,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said. “It kills the people-to-people category, which is the most common way for the average American to travel to Cuba,” Collin Laverty, head of Cuba Educational Travel, one of the largest Cuba travel companies in the U.S., told the AP."

After a day of pomp and pageantry involving the British royals, Tuesday was a day for politics and protests. Trump had meetings at Downing Street, and protesters were hoping that they were close enough — and loud enough — to be heard.

The road outside 10 Downing Street was sealed off with steel barricades, and there was a heavy police presence.

But nearby, the “Carnival of Resistance” was in full swing in on-off rain.

In a news conference Tuesday with outgoing prime minister Theresa May, Trump dismissed the protests. “Even coming over today, there were thousands of people cheering,” he asserted. “A lot of it is fake news, I have to say.”

He added: “I didn’t see the protesters until just a little while ago. And it was a very, very small group of people put in for political reasons. So it was fake news.”

Activists estimated 75,000 people hit the streets Tuesday — fewer than those at the anti-Trump rally in 2018, which organizers said drew more than 100,000.

But the protesters were vocal, their chants — including “Say it loud, say it clear! Donald Trump’s not welcome here!” and “Donald Trump, shame on you!” — ringing in the air as reporters headed to the news conference.

“We come today because we don’t like the tide of right-wing populism that’s going across the Western world, especially in America and Europe,” said Cat Thorneycroft, 35, an illustrator. “I don’t even necessarily mind that he’s had a state visit, but if he’s going to come, then this is what’s going to happen,” she said, referring to the protesters behind her in Parliament Square.

Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, was among those who addressed the crowds. He condemned Trump’s tweets calling London Mayor Sadiq Khan, a longtime Trump foe on Twitter, a “stone cold loser.” Corbyn said he was “proud that our city has a Muslim mayor.”

Trump also denounced Corbyn, calling him a “negative force.”

The Labour leader also said he would resist any attempts to allow private American companies to take over “our precious, wonderful National Health Service. . . . We will not stand for that.”

Trump tweeted Monday that he had not “seen any protests yet, but I’m sure the Fake News will be working hard to find them.” The main protests were planned for Tuesday.

The world’s most famous helium-filled balloon — the 20-foot-tall blimp depicting a baby Trump holding a cellphone — was back, hovering above the scene in Parliament Square.

Kevin Smith, one of the organizers and “Trump babysitters,” said it was a “very effective way to prick the pomposity and ego of Donald Trump.”

[As Trump’s state visit looms, Britain seems a reluctant host]

Asked whether it wasn’t a rather juvenile form of protest, he said it was “part of a long tradition in Britain of political caricature. It’s not unlike cartoons in a newspaper — it just so happens to be 3-D and floats in the air.”

The organizers of the balloon crowdfunded more than 36,00 pounds ($46,000), which they are giving to groups they describe as “pushing back against the politics of hate and division that are represented by Trump.”

There was also a talking Trump robot that sat on a toilet, saying: “You’re fake news! I’m a very stable genius!”

The British tradition of creating witty — and sometimes rude — placards was on full display. One protester held aloft a sign that read: “British Humour: the gift of a book to an illiterate man — well played Your Majesty.” As part of a customary gift exchange at the start of the visit, Queen Elizabeth II gave Trump a book by Winston Churchill on World War II.

Another man was pushing a shopping cart filled with toilet paper featuring Trump’s face on it. “Come on down to Trafalgar and get your Donald Trump toilet paper,” he said.

Footage posted on social media showed supporters and critics clashing at the rally. In one video, a Trump supporter was surrounded by people angrily shouting “Nazi scum!” before he was pelted with a milkshake.

The protests come a day after a lavish state banquet hosted by the queen at Buckingham Palace.

Bryony Doyle, 23, an illustrator and a nanny protesting in Trafalgar Square, said she was “very pleased” that Trump did not “get the red-carpet treatment when he arrived. I know he went for dinner at Buckingham Palace, but he didn’t stay there,” she said.

[The long and bitter feud between Trump and London Mayor Sadiq Khan]

The Trumps are staying at Winfield House, the residence of the U.S. ambassador in London, but not Buckingham Palace, which would normally be the case. The palace is reportedly undergoing renovations.

“I think with us and our culture there’s only so much we can do without feeling impolite,” Doyle said. “I don’t think the queen could actually say no. I think there’s a limit to what the royals can do without causing too much controversy. But that’s not the case with the public, which is why we are here all day!”

Some wondered whether the protests would have any effect.

Mark Davis, 64, a lawyer from California on vacation, said: “Trump could come here and do virtually anything and there are people back in the States who will support him. They’d think he’s being picked on, or this and that. I don’t think this changes anything. In the States, you’re either for him or against him.”

His wife, Monica Richards, 65, a retired employee of Orange County Superior Court in California, said they were nonetheless excited to be among a throng of “like people who have a great hate for Trump. It’s an opportunity to show our support for the forces who are against him.”

She then unrolled a homemade pink sign that read, “Impeach now.”

Warren calls for replacing Commerce Department in jobs plan,https://www.foxnews.com,"[""Andrew O'Reilly""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/warren-commerce-department-in-latest-policy-proposal,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., on Tuesday called for doing away with the Department of Commerce and several other smaller agencies, and replacing them with a new department responsible for creating new jobs.

Warren, who currently sits in the middle of the pack in a crowded field of Democratic presidential contenders, wrote in a post on Medium that this new department would have “the sole responsibility to create and defend quality, sustainable American job.”

“The new Department — the Department of Economic Development — will replace the Commerce Department, subsume other agencies like the Small Business Administration and the Patent and Trademark Office, and include research and development programs, worker training programs, and export and trade authorities like the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative,” Warren wrote.

She added: “The new Department will have a single goal: creating and defending good American jobs.”

2020 DEMOCRATS TAKE AIM AT BIDEN AT CALIFORNIA CONVENTION

Warren’s new proposal is part of her ""economic patriotism"" agenda – one of a series of ambitious policy proposals that have become a trademark of her campaign – and comes ahead of her first campaign tour of Michigan. The state, which was once a Democratic stronghold, went to President Trump in the 2016 presidential election – largely thanks to Trump’s appeal with blue-collar workers in the state’s manufacturing base.

Warren’s visit to Detroit and Lansing, and her economic proposal, are both aimed squarely at Midwesterners who have watched millions of manufacturing jobs disappear in recent decades.

“My Administration will pursue fundamental, structural changes in our government’s approach to the economy, finally putting American workers and middle-class prosperity ahead of multinational profits and Wall Street bonuses,” she wrote on Medium.

The Trump campaign mocked Warren's call for ""economic patriotism"" as a recycled Obama idea.

But it's also unclear how Warren would turn some of her most costly policies into reality, especially if Democrats don't win back control of the Senate in next year's elections. The last time Congress approved a significant new Cabinet-level department was 2002, when the Department of Homeland Security was created. And the $2 trillion price tag of Warren's clean energy manufacturing plan would prompt plenty of Republican critics.

That plank of her agenda is directly tied to the Green New Deal, a framework for dramatically cutting the nation's dependence on fossil fuels that's championed by rising liberal star Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.

WARREN THE LATEST 2020 DEMOCRAT TO LAND ON TIME MAGAZINE COVER

As outlined in her Green Manufacturing Plan for America – another policy proposal she released on Tuesday – Warren would pay for her program with proceeds from her proposed new tax on corporate profits and by ending tax subsidies for oil and gas companies and rolling back some provisions of the GOP's 2017 tax law.

“According to the independent Moody’s analysis of my plan, nearly its entire cost is covered by my Real Corporate Profits Tax — a tax that ensures that the very largest and most profitable American corporations don’t pay zero corporate income tax — ending federal oil and gas subsidies, and closing corporate tax loopholes that promote moving good jobs overseas,” Warren wrote.

Warren is betting that her campaign pledges will power her forward with Midwestern swing voters who are open to deserting Trump. Her clean manufacturing plan comes hours after another Democratic contender, former Vice President Joe Biden, released his own Green New Deal-linked agenda, which would spend $1.7 trillion over 10 years.

Biden is perceived as a threat to Trump in the Midwest, but Michigan Democrats see ample room for Warren to break through in a state that's twice elected women to its highest office. And although Warren burnished her reputation as an advocate for the working class by criticizing the bailout of Wall Street banks while serving as a watchdog of the government's 2008 financial rescue, she spoke more favorably at that time of the agreement that spent billions of dollars to keep U.S. automakers afloat, a position she is sure to highlight in Michigan.

""Wages have not grown, and people look at layoffs being imminent or threatened, not just in the auto industry,"" said former Michigan Democratic Party chairman, Mark Brewer. ""They're looking for somebody on their side, who understands their problems. Why Trump had such appeal in 2016 was that he tapped into that economic anxiety.""

Dossier author Christopher Steele willing to meet with DOJ inspector general team,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/dossier-author-christopher-steele-willing-to-meet-with-doj-inspector-general-team,"Christopher Steele is reportedly willing to be interviewed by the Justice Department inspector general's team that is conducting an investigation into alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuses.

The British ex-spy, whose unverified dossier was used to obtain surveillance against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, has agreed to meet with U.S. officials if they come to London where he lives and runs an investigative firm called Orbis Business Intelligence, a source told the Sunday Times in the United Kingdom.

Steele is only willing to talk about his relationship with the FBI, for whom he was a confidential source, and wants the U.S. to get permission from the U.K. government first. The report came out as President Trump is in the country for a state visit.

As recently as April it was reported that Steele declined to meet with Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s team due to concerns about being undermined. Although he is coming around, Steele still appears dead set against meeting with officials connected to Attorney General William Barr’s investigation into the origins of the Russia investigation, led by U.S. Attorney John Durham.

Trump’s presidential order in late May stated that Barr was given “full and complete authority to declassify information” and ordered the intelligence community “to quickly and fully cooperate with the Attorney General’s investigation into surveillance activities during the 2016 presidential election.” Barr, who has been working closely with Horowitz, said he picked Durham because he “was looking for someone who is tenacious, who is used to looking at sensitive material involving government activities, who has a reputation for being fair and evenhanded.”

The report says if Steele does take question from U.S. investigators, he would retain representation from a top American attorney for around £30,000, which is about $38,128.

The Washington Examiner has reached out to Orbis for comment.

The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year that Horowitz has been asking witnesses about the FBI’s treatment of information provided by Steele, described as a “key source” for the FBI. Horowitz has been looking into potential Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse since early 2018 and is reportedly “homing in” on the potential misuse of Steele’s unverified dossier by the Justice Department and FBI.

Last week, Barr said that Horowitz is “looking at a discrete area … which is the use of electronic surveillance that was targeted at Carter Page.” Durham’s investigation is much broader.

Steele cooperated with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and submitted written testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee for its Russia inquiry.

Steele’s dossier, which was packed with unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia, formed a key part of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications that were used to justify surveillance warrants against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. Steele was working for Fusion GPS, which received funding through the Perkins Coie law firm from the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee. Steele's Democratic benefactors were not revealed to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.

According to a report from April, the FBI reached out to some of Steele’s foreign sources in an attempt to determine their credibility, and as early as January 2017 agents had concluded that some of the dossier’s contents may have been based on rumors. The agents believed that some of Steele’s information may have even been based on Russian disinformation.

Barr said last month that “it’s a very unusual situation to have opposition research like that — especially one that on its face had a number of clear mistakes and a somewhat jejune analysis.”

Barr’s criticisms of the Steele dossier’s flaws come as former FBI Director James Comey, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, and former FBI General Counsel James Baker have all defended their handling of the dossier in recent weeks.

Barr previously said that Horowitz’s investigation would be completed by the end of June, and Fox News host Sean Hannity said on Monday evening that sources were telling him that the Justice Department inspector general report might already be in Barr’s hands."

A new deal between the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission will see U.S. regulators divide and conquer as they expand their oversight of Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook, according to multiple reports.

New details have emerged of an agreement between the two U.S. regulators that would see the Federal Trade Commission take the reins in antitrust investigations of Amazon and Facebook, while the Department of Justice will oversee investigations of Alphabet’s Google business and Apple.

Shares of Apple’s stock tumbled on news of the Justice Department’s role in overseeing the company, which was first reported by Reuters even as the company was in the middle of its developer conference celebrating all things Apple.

Google has been here before. Eight years ago, the Federal Trade Commission began an investigation into Google for antitrust violations, ultimately determining that the company had not violated any antitrust or anti-competitive statutes in its display of search results.

On Friday, The Washington Post reported that the Justice Department was initiating a federal antitrust investigation into Google’s business practices, according to multiple sources.

DOJ calls new census allegations a 'baseless attack on the integrity' of department and its employees,https://www.cnn.com,"['Ariane De Vogue', 'Tammy Kupperman']",06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/03/politics/doj-census-allegations/index.html,"(CNN) The Department of Justice on Monday night forcefully disputed an account by the American Civil Liberties Union, Common Cause and others that the decision to add a citizenship question to the census was politically motivated.

A Justice Department spokesperson says the allegations that a 2015 study by a Republican redistricting expert played a major role in the request to add a citizenship question to the census are meritless.

In a letter last week, the ACLU, Common Cause and others said they had found ""new evidence"" that the government's true motivation in adding the question was to improve the chances of Republicans.

They pointed to a recently disclosed 2015 study written by Dr. Thomas Hofeller, a Republican redistricting expert, who wrote that using ""citizen voting age"" population as the redistricting population base would be ""advantageous to Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites.""

The challengers say the new information shows Hofeller played a more significant role in the decision to add the citizenship question than has been disclosed and that his study reveals the true motive behind the administration's decision to add the question. Meanwhile, challengers in a separate case in Maryland, citing the Hofeller evidence, asked a federal judge on Tuesday to reopen their case to reconsider whether the Trump administration sought to intentionally discriminate against Latinos and immigrants.

"Illinois Corn Planting Is Not Even Halfway Finished, USDA Says",https://www.agriculture.com,[],06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.agriculture.com/news/crops/illinois-corn-planting-is-not-even-halfway-finished-usda-says,"DES MOINES, Iowa — U.S. corn farmers are still trying to get to the three-quarters planted mark, continuing their slowest pace on record.

Corn

In its Crop Progress Report Monday, the USDA pegged U.S. corn planting at 67% complete, behind the 96% five-year average.

Some in the trade expected a completion rating of 70%. This would suggest 27 million acres of corn will be planted the first time in the month of June, and possibly 1 to 2 million acres of corn will need to be replanted in June, according to Kluis Advisors’ records.

As of Sunday, Iowa farmers had 80% of that state’s corn crop planted vs. a 99% five-year average. Illinois farmers have 45% of their corn seeded, behind a 98% five-year average. Indiana has 31% planted vs. a 94% five-year average. In the eastern Corn Belt, Nebraska farmers have 88% of their corn planted vs. a 98% five-year average.

Also, 19% of the U.S. corn has 46% emerged vs. a 84% five-year average.

Soybeans

In its report, the USDA pegged the U.S. soybean planting completion rate at 39% vs. a 79% five-year average.

Iowa has 41% of its soybean crop in the ground compared with an 89% five-year average. Illinois has 21% of its crop seeded, compared with an 84% five-year average. Indiana soybean growers have 17% of their crop in the ground vs. an 80% five-year average.

The Trump Administration Might Be Too Incompetent to Undermine Environmental Regulations,https://slate.com,['Richard L. Revesz'],06-03-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/technology/2019/06/trump-administration-cant-actually-undermine-environmental-regulation-too-incompetent.html,"Photo illustration by Slate. Photos by Nivellen77/iStock / Getty Images Plus and Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images.

The Trump administration appears to be entering an alarming new stage of its attack on environmental protection. For the past two-plus years, it has used a retail approach, targeting Obama-era environmental rules one by one, trying to suspend compliance deadlines. This strategy has been met with limited success—more than 90 percent of the administration’s deregulatory efforts are being defeated in court, mostly due to sloppy agency actions. But the Environmental Protection Agency has recently decided it will undertake a new approach in its effort to launch a wholesale attack on environmental regulation—it will change the way it collects and processes data, to provide better justification to dismantle the analytical foundation of its rules. These moves fly in the face of established economics and health sciences, and are inconsistent with the practices of administrations of both parties over four decades. The consequences for the environment and public health could be disastrous. But even as this approach might be more deliberate, these actions are unlikely to survive court challenges as well.

The EPA appears to be pivoting from a retail to a wholesale attack on environmental standards.

In the coming weeks, the EPA plans to finalize vastly weakened versions of two important climate rules: a regulation controlling greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and standards to limit emissions from vehicles. The draft proposals for the Trump administration’s revisions to each of these rules were rife with analytical problems. In the power plant rule revision, the agency exercised its discretion in a manner that imposed billions of dollars’ worth of net harm on the American public. And the vehicle rule analysis is justified by claims about improved safety that rest on a wholly implausible and discredited economic analysis: It assumes that people will buy more—as opposed to fewer—vehicles as they become more expensive. These failures are likely to reappear in the final rules as well, because the administration would be unable to justify its chosen actions without mangling the underlying analysis. As a result of these analytical failures, the rollbacks will be highly vulnerable to legal challenges and could add to the administration’s string of court losses.

Perhaps sensing urgency as these losses mount and the president’s term slips away, the EPA appears to be pivoting from a retail to a wholesale attack on environmental standards. The agency has taken steps to begin an assault on the core foundations of environmental rulemaking, signaling that it plans to alter the building blocks of the economic analysis that underlies its rules. This new EPA attack features three dirty tricks that would erase the bulk of the benefits of critical environmental policies. These benefits—tens of thousands of averted deaths and hundreds of thousands of averted hospitalizations for strokes, heart attacks, and respiratory ailments—would, of course, still be there. The administration’s analysis would just pretend otherwise.

One EPA method involves calling into question the benefit of reducing pollution below the level of the national ambient air quality standards. Since the late 1970s, every administration—Republican and Democratic—has acknowledged that more stringent standards would provide greater health benefits. But earlier this month, William Wehrum, who oversees air quality for the EPA, brazenly cast doubt on this long-established, science-based approach, telling the New York Times that counting these benefits in regulatory analyses “doesn’t make any sense” because the standards are set at “safe” levels, thereby implying that there can be no benefits at concentrations below the ones that the EPA deems to be “safe.”

The problem with this understanding is that the Supreme Court has made clear that “the word ‘safe’ does not mean ‘risk-free.’ ” And, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which hears all the challenges to national ambient air quality standards, explained that in setting these standards, EPA must “ ‘select … standard levels that … reduce risks sufficiently to protect public health’ ” even while recognizing that “ ‘a zero-risk standard is [not] possible.’ ”

Wehrum should know better, or at least, he did not too long ago. He had previously served under President George W. Bush in senior positions in EPA’s air office between 2001 and 2007. During that time, in setting national ambient air quality standards for particulate matter and for ozone, the EPA acknowledged that significantly higher benefits would accrue to the American people if the agency set the standards at levels more stringent that the ones it ultimately chose. The significant concern with this approach is that it will pave the way for the EPA to support laxer standards without having to acknowledge that there is a cost to human life in doing so.

A second EPA trick involves concealing “co-benefits”—the indirect (and often enormous) benefits that result when a regulation reduces pollutants besides the ones being directly targeted by a particular regulation. EPA has launched an attack on co-benefits most directly as part of a revision to a finding related to a major mercury pollution rule—it’s trying to argue that the $37 billion to $90 billion in health co-benefits resulting from reductions in harmful particulate matter pollution don’t exist. If the administration’s goal is to obscure the value of environmental rules, undermining co-benefits will certainly help.

Co-benefits are so universally accepted as a worthwhile thing to consider that even the Trump EPA’s own handpicked Science Advisory Board recently highlighted the importance of considering them. Furthermore, a landmark guidance document on regulatory analysis issued by the Office of Management and Budget under George W. Bush explicitly requires the consideration of indirect benefits, though the EPA has consistently taken co-benefits into account since the Reagan administration. Courts have also ruled that the indirect costs of regulations must be considered, so ignoring indirect benefits would create a lopsided and unjustifiable analysis. Indeed, counting indirect effects when they are negative but ignoring them when they are positive is the embodiment of the type of arbitrary and capricious conduct that the law categorically prohibits. But the Trump EPA now wants to make this the norm.

The EPA’s final dirty trick involves questioning foundational scientific studies on the harmful health impacts of particulate pollution. The detrimental health effects of particulate matter emissions are exceptionally well-documented. Two foundational studies performed in the 1990s found that people in cities with the highest levels of these pollutants were dying two years earlier than those in the least-polluted cities. The results were independently verified by two groups of outside researchers, and these studies have helped inform several major air pollution regulations. But an EPA rule proposed last year would bar the consideration of studies like these, even though they are widely regarded as state-of-the-art, because their individual patient health data cannot be shared publicly, because of patient confidentiality rules. The administration’s approach would make it virtually impossible for regulatory policy to rely on epidemiological studies, a science-denying approach that is unlikely to find a receptive ear in the courts.

During the retail phase of the Trump administration’s attack on environmental rules, the EPA cut corners, which led to most of its actions being overturned in court. This new wholesale attack on environmental rulemaking is far more pernicious than the last. The Trump administration is actively trying to undermine and minimize science that has served as a universal baseline for decades. But once again, it’s pursuing its case sloppily, which means the courts are likely to still see through these dirty tricks and stop them before they have a massively negative impact on public health."
Democrats release Homeland Security funding bill without money for border wall,https://thehill.com,[],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/homenews/house/446806-democrats-release-homeland-security-funding-bill-without-money-for-border-wall,"House Democrats are bucking President Trump Donald John TrumpYouTube declines to take action against commentator accused of racist, homophobic harassment YouTube declines to take action against commentator accused of racist, homophobic harassment US officials respond to China blaming Trump admin for derailing trade negotiations MORE with their newly released funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), including no funds for border walls or barriers of any kind in the legislation.

House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey Nita Sue LoweyHouse advances B agriculture bill House advances B agriculture bill House committee advances 7 billion transportation, housing bill MORE (D-N.Y.) said the 2020 DHS funding bill, released Tuesday, is meant to protect the nation's values.

“This includes upholding the rights and dignity of migrants, protecting against attempts by the Trump administration to steal funds from measures that actually keep us safe for a vanity border wall, and providing no funding for additional Border Patrol agents and checkpoints or border barriers,” Lowey said.



The bill is the opening salvo in a fight that could lead to another government shutdown over border security.

Earlier this year, Trump shut down the government for a record 35 days after Democrats refused to comply with his demands for $5.7 billion in funding for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

In the end, Trump acquiesced to a compromise of $1.35 billion for barriers, on par with what was offered before the shutdown, and well below the amount he demanded.



Trump went on to declare a state of emergency at the border, which would allow him to circumvent Congress and use military funds to build the barrier.



House Democrats have included provisions in their 2020 spending bills that would block such attempts to reprogram funds to build a wall.

For example, a military construction spending bill blocked funds from being reprogrammed for building a wall, and the financial services spending bill included provisions preventing forfeited funds for that purpose.

Democrats are also seeking to block Trump’s emergency moves in court.



The $63.8 billion DHS bill increases spending by $2.2 billion over current levels, but comes in $1.9 billion below Trump's request.

The DHS bill is the last of 12 spending bills the House Democrats have released for the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. Combined, the bills represented a broad rejection of Trump's agenda and budget requests. Trump had proposed slashing domestic spending by as much 10 percent, including deep cuts to the State Department, Environmental Protection Agency, National Institutes of Health and Department of Transportation, among other programs.

The House bills flouted his proposals, adding $34 billion to domestic spending and $17 billion to defense.

Venezuela’s Two Presidents Collide,https://www.newyorker.com,"['Jon Lee Anderson', 'Masha Gessen', 'Naomi Fry', 'The New Yorker', 'Anthony Lane', 'Jiayang Fan']",06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/06/10/venezuelas-two-presidents-collide,"There are a few rules for how to topple a government. Make sure that you have the military on your side, or at least enough of it to dissuade unsympathetic soldiers from intervening. Spread money around, to inspire loyalty. Determine which part of the populace will join your uprising, which part will resist, and which part will stand aside and watch. Neutralize the resistance quickly; take over the media so that you can disseminate orders. Once the ruler is displaced, kill him or hustle him out of the country as fast as you can. When Juan Guaidó, the leader of Venezuela’s uprising, announced the “final phase of Operation Freedom,” on April 30th, he seemed to have done none of those things. He arrived before dawn outside the La Carlota airbase, in Caracas, and recorded a video declaring that the time had come to force out the country’s increasingly tyrannical ruler, Nicolás Maduro. Guaidó, thirty-five years old, had recently been named the speaker of the National Assembly, and he looked a bit surprised to find himself where he was. With a few dozen military sympathizers at his side, he said, “There have been years of sacrifice. There have been years of persecution. There have been years of fear, even. Today, that fear is overcome.” The previous May, Maduro had been elected to a second six-year term, but the election was widely viewed as illegitimate. One criticism was that his principal rivals were either in exile, under house arrest, or banned from political activity. Another was that his first term had been so disastrous that an honest victory seemed inconceivable. Maduro had entered government as a protégé of the charismatic leftist Hugo Chávez, who ruled for fourteen years and used the country’s oil wealth to bolster a “Pink Tide” of socialist-leaning governments in Latin America. Since Chávez’s death, in 2013, Maduro has presided over Venezuela’s unravelling. Its economy collapsed as the price of crude oil fell; corruption and mismanagement made things worse. Hyperinflation, which is expected to reach ten million per cent this year, has left the currency worthless. Hunger and disease are epidemic. In Caracas, people go panning in the filthy water of the Guaire River for gold jewelry that has been dropped down sinks; butchers sell cow hooves to customers desperate for protein; women give up careers to work as prostitutes in neighboring countries. More than ten per cent of Venezuela’s population has fled. Maduro has responded blithely, alternately denying the problems and advising his departed citizens to “stop cleaning toilets abroad and come home.” The current crisis began in 2016, when the National Assembly launched a referendum to remove Maduro from power, and he responded by creating a rival legislature, filled with his loyalists. Months of demonstrations followed, and more than a hundred protesters were killed. As tensions rose, the persecution of political dissidents, whom Maduro has derided to me as “counter-revolutionaries,” grew more common. Last August, as Maduro presided over a military parade, an armed drone exploded overhead, in an apparent assassination attempt. No one died, but an opposition politician named Fernando Albán was arrested. Three days later, he fell to his death from the tenth floor of the intelligence headquarters. The official explanation was suicide, but rumors persisted that agents had drowned him in “the bathtub,” a local equivalent of waterboarding, and then thrown his body out a window. At a rally on January 23rd, Guaidó invoked a constitutional clause to assert that Maduro’s sham election had rendered the office vacant, and to name himself Venezuela’s legitimate leader. Since then, the country has been caught in a seesawing conflict between two Presidents—one spuriously elected but backed by the armed forces, the other self-proclaimed but endorsed by much of the Western world. Since taking office, Donald Trump has frequently called for Maduro to be removed, by military coup if necessary. Within minutes of Guaidó’s speech, Trump publicly recognized him as the rightful leader of Venezuela. John Bolton, Trump’s pugnacious national-security adviser, added a warning: “Any violence and intimidation against U.S. diplomatic personnel, Venezuela’s democratic leader, Juan Guaido, or the National Assembly itself would represent a grave assault on the rule of law and will be met with a significant response.” More than fifty other governments, including those of Canada and most countries in the European Union, quickly endorsed Guaidó. His supporters began referring to him as “Presidente” and to Maduro as “the usurper.” When the final phase of Operation Freedom commenced, though, it was a disaster. At the airbase, Guaidó’s political mentor, Leopoldo López, appeared unexpectedly, after several years under house arrest, but stood by silently, looking wary and slightly dazed. Guaidó’s speech for the video cameras seemed hastily improvised. In the middle of it, a cell phone rang for several seconds before someone turned it off. “Today, brave soldiers, brave patriots, brave men loyal to the Constitution have responded to our call,” Guaidó announced. But not many soldiers seemed to be joining the fight. A few thousand civilians gathered near La Carlota, where loyalist troops surrounded them, sometimes firing guns. Assault vehicles drove through the crowds, scattering the protesters. Within a few hours, the soldiers who had joined Guaidó sought refuge in the Brazilian Embassy. That evening, Maduro gave a speech, claiming victory over a small group of plotters who had “handed their souls over to the coup-mongering far right.” For three days, Guaidó was missing, and rumors spread that he was sleeping at a different foreign embassy every night. Finally, he appeared at a press conference, in the back yard of a house belonging to political allies. Despite the mayhem in the country, Guaidó smiled imperturbably and flashed a thumbs-up. When asked about the fracaso—the failed uprising—he had a ready answer. “It’s true that Maduro, the usurper, is still in power,” he said. “And that’s a fracaso for all Venezuela. But we are going to continue going forward, to fight for change.” Guaidó’s calm determination suggested a young man with unusual political acumen, and also one with powerful friends.

One morning in March, a few weeks before the uprising, Guaidó took me with him to Vargas, his home state, on the Caribbean coast. For the trip, an hour’s drive from Guaidó’s apartment in Caracas, we sat in the back of an armored S.U.V. A man in owlish glasses sat between us. He introduced himself as Davíd, the President’s astrologer. “My laser eye surgery was expensive but worth every penny.” As we set out, Davíd said that he hoped we wouldn’t meet any colectivos—groups of paramilitary thugs, who roam around on motorcycles, shooting at anti-government protesters. The colectivos, he declared, were “la encarnación del mal”—the incarnation of evil—and “representatives of the Devil on earth.” Riding in front was Guaidó’s chief of staff, Roberto Marrero. An extroverted man with a goatee and the demeanor of a stage villain, Marrero lightened the mood by playing us a video clip on his phone. It showed a young man riffing on an irreverent taunt that has become a ritual across Venezuela: one person shouts “Maduro!” and everyone within earshot shouts back “Coño e’tu madre! ”—a supremely rude reference to his mother’s anatomy. (In Buenos Aires, where there is a burgeoning Venezuelan expat community, a sympathizer recently opened a restaurant called Maduro Coño e’Tu Madre.) In Marrero’s clip, the young man had turned the taunt into a rap, with a reggaetón beat and a raucous chorus harmonizing in the background. Marrero said delightedly, “That’s Vargas style, man. It’s where we’re going.” Along the highway that leads down the mountain from Caracas to the sea, Guaidó pointed out the spot where he had been arrested by Maduro’s intelligence agents. It had happened on January 13th, eight days after his inauguration as speaker, during which he had condemned Maduro as “illegitimate.” He was held for only a few hours, but passing drivers had caught the arrest on camera; they spread video of it on social media, causing a global outcry and galvanizing the opposition. Guaidó quickly became the center of an international effort to depose an autocrat. Everything has happened fast for Guaidó, and at times his inexperience shows. During our car trip, he was boyishly restless, drumming on his knees and distractedly whistling a tune. At one point, he recalled an encounter he’d had the previous day, when a little girl approached him and proclaimed, “Queremos futuro”—“We want a future.” Guaidó repeated the phrase several times, imitating her falsetto, before breaking into a giggle. Someone who works closely with the Trump Administration on Venezuela policy told me, “Look, Guaidó is not yet a leader. But you have to understand, the Venezuelans are so desperate at this point that if you put a dog on a podium they’d vote for it.” He was very much an accidental President. The job of speaker of the National Assembly rotates among parties; when the new term began, last December, it happened to be his party’s turn. There were three people ahead of Guaidó for the job. But Leopoldo López, the head of the party, was under house arrest; his second-in-command had been forced into exile; and the third man was under political asylum in the Chilean Embassy. Guaidó was young, likable, and a quick learner, and, in a country where all the experienced politicians had failed, he was a virtual unknown. Unlike most Venezuelan officials, he did not seem to be personally corrupt. Slim and fresh-faced, with brown skin and a wide smile, Guaidó invites comparisons to the young Barack Obama, a perception that he has encouraged by adopting the slogan “Yes, we can!” Chely Escalona, one of Guaidó’s former schoolteachers, told me, “Let’s be honest here. Juan Guaidó is an ordinary guy, nothing special about him. A nice guy, yes, but ordinary. And that’s fine! We have to get past this strongman fixation we have in Venezuela.” Guaidó grew up, with four siblings, in a suburb of La Guaira, a port town at the foot of the jungly mountains below Caracas. As we reached the coast and began driving east, he pointed out familiar places. There was the international airport of Maiquetía, where his father once worked as a pilot. There was a series of white sandy beaches and beat-up resort hotels—a traditional weekend escape for caraqueños. Entering La Guaira, we passed a small stadium, erected by the government. Guaidó scowled. The stadium had been under construction for seven years, and, seat for seat, “it cost more than Yankee Stadium,” he claimed. “The corruption has finished them off,” he said, disgustedly, of the chavistas. Venezuela’s oil wealth is like a spigot, he added: “As long as water comes out, everything’s fine. It’s only when it stops flowing that people start asking what’s up. And that’s what’s happened here.” Guaidó’s parents divorced when he was young, and his father immigrated to the Canary Islands, where he now works as a taxi-driver. But Guaidó was surrounded by family, and he was popular in the neighborhood, an avid salsa dancer and a fan of the local baseball team, the Guaira Sharks. Things changed in 1999, when, during his senior year of high school, a mudslide, swollen by days of heavy rain, crashed down on the town. The catastrophe killed thousands of people and left many more homeless. Guaidó’s house was destroyed; so was his school. Chávez had come to power earlier that year, and the mudslide was among his first major tests as Venezuela’s leader. His response was widely seen as a colossal failure. Soldiers sent to Vargas as rescuers were accused of lootings, killings, and other crimes; a government program to rebuild public housing and other infrastructure was inexplicably slow. “El desastre de Vargas,” as Venezuelans call it, was the turning point of Guaidó’s young life; he invokes it constantly in speeches. Displaced by the catastrophe, his family moved to a temporary home in Caracas, where he was enrolled in a new high school. He stayed in Caracas to attend a Catholic university, and graduated in 2007, with a degree in industrial engineering. In those years, Chávez’s regime was following an increasingly radical socialist ideology. Guaidó and several other students formed a movement to oppose him. He and his comrades became known as the 2007 Generation, and a number of them have remained active in the opposition. In 2009, Guaidó joined Leopoldo López to found Voluntad Popular—a right-of-center party that is part of a broad coalition opposed to the regime. The next year, while still in his twenties, he entered the National Assembly. López—thirteen years older, a charismatic graduate of Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government—became the opposition’s most prominent leader. But many poor Venezuelans suspected that his loyalties ultimately lay with the sifrinos, the country’s wealthy class, which is predominantly white and fiercely anti-chavista. He was also a target of the regime. In 2014, he was arrested, after leading a series of protests, and given a thirteen-year sentence. When Guaidó became the face of the opposition, his humble origins helped attract sympathy to the cause, in Venezuela and in the United States. A former senior U.S. official told me, with a laugh, “We needed someone who wasn’t a member of the Caracas Polo Club.” At his home one morning, Guaidó introduced me to his wife, Fabiana, a slender woman of twenty-seven, who greeted me with a shy smile. They met at a Voluntad Popular youth rally in 2013, when Fabiana had just graduated from college with a degree in journalism, and they married soon afterward; they now have a two-year-old daughter named Miranda. At the apartment, Guaidó picked up Miranda and kissed her, encouraging her to wave to me. The apartment was a no-frills two-bedroom, with a galley kitchen, a narrow living room, and a view of nearby apartment buildings. Guaidó laughed: “It’s not much, but it’s home.” An aide pointed out that the apartment was at least safe. One day while Guaidó was away, he said, special-forces agents had showed up and intimidated Fabiana and Miranda. Watchful neighbors had seen the agents approaching; they berated the men until they left. The aide said, “Here, everyone is with him, and they are watching out for him.” That afternoon, Guaidó had lunch at El Mosquero (roughly, the Place of Flies), an open-air fish market next to the Guaira port. He sat at a Formica table to eat empanadas; within minutes, he was mobbed by locals, calling out “Guaidó Presidente!” and taking selfies with him. An elderly woman cooed, “My love! My prince!” Others kissed and hugged him. A man told me that he had worked in the port for thirty-five years, but now there were no jobs, and he could not feed his family. He reached across the table to fist-bump Guaidó, and instructed him, “You have to go forward, never back.” A woman with a walker was seated next to Guaidó and given an empanada. Between bites, she raised her voice and yelled, like a soccer fan, “We have to win!” Away from the crowd, Davíd informed me that Guaidó was a descendant of Guaicaipuro, a sixteenth-century indigenous chieftain who had fought the Spanish conquest before being ambushed and killed. Chávez had resurrected Guaicaipuro as a national hero, ordering that his remains be symbolically reinterred in the National Pantheon. Seeing my bemusement, Davíd explained that all of Venezuela’s leaders were the reincarnations of predecessors. Chávez wanted to be Simón Bolívar but was really Guaicaipuro, while Guaidó was mostly Guaicaipuro, with a little bit of Tiuna, another indigenous chief. Maduro, however, was just “the axis of evil.” Davíd explained that “the Cubans”—Maduro’s rumored team of secret advisers—had practiced the “dark arts” of Santería to lead Maduro to evil. “Venezuela is ordained to be the best country in the region, and after a world war, which is now unfolding, it will receive many people from all over the world,” he said. “In order to be ready, however, it must be liberated.” Guaidó would bring about that liberation, he claimed: “I met him in December, and I told him, ‘You are the Chosen One.’ ” Many of Guaidó’s followers were similarly fervent, but for more practical reasons: he offered hope, and he was willing to risk making a public argument for sweeping change. After lunch, his team drove to a small plaza, where he jumped onto a stage and gave a speech. It was, like all his speeches, economical and inspirational. He told the crowd that it wouldn’t be long before “we the people” occupied Miraflores, the Presidential palace, where “the usurper” Maduro still lived. But a long road lay ahead, and unity and fortitude were essential. A group of women in the crowd raised their hands in the air, like believers at a Pentecostal sermon. One had her eyes closed, a beatific expression on her face.

In March, Venezuela’s electrical grid crashed, and the lights went out all over the country. The blackout, or apagón, lasted for five days, deepening the crisis. As Maduro went on television to accuse the Trump Administration of launching an “electromagnetic attack,” most Venezuelans blamed governmental ineptitude and negligence. It emerged that underbrush had not been cleared around key electrical installations, and fires had broken out. The effects were calamitous. The Internet failed, water stopped running, and hospitals scrambled to keep incubators and dialysis machines going. Satellite images showed Venezuela as a dark spot on the South American map, like a black hole in a starry constellation. I had arrived in Caracas on the second day of the apagón. The airport had no electricity or air-conditioning, and immigration and customs officials appeared hot and exhausted. The rest of the country was effectively shut down: Maduro had closed schools and told public employees to stay home. At the hotel where I was booked, the generator had burned out, so the elevator didn’t work and there was no water. The hotels with functioning generators were full, their lobbies packed with well-to-do Venezuelan families and their servants. In an elegant hotel favored by Caracas’s upper class, I saw a woman in designer leisure clothes handing the reception staff a wad of crisp hundred-dollar bills, as she lamented being forced to leave her Cavalier King Charles spaniel alone in her house. She had gone to visit him, she said, and found him “all depressed, pobrecito.” The receptionists clucked sympathetically. “Be careful with your third wish. Another book you might already have read would be a bummer.” Throughout the city, the opposing sides had marked territory. On the highway into Caracas, graffiti in the Soviet style that Maduro favors showed his profile linked with Chávez’s. A newly erected signboard portrayed Simón Bolívar, the great hero of the chavista revolution, with the aphorism “If tyranny is chaos, revolution is order.” In the middle-class opposition strongholds of Altamira and Los Palos Grandes, there were messages spray-painted on walls: “Maduro = Murderer,” “Medicine is not a privilege.” Someone had defaced a “Long live Maduro” sign, replacing the President’s name with “hunger.” On the raised highway that runs through Caracas, a convoy of armored personnel carriers belonging to the National Guard had blocked an exit. On the road below, hundreds of people had gathered to march in support of the opposition, but their progress was stopped by Guardsmen poised with riot gear and guns. After dark, the streets were eerily silent. Caracas was one of the world’s most dangerous cities at the best of times; now it felt flatly apocalyptic. Masked colectivo thugs roamed the backstreets on motorbikes. One night, after midnight, I saw that soldiers had blocked the darkened approaches to the Miraflores palace. Outside, the embers of rubber tires were still burning where protest barricades had been erected. Wherever there was power, people gathered to plug in their phones. Near a mobile-phone relay tower, some had pulled up their cars to check e-mail. Their hazard signals, blinking in the darkness, were the only light that could be seen.

The caraqueños refer to their slums as los cerros—the hills—because they occupy the mountainsides above Caracas. Some extend for miles, spreading over hilltops and down into canyons, where countless people live in red brick shanties and unpainted cement huts. The state is effectively nonexistent in the cerros, except for a few services instituted during the Chávez era: monthly food handouts, small allowances, and teams of Cuban doctors who provide primary health care. Even these services have become irregular, and life is precarious. Unemployment and crime are ubiquitous. Residents usually get electricity by cannibalizing weak current from municipal lines. Now even that was unavailable. On the third day of the apagón, I visited San Blas, a grimy, defoliated area of the sprawling Petare slum, and came across a group of people lined up on a dirt road with plastic buckets. At the front of the line, a spigot, linked to an underground spring, poked up from a pool of muddy water. It gave out only a thin trickle, and each bucket took nearly half an hour to fill. The people sat in the scant shade of nearby houses, slumped from exhaustion. A woman near the front of the line said that she had been waiting since before dawn, nine hours earlier. It would be two more hours before it was her turn. The people around her nodded; everyone was in the same predicament. An older woman said that the water problems predated the apagón; there had been no running water for a month in San Blas, where thirty thousand residents shared three spigots. No one from the government had come to inspect, or to supply water from cistern trucks. With a disgusted look, she said, “It’s been like this since the Fourth Republic,” the forty-year period of democracy that preceded Chávez. “Back in those days, we had water all the time. But these people”—she waved down the hill toward the authorities—“do nothing for anyone but themselves.” Most of her listeners were too young to remember life before Chávez. All they knew was that they had no water, and that lining up with a bucket was the way to get some. When I asked a woman if she was planning to go into the city to join one of Guaidó’s demonstrations, she shook her head and gave me an uncomprehending look. Guaidó often says that his message is gaining support in the cerros, but most people I spoke to there seemed too accustomed to crisis to believe in the possibility of transformative change. At the summit of the Petare hill, a shopkeeper looked out from the half-closed grilles of his storefront. He had lost all his refrigerated food, and couldn’t operate the oven he used to bake bread, so he had nothing to sell except batteries, candy, and a few other sundries. Shrugging, he said, “There’s nothing to be done.” He was no more hopeful about the political situation. When I mentioned Guaidó’s movement, he said laconically, “Pueblo no tumba gobierno”—ordinary people don’t topple governments. In Caracas, the opposition leader Henrique Capriles had told me much the same thing. “Let’s imagine that I’ve been kidnapped,” he said. “My family wants to rescue me, but, if the kidnapper doesn’t pick up the telephone, what’s to be done? Who frees me? That’s the situation we’re in here.”

The question of the United States’ intentions hung over the crisis in Venezuela, but Guaidó admitted to being hazy on American politics. In Vargas, he took me aside to ask about the 2020 elections. He noted that Bernie Sanders had announced his intention to run, but he knew little about Beto O’Rourke. Asked about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez during a recent Fox Business interview, he had drawn a blank. He’d Googled her afterward, and he told me with a laugh that she didn’t seem all that radical: “What they refer to as socialist in the United States is what we’d call a Social Democrat here.” Davíd interrupted to say that he had “read the cards” and that Trump was likely to win reëlection, but that it depended on Venezuela’s becoming free. He added that Trump had a “Karmic problem,” because he “didn’t know how to express himself,” but that he was successful despite his impediments. “He’s like Maxwell Smart,” Davíd said—the bumbling spy in the sixties sitcom. “Everything he does is wrong but turns out well in the end.” Trump became interested in Venezuela early in his term. In February, 2017, he received a visit at the White House from Lilian Tintori, the wife of Leopoldo López. Tintori—a former reality-TV star and champion kite-surfer—gave an impassioned talk about human rights in Venezuela and her husband’s plight. Afterward, she posed for pictures. According to U.S. officials, Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence were smitten. Fernando Cutz, who at the time led Latin-American initiatives for the National Security Council, told me that Trump called him in for a briefing on Venezuela. “He asked me what we could do,” Cutz said. “Why were the people suffering there?” Cutz said that Trump almost never mentioned Cuba, traditionally the U.S.’s central concern in Latin America, but regularly asked about Venezuela. “Clearly, it was a priority for him,” Cutz said. For months, Trump said nothing about an armed intervention. Then, in August, 2017, he brought up Venezuela at a meeting in the Oval Office with John Kelly, the chief of staff; H. R. McMaster, the national-security adviser; and Rex Tillerson, the Secretary of State. According to attendees, he asked, “Why don’t we use the military?” McMaster replied, “Well, Mr. President, there are other options.” Trump asked the other officials what they thought, and they all tried to dissuade him. Trump nodded, but then, the next day, he announced to reporters at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, “We have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option.” Kelly and Tillerson were there; they stood stolidly. Nikki Haley, the U.N. Ambassador, apparently hearing the suggestion for the first time, gave Trump a look of befuddled alarm. A U.S. military intervention would have enormous implications around the world. Maduro has few allies in Latin America; the Pink Tide of leftist leaders has mostly receded. But Cuba remains tightly entwined with Venezuela, which for years has supplied it with oil in exchange for experts, including thousands of doctors and, by all accounts, some military and intelligence advisers. Maduro also has substantial alliances with China, which has made enormous investments in Venezuela, and particularly with Russia. After the U.S. endorsed Guaidó, Vladimir Putin called Maduro to offer support and to denounce “destructive external interference.” In late March, Putin dispatched a hundred military advisers and technicians to Venezuela, purportedly to repair air defenses that Chávez had put in place. The gesture was conspicuous: the military aircraft carrying the troops flew from Syria, where Russia is also agitating against U.S. interests, and landed at the main airport in Caracas. The Russians’ actions caused acute frustration in Washington. “They’ve figured out that with very little cost they can get into an international situation and become a player,” Cutz said. “Russia is no longer a superpower, but it’s fairly good at acting like one. A hundred troops to Venezuela? That’s nothing. But we in the U.S. have not figured out how to extract them or to respond to this.” McMaster favored an incremental approach to the crisis, with gradually increasing sanctions, intended to encourage talks. The Administration invited the rebels to Washington for advice and urged anti-Maduro factions to unite, apparently with little success. In 2017, the U.S. helped bring the regime and the opposition together for talks, in the Dominican Republic, but they quickly fell apart. Before the invasion of Afghanistan, Americans flew in with millions of dollars of cash to inspire local warlords to support a campaign against the Taliban. In Venezuela, Trump officials have occasionally offered incentives to officers who defected, but there has apparently been no budget for a wider effort to convert the military. After Bolton replaced McMaster, in April, 2018, the Administration imposed financial sanctions on Venezuela’s state-owned oil company, designed so that any new profits would be deposited in an account under Guaidó’s authority. But the Administration has not yet figured out how to disburse the funds to Guaidó. Mostly, Trump officials seem to believe that they can effect change by making pronouncements. Since Bolton took office, he has devoted a majority of his tweets to confronting Maduro. In one, he wrote, “I wish Nicolas Maduro and his top advisors a long, quiet retirement, living on a nice beach somewhere far from Venezuela.” Senator Marco Rubio, of Florida, has tweeted with particularly Trumpish zeal, mocking small crowds at a pro-regime rally (“Wow! . . . Very impressive turnout”) and assailing Maduro’s potency (“the emperor . . . has no clothes”). At times, he has made forthright threats. In a tweet addressed to the “Maduro Crime Family,” he promised that “the willingness of many nations to support stronger multilateral actions to dislodge them has increased dramatically.” At one point, he tweeted a series of photographs of deposed dictators: Manuel Noriega, Nicolae Ceauşescu, and, in a gruesome image, Muammar Qaddafi being brutalized by rebels just before his murder, in 2011. When I asked Guaidó if the photographs had helped his cause, he gave a knowing laugh and quickly formulated a politic answer: “I don’t know if they help, but I understand their language. Now, extricating myself from those images, the only possible comparisons to the Venezuelan case are dictatorships of that type, or of cases of countries at war. O.K., maybe those are hateful comparisons. But if you take those photos away and you put in their place access to water, inflation, gross domestic product, access to information, to justice, political prisoners, there are no other comparisons possible.” “The couple will now exchange vows that they wrote themselves, because I guess mine weren’t good enough, but, whatever, let’s see what you’ve got.” The regime uses these provocations for maximum propaganda value. In March, Diosdado Cabello, a member of Maduro’s cabinet, appeared on his weekly TV show, whose name translates loosely as “Beat Them with a Club,” to lead the audience in a chant of “Yankee, go home!” An influential Venezuelan politician told me, “If I could talk to Trump, I would tell him, and also Bolton, Pence, and Rubio, to stop! Por favor! ” Other observers told me that the Trump Administration’s messages helped provide cover for Maduro’s repressiveness. “Rubio is like a scarecrow for Maduro,” a diplomat in Caracas said. “He uses his tweets to prove there is an invasion coming.” In recent meetings, the diplomat said, Maduro had seemed galvanized by the standoff, saying that he felt “excited about confronting Trump.” He had also said, “I’m not going to end up like Qaddafi, or like Mubarak. After me, someone else will come.” He had begun comparing himself to the Chilean President Salvador Allende, who was overthrown in a U.S.-backed coup in 1973, and committed suicide rather than be taken prisoner. The diplomat rolled his eyes in disdain.

The Administration’s most dramatic action on Guaidó’s behalf was a high-profile operation, in February, to deliver humanitarian aid to Venezuela. As U.S. military planes flew food and medical supplies to the border with Colombia, Guaidó and his American backers urged the regime to allow the shipments through. Humanitarian-aid missions are traditionally kept separate from politics. In this case, though, public offers were made to specific senior officers to defect in exchange for amnesty for past abuses. A military attaché to Washington had switched sides, as had a general, who broke with the regime on social media. This was less significant than it might have seemed; Venezuela’s Army has more than two thousand generals. Meanwhile, the defense minister, Vladimir Padrino López, declared that he and his troops remained loyal to Maduro and the Bolivarian revolution. The delivery was scheduled for February 23rd, and, in the preceding days, Maduro rejected the aid, saying, “We are not beggars.” He sent tankers and shipping containers to block three crucial border bridges, and deployed the National Guard for added security. That morning, Guaidó appeared on the Colombian side, standing alongside a group of conservative leaders from the region. A crowd had gathered, and Guaidó urged them to be brave, promising that the aid would “restore prosperity to Venezuela.” The tycoon Richard Branson had organized a concert, Venezuela Aid Live, on the Colombian side, where top Latin entertainers attracted more than two hundred thousand people. A counter-concert organized by Maduro’s people flopped, as most of the performers pulled out beforehand. In a TV interview, Rubio said that Maduro was powerless to stop the aid: “The question is whether it gets through in a way that he’s coöperative with or in a way that he’s not.” On Twitter, Guaidó announced, “As commander-in-chief of the armed forces . . . I declare that soldiers who cross the border will not be considered traitors to their homeland,” and some sixty disgruntled soldiers took him up on the guarantee. The initiative, though, turned out to be devastatingly underplanned. Guaidó hoped to form a “human chain” to pass bags of food and medical supplies across the bridges. But the regime’s soldiers wouldn’t move the barricades, and the standoff devolved into violence. Emiliana Duarte, a Venezuelan journalist who was there that day, shot video of a chaotic scene. A truck loaded with supplies had been accidentally set on fire, apparently by anti-Maduro demonstrators hurling Molotov cocktails. Armed loyalists on motorbikes terrorized protesters. “The most frightening thing was how the colectivos and the National Guardsmen coördinated their efforts,” Duarte said. She showed me video of protesters running and hiding from the colectivos, and of the National Guard firing pellet guns into the crowd. One Guardsman fired at Duarte from a dozen paces away, and she dropped her camera as the shot whizzed past. Maduro’s men injured hundreds of protesters. On the Brazilian border, National Guardsmen broke up an effort to bring in aid by firing at activists from the Pemón indigenous community, killing four. In the capital, Maduro held a rally, at which he called himself “stronger than ever” and danced with his wife onstage. Guaidó, frustrated, made his first major misstep: he posted a tweet in which he appeared to advocate military force against Maduro. “Today’s events oblige me to take a decision: to propose formally to the international community that we keep all the doors open to achieve the liberation of this fatherland that struggles and will continue to struggle. Hope was not born in order to die, Venezuela!” In support, Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that “all options are on the table.” But the rest of the region was alarmed by the prospect of an invasion. At a subsequent meeting of the Lima Group, a council of fourteen Latin-American countries, which had been set up in 2017 to deal with the Venezuela crisis, several senior officials said that they would not support a war to unseat Maduro. “We have never contemplated a military solution,” the Colombian foreign minister, Carlos Trujillo, said in a radio interview. “All the actions are political and diplomatic, and I say that emphatically, so there’s no more speculation on Colombia’s position.”

During the blackout, a looting spree erupted in the oil city of Maracaibo, after an ice vender refused to serve customers unless they paid in U.S. dollars. (Throughout Venezuela, as hyperinflation has devalued the currency, the economy has run increasingly on dollars.) The ice seller’s sweltering customers grew frustrated, and then violent. The unrest spread; in the following week, more than five hundred businesses were ransacked or burned, and several major factories and warehouses were stripped, with even their wiring hauled away. The looters were determined and, in some cases, armed; the police did not intervene, apparently out of fear for their lives. With the lights still out and the looters unchecked, many people felt that Maduro had lost the ability to govern. The diplomat told me that his regime represented the death of the chavista dream: “They’ve lasted for twenty years, but I think they’ve hit their limit, and the reason is that these people aren’t real revolutionaries. They’re malandros”—villains. “They like money. Oil has created a shallow and short-term political culture in Venezuela. In the seventies, Venezuelans would take the Concorde to Paris just to take a shower, or to New York to dance at Studio 54, and the nomenklatura of those days has simply been replaced by the nouveau-riche chavistas of today. On top of that, they have created a security state. There is repression, political prisoners, torture, and even executions, but there is no security for the citizens. This is ‘Ubu Roi’—that’s what this is. Totally aberrant.” Still, Maduro is undeniably able to rally Venezuelans to defend his regime, especially in the slums. In Caracas, one of the traditional chavista bastions is the community known as the 23rd of January, for the date of the military coup that overthrew the dictator Marcos Pérez Jiménez, in 1958. El 23, as it is known, is a vast housing complex in northwestern Caracas. It was erected in the fifties, when the country’s oil economy was booming, and was modelled on Le Corbusier’s Cité Radieuse, in Marseille. In those days, the government built projects across the country: universities, highways, bridges, dams. They now serve as reminders of a lost era. At El 23, the gardens that were planted after the complex was built have been obliterated by thousands of shanties. Colectivo Alexis Vives was founded in El 23, with financial support from Chávez, as a community-support organization. It is situated in a former commercial block, next to a burned-out supermarket. A mural outside depicts the Last Supper, with Christ as a brown-skinned man with a bushy beard, surrounded by revolutionary apostles: Che Guevara, Fidel Castro, Mao, Lenin, Chávez. It has been run for years by a diehard chavista named Roberto Longa. A burly, voluble man, Longa holds court in a kind of command center, with a panel of sixteen video screens that monitor security cameras around the estate. When I visited Longa during the blackout, he claimed, improbably, “The chavistas have never had a better moment than the present one.” His reasoning was quintessentially Marxist: “the contradictions are deepening” in Venezuelan society—part of a necessary process of broadening the revolution. “The contradictions need to deepen even more before a dialogue can take place between the government and the popular forces,” he said. There was no need to include Guaidó in such a dialogue, he stressed. “We’re confronting the Empire”—the United States. “Guaidó is a symbol of the Empire, and he should be imprisoned and then tried for treason.” Longa confided that he believes “the Empire” murdered Chávez, by injecting him with an aggressive strain of cancer. He showed me a photograph of Chávez during a visit to El 23. He said, “Our love is for Chávez, and we are never going to stop loving him for all of our lives.” In his view, Maduro was carrying on Chávez’s work, and his explanations for the real cause of the country’s woes were inarguable. The blackout had been brought about by American sabotage; the widespread poverty and hunger resulted from an “economic war” led by the U.S. “The gringos have said, ‘We’re going to asphyxiate you,’ and we can see it happening,” he said. If the Americans forced Maduro from power, he vowed to take up arms. “We’ll radicalize the revolution,” he said. “We’ll initiate a prolonged popular war, an insurrection, and then move against the rancid oligarchy, and take over the oil industry, and so on.” Later, Jefferson González, a young member of Longa’s colectivo, told me that most chavistas had closed ranks with Maduro: “People might have their complaints, but we wash our dirty laundry in private. One thing I can assure you is that, if there is a gringo invasion, the people will come out of the barrios to fight. Meanwhile, Maduro is the leader of the revolution, and he has told the gringos that they should get out of here. What we are all waiting for is for him to arrest Guaidó.” He wore a truculent look, and added, “We saw Guaidó’s ass—which he offered up to the gringos—before we ever saw his face. That’s why Mike Pence is always talking about Venezuela, because he’s the real leader. The opposition right now is the American government.” If the unrest in Venezuela turned to open conflict, it was not clear that Guaidó’s supporters would come to the streets and fight. On Saturdays, the regime and the opposition held rallies in Caracas, and the contrast was telling. The opposition’s events often had the ritual earnestness of a campus protest. The regime’s felt like a cross between a block party and an Army Reserve parade. One weekend during my visit, police blocked off a main avenue downtown, and people dressed in red, the official chavista color, began arriving on buses, carrying pro-government signs. A few hundred men and women in militia uniforms had organized themselves into marching ranks. These milicianos, as they are called, make up an all-volunteer force that Maduro has heralded as the core of a people’s resistance army, which will help defend against a Yankee invasion. They are mostly untrained and inexperienced—one diplomat I spoke to derided them as “wheelchair shooters”—but they are enthusiastic, and they have the regime’s support. A d.j. had set up a booth and was blaring chavista salsa through loudspeakers. “Our comandante always goes onward with the revolution,” the lyrics of one song went, and people sang along, as some broke out of line to dance. The mood was festive, but the milicianos also provide evidence of Venezuela’s militarization. At a rally in April, Maduro announced proudly that their membership had grown to two million, and soon there would be a million more. “With your rifles on your shoulders, be ready to defend the fatherland and dig the furrow to plant the seeds to produce food for the community,” Maduro told them. He asked them to swear to fight “imperialist aggressions”—even if it cost them their lives.

Most chavistas take it as self-evident that Guaidó is a Yankee stooge. In February, Maduro called him “a puppet, a Judas who has tried to help the American empire take control of our country politically and militarily.” The charge rankles Guaidó, but he cannot entirely refute it. As long as the U.S. backs him, he is protected—a kind of one-man no-fly zone. A few weeks before Guaidó launched the “final phase of Operation Freedom,” I visited him at his de-facto headquarters, at a small hotel in a pro-opposition neighborhood of Caracas. When I asked him to clarify his position on the prospect of a U.S. military invasion, he instead talked at length about the destructive effects of Maduro’s rule. Finally, he said, “If we want to be responsible about things, we have to consider all the available options for changing our situation, because the people are paying a social cost that is without precedent.” “Whenever I get annoyed with him, he does that and I’m blinded by desire.” Ever since the Lima Group rejected military action, Guaidó’s American supporters had limited their threats, suggesting that they would invade only if the regime touched him. I asked if he was prepared to sacrifice himself in order to bring on an invasion. His reply was scattershot: “If that’s the cost there is to pay, where do I sign? Of course, nobody wants to risk their freedom, nobody is prepared for that, nobody is born to do that. But for me that would not be a dilemma. It would be very strange if it were to happen. And, look, I know how political that element”—a U.S. military action—“would be. I know the scars that have been left in the region with all of this, but this case is also very different from many others. What is happening in Venezuela is very atypical.” In the end, he said, it wasn’t fair that he be held accountable for a decision that wasn’t his to make. Meanwhile, he and his comrades were doing what they could to find “a Venezuelan solution to a Venezuelan problem.” Guaidó spoke vaguely about the plan that was taking shape. They would hold rallies around the country, and eventually march on Miraflores, to force out Maduro. “It’s a gamble,” he acknowledged. “But we have no other options available to us to channel and contain people’s emotions, because all the other options are violent ones—and that way is craziness. People are going around saying, ‘Miraflores, Miraflores, Miraflores,’ because they’re desperate, and they need to feel there’s a solution to the conflict. Who wants intervention? Nobody! But telling someone who is dying of hunger, ‘Just wait a little more’—that’s not easy to do. It’s hard to know what to say when people come up and tell you their wife died a week ago because there were no drugs for her chemo.”"

Happy 8th Birthday to MyPlate!

Happy Birthday, MyPlate! Eight years ago, MyPlate was introduced as a symbol of the five food groups that serve as the building blocks for healthy eating. This year, we are encouraged to Start Simple with MyPlate, which provides healthy inspiration and tips that are easily incorporated into busy lives and fit personal preferences, health goals, style, and budget. Learn more and join in the #MyPlateChallenge at: ChooseMyPlate.gov/StartSimple.

In honor of MyPlate’s 8th birthday, we are excited to celebrate with nutrition education gifts for you. The staff here at the Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion (CNPP) have come together to provide 8 ways we Start Simple with MyPlate. We hope you enjoy these real-life ideas from our CNPP family:

Making dinner after long workdays can seem like a chore. As a time saver, I always wash and cut my vegetables, as well as marinate my favorite protein foods right when I get home from the grocery store. That way, I’m one-step ahead. (Erica, Nutritionist) With 3 young kids and a variety of activities, snacks have become a necessity when we leave the house. I portion healthy foods into small containers the night before so that they're ready to grab–n–go when we need them. (Corey, Nutritionist) I’m a huge sports fan and enjoy fresh veggies when I watch games. Grape tomatoes, mini sweet peppers, sugar snap peas, and baby carrots are virtually prep-free and help me meet my vegetable goals, even on game day. (Lisa, Nutritionist) Sometimes making balanced meals with all food groups for one person is not easy. To help, I make large batches of dinners such as protein foods (pork loin), grains (wild rice), vegetables (roasted zucchini) and fruit (baked apples). Then, I portion my own “meal kits” for easy “planned over” dinners served with a glass of milk. (Barb, Nutritionist) Now that my kids are grown, I no longer have a grocery list of “favorites” but still like to have a variety of produce. This is easy as ABC -- Apples, Bananas, and Carrots. I always have these on hand for quick and easy snacks. (Janie, Graphic Information Specialist) As an avid traveler, I pack a cooler of sandwiches, water, and healthy snacks for road trips. This avoids the need (or temptation) to stop on the road which helps make sure I eat something healthy and saves money. (Dave, Nutritionist) My boyfriend and I love trying new restaurants on the weekends. We focus on ordering heathy foods cooked in new ways. This gets us inspired with different ideas when eating in. (Hannah, Visual Designer) Every Wednesday, after work I ride my bike to the farmers market down the street. In addition to picking up tasty, local produce I get to fit in some physical activity too. (Melissa, Nutritionist)

U.S. EPA is sued for ousting scientists from advisory committees,https://www.reuters.com,"['Jonathan Stempel', 'Min Read']",06-03-2019,2019,6,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-epa-lawsuit/us-epa-is-sued-for-ousting-scientists-from-advisory-committees-idUSKCN1T42H8,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was sued on Monday by a nonprofit over a recent directive banning many scientists from panels that advise the agency on scientific matters.

FILE PHOTO: An empty podium awaits the arrival of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler to address staff at EPA headquarters in Washington, U.S., July 11, 2018. REUTERS/Ting Shen

EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler was also named as a defendant in the lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court by the Natural Resources Defense Council.

The NRDC said the Oct. 31, 2017 directive from Wheeler’s predecessor Scott Pruitt upended decades of EPA practices “for no good reason” and without required public comment.

It said the agency has since used the directive to remove qualified scientists from its roughly 23 advisory committees, freeing it to replace them with industry representatives.

Monday’s complaint seeks to set aside the directive and all decisions based on it.

The EPA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Pruitt’s directive barred anyone receiving EPA grant money from serving on the advisory panels, citing a need for the panels to be more independent.

“Whatever science comes out of EPA, shouldn’t be political science,” Pruitt said at the time.

The directive was welcomed at the time by conservatives opposed to excessive regulation and condemned by Democrats and environmental groups.

U.S. President Donald Trump has tried to roll back what he considers burdensome environmental regulations to make the government more friendly to drilling, manufacturing and mining businesses.

The NRDC said it had legal standing to sue because some of its members include scientists who would have to forgo grants or professional opportunities under the directive.

The case is Natural Resources Defense Council Inc v. EPA et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 19-05174."
2 more Alabama cities selected for Department of Justice violent crime initiative,https://www.al.com,"['Carol Robinson', 'Crobinson Al.Com']",06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.al.com/news/birmingham/2019/06/2-more-alabama-cities-selected-for-department-of-justice-violent-crime-initiative.html,"Two more Alabama cities have been selected to take part in a Department of Justice initiative aimed at reducing violent crime nationwide.

The National Public Safety Partnership was launched in 2017 in response to President Trump's directive to reduce crime and improve public safety. Then- Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the National Public Safety Partnership, an alliance of local and federal law enforcement agencies coordinating with community organizations to reduce violent crime in areas long plagued by it. The Attorney General selected Birmingham as one of the initial 12 PSP sites.

On Monday, Attorney General William P. Barr announced 10 more cities, including Anniston and Oxford. To be considered for selection, a site must have sustained levels of violence that far exceed the national average and demonstrate a commitment to reducing crime. Cities must also display compliance with federal immigration requirements.

In addition to Anniston, and Oxford, other sites announced Monday are: Anchorage, Alaska; Davenport, Iowa; Wichita, Kansas; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Baltimore, Maryland; Cleveland, Ohio, Amarillo, Texas and Harris County, Texas.

In a DOJ press release, Barr said the Public Safety Partnership provides a framework for enhancing federal support of state, local and tribal law enforcement officials and prosecutors as they aggressively investigate and pursue violent criminals, specifically those involved in gun crime, drug trafficking and gang violence.

“The Public Safety Partnership is a successful program that directs federal law enforcement resources to the cities where they can have the greatest impact,"" Barr said in a prepared statement. ""These resources help police departments to diagnose where crime is highest—and why—and to find, arrest and prosecute criminals. Several participating cities have already seen dramatic reductions in violent crime over the past two years. As we expand this program to 10 more cities across America, we are determined to replicate that success.”

Birmingham's Public Safety Partnership building alliances for safer communities The task force has been instrumental in identifying the worst violent offenders in the area for arrest and prosecution.

Northern District of Alabama U.S. Attorney Jay Town said the partnership provides data-drive resources to assist law enforcement in removing the habitual offenders from the southeast side of the northern district. ““Our collective goal is simply to reduce crime, especially violent crime, in Anniston, Oxford, and surrounding areas. My office, local and federal law enforcement, and the Department of Justice are fully committed to facilitating the strategies, training, and technical assistance to do just that,’’ Town said. “We have prison beds already reserved for the alpha criminals in Calhoun County…and we are coming.”

To be considered for selection, a site must have sustained levels of violence that far exceed the national average and demonstrate a commitment to reducing crime. Cities must also display compliance with federal immigration requirements.

More than 30 cities have taken part in the Public Safety Partnership. The primary participating Justice Department components include the Office of Justice Programs, Office on Violence Against Women, Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, FBI, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and U.S. Marshals Service.

“We are excited to have the DOJ working with us in conjunction with the East Metro Area Crime Center to reduce gun crimes in our region and to reduce overall crime,’’ said Oxford Police Chief Bill Partridge. “This will help the entire region in reducing crime.”"
State Department says it is now requiring social media info from 'most' visa applicants,https://www.cnn.com,['Eli Watkins'],06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/02/politics/state-department-social-media-visa/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The State Department has begun requesting ""most"" US visa applicants provide information on their social media accounts, a department official said in a statement.

The move was expected following an announcement in March of last year that outlined plans to require nearly all US visa applicants to submit their social media handles and other information.

The State Department statement over the weekend said the forms for both immigrant and nonimmigrant visa applicants had been updated ""to request additional information, including social media identifiers.""

According to the official's statement, the move is a result of a memorandum issued by President Donald Trump in 2017 on ""vetting"" for people coming to the US and a provision of an executive order from around the same time that sought to block entry to the US for people from several majority-Muslim countries, which included a provision on vetting standards.

CNN previously reported that the change was expected to affect around 15 million people.

Jason Chaffetz: Lawbreaking FBI leaker must be prosecuted – Justice Department fails to do so,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Jason Chaffetz', 'Jason Chaffetz Is A Fox News Contributor Who Was The Chairman Of The U.S. House Oversight Committee When He Served As A Representative Utah. He Is The Author Of']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/jason-chaffetz-justice-department-leakers,"While the predictable news conference with Special Counsel Robert Mueller made headlines this week for repeating what we already knew, a bigger story from the Department of Justice broke that got far too little attention.

In a Wednesday report released by the Inspector General for the Department of Justice, we learned that the OIG was able to identify a former deputy assistant director at the FBI who violated the law by leaking sealed court documents to the media, engaging in repeated unauthorized contacts with journalists, and accepting a gift from the media.

BARR SAYS DOJ HAS 'MULTIPLE LEAK' PROBES UNDERWAY

We already knew leaking and unauthorized media contacts were a cultural and systemic problem at the FBI. A June 2018 OIG Report revealed the extent of the practice and provided a graphic illustration:

Although FBI policy strictly limits the employees who are authorized to speak to the media, we found that this policy appeared to be widely ignored during the period we reviewed. We identified numerous FBI employees, at all levels of the organization and with no official reason to be in contact with the media, who were nevertheless in frequent contact with reporters. The large number of FBI employees who were in contact with journalists during this time period impacted our ability to identify the sources of leaks.

But this week, we learned the OIG actually has identified one of the sources and suggested the allegations were supported by ""a preponderance of evidence."" Though that is certainly newsworthy, the real news was the Justice Department response. Officials mysteriously, though not surprisingly, declined to prosecute one of their own.

Creating new laws for theJustice Department to ignore does not solve the problem. But Congress can be part of the solution through the oversight function.

These are serious allegations against a very senior FBI official. How can the department not take action when there is direct evidence in hand? This is someone who deliberately and illegally disclosed sensitive information from sealed court filings. If the Justice Department looks the other way, what message does that send to the rest of the FBI? What better way to signal to the entire federal law enforcement apparatus that laws and rules are optional?

Unfortunately, we routinely have people at DOJ who put their thumb on the scale to impact politics. It's obviously part of the culture fostered by the two previous FBI directors, Robert Mueller and James Comey. They have both shown political animus and bias toward President Trump.

Comey himself released sealed information, likely for a political purposes. Mueller this week left no doubt of his own animus toward the president. No wonder the American people have lost faith in our federal law enforcement.

Not only is there no penalty for violating the law, there may actually be an incentive for doing so. For leakers with partisan motivations, the chance to impact an election may outweigh the risk of an unlikely prosecution.

If we want to instill confidence in the system, we need to be able to demonstrate that when somebody violates rules and laws within the FBI, they, too, will be prosecuted and held accountable.

There is little Congress can do legislatively. Leaking is already against the law. Creating new laws for the Justice Department to ignore does not solve the problem. But Congress can be part of the solution through the oversight function.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., should call on the Justice Department to answer to the American people for this failure to prosecute. Members of the Judiciary Committee in the House and Senate should question Inspector General Michael Horowitz about his findings and demand answers from the DOJ about the failure to prosecute. There may be no better way to get the answers the American people deserve.

House Democrat places hold on State Department's move to establish cyber bureau,https://thehill.com,[],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/446978-house-democrat-places-hold-on-state-departments-move-to-establish-cyber,"Rep. Eliot Engel Eliot Lance EngelHouse Democrat places hold on State Department's move to establish cyber bureau House Democrat places hold on State Department's move to establish cyber bureau The Hill's 12:30 Report: Pelosi fires back in feud with Trump MORE (D-N.Y.), the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, placed a hold Tuesday on the State Department’s notification that it plans to establish a Bureau of Cyberspace Securities and Emerging Technologies (CSET), calling its proposed mission too narrow.

“While Congress has pursued comprehensive, bipartisan legislation, the State Department has plowed ahead in its plan to create a bureau with a much narrower mission focused only on cybersecurity,” Engel told The Hill in a statement. “This move flies in the face of repeated warnings from Congress and outside experts that our approach to cyber issues needs to elevate engagement on economic interests and internet freedoms together with security.”

Engel was likely referring to the Cyber Diplomacy Act, a bill he co-sponsored along with House Foreign Affairs Ranking Member Michael McCaul Michael Thomas McCaulHouse Democrat places hold on State Department's move to establish cyber bureau House Democrat places hold on State Department's move to establish cyber bureau Furious lawmakers aim to block Trump's Saudi arms sales MORE (R-Texas) that would establish an Office of International Cyberspace Policy at the State Department.

Engel added that the hold on the notification would stand until “the Secretary of State directs his staff to work constructively with Congress to establish a bureau that ensures the Department is able to advance the full range of U.S. interests.”

A spokesperson for the State Department confirmed the agency had “notified Congress regarding its plans to establish the new CSET bureau” but did not comment further.

McCaul, meanwhile, expressed a more positive view of the State Department's move. A committee spokesperson for McCaul told The Hill that he ""looks forward to working with the Administration and his colleagues in the House and Senate to legislate the best possible cyber structure and mission set.""

The State Department’s notification to Congress of its intent to establish CSET, obtained by The Hill on Tuesday, lays out the key staffing and coordination plan for the proposed bureau.

The agency wrote that CSET will “consolidate resources focused on cyberspace security and the security-related aspects of emerging technologies.”

In addition, the State Department’s Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs’ focus on “privacy aspects” of cybersecurity and emerging technologies will be increased.

“In considering the growing national security challenge presented by cyber space and emerging technologies, the Department has determined that its efforts in these areas are not appropriately aligned or resourced,” the State Department wrote in justifying these developments.

As part of the establishment of CSET, a “coordinator and ambassador-at-large” would be appointed to lead U.S. international efforts on cyberspace.

Christopher Painter, the State Department coordinator for cyber issues from 2011 through 2017, tweeted Tuesday that while he thinks the agency’s move to prioritize cybersecurity is positive, he's unsure about the approach.

“Great that State is finally re-elevating cyber,” Painter tweeted. “Its a critical issue & needs US leadership. Not so great that they have chosen stove-piping over a coordinated approach.”"
Senior official at Treasury agency investigated for employee bullying,https://www.politico.com,['Victoria Guida'],06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/04/employee-bullying-treasury-1492846,"The top human resources official at a Treasury Department agency allegedly created a hostile work environment in which employees feel belittled and afraid to speak up. | Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images finance & tax Senior official at Treasury agency investigated for employee bullying

The top human resources official at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is under an internal investigation over claims of bullying and harassment, allegations that echo complaints against her in a previous government position, according to interviews and documents obtained by POLITICO.

Cassandra Cuffee-Graves, hired as deputy comptroller for human capital at the bank regulator in April 2018, has created a hostile work environment in which employees feel belittled and afraid to speak up, five OCC staff members said in interviews. Multiple employees argued that Cuffee-Graves was not properly vetted before being given the job, raising broader questions about hiring practices at the agency, which oversees national banks.

Story Continued Below

Cuffee-Graves and her deputy, Bianca Green, are the subject of an administrative inquiry by the OCC’s legal office, according to the employees, who said they were informed of the probe in March. The employees asked to remain anonymous.

OCC spokesperson Joseph Adamoli said the agency, which is an independent bureau within the Treasury Department, does not comment on personnel matters. Cuffee-Graves and Green did not respond to requests for comment.

Similar allegations were made about the two women when they were top HR officials at the Department of Education. A July 8, 2016, letter to then-Education Secretary John King, signed by human resources staff, claimed a “hostile work environment, fear of retaliation from leadership, verbal abuse, violation of the merit system principles, and collusion against employees.” A signatory of the letter told POLITICO that 19 employees were involved in drafting it.

“Several employees with years of service and no prior suspensions have been suspended for submission of work products that were performed under limited direction by management with the sole intent of using the disciplinary process against the employees,” the letter alleged.

In one instance, an employee was suspended by Green without pay for 30 days for failing to complete certain tasks. A case report published in September 2018 by the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board, an independent agency that hears appeals from government employees, reversed that decision. The board found that whistleblowing by the employee related to hiring practices at the agency was a “contributing factor” in the suspension.

The employee, Christine Reese, had previously alleged “violations of merit principles and prohibited personnel practices” by several management officials, including Cuffee-Graves, in complaints to the department’s inspector-general and the Office of Special Counsel.

In one of those complaints, she claimed Green was wrongly placed in her position because the department did not follow proper procedures to ensure a competitive hiring process, a claim also lodged by human resources staff in their 2016 letter.

MSPB did not rule on the merits of Reese’s claims but decided in her favor upon finding she was a whistleblower.

The MSPB investigation also found that Cuffee-Graves had imposed an “unreasonable” deadline on the suspended employee, less than 24 hours for a project, which was not completed on time -- one reason for the punishment.

Reese was suspended on April 1, 2018, just a few weeks before Cuffee-Graves started her new position at the OCC. Cuffee-Graves hired Green for a newly created deputy position at the OCC that October, shortly after the case report was finalized.

Cuffee-Graves and Green first worked together in 2012, when both were at Customs and Border Protection.

According to court records, Cuffee-Graves was in bankruptcy proceedings when she was hired by the agency, which the OCC employees believe should have raised questions about her suitability for a management position at a key financial regulator.

According to a review of documents from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland, Cuffee-Graves filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in August 2017 and her plan was confirmed in June 2018.

When applying for a job at the OCC, candidates are asked whether they are delinquent on any federal debt, such as taxes or federally insured student loans or mortgages.

Rich Delmar, an official with the Treasury Department’s IG, asked whether the watchdog had any open investigations into the OCC’s office of human capital, said the office “can’t discuss investigative matters.”

The Education Department IG in its annual plan for fiscal year 2018 said it intended to conduct an audit of the department’s hiring practices, but IG spokesperson Catherine Grant said that audit has been put on hold.

“We do not comment on whether we have received an allegation or complaint, nor do we generally confirm whether we are conducting an investigation,” she said."
Oracle Accuses Amazon Of Courting Former Employee Involved In A $10 Billion DOD Program,https://dailycaller.com,"['Chris White', 'Energy Reporter']",06-03-2019,2019,6,https://dailycaller.com/2019/06/03/amazon-department-of-defense/,"Amazon made a highly lucrative job offer to a former employee while the man was leading a $10 billion winner-take-all cloud computing contract with the government, according to court documents obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.

Computing giant Oracle alleged in the May 31 complaint that former Department of Defense official Deap Ubhi was offered shares in Amazon and a salary with the big tech giant while he was finding a company to help build out the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) contract.

“AWS (during JEDI and with full knowledge made a hidden job offer to Ubhi, to include a massive [redacted] immediate signing bonus payment, a second [redacted] bonus payment after year one, [redacted} shares of Amazon stock (roughly $950-$960 per share in the relevant period), and a [redacted] salary,” the court document notes, referring to Amazon Web Services, one of the companies vying for the contract.

The document added: “AWS offered a former Amazon employee actively running DoD’s $10 billion JEDI procurement nearly [redacted] dollars in cash and stock during a live procurement, not to mention a substantial salary.” (RELATED: Trump’s Acting DOD Secretary Weighs In On A Cloud Contract Conservatives Loathe)

Ubhi never recused himself, according to the document. Instead, “he spent weeks as a DoD official, downloading the JEDI Google drive to his laptop, meeting with AWS competitors as a DoD official, requesting and participating cloud meetings … and obtaining submissions from JEDI competitors,” Oracle notes in its document.

The filing comes several months after Oracle file a similar lawsuit in December 2018 noting Ubhi’s past employment with Amazon, which stands to be one of two potential winners of JEDI, a cloud computing infrastructure for the U.S. military. Oracle’s lawsuit is an attempt to block the contract until further investigation.

Ubhi openly praised Amazon on Twitter while he was working with the DOD, media reports show. “Once an Amazonian, always an Amazonian. Proud today. Thank you, @JeffBezos,” Ubhi tweeted in January 2017, referencing Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos’s opposition to President Donald Trump’s border wall.

The former DOD official left the government in late 2017. He now works with AWS.

Oracle and IBM have tried to overturn the single-award approach even. They argue that such a contract would force the Pentagon to pay billions of dollars to one company, while losing out on innovations from other companies down the supply chain. Conservatives have made similar arguments in the past.

“A contract of this magnitude should not be awarded as a sole source contract,” conservative groups wrote in a May 16 letter to Russell Vought, the acting director for the Office of Management and Budget. Citizens Against Government Waste and The American Conservative Union were among several groups that signed the letter.

It has become controversial among Republican lawmakers as well.

Reps. Steve Womack of Arkansas and Tom Cole of Oklahoma, for instance, requested a probe in October 2018 into the Pentagon’s handling of the deal. This came after TheDCNF reported that an adviser to former Secretary of Defense James Mattis once consulted for Amazon Web Services through her firm.

Both Amazon and DOJ refused to provide a comment to TheDCNF, citing ongoing litigation.

VA whistleblower says there’s a secret wait list for veterans' care,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Joe Davidson', 'Columnist Focusing On Federal Government Issues']",06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/whistleblower-says-theres-a-secret-va-wait-list-for-care-the-department-says-thats-not-true/2019/06/01/197e59a2-83df-11e9-bce7-40b4105f7ca0_story.html,"President during the swearing-in ceremony for Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie last year. A whistleblower has accused VA of having a secret wait list. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)

Columnist

Jereme P. Whiteman rose quickly through the Department of Veterans Affairs, reaching the top grade on the main employee classification scale in only seven years.

But his future within VA appears stymied. He’s become a rebel within the department’s establishment — a whistleblower who says the scandals that shamed the department during the Obama administration haven’t stopped.

Whiteman, VA’s national director of clinic practice management and a onetime Marine, has accused the department under President Trump of having “a secret VA wait list” for veterans seeking health care.

It’s starkly reminiscent of the tsunami-level scandal that broke in 2014 over the coverup of long patient wait times. That coverup included falsifying records to indicate the wait for medical service was shorter than it really was. Congress went ballistic, and the controversy drove then-VA Secretary Eric Shinseki, a former Army general and chief of staff, from office.

Whiteman said figures from internal reports indicate the actual number of veterans waiting for VA health care could be much higher than the numbers VA makes publicly available. Whiteman provided copies of the internal reports to The Washington Post.

From May 1, 2018, through May 1, 2019, the monthly average on the department’s public electronic wait list (EWL) was 14,971. During that period, the monthly average on the internal electronic wait list was 44,478.

In an email Wednesday night to VA Secretary Robert Wilkie, Whiteman said that “I discovered a secret VA wait list” in September and that “the agency has taken steps to conceal this wait list from the public.” He warned Wilkie that this could hurt the agency “unless swift actions are taken to properly address my concerns.”

Through its Veterans Health Administration, the department runs 1,250 health-care facilities, serving 9 million veterans annually.

VA press secretary Curt Cashour said Whiteman’s allegations are false. Cashour said VA’s electronic wait list has two components — clinical and administrative.

He said the clinical list — the public list — tracks the number of veterans waiting for medical treatment.

Of the other list, he said that “the administrative component of the EWL has nothing to do with waits for medical treatment and tracks routine actions, such as facility and provider transfer requests.”

[VA is gearing up for a massive shift of health care to the private sector. But Democrats are fighting back.]

Cashour said VA does not publicly post the administrative component of the EWL, “because it has nothing to do with waits for medical treatment and would only create confusion.”

Whiteman punched back, telling Wilkie that Cashour’s statement to The Post was “incredibly disingenuous.” Whiteman said any veteran waiting for treatment should be included on the public list, including veterans waiting for VA-funded care by private providers or veterans waiting to be transferred to another facility.

Unlike many federal whistleblowers, Whiteman went public while still on the job. Whiteman went through his chain of command months before becoming frustrated and contacting The Post’s Federal Insider.

Whiteman, 39, said he rose to GS-15, the top of the General Schedule, last year after just seven years as a federal civilian, all with VA. The Temple Hills, Md., resident started as a GS-7, doing pharmacy billing.

Before joining VA, he was a Marine for eight years, leaving as a staff sergeant working on jet weapons systems. His pride in that service is evident from his glass-enclosed uniform displayed on his office wall, along with other Marine and family decorations in his windowless spot on the eighth floor of VA’s Central Office, across Lafayette Square from the White House.

In a September email to his boss, Susan Kirsh, the acting assistant deputy undersecretary for health for access to care, and her boss, Steven L. Lieberman, VA’s acting principal deputy undersecretary for health, Whiteman said the discrepancies in public and internal wait-list numbers “could be seen as VA hiding a very large wait list of Veterans waiting extremely long for care.”

Whiteman was so disappointed in the way leadership handled his concerns that he filed a verbal complaint, under oath, about the discrepancies with the department’s Office of the Medical Inspector. He asked the office to investigate circumstances for patients who died while on the wait list to determine whether the deaths were connected to wait times.

Cashour said the medical inspector’s office found the allegations unsubstantiated. In the email to Wilkie, however, Whiteman said the medical inspector never followed up with him beyond his initial statement.

Whiteman has filed official complaints charging VA with retaliation against him because of his whistleblowing.

In an April 27 email, Whiteman told VA’s whistleblower protection office that one example of retribution followed the successful deployment of a text-message reminder system that led to a significant reduction in the number of missed medical appointments, saving an estimated $112 million annually.

“I lead a team of four VA employees on this project,” he wrote in an email to the whistleblower office. “I was the only one of the four who did not get an award for this project. I believe this was retaliation for my Whistleblower activity.”

Cashour said the department does not tolerate retaliation, but he did not comment on this allegation.

[VA security staff compromised safety and Shulkin violated ethics rules, oversight report says]

Whiteman also filed a retaliation complaint in an April 29 email to the Office of Special Counsel. This independent federal office protects federal whistleblowers. Despite the name, it is not led by or related to Robert S. Mueller III, who led a special-counsel investigation of Russia’s actions in support of Trump’s candidacy.

Although Whiteman is a GS-15, his email to the special-counsel office said he was subjected to “numerous undesirable work assignments” from Kirsh, including “reporting to a lower grade GS-11 employee. . . . I find this degrading and humiliating, yet I do the work as directed.”

Cashour said, “Whiteman has always reported to someone above the GS-15 level.” Whiteman said that is on paper, not in reality.

Married and the father of five, Whiteman plans to remain at VA, considering it the best place in the federal government for him as a health-care administrator. But his work life is no longer the same.

“It’s well known within headquarters that I am whistleblowing,” he said. “And I see it when I walk down the halls. People, you know, don’t look at me. They don’t make eye contact with me.”

Because of his disclosures, “there’s no more upward mobility for me at this point.” Whiteman said. “I consider myself probably stalled.”"
State Department now requires U.S. visa applicants to share social media accounts,https://www.cbsnews.com,[],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/state-department-now-requires-us-visa-applicants-to-share-social-media-accounts-2019-06-01/,"The State Department is now requiring nearly all applicants for U.S. visas to submit their social media usernames, previous email addresses and phone numbers. It's a vast expansion of the Trump administration's enhanced screening of potential immigrants and visitors.

In a move that's just taken effect after approval of the revised application forms, the department says it has updated its immigrant and nonimmigrant visa forms to request the additional information, including ""social media identifiers,"" from almost all U.S. applicants.

The change, which was proposed in March 2018, is expected to affect about 15 million foreigners who apply for visas to enter the United States each year.

Social media, email and phone number histories had only been sought in the past from applicants who were identified for extra scrutiny, such as people who'd traveled to areas controlled by terrorist organizations. An estimated 65,000 applicants per year had fallen into that category.

The department says collecting the additional information from more applicants ""will strengthen our process for vetting these applicants and confirming their identity.""

The new rules apply to virtually all applicants for immigrant and nonimmigrant visas. The department estimated it would affect 710,000 immigrant visa applicants and 14 million nonimmigrant visa applicants, including those who want to come to the U.S. for business or education, according to an initial notice.

The new visa application forms list a number of social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube and require the applicant to provide any account names they may have had on them over the previous five years. They also give applicants the option to volunteer information about social media accounts on platforms not listed on the form.

In addition to their social media histories, visa applicants are now asked for five years of previously used telephone numbers, email addresses, international travel and deportation status, as well as whether any family members have been involved in terrorist activities.

Only applicants for certain diplomatic and official visa types are exempted from the requirements."

Sonny Perdue in Raleigh says USDA relocation decision soon,https://www.kansascity.com,[],,,,https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article231152068.html,"U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue talks about relocating two USDA offices Sonny Perdue, the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture talked about North Carolina's chances to land two USDA office relocations during a visit to Raleigh on Tuesday, June 4, 2019. Up Next × SHARE COPY LINK Sonny Perdue, the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture talked about North Carolina's chances to land two USDA office relocations during a visit to Raleigh on Tuesday, June 4, 2019.

Sonny Perdue, the U.S. secretary of agriculture, said his department plans to choose a landing spot for two U.S. Department of Agriculture offices within “days and weeks,” a decision that could have ramifications for the Triangle.

The Research Triangle region is one of the final contenders to land the offices of the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture — two agencies that could net the area around 700 jobs.

The USDA named the “Research Triangle” region last month as one of four potential locations for the offices. The other contenders are Indiana (the Indianapolis region) as well as either Kansas or Missouri (the greater Kansas City area).

“I have tried to distance myself from that” decision, Perdue told reporters during a tour of the Inter-Faith Food Shuttle in Raleigh. We’re “looking for recommendations obviously. But I don’t want to put my thumb on the scale in those kind of things.”

Perdue — who worked in Wake County as a veterinarian in the 1970s — confirmed that USDA has taken a site visit to the Triangle, though he didn’t say where the site visit was or when it took place.

While making a joke about North Carolina basketball, Perdue added that he thought the Triangle had a lot of qualities the USDA is looking for.

“Carolina being in the final four — that has never happened before, right?” he said. “Obviously, you all who live here know what makes this area attractive. You have a great quality of life; you’ve got the laborshed from the Research Triangle Park; you’ve got the universities and academics here and it is just a great place to live. Those are the qualities we are looking for.”

He also noted that the area’s high-tech industry was a plus for the potential relocation.

Concerns about a relocation

The decision to relocate the two offices, which conduct research on farms and agriculture and provide grant funding, has proven to be controversial since Perdue made it last year.

Critics of the move are worried about the ability of the offices to retain talent, keep their research independent and remain relevant to policy makers in Washington, D.C., if they are located hundreds of miles away.

Rebecca Boehm, an economist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said she is concerned that the move would “do more harm than good.”

“We are concerned that physically moving staffers away from key policy makers across the government would limit the impact of their work,” she told The News & Observer in a phone interview.

She noted that the Trump administration has also suggested budget cuts to the offices and worried that if it is moved those budget cuts might be easier to pass through Congress.

She added, “This seemed like an attack on science, and we have seen the Trump administration do that in other parts of the government.”

There’s also concern among current employees that if the relocation goes through, the two offices could lose many experienced workers who have lived in the D.C. area for decades and don’t want to uproot their lives.

“As soon as we are in a new location, that is when the institutional knowledge will go down,” Laura Dodson, an economist at the ERS, told The N&O in a phone interview. “We have so many economists that have worked on these (topics) for years.”

She said on one team at the ERS, five of the eight members have quit in the past four months. A report from political news site Politico noted last month that “non-retirement departures” from the organization have more than doubled so far this year and that six economists left in April “out of frustration with the relocation process,” according to unnamed co-workers at the organization.





Dodson said morale is low and the office is like a “graveyard.”

“Within the agency, 99% say that this is terrible,” she said. “It is going to destroy the agency, destroy science, wreck families and wreck homes.”

Perdue admitted that there has been some concern about the move from staffers.

“There has been some concern all along, I don’t know about a backlash,” he said in response to a question about concerned ERS workers. “They have been very vocal obviously. But anytime you make change and you move people’s cheese, there’s always anxiety. We believe when people are in these locations, whether it is here in the RTP area or it’s in the Indianapolis area, (or) Kansas City, Missouri ... people are going to discover a great quality of life, just like you know here.”

In North Carolina, government workers have expressed similar concerns about the state Division of Motor Vehicles’ plans to move out of Raleigh and into Rocky Mount. That move is happening partly because of decisions in the legislature, and the state Senate’s budget proposal would move the Department of Health and Human Services out of Raleigh as well.

In the case of the DMV relocation, more than half of workers at the agency’s Raleigh headquarters who responded to a question about their plans if the agency moves to Rocky Mount said they would look for another job, The News & Observer previously reported.

Reaction in Congress

U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, said last month he is a supporter of the USDA’s relocation efforts and applauded the agency for considering his home state.





“It’s a testament to North Carolina’s agriculture industry and our public university system that the Research Triangle is among the three finalists for the relocation of ERS and NIFA,” Tillis said in a letter to the USDA. “Since it was first announced, I have supported USDA’s plans to bring federal resources closer to stakeholders. I applaud USDA for considering North Carolina and I will continue to support USDA as it makes a final decision.”

But there has also been some push back from the U.S. House about the USDA relocations.

The House Agriculture Committee is holding a hearing this week to discuss the potential relocation of the offices. Additionally, an appropriations bill allocated $87.8 million for the ERS’s budget, but that bill also included language that would forbid those funds from being used to relocate the ERS, The New York Times reported.

This is the second government office that North Carolina has publicly competed for in the past year. Last year, Raleigh attempted to land the new U.S. Army Futures Command Center, an Army headquarters assigned the development of new missiles, cannons, tanks and aircraft for modern warfare. That would’ve brought about 500 staffers, but Raleigh narrowly lost out to Austin, Texas, for the expansion.

North Carolina put incentives on the table, specifically an offer of three years’ worth of free rent for office space on N.C. State University’s Centennial Campus, in its unsuccessful bid for the Army office. It’s unclear at the moment whether incentives will play a part in the USDA relocation, and the state’s Commerce Department has declined to comment about the recruitment of the USDA offices.

Around 136 locations across 35 states expressed interest in the USDA offices after the original request for qualification was put out by the USDA."
The EPA says a chemical in Monsanto's weed-killer doesn't cause cancer — but there's compelling evidence the agency is wrong,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Hilary Brueck'],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.businessinsider.com/glyphosate-cancer-dangers-roundup-epa-2019-5,"Gardeners Alva and Alberta Pilliod say they used Monsanto's Roundup spray to keep weeds off their driveway for more than two decades, applying the herbicide while wearing flip flops, shorts, and tank tops. Now, they both have Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL). In a lawsuit, they were awarded $2.05 billion in damages in May.

School groundskeeper Dewayne Johnson, now in his 40s, also used to spray Roundup up to 30 times every summer. He has the same blood cancer as the Pilliods, and won nearly $80 million in a suit last year.

A third man, Edwin Hardeman, used Roundup for more than 25 years to keep weeds off his oak trees. He got NHL, too. A jury in California ruled in March that Roundup was a ""substantial factor"" in his diagnosis.

More than 13,000 similar lawsuits have popped up in the US. Almost all are being filed by gardeners, groundskeepers, and other professional weed-whackers who allege that their consistent, repeated use of Roundup gave them cancer. One of the latest allegations came this week from 44-year-old groundskeeper Jeffrey Sabraski. Sabraski alleges he sprayed Roundup several times per week, wearing nothing but shorts and t-shirts, and has also developed NHL. He's suing Monsanto, as the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported on Wednesday.

Roundup is the most widely-used herbicide in the world, and its key chemical is called glyphosate. The plaintiffs in this recent surge of court cases say that Monsanto didn't sufficiently warn them about the potential health risks associated with the product or tell them how to protect themselves from exposure.

But teasing out the health risks of glyphosate isn't easy. The World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) says the chemical is ""probably"" carcinogenic to humans. But the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the agro-chemical giant Bayer, which now owns Monsanto, both say glyphosate isn't linked to cancer in any meaningful way.

""EPA continues to find that there are no risks to public health when glyphosate is used in accordance with its current label and that glyphosate is not a carcinogen,"" the agency said on its website. Canadian health authorities support the US' stance.

However, peeling back the curtain on the scientific studies that have looked at glyphosate thus far can tell us a lot about how the chemical can indeed be dangerous when people and animals are exposed to it in the wrong ways.

What Monsanto and the EPA say about glyphosate

Glyphosate, which has been in use around the world since the 1970s, blocks an enzyme pathway that helps plants grow. The herbicide's patent expired in 2000, and Indian and Chinese farmers are now the weed-killer's biggest buyers.

It's tricky for epidemiologists to say conclusively that something causes cancer, so what we know so far — from thousands of studies conducted in rats, mice, and humans — is that the pesticide might be linked with cancer, or it might not. Glyphosate might make cancer more likely to sprout up, since there's evidence it can encourage DNA damage. But more research is still needed to learn how, exactly, it affects the human body.

Monsanto maintains there's no good evidence the chemical causes cancer. The company often points to a 2017 study of more than 54,000 pesticide sprayers in Iowa and North Carolina (mostly farmers), which found no statistically significant association between glyphosate and cancer.

The company also often highlights the results of large-scale studies of French, Norwegian, and North American farmers that have found glyphosate to be safe.

But farmers are largely protected from the dangers of herbicides and pesticides, since they spray fields using industrial-grade farm equipment. In that same study, in fact, chemical sprayers who had the most exposure to glyphosate were found to have a slightly higher risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia than people who'd never used the weed-killer. The difference, however, was so small that more research is needed to confirm these results.

The EPA has also consistently said that consumers have nothing to worry about when it comes to glyphosate.

""In 2017, EPA published comprehensive ecological and human health risk assessments for glyphosate. No human health risks were identified,"" the agency said in April. However, the EPA cautioned that ""potential ecological risks were identified for terrestrial and aquatic plants, birds, and mammals, primarily from exposure to spray drift.""

Humans, of course, are terrestrial mammals, too. And gardeners who use lots of glyphosate — without much protection — would arguably also be exposed to spray drift.

""The evidence is not as strong so as to be absolutely sure"" Manolis Kogevinas, of the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, told Business Insider. ""But yeah, there's definitely a chance that they will develop cancer.""

The IARC has a different stance

In March 2015, the IARC convened a group of 17 experts from 11 countries to determine the potential human health dangers of glyphosate, along with four other pesticides and herbicides. The international, non-partisan committee concluded that glyphosate is ""probably"" carcinogenic to humans, based on studies in humans and lab animals.

That's why glyphosate is now a ""Group 2A"" carcinogen, according to IARC. That means that the chemical is considered to be a contributor to cancer, but not on the level of more well known cancer-causers like formaldehyde and UV radiation.

But the IARC also has a complicated history with glyphosate research. Reuters reported in 2017 that the agency had cut sections out of a draft report that suggested glyphosate might not contribute to cancer. In a follow-up letter to Congress, IARC director Christopher Wild wrote that the group revised that draft because some of the data came from ""a review article co-authored by a Monsanto scientist.""

He added that the information from that article ""was insufficient for independent evaluation of the individual studies and the conclusions reached by the Monsanto scientist.""

Why these groups came to different conclusions about glyphosate

A tightly reviewed and vetted paper published in the journal Environmental Sciences Europe earlier this year looked into why the EPA and IARC appear to disagree about the risks of glyphosate. It found that the EPA's conclusions relied mainly on ""unpublished regulatory studies,"" many of them industry-funded. The IARC, on the other hand, looked at ""mostly peer-reviewed studies.""

That could explain why 99% of the glyphosate studies that the EPA considered found that the chemical is not a cancer-causer, while 70% of the studies the WHO looked at suggested it probably is.

""It's kind of easy to understand why EPA would say, 'Well, geez, you know, it must be okay,'"" study author Charles Benbrook, an agricultural economist who now serves as an expert witness for plaintiffs involved in Roundup litigation, told Business Insider. ""It was okay because they were looking at a bunch of negative studies that Monsanto [did]. Monsanto repeated essentially the same study like 30 times.""

Benbrook alleges that the reason so many big payouts are being won in court is that Monsanto didn't properly warn people who used Roundup at home or on a small scale that they should wear protective clothing when they applied the weed-killer.

""It's not farmers out in the field with their large, modern spray rigs, where the operator is inside a steel and glass cab with a sophisticated air filtration system that essentially eliminates exposure,"" Benbrook said. ""Some people are spraying Roundup 6 or 8 hours a day for five days a week with this kind of handheld equipment.""

Monsanto maintains that as long as consumers follow the instructions on the label, glyphosate-based herbicides are perfectly safe. The company also points to hundreds of glyphosate studies in EPA databases that were not Monsanto-funded.

""At the end of the day, whether you're in the court of law, regulatory agencies, or court of public opinion, it's the science that should matter here,"" a Bayer spokesman said in an email to Business Insider. ""And the extensive body of science over 40 years, including several recent human epidemiology studies, shows that glyphosate-based herbicides are not associated with NHL. Customers who know these products best continue to rely on them.""

The company also points to the courtroom testimony of Robert Phalen, an environmental scientist who testified in the Pilliod's trial that human skin actually repels glyphosate. (Phalen once authored a textbook with another scientist also named Robert Phalen, who has said modern air may be ""a little too clean."")

Monsanto tweaked its Roundup formula in Europe

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that pets stay off lawns and plants that have just been sprayed with glyphosate, since animals can develop digestive or intestinal issues if they touch the substance when it hasn't dried. Glyphosate has also recently been linked to more severe cases of fatty liver disease in people.

But beyond glyphosate, there's another compound in Roundup: soap-like detergents called surfactants that help the chemical penetrate the leaves of plants to work its weed-killing magic. Benbrook believes Monsanto should be doing more to warn people about how surfactants work and how to protect themselves.

""It's the surfactants that are carrying the glyphosate first through the skin and inside the body, and then inside of cells where damage can be done to DNA,"" he said.

In Europe, Benbrook noted, surfactant chemicals have been made less toxic for consumers. In the US, however, there's been less regulatory pressure, so Monsanto has not changed Roundup formulas in the same way. ""When juries learn that Monsanto is making a product that's at least 10 times, maybe 100 times safer all across Europe?"" he said. ""That's not acceptable. That's one of the reasons that I think we can expect a continuation of these mammoth punitive damage awards that have occurred in the first three trials.""

Bayer said that allegation is one ""we don't believe is supported by the extensive body of science.""

The company told Business Insider in an email that ""regulators have specifically assessed the safety of the class of surfactants used in glyphosate-based herbicides; in 2009, the U.S. EPA concluded that these surfactants are not carcinogenic.""

The statement added that Monsanto tweaked the surfactants in products sold in Europe ""due to market preferences or country-specific requirements in the region.""

Traces of glyphosate in food don't seem to hurt people

As lawsuits about glyphosate have entered the spotlight, some people have expressed concerns about the trace amounts of the chemical in our food.

The traces of glyphosate found in a bowl of Cheerios or a glass of wine are probably not going to kill anyone, though.

""Using the internationally accepted limits, an average adult male would have to drink over 1,000 liters of wine a day to reach any level of risk,"" pharmacologist Ian Musgrave recently wrote in The Conversation.

That said, it's worth remembering that different people's bodies can react differently to chemicals. The foods pregnant women eat impact how their fetus grows and develops, for example, and the developing digestive systems of infants and toddlers may be more delicate than others. Scientists are still studying how pesticides can impact childhood brain development.

Kogevinas still doesn't think the chemical's presence in food is much to worry about, though.

""If you ask me, is the glyphosate the problem in my food? No, it is not,"" he said. But he noted that he prefers to buy organic produce to avoid pesticides more generally.

Kogevinas lives in Barcelona, where the Roundup formulations adhere to the European standards, but that didn't affect his decision about whether or not to buy it: He has opted never to use glyphosate in his own garden."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has approved the possible sale of eight F-16 aircraft and related equipment to Bulgaria at an estimated cost of $1.67 billion, a Pentagon agency said on Monday.

The prime contractor will be Lockheed Martin Corp, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a statement.

“The proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national security of the United States by helping to improve security of a NATO ally and a key democratic partner of the United States in ensuring peace and stability in this region,” the statement said."

DHS says citizenship approvals rose in 2018,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Stephen Dinan']",05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/may/31/dhs-says-citizenship-approvals-rose-2018/,"Homeland Security reached a five-year high in approvals of citizenship applications last year, and swore in more people as naturalized citizens as well, according to the new statistical report released Friday night.

Those numbers contradict the criticisms of congressional Democrats who had complained about backlogs building at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the Homeland Security branch that handles legal immigration.

The new report also suggests that far from a crackdown, the government is processing more asylum-seeker petitions than any of the last four years. That included a 61 percent increase from 2017 to 2018 in affirmative asylum applications — though refugee interviews are down from more than 1250,000 in 2016, the last year under President Barack Obama, to just 26,400 in fiscal year 2018 under President Trump.

Still, when the whole panoply of humanitarian programs is considered — asylum, refugees, crime victim visas, Temporary Protected Status and screening for credible fear or reasonable fear of persecution — the numbers were 32 percent higher than fiscal year 2017. Credible fear and reasonable fear are first steps on the asylum track.

USCIS’s workload has become contentious in recent years, with immigrant-rights groups accusing the Trump administration of building a bureaucratic “wall” to deny people the chance to enter the U.S. legally. The accusation is a play on their disdain for Mr. Trump’s border wall intended to stop illegal immigration.

Hispanic Democrats in Congress say things are so bad that they requested — and have been granted — an investigation to be done by the Government Accountability Office. Rep. Joaquin Castro, chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said the case backlog is an example of “President Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda.”

Yet the backlog in citizenship applications, for example, exploded during the end of the Obama administration. The Washington Times, which tracked the explosion at the time, sought comment from immigrant-rights activists and lawmakers, including Democrats, but didn’t find many who blamed the Obama administration for the slow processing.

The new numbers from USCIS also detail some of the more hidden parts of the agency’s work, such as its efforts to weed out fraud in legal immigration applications.

Experts say fraud is rampant, but the agency has not released any major fraud assessments in years.

Still, the Fraud Detection and National Security division reported 149,3000 investigative leads or actions year — a 14 percent increase over 2017. That included 30,400 tips of fraud, 7,600 national security matters and nearly 17,000 public safety matters.

FDNS also reported screening social media in 11,700 cases.

"Schiff says impeachment 'is destined for failure,' calls GOP 'cult of the president's personality'",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/schiff-calls-gop-the-cult-of-the-presidents-personality-hints-potential-impeachment-could-fail-without-their-support,"House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said that impeachment ""is destined for failure"" without Republican support, while blasting the party as “the cult of the president’s personality"" and stating that he is actually against ""putting the country"" through impeachment proceedings.

Schiff, on ABC News’ “This Week,” said that while he believes House Democrats could impeach the president, the move would likely fail, due to a lack of support from Republicans in the House and Senate.

NADLER: THERE 'CERTAINLY IS' JUSTIFICATION TO IMPEACH TRUMP

""I think we're going to do what is right for the country, and at this point, the speaker has not reached the conclusion, and I haven't either that it's the best for the country to put us through an impeachment proceeding that we know will, is, destined for failure in the Senate,"" Schiff said.

Schiff added that the president's ""conduct qualifies"" as ""high crimes and misdemeanors,"" but said: ""at the same time, we have to recognize that the reality — that one party, the Republican Party, has turned itself into the cult of the president’s personality and is not likely to act consistent with its constitutional obligations.""

Schiff added, however, that if Trump ""continues to stonewall"" Congress, and ""demonstrate his unfitness for office,"" congressional Democrats could move forward.

""There may be little additional cost to going through that process, even if unsuccessful in the Senate,"" Schiff said. ""But we're not there yet and I think if it is a close call, close calls go against putting the country through that.""

Schiff’s comments come as rank-and-file congressional Democrats have ramped up their calls for impeachment, following a rare public statement by Special Counsel Robert Mueller last week, who announced it was “not an option” for his team of prosecutors to charge the president with a crime due to longstanding Justice Department policy.

Mueller detailed the findings in his probe, maintaining that there was “not sufficient evidence to charge a conspiracy” with regard to whether members of the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russian government during the 2016 presidential election.

But Mueller did not mince words on his inquiry into whether the president obstructed justice.

“If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said that,” Mueller said. “We did not determine whether the president did commit a crime.”

Mueller explained the longstanding Justice Department policy, which states that a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime, and thus said “charging the president was not an option we could consider.”

Mueller added that “it would be unfair to accuse someone of a crime when there could be no court resolution of the charge.”

TRUMP BLASTS MUELLER AS 'HIGHLY CONFLICTED,' CALLS IMPEACHMENT A 'DIRTY, FILTHY, DISGUSTING WORD'

But Mueller said that while the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinion blocks a president from indictment while in office, “the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse the president of wrongdoing.”

Some on the left took that comment as a green light to ramp up talks about impeachment proceedings against the president.

Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., also compared Mueller's remarks to an ""impeachment referral,"" and said, ""We need to start impeachment proceedings. It's our constitutional obligation.""

Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., who is also running for president, said now that Mueller's job is done, ""Impeachment hearings should begin tomorrow.""



House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., whose committee would oversee impeachment proceedings, said that there ""certainly is"" justification to begin impeachment, but said it was critical to first gain the support fo the American people.

“Impeachment is a political act, and you cannot impeach a president if the American people will not support it,” said Nadler, D-N.Y. “The American people, right now, do not support it because they do not know the story. They don’t know the facts.”

Nadler added: “We have to get the facts out. We have to hold a series of hearings, we have to hold the investigations.”

But despite growing calls from rank-and-file Democrats, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has tread lightly on the topic, vowing to investigate allegations against the president, but stopping short of calling to begin impeachment proceedings.

Pelosi, this week, also said that Democrats “want to do what’s right and what gets results.”

“We’re legislating, we’re investigating and we’re litigating,” Pelosi said. “Everybody wants justice, everybody wants the president to be held accountable.”

But House Majority Whip James Clyburn, D-S.C., despite Pelosi’s resistance to the idea, said Sunday he feels Democrats have “already begun” impeachment proceedings.

“We’ve got all these committees doing their work, we’re having hearings, we’ve already won two court cases and there are other cases that are still to be determined, so why should we get out in front of this process?” Clyburn said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

“It’s kind of interesting to me when you talk to people and ask them what they think we ought to do,” he added. “They agree with what we’re doing, it’s just that, emotionally, they would like to see something done and see it done quicker.”

Trump, though, blasted the idea as a “scam.”

“I don’t see how they can,” Trump said Thursday. “It’s a dirty, filthy, disgusting word, impeach. It’s high crimes – there was no high crime. So how do you impeach?”

The White House also has ignored the discussion, and seized only on Mueller's move to announce the official conclusion of the Russia probe. Mueller, last week, said the investigation was officially complete, his office would close, and said he was resigning from the Justice Department to return to private life.

But even without launching official impeachment proceedings, congressional Democrats are leading several high-profile Trump-focused investigations. The House Judiciary Committee, which would oversee potential impeachment proceedings, is investigating the administration’s handling of Mueller’s report, and even voted to hold Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt for defying a subpoena requiring that he turn over an unredacted version of Mueller’s report, and its underlying evidence and documents. The president, in turn, asserted executive privilege over the files in a bid to protect them from release.

Meanwhile, the House Intelligence Committee, Oversight Committee, Ways and Means Committee and Financial Services Committee are all investigating the president and have aggressively sought his financial statements and documents for their probes, as well as testimony from high-profile Trump administration officials.

Thus far, the White House has directed the officials to defy their subpoenas to appear before Congress, and the president has vowed to block “all” subpoenas.

But Republicans, like House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Doug Collins, R-Ga., are shifting their focus to Barr’s review of the origins of the Russia investigation. Barr appointed U.S. attorney from Connecticut John Durham to lead an investigation into the FBI’s original Russia probe, and alleged misconduct related to Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants, as well as the FBI’s use of informants against the Trump campaign in 2016.

“It’s time for us to find out how this started and go from there,” Collins said on “Fox News Sunday.”"
