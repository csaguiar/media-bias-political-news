Trump says 'Iran made a very big mistake' after drone downing,https://www.cnn.com,['Kevin Liptak'],06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/20/politics/trump-iran-drone-downing/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump and his aides were confronting dramatically increased tensions with Iran on Thursday after the downing of a US drone near the Persian Gulf.

""Iran made a very big mistake!"" the President tweeted mid-morning as he and his national security officials huddled to weigh possible responses.

The ominous — if vague — message came after Iran's Revolutionary Guard said it had shot down an ""intruding American spy drone"" after it entered into the country's territory Thursday.

The move caused the volatile situation in the region to deteriorate further. Trump has tightened sanctions on Iran after withdrawing from the Obama-era nuclear deal last year.

An official told CNN that Trump is attending the meeting to mull responses to Iran's action this morning. A second US official told CNN that outgoing Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan and incoming Acting Defense Secretary Mark Esper were both expected to attend. National security adviser John Bolton is also expected to meet with Pentagon officials today.

"Trump is giving up on regime change in Venezuela because it's complicated and he got bored, report says",https://www.businessinsider.com,['Tom Porter'],06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-bored-of-venezuela-as-maduro-clings-to-power-report-2019-6,"President Donald Trump is losing interest in Venezuela after a bid to remove President Nicolás Maduro failed and he clings to power, officials told The Washington Post.

In April, a US backed bid by the Venezuelan opposition to remove Maduro failed, when senior Venezuelan government and military officials reneged on promises to switch sides and instead stood by the president.

According to US officials who spoke to the Post, Trump had viewed the prospect of a US-backed toppling of Maduro as an ""easy win,"" at a time when other foreign policy initiatives had stalled.

A former administration official speaking on condition of anonymity told the publication that Trump had always thought of Venezuela as ""low-hanging fruit"" on which he ""could get a win and tout it as a major foreign policy victory.""

""Five or six months later . . . it's not coming together,"" the official said.

Current and former officials told the Post that Trump had ""chewed out"" national security adviser John Bolton and Latin America policy director Mauricio Claver-Carone because they ""got played"" both by US-backed opposition leader Juan Guaidó, and Maduro regime figures - who claimed to have supported ousting Maduro.

Back in January when Guaidó declared himself interim president of Venezuela and urged the military to turn against Maduro, the US was quick to declare its support, imposing sanctions on Venezuelan government officials sending food aid to the country, and pressing allies to recognise Guaidó as the country's rightful leader.

The Pentagon even refused to rule out using military force to aid ousting Maduro, a move which experts told Business Insider could have resulted in the US being bogged down in a protracted conflict similar to those in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The issue has largely fallen off Trump's Twitter feed, with the president last mentioning Venezuela on June 4, when he claimed Russian forces had withdrawn from the country. Russia denied so much as discussing with the president withdrawing its defense personnel."
‘My Whole Life Is a Bet.’ Inside President Trump’s Gamble on an Untested Re-Election Strategy,https://time.com,['Brian Bennett'],,,,https://time.com/longform/donald-trump-2020/,"‘My whole life is a bet,’ the President of the United States says, resting his forearms on the edge of the Resolute desk in the Oval Office.

It’s a steamy evening in mid-June, and Trump is facing a set of high-stakes tests around the world. Tensions rising with Iran. Tariffs imposed by India. Protesters flooding the streets of Hong Kong. But Trump is confident, ready to joust. He has invited a group of TIME journalists for an interview, blown past the allotted time and settled in for a wide-ranging discussion. Along the way, he orders a Diet Coke with ice with the push of a small red button set into a wooden box on the desk, and directs an aide to fetch a copy of a hand-delivered birthday letter sent from Kim Jong Un.

Politics is rarely out of mind for any man who wills his way into this rarefied sanctum. Especially not one who calls his campaign manager on many days by 7 a.m., and certainly not now, the day before Trump formally kicks off his 2020 re-election bid. So it doesn’t take much prodding for the President, a former casino magnate, to start making book on the sprawling field of Democratic challengers.

A “progressive” will probably win the primary, Trump predicts, running down the competition with evident relish. Joe Biden “is not the same Biden,” he says, adding later, “Where’s the magic?” Kamala Harris, he notes, “has not surged.” Bernie Sanders is “going in the wrong direction.” Elizabeth Warren’s “doing pretty well,” he allows, but Pete Buttigieg “never” had a chance.

Why? “I just don’t feel it,” Trump says. “Politics is all instinct.”

Once again, Trump is putting his own instincts at the center of his campaign. The political mercenaries who tried to discipline his impulses in 2016 have been shown the door. The 2020 campaign is unmistakably Trump’s show. “We all have our meetings,” the President says. “But I generally do my own thing.” Campaign staff have been hired to follow Trump’s lead, and the President has made it known that when he tweets a new policy or improvises an attack at a rally, everyone had better be ready to follow along. “He blows the hole and everyone runs into the breach,” says an aide.

Gone is the rickety operation that eked out an upset victory over Hillary Clinton. In its place, advisers boast, is a state-of-the-art campaign befitting an incumbent President. Trump’s campaign is gearing up to spend $1 billion, and may well get there. His team has spent more money, earlier in the campaign, than any re-election bid in recent history. Campaign staff sit in slick offices in a glass-skinned tower overlooking the Potomac River in Arlington, Va. And Trump has won total control of the Republican National Committee, which fought against him for much of 2016.

Despite the trappings of convention, however, Trump has for the most part thrown out the playbook for incumbency. The last three two-term Presidents were lifted in important ways by a bipartisan message. Bill Clinton ran on the 1994 crime bill and tax reform. George W. Bush ran on keeping America safe in the wake of 9/11. Barack Obama reminded voters that Osama bin Laden was dead and General Motors was alive.

Trump, who lost the popular vote in 2016 and is the only President in the history of Gallup polling never to crack 50% approval, says he’s ready to defy that legacy. “I think my base is so strong, I’m not sure that I have to do that,” he tells TIME, after being asked whether he should reach out to swing voters. The mantra of Trump 2020 is “turnout, turnout, turnout,” as campaign manager Brad Parscale puts it. “People all think you have to change people’s minds. You have to get people to show up that believe in you.”

Insiders know it’s a tough path. In 2016, Trump flipped three Democratic bastions—Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin—by a combined 79,646 votes, capitalizing on Hillary Clinton’s liabilities and energizing disaffected voters. Trump drew an “inside straight,” says his 2016 campaign chief executive Steve Bannon. He can’t count on that luck in 2020. “You have to get every f-cking deplorable,” Bannon says, using his own Clinton-inspired term for Trump’s ardent supporters. “Everybody’s got to show up.”

The key is making Trump’s instinct for America’s sore spots the engine of a political machine designed to inflame supporters. At its core, his campaign is a kind of a perpetual outrage machine. It uses algorithms—automated settings on Internet platforms like Google and Facebook—to place massive digital ad buys anytime Trump creates a firestorm. The cycle is simple: Trump says something controversial or offensive; that drives a surge of search interest in the topic; and that gives his campaign an opening to serve up online ads. The ads encourage supporters to text the campaign, take single-question campaign-generated polls, and buy Trump hats, yard signs, beer coolers and WITCH HUNT decals from the campaign online store, all of which rakes in voter contact data.

Never before has an incumbent President run a campaign this way. “It is a strategy built for the new partisan era,” says Princeton University presidential historian Julian Zelizer. “Candidates are always doing things to turn out their supporters. What has not been tested, at least in modern times, is a strategy in which all the rhetoric and all the policy is just tailored around the turnout crowd and there is no effort to go beyond it.”

Which brings us to the wager on which the gambler has staked a second term. Trump has already smashed the norms of American politics, remade the Republican Party into his cheering gallery and taken the national news cycle hostage. Can he win a second term on the basis that’s he’s governed in the first, by playing to his base?

Nowhere has the machine adapted to the President as it has in the Oval Office. Over the course of TIME’s 57-minute interview, the case for Trump’s re-election unspools through a series of set-piece requests made to his assistants. Pressed over his commitment to get the U.S. out of foreign wars, he has a ready reply. “We defeated ISIS,” he says. “Maybe you could ask somebody to bring me those maps,” he adds, speaking to one of his staff. Soon enough, an aide brings in three printed sheets showing the Islamic State–held territory in Syria shrinking to zero.

When asked whether the latest attacks against oil tankers near the Strait of Hormuz, which U.S. officials blame on Iran, threaten to draw America toward a new, dangerous intervention in the Middle East, he requests favorable data once more. “Do me a favor, will you get the information I had yesterday?” he says to an aide in the next room. “The companies, the countries that benefit from the strait? I want to show you something. China gets 60% of their oil there. Japan gets 25% of their oil. We get very little.”

Of course, ISIS continues to launch attacks. “We’ve taken back the caliphate,” Trump says. “That doesn’t mean one of the crazies doesn’t walk into a store all bombed up.” And it’s not impossible to imagine the world economy or the Middle East descending into chaos if Trump fulfills his wish “to get out” of the region. Even as he downplays Iran’s alleged attack as “very minor,” his outgoing Acting Secretary of Defense announced a deployment of 1,000 more U.S. troops to the Gulf to bolster U.S. installations against what the Pentagon calls an escalation of threats from Iran.

The core of Trump’s pitch — to voters as well as visiting journalists—is that there’s been great progress around the world on his watch. The collapse of Chinese trade talks — and a mounting tariff fight that the Oxford Economics research firm says will shave 0.3% off GDP in 2020 and potentially cost the economy $62 billion in lost output over the next year—is not a failure, it’s a success, he claims. “I give them a lot of credit, but we’ve helped create China. You look at what’s happened over the last period of time, and China wants to make a deal,” he says. “I’m very happy now collecting 25% on $250 billion, which is what we’re doing.” Few trade experts see Trump gaining the upper hand in his tariff battle, but in his telling, multiple countries are looking to make deals with the U.S., thanks to his unconventional approach. He lists some, only off the record, again calling for a document that provides rather weak support.

Eventually, Trump just cuts to the chase. “Look, I think I’ve done so much—could you bring me the list of things, please, give me four of them,” he shouts through the door. “I’ve done more in 2½ years than any President in the history of this country.” Three printed pages with 72 bullet points emerge: Economic growth is up, and unemployment has stayed at or below 4% for 15 months. He signed tax cuts into law, opened up Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling, recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, canceled the Clean Power Plan, withdrew from the Iran deal and the Paris Agreement, issued an order to make a space force the sixth branch of the military. He’s aggrieved by the perception that he doesn’t get credit for what he’s done.

The Oval Office isn’t the natural venue for Trump’s brand of politics. Campaigning is where he really feels at home. So Trump has merged the two to an unprecedented degree — filing for re-election on the first day of his presidency, naming a 2020 campaign manager just a year into his first term and banking at least $100 million for the effort so far. In June, an independent government agency found that senior White House adviser Kelly-anne Conway had violated a law prohibiting federal employees from engaging in partisan politics by repeatedly slamming Trump’s 2020 opponents in media interviews and on Twitter. (“Let me know when the jail sentence starts,” Conway scoffed in May.) Even as Trump sat with TIME, his Administration was tossing red meat out the back of the campaign wagon in the form of a pledge to deport “millions of illegal aliens” in the country.

The nerve center of the re-election bid isn’t Trump Tower, where campaign mail arrives and Eric and Lara Trump have studios for television hits, or even the Arlington office tower. The node closest to Trump’s brain is a narrow room with a single window two doors down the hall from the Oval, where Jared Kushner sits. The President’s son-in-law, a former real estate developer and onetime moderate Democrat, began pitching in with policy research on trade and taxes back in 2015, then took a behind-the-scenes leadership role that November after he saw Trump ignite a crowd in Springfield, Ill. By the end of the campaign, he had emerged as a kind of shadow campaign manager, guiding Trump where possible and reassuring worried Republicans on all fronts. He’s playing a similar role this time around, as an architect of the campaign and troubleshooter, talking nearly every day with Eric Trump, Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel and Parscale.

One of Kushner’s main projects has been populating the leadership ranks of the Republican Party with Trump loyalists. In February 2018, he and Eric Trump installed as head of the re-election effort Parscale, a lanky 43-year-old digital-marketing entrepreneur from San Antonio who engineered Trump’s targeted online-ad blitz in 2016. Parscale has hired about 60 staff and worked with the RNC to create an online fundraising platform, known as WinRed, to compete with ActBlue, the Democratic digital juggernaut. Drawing on his tech-startup background, Parscale is also developing a smartphone app that attempts to “gamify” Trump supporters’ engagement with the campaign by offering prizes. In exchange for getting friends to share their contacts, hosting Trump events in their home or knocking on doors, voters get perks like better rally seats, photos with the President, signed hats and other incentives.

Parscale, a 6 ft. 8 in. former college basketball recruit, sees his role as Trump’s facilitator. “He’s the real campaign manager, the real finance director, the real director of everything,” Parscale says. “My job is to build a team that’s ready to deal with whatever happens.”

More often than not, the President will go off-script, and a campaign official likens Trump’s knack for riling voters to an old night-fishing trick, shining high-power flashlights into the water to draw quarry to the surface. “The United States is a pond. The President is like the lights,” says the official, who requested anonymity to speak candidly. “If he’s not there, there’s no light, fish are deep, I need a really big lure, it’s expensive.” But, the adviser continues, when Trump lights things up with an issue like immigration or trade, it becomes easy to draw prospective voters out.

A rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., in late March offers a case in point. Trump issued an off-the-cuff threat to “close the damn border” if Mexico didn’t stop two large caravans heading toward the southwest border. The crowd erupted in cheers. Electrified by the response, Trump told aides he wanted to move ahead with a plan to close ports of entry. A series of three tweets were drafted to be released on Trump’s Twitter feed the next morning, announcing that large sections of the border would be closed the following week.

As news stories and web searches spiked, the campaign bought digital ads about immigration. Though the President later backed off the threat, his campaign kept the momentum going by spending $250,000 over the next nine weeks pushing out ads on Facebook and paying for clicks on Google Search. “The content we produce, the advertising we platform, there’s never been anything like it in politics,” Parscale says. “We have our own television show in a way.”

Using such techniques, Parscale has built a list of 35 million voter contacts. The outreach has been churning for more than a year now. When Trump barnstormed Republican strongholds before the midterm elections, officials asked attendees to text wall or Trump to phone numbers plastered on signs and scoreboards inside the arena. Those cell-phone numbers, and other data collected through RSVPs, help the campaign construct a community-level map of energized supporters and prospective volunteers—a cohort they call “the Army of Trump.”

Since 2015, Trump has used rallies to serve up a potent cocktail of tribal resentment and rage. They thrill the President as much as anyone: talking to TIME in the Oval, he boasted of 120,000 people requesting tickets to his official re-election kickoff on June 18 in an Orlando arena. “This is the size of Madison Square Garden. I think it’s slightly larger,” he says. “It’s where the Orlando Magic plays. It is packed. We’ll have thousands and thousands of people outside.”

The familiar slogan has been updated—Make America Great Again has become Keep America Great—but the tone of the show has not. Trump promised in Orlando to build a wall to keep out dangerous “aliens” and called the Democrats’ immigration policies “the greatest betrayal of the American middle class and, frankly, American life.” The swamp in Washington still needs draining, according to the President, even though it’s now his bog. The crowd’s enthusiasm waned when he talked about his achievements, but it broke out in raucous calls to “lock up” Hillary Clinton when he mentioned her name. “Our radical Democrat opponents are driven by hatred, prejudice and rage,” he said in Orlando, pointing to House efforts to investigate his 2016 campaign’s ties to Russia and possible obstruction of justice by the President. “They want to destroy you, and they want to destroy our country as we know it.”

Jim Messina, who ran President Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign, says this approach helps Trump dominate the national conversation on issues, like immigration, that motivate his base. Democratic strategists worry that the Trump campaign will have the chance to spend tens of millions of dollars building a campaign in the field and defining his opponents for months, all while the Democrats are mired in a long and brutal primary battle.

What mystifies many is that Trump, a lifelong pitchman, has never bothered to sell himself to the broader public. “The thing they are not doing, which I think is really odd, is doing any sort of general-election messaging,” Messina says. “By this point [in the 2012 election], we were in the Midwest trying to tell the economic-recovery story, which you would kind of expect them to be doing right now. Instead every single thing they’re doing is about the base.” The problem with that, he adds, is the nation — including the battleground states that will decide the election — is growing more diverse every year, which sharpens Trump’s need to expand his coalition. “If you just do a base strategy, then you’re not going to be able to expand to any states,” Messina says. “And I think that is where this election is going.”

There is, of course, a large section of the country, the government and its centers of power that have not bent to Trump’s politics. That can infuriate the President. Halfway through the TIME interview, the subject turns to special counsel Robert Mueller, who survived nearly two years of attacks by Trump and his allies to produce a damning 448-page document enumerating Russia’s efforts to help Trump win in 2016.

Some of the people closest to Trump offered damaging evidence. His former chief of staff, White House counsel, deputy campaign chairman, Deputy National Security Adviser, staff secretary, communications director and others testified under oath, at risk of prison time, to acts by Trump that Mueller said were designed to “influence” and “control” the probe. While Mueller declined to say whether those acts amounted to obstruction of justice, Democrats and at least one Republican say they did. Pressed by TIME about his aides’ testimony, Trump becomes angry. “It’s incredible,” he says. “With all I’ve done, with the tremendous success I’ve had, that TIME magazine writes about me the way they write is a disgrace, O.K.?”

The moment provides a glimpse into why the Trump re-election operation runs on perpetual outrage. Those closest to him know a conventional campaign couldn’t regulate a man who scorns political and ethical norms and is unable to let challenges to his authority pass. He isn’t faking his outrage—about the media, the Mueller report, his opponents—and that anger, whatever its ultimate source, is politically powerful. “Nobody has been treated as unfairly as Donald Trump,” the President says.

That in turn means that Trump’s team may not have much choice in the kind of campaign it runs. “A unique challenge Trump’s campaign will always have is Trump is not tethered to the campaign,” says Robby Mook, who managed Clinton’s 2016 presidential bid. “He is going to go out and do whatever he does every day. So his campaign will have to figure out, strategically and tactically, how to cope with that.” The machine that Kushner and Parscale have built is designed to harness the power of Trump’s grievance message, which resonates with tens of millions of voters. “He’s not pivoting,” Kushner tells TIME. “The President is who he is and doesn’t pretend to be anything else.”

But they also recognize they need to do more. The campaign is knocking on doors in African-American enclaves in Florida and North Carolina to talk up the landmark prison-reform law Trump signed in December 2018. It’s also testing how to pitch Latino voters in New Mexico and Nevada on Trump’s Chinese tariffs. “The No. 1 issue driving Latino voters to like him and support him is his fight against China,” a senior campaign official says, adding that the campaign is working to figure out why that’s an animating issue.

But cranking the outrage machine for so long may make it hard for voters to hear a subtler frequency. Privately, some Trump advisers say they need to do a better job touting the President’s record, especially on the economy. But can that message break through the pain Trump’s tariffs have caused for many voters? And in the meantime, a large chunk of the campaign budget is still being spent on hot-button topics like immigration. “They are trying to say they are running a normal campaign and doing outreach,” says Messina, who now tracks ad buys for his consulting firm. “It’s all show.”

For the moment, polls show Trump trailing the Democratic front runners in some key states. Trump is being briefed on polling data at least twice a month, and in the past few weeks has been requesting more granular breakdowns, according to a former adviser who speaks to Trump. “He’s aware that he’s not beating any of the major candidates right now one-on-one nationally,” the adviser says. He fired some of his pollsters after internal surveys were leaked showing him trailing Biden.

Trump himself doesn’t seem to know whether he can really beat the odds. Still fuming about Mueller, Trump keeps coming back to the investigation and makes contradictory claims about its effects. “Based on the economy, I should be up 15 or 20 points higher,” he says, but “the thing that I have that nobody’s ever had before, from the day I came down the escalator, I have had a phony witch hunt against me.” Minutes later, he asserts the opposite. The Mueller probe “turned out to be an asset,” he says, “because it’s really energized our base like I’ve never seen before.”

There’s no question Trump has significant advantages as he looks ahead to the re-election fight, beginning with time and money and the biggest megaphone on the planet. In his position, most incumbents would appeal for four more years by pledging to unite the country. Casting this approach aside makes him “historically unusual” for an incumbent President, says Timothy Naftali, former director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum. “He basically wants to beat the house, politically, again.” Whether he wins his bet or not, Trump’s campaign will test the power of outrage. —With reporting by Tessa Berenson, Massimo Calabresi, Edward Felsenthal and Abby Vesoulis/Washington

Opinion | What ‘Chernobyl’ Teaches About Trump,https://www.nytimes.com,['Bret Stephens'],06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/20/opinion/chernobyl-hbo-lies-trump.html,"The result is that people lose the capacity to think for themselves, to make judgments, to find a rational basis for taking any sort of stand on principle. They become sheep.

On Tuesday, The Times’s Jeremy Peters published a profile of the conservative radio host Michael Savage, an early and fervent Trump supporter who occasionally voices his disappointment with the president, always from a right-wing perspective. Many of his 7.5 million listeners don’t take it too well. As Savage puts it, to “too many people” Trump is more than a human being, “he’s a demigod.”

Those people — the ones who brook no criticism of Trump, ever, on any subject — are the sheep.

That’s not anything like a majority of the country. But it is further poisoning a society in which the idea of truth was already being Balkanized (our truth), personalized (my truth), problematized (whose truth), and trivialized (your truth) — all before Trump came along and defined truth as whatever he can get away with.

The most telling thing about The Post’s count of Trump’s untruths is how un-shocking it becomes as the number grows larger. Like money, lies are subject to an inflationary rule: The more there are in official circulation, the less each one matters.

All this is unfolding without the assistance of the K.G.B. or some other instrument of a repressive state to enforce a line and dissolve the distinction between fact and fiction. But the effect is no less damaging. A president who will say anything speaks to a base that will believe anything. Meanwhile, the rest of the country doesn’t believe a word.

What happens when we have our own Chernobyl, or another 9/11, or something worse, and the credibility of government becomes essential to the survival of the state? What happens when the word of the president actually matters?

Watching “Chernobyl,” I was left with this disquieting thought: At least the Soviet Union had Mikhail Gorbachev, with his instinctive decency and honesty, at the top during that crisis.

E.P.A. Finalizes Its Plan to Replace Obama-Era Climate Rules,https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/climate/epa-coal-emissions.html,"The new rule, which is expected to come into effect within 30 days, assumes that the forces of the market will guide the country to a future of cleaner energy by naturally phasing out coal over time. It imposes only modest requirements on coal plants.

While it instructs states to reduce emissions, the new measure sets no targets. Instead, it lets states decide how much carbon reduction they consider reasonable and suggests ways to improve efficiency at individual power plants.

Jeffrey R. Holmstead, who served in the E.P.A. during both Bush administrations and now represents utility companies as a lawyer for the firm Bracewell, said he thought the current Supreme Court would be skeptical of any presidential effort to regulate carbon emissions under existing law.

“I t will establish what the E.P.A. can and can’t do,” Mr. Holmstead said of the new Trump rule. “I think it really will tie the hands of future administrations.”

Environmental groups say the Trump rule will slow the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions at a time when scientists warn that countries must rapidly decarbonize to avoid the most severe effects of climate change, including heat waves, extreme storms, droughts and floods.

Mr. Wheeler has said the Trump administration’s plan is legally sound, will not damage the economy and will still go a long way toward reducing carbon .

He maintained that, when the new measure is fully implemented, it will reduce carbon emissions in the power sector by 34 percent below 2005 levels, roughly equal to the goals of the Clean Power Plan."
Trump tells Fox News DOJ looking into whether his phone calls were monitored,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'President Trump', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-hannity-campaign-launch-justice-department-phone-calls-monitored,"One day after formally launching his 2020 presidential bid, President Trump told Fox News' ""Hannity"" exclusively on Wednesday that investigators are working to determine whether his personal phone calls were secretly monitored by U.S. intelligence agencies during the 2016 campaign -- a possibility he called ""the ultimate.""

Trump also hammered House Democrats for putting his former top communication advisor Hope Hicks ""through hell,"" after pictures of Hicks testifying before a closed-door session on Capitol Hill earlier in the day leaked on social media.

Hicks is the Executive Vice President and Chief Communications Officer for Fox Corporation, and Fox News is a subsidiary of Fox Corporation.

""What's happened to the Democrats -- and in the meantime, they're not doing any work in Congress,"" Trump told Sean Hannity, calling the party ""unhinged.""

""They're not allowed to do that. It's probably illegal,"" Trump said, referring to the leaked pictures of Hicks. Some Democrats complained that Hicks, in her appearance before the House Judiciary Committee, was ordered by the White House to stay quiet about her time as an aide to Trump, citing legal privileges.

But, Trump condemned Democrats' ongoing hearings on collusion and obstruction as an attempt at a ""do-over"" of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.

""Take a look at Ukraine,"" Trump said. ""How come the FBI didn't take the server from the DNC? Just think about that one, Sean."" That was a reference to the DNC's decision in 2016 to turn over its server to the private security firm Crowdstrike, rather than the FBI, after what prosecutors said was a Russian-led hack.

The Hill's John Solomon reported earlier Wednesday that the FBI, in search warrant affidavits, relied heavily on leaked Ukrainian financial documents concerning former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort -- even though the bureau was repeatedly warned that the documents were untrustworthy and likely fake.

Earlier this year, Ukraine Prosecutor General Yurii Lutsenko opened a probe into the so-called ""black ledger"" files that led to Manafort's abrupt departure from the Trump campaign. The investigation commenced after an unearthed audio recording showed that a senior Ukrainian anticorruption official apparently admitted to leaking Manafort's financial information in 2016 -- including his ties to pro-Russian actors in Ukraine -- to benefit Clinton.

CLINTON-UKRAINE ALLEGATIONS 'BIG,' TRUMP SAYS

A Ukrainian court recently ruled that the Manafort leak amounted to illegal interference in the U.S. election. A 2017 investigation by Politico found that Ukrainian officials not only publicly sought to undermine Trump by questioning his fitness for office, but also worked behind the scenes to secure a Clinton victory.

""I don't hear Russia much anymore. You know, they've given up on that one."" — President Trump

Trump told Hannity the episode was hardly surprising, given that the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee (DNC), through the firm Fusion GPS, funded British ex-spy Christopher Steele's creation of an unverified and largely discredited dossier. The FBI went on to cite the dossier in secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court applications to surveil former Trump aide Carter Page.

""I think it's a disgrace,"" Trump said.

Numerous issues with the Steele dossier's reliability have surfaced, including several that were brought to the FBI's attention before it cited the dossier in its FISA application and subsequent renewals. Mueller's report made plain, for example, that former Trump attorney Michael Cohen did not travel to Prague to conspire with Russian hackers seeking to access Democrat files, as the dossier alleged.

Mueller also was unable to substantiate the dossier's claims that Page had received a large payment relating to the sale of a share of Rosneft, a Russian oil giant.

""The fact is, they were spying on my campaign, using intelligence agencies to do it. ... We're trying to figure out whether they listened to my calls. That would be the ultimate. We'll see what happens. If that happens, we'll probably find out. If they spied on my campaign and they may have, it will be one of the great revelations in history of this country. It will be very interesting. I think we're gonna find out.""

Trump said Attorney General Bill Barr is working ""very hard"" to get to the bottom the matter.

DOJ INVESTIGATING NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AS PART OF ONGOING REVIEW OF FBI MISCONDUCT

The lengthy phone conversation began with Trump recounting the Tuesday night launch of his campaign in the jam-packed Amway Center in Orlando. Thousands of Trump supporters arrived more than 40 hours in advance to secure a spot, despite sweltering Florida heat. Some had been camped in chairs for several nights.

""It was an incredible scene -- and outside there were thousands of people,"" Trump told Hannity, comparing the atmosphere to that of a national college football championship. ""It was just an electric evening. ... It's a tailgate party for our country.""

Trump noted that the U.S. has become ""number one in the world in energy,"" referring to the fact that the U.S. is the world's leading crude oil producer. The head of the International Energy Agency said in 2018 that, because of the ""shale revolution,"" the U.S. ""is becoming the undisputed leader of oil and gas production worldwide.”

The positive economic indicators, Trump said, have led Democrats to desperately pivot to discussing obstruction, now that Mueller's report found no evidence of Russian collusion by the Trump campaign, despite multiple efforts by Russian-linked actors to involve the Trump team in its hacking efforts.

""I don't hear Russia much anymore. You know, they've given up on that one,"" Trump said, before touting his administration's economic successes. ""We have the best, lowest unemployment rate for blacks, Asians, Hispanics -- nobody's ever seen numbers like this... If the other side had won, we'd have gone into a depression.

""We have more poeple working today -- almost 160 million people -- than have ever worked in the history of our country,"" Trump added. ""Think of it -- it's a great number.""

Trump also denied a Wall Street Journal report that he will live-tweet the upcoming Democrat primary debates, but suggested it might not be a bad idea.

""Instead of fake news, I'll make them correct news -- and maybe that's OK,"" Trump joked.

""When I make a speech, like last night -- there was a fantastic woman in the front with a sign, 'Please keep tweeting, it matters,'"" Trump continued. ""And, I think it does matter. I don't do it because I enjoy it. When somebody says an outright lie on MSNBC or CNN ... I can counteract those lies, and I have many more followers than they do."""
"Marine general 'bullied' subordinates, 'devalued women': Pentagon inspector general",https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/marine-general-bullied-subordinates-devalued-women-pentagon-inspector/story?id=63814450,"A Department of Defense Inspector General report concluded that a Marine Corps general ""disparaged, bullied, and humiliated subordinates, devalued women, and created a negative ... work environment that led to a general distrust of his impartiality and leadership.""

In response, the Marine Corps said it would ""take appropriate action in light of the substantiated misconduct.""

Brig. Gen. Norman Cooling was serving as the Legislative Assistant to the Commandant of the Marine Corps when the Senate Armed Services Committee sent a complaint to then-Defense Secretary James Mattis about Cooling's conduct, leading to the DOD IG investigation which was initiated on March 15, 2018.

The IG concluded that Cooling violated sections of U.S. Code, as well as Defense Department and Navy regulations. He is currently serving as the Assistant Deputy Commandant for Plans, Policies and Operations for the Marine Corps, after being removed from his previous position last year due to the investigation.

After reviewing the IG's draft report, Cooling acknowledged that he ""fell short of maintaining a positive climate throughout the Office of Legislative Affairs (OLA)"" and accepted responsibility for that shortfall, but said the report did not provide ""sufficient evidence by any legitimate legal standard to support a finding that I created a hostile work environment or that I made demeaning remarks about women,"" according to the IG.

""The Marine Corps takes all allegations of misconduct seriously, regardless of rank,"" Marine Corps spokesman Maj. Brian Block told ABC News in a statement on Wednesday. ""The Marine Corps is currently reviewing the DoD IG's report and will take appropriate action in light of the substantiated misconduct.""

""The Marine Corps expects every Marine, uniformed and civilian -- and particularly those in leadership positions -- to hold themselves to the highest standards in their personal and professional conduct. When Marines fall short of our standards they are held accountable,"" he said.

Sgt. Joseph Johnson/U.S. Department of Defense

The IG interviewed over three dozen witnesses and reviewed 11,650 official emails, along with other relevant documents before determining, according to the report, that ""on numerous occasions ... Cooling’s comments and conduct demeaned, bullied, and humiliated his subordinates.""

Among the details of the report:

""BGen Cooling told a female [non commissioned officer] who aspires to be a Marine Corps pilot that he would rather have his daughter work in a brothel than be a pilot.""

""He loudly and publicly berated two staff members whom he accused of trying to 'f**k' him and asked them repeatedly, 'Where the f**k have you been?'""

""He publicly yelled to a staff member that if the staff member did not give him requested budget information he would castrate the staff member.""

""In a staff meeting, he bullied a staff officer when he publicly berated, belittled, and singled her out for ridicule in front of her peers when a Member of Congress canceled a meeting with the Assistant Commandant. He then told his entire staff in the same meeting that if any of them failed to get an office call for the Assistant Commandant with a Member of Congress, he was 'going to jump out this f**king window.'""

""He bullied a subordinate when he attempted to damage her reputation by spreading a rumor about her and potentially damaging her future career by warning the most senior Marine Corps officer in the subordinate’s career field, 'watch yourself, you’ve got to watch out' for her. BGen Cooling further blamed the subordinate for the SASC complaint against him, his removal from the Legislative Assistant position, and this investigation into his conduct.""

Cooling further told the IG that the report ""can only legitimately establish that I made a few isolated comments that some construed in the worst possible way and told third parties so that they ended up in the [SASC complaint].""

""At no time during that brief assignment, nor at any other time during my career, did I ever discriminate against anyone for anything other than their performance,"" he said in the report.

Cooling graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1986 and has deployed multiple times to Iraq and Afghanistan throughout his military career."

The State Department headquarters in Washington in March 2009. (J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press)

Columnist

The State Department official in charge of U.S. arms control negotiations with Moscow and her husband had a years-long friendship with GOP operative Paul Erickson, the former boyfriend of convicted unregistered Russian agent Maria Butina — ties this official did not disclose to her superiors or to Congress during her confirmation process in the spring of 2018.

Erickson officiated the June 2017 wedding of Andrea Thompson, the undersecretary of state for arms control and international security affairs, and David Gillian, a former senior Australian army officer, three administration officials and Erickson’s lawyer have confirmed. At the time, Thompson was serving as national security adviser to Vice President Pence. Four months before the wedding, Gillian had transferred Erickson $100,000, which federal officials allege Erickson stole from Gillian, FBI and court documents show. Thompson never disclosed these ties to her superiors until approached this week by this columnist, the three administration officials said.

The wedding took place about six months before Erickson and Butina were publicly identified as being connected to Russian influence operations inside the United States. But by the time of Thompson’s confirmation, allegations of the couple’s influence activities had been widely reported.

Sen. Robert Menendez (N.J.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told me that his panel will investigate Thompson’s lack of disclosure to both Congress and the FBI.

“These reports about Under Secretary Thompson raise questions about how forthcoming she was with all relevant information during her confirmation process,” Menendez said. “I hope that any relevant connections implicating financial interests, or to someone who our government has charged with being an agent of a foreign power, would have been fully reviewed and vetted by the FBI during the security clearance process, and disclosed to the Foreign Relations Committee. It is not clear that happened.”

Thompson’s failure to disclose her contacts and her husband’s business dealings with Erickson is viewed inside the administration as a serious lack of judgment — considering that her former boss, then-national security adviser Michael Flynn, was fired for lying about his contacts with Russian officials.

Several administration officials told me Thompson should have disclosed these connections voluntarily, since she holds top security clearances and has worked for decades as a U.S. intelligence officer. Her failure to report this information, these officials suggested, represented an intelligence vulnerability that could have been used against her.

“When the person who marries you gets into trouble with the Russians and your job is to negotiate with the Russians, you have to disclose that,” a senior administration official told me. “Everybody with an intelligence clearance knows that.”

Butina attended the Thompson-Gillian wedding in South Dakota as Erickson’s guest, according to Erickson’s lawyer, William Hurd. Butina did not have significant interactions with either Thompson or Gillian at the wedding, beyond greetings and congratulations, Hurd told me.

“Paul Erickson had known Andrea Thompson and David Gillian for years. He considered them both friends and agreed to officiate at their wedding in 2017,” Hurd told me. “Maria Butina came to the wedding because Paul Erickson was dating her. If Paul had been dating a different woman, then that woman would have come to the wedding.”

The State Department declined to comment on the record. Thompson, through a State Department spokesperson, also declined to comment. Butina’s lawyer declined to comment. Gillian and the McChrystal Group, the consulting firm where he now works, did not respond to requests for comment.

As a career intelligence officer, Thompson would have been required under updated executive branch regulations to self-report any significant unofficial contacts with a foreign national or any attempt by a foreign national to gain influence.

There is no evidence to suggest Thompson or Gillian had significant interactions with Butina outside the wedding, either. Sources close to Thompson told me that Erickson had known the Thompson family for many years in South Dakota.

Thompson is not alleged to have been involved in her husband’s business dealings with Erickson. Additionally, there is no evidence Thompson was deliberately untruthful to her bosses, federal investigators or congressional officials during her vetting or confirmation process, which took place from late 2017 until her confirmation on April 26, 2018.

In December 2017, after Thompson had left the vice president’s office and was working at the State Department before being nominated for her current role, the New York Times revealed that Erickson had emailed top Trump campaign officials in May 2016 offering to set up a high-level back channel with the Russian government led by President Vladimir Putin.

Under the subject line “Kremlin Connection,” Erickson proposed that Trump could “make first contact” with “President Putin’s emissary” at an upcoming event hosted by the National Rifle Association, of which Erickson was a long-time member. The planned meeting did not take place, according to the Times.

But according to federal prosecutors, this was just one of a series of actions Erickson took in cooperation with Butina to make connections in Republican political circles and set up meetings for Alexander Torshin, who was then a deputy governor of the Russian central bank.

In July 2018, the Justice Department unveiled a criminal complaint against Butina, charging her with “conspiracy to act as an agent of the Russian Federation within the United States without prior notification to the Attorney General.” In an accompanying affidavit, the FBI claimed that ""U.S. Person 1,"" whom several reports have identified as Erickson, worked closely with Butina to build her influence inside the United States and “advance the interests of the Russian Federation.”

The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has opened an investigation into Butina, Torshin and their activities inside the United States. The FBI is also reportedly investigating whether Torshin helped funnel Russian money through the NRA to help the Trump campaign.

Erickson has never been charged with any crime related to Butina, Torshin or the NRA. In February, he was indicted in a seemingly unrelated matter, accused by federal prosecutors of defrauding dozens of investors related to a plan to build retirement facilities and housing for oil workers in North Dakota. According to an April 2018 FBI affidavit in that case, one of Erickson’s last investors was Gillian.

“Erickson told David Gillian he would receive a return of between 25 percent and 75 percent within approximately one year,” the affidavit alleges.

“In reality, the bank records indicated that Gillian’s $100,000 was not invested in real estate or anything else,” the affidavit continues. “In fact, that money was used to pay routine expenses and to pay off a previous investor, Congressman Marshall Sanford. Some of Gillian’s money went to Erickson’s girlfriend, Maria Butina.”

The criminal complaint against Erickson alleges he wired more than $20,000 to American University, where Butina was studying, three months after taking Gillian’s money. Gillian is now suing Erickson in civil court in South Dakota regarding the investment. Hurd, Erickson’s lawyer, has previously called the fraud charges against Erickson “unfounded.”

To be clear, Thompson’s connections with Erickson are not a crime and Erickson is innocent until proven guilty. Gillian is not accused of wrongdoing and is allegedly a victim of Erickson.

Rep. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said Thompson’s situation was symptomatic of larger staffing issues plaguing the Trump administration.

“From clumsy vetting to chronic failure to fill vacant positions, it’s no wonder there’s such dysfunction in the executive branch,” Engel said. “The White House needs to get its act together to make sure the officials in charge of protecting our national security meet the highest standards and comply fully with all laws and regulations on disclosure.”

WV MetroNews Final rule filed on Trump's Affordable Clean Energy plan,http://wvmetronews.com,['Metronews Staff'],06-19-2019,2019,6,http://wvmetronews.com/2019/06/19/coal-industry-reacts-to-new-epa-rule/,"By MetroNews Staff in | June 19, 2019 at 2:02PM

CHARLESTON, W.Va. –West Virginia Coal Association President Bill Raney was cautiously optimistic about the Trump administration’s Affordable Clean Energy Rule.

File Bill Raney

The measure, announced Wednesday, would gut an Obama-era rule which required U.S. power companies to reduce carbon emissions by 35 percent over their 2005 levels by the year 2030.

“It’s positive for the coal industry for certain because we struggled with the Obama administration and everything they did,” Raney said.

However, it’s unclear just how quickly the new rule would have any noticeable impact on the coal industry or if it will at all.

Many power producers have already shutdown older coal-fired power plants and switched to alternative fuels like natural gas in newer operations to generate electricity. Some companies are already on a glide path to meet the standards which were imposed by the Obama-era rule.

“I think it will be slow and drawn out,” Raney said on MetroNews “Talkline.” “It’s a matter of an obstacle that was placed in front off the utility industry and it’s going to take a while to turn that around.”

In an article published last fall in Sierra, the national magazine for the Sierra Club, New York University School of Law Professor Richard Revesz predicted the change by the Trump administration would not stand up in court.

“The agency has a weak position, in part because the agency acknowledges that their rule will produce tens of billions of dollars of foregone benefits relative to the Clean Power Plan,” Revesz said.

Patrick Morrisey

West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey gave credit to President Trump for the new rule.

“President Trump has been a friend of our state, and of coal, and the Affordable Clean Energy rule allows our state the autonomy to regulate energy and air quality without much of the unlawful federal overreach of the so-called Clean Power Plan,” Morrisey said in a statement.

U.S. Senator Shelley Moore Capito also praised the rule.

“The EPA’s final Affordable Clean Energy rule is another sign that the Trump administration is committed to commonsense regulation and ending the War on Coal, and that striking a balance between the economy and the environment is absolutely possible,” Capito said “The Obama administration’s so-called ‘Clean Power Plan’ was an unrealistic and strangling regulation that was devastating to West Virginia’s energy economy.”

File Capito

Capito said the new rule would allow states and energy producers to reduce emissions at an “achievable pace” without hurting the economy.

“Combined with rolling back unnecessary bureaucratic red tape and compliance costs, this will keep American energy affordable and competitive on the world stage. West Virginians don’t have to choose between a clean environment and a thriving economy. We demand both; and with this plan, we can achieve both,” Capito said.

Senator Joe Manchin, who serves as the ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said he pleased fossil fuel plants have more flexibility but addressing climate change should remain a top priority.

“I never supported the CPP because it required coal plants to install emission controls that were not ‘commercially proven’ at the time. It is unreasonable to ask power plants to utilize technologies that do not yet exist, and penalize them if they don’t. For this reason and others, the regulation became a subject of intense litigation causing further uncertainty for our power sector,” he said.

Gov. Justice Justice applauded the rule, calling it “President Trump’s rollback of Obama’s war on coal.”

“The Affordable Clean Energy Rule will give power where it belongs: back to the states. Places like California may be able to survive entirely on solar and wind and that’s great. But here in West Virginia, we live and die by the coal we mine and the oil and natural gas we produce,” he said.

“The Obama restrictions were so ridiculous and out of touch with the reality of life here in West Virginia, that thousands of people lost the lifestyle and standard of living they were accustomed to. This economic hopelessness in West Virginia led to a drug epidemic that we are still trying to recover from.”"

The House Intelligence Committee has “very little visibility” into the three Justice Department investigations into the intelligence officials who launched the Russia probe, the panel’s chairman Adam Schiff said on Wednesday.

It’s a situation that has Schiff concerned, given his fears that the probes are politically motivated.

Story Continued Below

“It’s an effort to amplify the counter-narrative, and to ignore what the Russians did, and what they will do in the next election,” Schiff said at a National Press Club event on Wednesday. ""We’ve already seen a disturbing erosion of our checks and balances” with regard to the White House’s contact with DOJ, he added.

DOJ’s Office of the Inspector General has been investigating the origins of the Russia probe since last year. Attorney General Bill Barr launched a parallel investigation in May, tapping John Durham to spearhead the inquiry around the time special counsel Robert Mueller was wrapping up the two-year probe, which concluded Trump’s campaign did not criminally conspire with Russian intermediaries to disrupt the 2016 election. Barr said he wanted to find out whether there was inappropriate government “spying” on the Trump campaign that drove suspicions of a Kremlin link.

According to The New York Times, Durham’s efforts have since zeroed in on the CIA analysts responsible for the conclusion that Russian President Vladimir Putin interfered in the 2016 election specifically to help Trump win. The focus has alarmed some in the national security community who worry that Durham’s probe will cast doubt on the apolitical nature of intelligence gathering and give credence to the president’s misleading claims that Obama-era officials tried to sabotage his campaign.

Those fears have been exacerbated by Trump’s decision to give Barr sweeping declassification authority, a power usually delegated to intelligence leaders for their own evidence.

Schiff indicated that, despite asking the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Justice Department to keep him informed about any official declassification requests from Barr, the House Intelligence Committee — which oversees the intelligence community — remains largely in the dark about what the agencies are having to produce and whether their cooperation is voluntary or being compelled.

“I have discussed personally with the Director of National Intelligence [Dan] Coats my profound concern about what Bill Barr is doing in particular,” Schiff said. “Namely, his desire to provide cover to the president by investigating the investigators.”

Others are less anxious about Durham’s probe, noting that the CIA has been investigated by Durham before and is accustomed to this kind of oversight. They point to 2008, when Attorney General Michael Mukasey appointed Durham to conduct a criminal investigation into the destruction of torture tapes made by the CIA years earlier. That probe was expanded and later resulted in full criminal investigations into the deaths of two detainees, which ultimately wrapped in 2012 with no charges brought against anyone in the agency.

It’s unclear, though, what mandate Durham is operating under and whether he is looking at the intelligence agencies with an eye to recommending criminal charges. He has not been appointed to lead a criminal investigation, and the Justice Department has formally described the inquiry as only as a “review.” Durham also won’t be leaving his day job as the U.S. Attorney for the District of Connecticut.

Schiff, meanwhile, said he is still trying to get answers from the FBI about the counterintelligence findings of Mueller’s investigation, and whether the counterintelligence investigation launched in early 2017 into Trump himself was ever formally closed.

While the FBI has “started to provide some answers” and increased briefings, Schiff said, they’ve been reluctant to go into any detail. “They’re just telling us about process,” Schiff said. “Like everything else, it’s like pulling teeth, and our patience is growing fatigued at this point.”"
Schumer Requests Investigation Into Mnuchin’s Handling of the Harriet Tubman $20 Bill,https://www.nytimes.com,['Alan Rappeport'],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/us/politics/schumer-harriet-tubman-bill.html,"In May, Mr. Mnuchin said at a congressional hearing that the design imagery of the bill would not be ready until 2026 because of the complexity of creating new anti-counterfeiting measures. He would not commit to Tubman ever appearing on its face and said that a future Treasury secretary would make that decision.

Mr. Mnuchin has denied delaying the process and said in a statement last week that Treasury and the Bureau of Engraving and Printing remain committed to the schedule of new $20 notes going into circulation by 2030.

Len Olijar, the director of the bureau, said that, for security reasons, design concepts of a new $20 note were never going to be released next year and that “everything remains on the table” regarding whose portrait will be on the new bill. Mr. Olijar said that the image of a $20 note that The Times obtained featuring Tubman’s portrait, which was created by the bureau, was not an advanced design concept.

After Mr. Trump took office, the Treasury Department removed from its website all mentions of Tubman or the planned changes to the $20, $10 and $5 notes that the Obama administration set in motion. Mr. Mnuchin had said little on the subject until he was pressed about it during a House Financial Services Committee hearing last month.

The delay of the new design has prompted calls for the Trump administration to follow through in adding Tubman to the note and bipartisan legislation in the House that would require the Treasury Department to do so next year.

Requests from Congress for inspector general inquiries do tend to yield responses. Mr. Mnuchin’s department has faced internal investigations into the secretary’s travel practices and into his handling of an analysis of the Republican tax cut legislation. The inquiry into Mr. Mnuchin’s air travel found he broke no laws in his use of military aircraft but lamented the loose justification provided for such costly flights. The tax cut analysis investigation found no evidence of any improper political interference with the career tax staff."
House Republicans demand hearing after State Dept. cites 'multiple security incidents' under Clinton leadership,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republicans-demand-hearing-after-state-dept-cites-multiple-security-incidents-under-clinton-leadership,"House Oversight Committee Republicans on Tuesday formally called for an immediate hearing on security breaches at the State Department during Hillary Clinton's leadership, after the department said Monday it had uncovered ""multiple security incidents"" involving more than a dozen employees.

In a letter to Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., ranking committee Republicans Jim Jordan, Mark Meadows and Jody Hice said State Department officials conducting the ongoing security review into the matter should testify.

""We request a hearing to examine widespread security protocol breaches at the State Department concerning former Secretary Hillary Clinton’s private email server,"" the Republicans wrote. ""The unorthodox and unsecure arrangement she maintained exposed classified, national security and diplomatic-sensitive information to a myriad of risks and related issues.

'OMG': TOP HILLARY AIDE STUNNED BY APPARENT EMAIL HACK ATTEMPT IN MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, FBI DOCS SHOW

""The wide-ranging fallout from these mishandling instances should not be minimized and obscured,"" they added.

On Monday, the State Department disclosed that it had identified ""multiple security incidents"" involving current or former employees' handling of Clinton's emails, and that 23 ""violations"" and seven ""infractions"" have been issued as part of the department's ongoing investigation.

The information came in a letter to Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, who is responsible for overseeing the security review.

""To this point, the department has assessed culpability to 15 individuals, some of whom were culpable in multiple security incidents,"" Mary Elizabeth Taylor, the State Department's assistant secretary in the Bureau of Legislative Affairs, wrote to Grassley. ""DS has issued 23 violations and seven infractions. ... This number will likely change as the review progresses.""

President Trump highlighted the finding in a tweet overnight, questioning whether Democrats would investigate and saying, ""This is really big.""

Former House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, now a Fox News contributor, said Tuesday that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo should personally handle the probe into departmental misconduct.

""I love Mike Pompeo as the secretary of state,"" Chaffetz said. ""I have the greatest respect for him, he's got his very full plate, but he has to personally get involved with this. Some people should be fired, they should lose their security clearances and they should be in jail.""

The State Department, dubbing the matter ""serious,"" said it expected to conclude its investigation by Sept. 1. The department acknowledged that the probe was unusually time-consuming.

""Given the volume of emails provided to the department from former Secretary Clinton's private email server, the department's process has been necessarily more complicated and complex requiring a significant dedication of time and resources,"" Taylor wrote.

Taylor also noted that disciplinary consequences were pending, and that internal referrals have been made to State Department Human Resources and security officials, even where employees involved no longer work with the department.

Clinton's private email use has remained in the spotlight, as the DOJ looks into potential misconduct in the handling of federal authorities' surveillance and intelligence operations in 2016. Then-FBI Director James Comey said in 2016 that Clinton's handling of classified information was ""extremely careless"" -- but that ""no reasonable prosecutor"" would bring charges.

Last month, a trove of partially redacted FBI documents from the agency's investigation into whether Clinton mishandled classified information -- a probe known as the ""Midyear Exam"" -- revealed that top Clinton aides were shocked at apparent attempts to hack her private email servers.

The document release revealed numerous episodes in which the Clinton team either suspected it had been hacked or seemingly acknowledged that security measures had come up short.

""omg,"" top Clinton aide Huma Abedin wrote to Justin Cooper, the technology pro overseeing Clinton's private home-based email servers, when he told her shortly after midnight on Jan. 9, 2011, that ""someone was trying to hack us.""

And this past March, it was revealed that the Justice Department ""negotiated"" an agreement with Clinton's legal team that ensured the FBI did not have access to emails on her private servers relating to the Clinton Foundation. Former FBI Agent Peter Strzok testified about the arrangement during a closed-door appearance before the House Judiciary Committee last summer, according to a transcript released this year.

The agreement was reached, Strzok said, because ""according to the attorneys, we lacked probable cause to get a search warrant for those servers and projected that either it would take a very long time and/or it would be impossible to get to the point where we could obtain probable cause to get a warrant.""

The DOJ's goal, Chaffetz said at the time, was to ""make sure they hear no evil, see no evil -- they had no interest in pursuing the truth."""

Wilkie testified before a Senate Veterans Affairs Committee hearing, where he was pressed on efforts the Trump administration is taking to address what many have called a growing epidemic of suicide among former military servicemembers.

Wilkie said the issue called for a collaborative approach across government.

""Suicide is a national public health issue that affects communities everywhere. Just as there is no single cause of suicide, no single organization can end veteran suicide,"" Wilkie said in his remarks provided to the panel.

""We must work side-by-side with our partners at all levels of government and in the private sector to provide our veterans with the mental health and suicide prevention services they need.""

Wilkie highlighted the problem of firearm-related suicides, which he said accounted for 70 percent of veteran suicides. And he said officials would do more to prevent such deaths.

“The goal is to build time and space between the impulse to harm oneself and the act,” the secretary said.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) pressed Wilkie on that promise.

“The time and space between someone who overdoses on prescription drugs, you have hours,"" Blumenthal said. ""For someone who uses a gun, you have no time.”

Wilkie told the senator he was open to look at legislation that would take guns away from people if a judge deems those individuals a threat.

Wilkie said education was an important aspect as well, noting that more must be done to talk to servicemembers about mental health issues and to train those in the military from the start of basic training to recognize warning signs of mental illness and depression.

“Educating family members is absolutely key in things as simple as gun storage,” he added.

Lawmakers from both parties said officials must do more on suicide prevention.

Former Mueller counsel Michael Dreeben leaving top DOJ post,https://www.politico.com,['Darren Samuelsohn'],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/19/former-mueller-counsel-michael-dreeben-leaving-top-doj-post-1371101,"Michael Dreeben helped beat back a challenge to the special counsel’s use of subpoenas to pry information from reluctant witnesses. | Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images legal Former Mueller counsel Michael Dreeben leaving top DOJ post Dreeben successfully fought off legal challenges to the special counsel's appointment in federal court.

Michael Dreeben, a longtime Justice Department lawyer who had a central role on special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe, is leaving the government in the coming weeks, a DOJ spokeswoman confirmed Wednesday.

The 30-year DOJ veteran had been on a sabbatical from his role as deputy solicitor general to work on the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. There, he successfully fought off legal challenges to Mueller’s appointment in federal court. He also helped beat back a challenge to the special counsel’s use of subpoenas to pry information from reluctant witnesses.

Story Continued Below

DOJ spokeswoman Kerri Kupec confirmed Dreeben’s upcoming departure from the government, making him the latest member of Mueller’s team to move on from government work since the Russia probe was wrapped up earlier this spring.

Mueller’s last day on the government payroll came May 29, the same day he broke a nearly two-year public silence about his work. The special counsel’s office then formally closed.

So far, only a handful of former Mueller staffers have surfaced in new roles since finishing their Russia probe duties. Andrew Weissmann, one of the senior prosecutors on the special counsel’s team, returned to New York University’s law school as a senior fellow in May. Another top lawyer, Greg Andres, also landed back at his old job as a partner at the New York office of Davis Polk.

Dreeben declined comment when asked about his plans after he leaves the government. In the solicitor general’s office, Dreeben represented the United States more than 100 times before the Supreme Court, an accomplishment that Chief Justice John Roberts noted in May 2016 made him the “second person to reach that rare milestone this century.”

In a statement Wednesday, Solicitor General Noel Francisco praised Dreeben's career.

“On behalf of the Office of the Solicitor General, I thank Michael for his many years of service to the Department,"" he said. ""We wish him the best of luck in the next chapter of his career."""
"10-year Treasury yield drops as low as 1.97%, first time below 2% since November 2016",https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/19/us-treasury-yields-tick-higher-as-investors-await-federal-reserve-meeting.html,"A chart showing the U.S. 10-year treasury yield below 2% as of 11:49 p.m. ET Wednesday.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell below 2% for the first time since November 2016 on Wednesday — breaching a key psychological level — after the Federal Reserve struck a more dovish tone in its June policy statement and Chair Jerome Powell said that the case for easier monetary policy had strengthened.

Though the central bank maintained the target overnight lending rate, that decision was accompanied by a growing number of officials open to one rate cut by the end of 2019 with eight members in favor. However, the consensus still didn't expect a reduction until 2020 at the earliest.

The policymaking committee of the Fed also dropped the word ""patient"" from its statement, a sign interpreted by some investors as a hint that the central bank hasn't abandoned the idea of a rate cut in 2019. The Fed tweaked its statement to acknowledge that inflation is ""running below"" its 2% objective.

At around 11:58 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to price, declined below 2% to 1.9821% — around its lowest levels since November 2016. The yield on the 2-year slipped to 1.7209%, its lowest level since 2017. The 3-month Treasury bill yield ticked lower to 2.175%, as of 7:30 p.m. ET.

While stock investors and home buyers may initially cheer the drop in the benchmark for corporate bond and mortgage rates, the return to levels not seen in more than two years raises serious questions about the state of the economy.

Softer economic gauges like May's anemic jobs report — which showed that the U.S. economy added just 75,000 positions — and a lackluster consumer pricing print suggested to economists and fixed-income traders earlier this month that the central bank may have to assure markets of its willingness to step in if GDP growth decelerates.

Speaking to reporters after the central bank meeting, Powell said policymakers are worried about certain economic data and see an improving case for easier policy.

""Overall, our policy discussion focused on the appropriate response to the uncertain environment,"" he said. ""Many participants now see the case for somewhat more accommodative policy has strengthened,"" Powell said.

Traders are now pricing in a more than 80% chance of a rate cut in July and 70% probability of another reduction in September, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.

""It was largely what the market was looking for: I don't think they went too far as to spook the market in any way,"" said Tom Garretson, a fixed-income strategist at RBC. ""Seeing that eight [officials] are seeing a rate cut this year was dovish.""

""This is mostly an inflation story,"" he added. ""If you look at GDP forecast for 2020 they're up to 2% from 1.9% ... even if they were worried about tariffs, it didn't show up in their forecast.""

The Fed has in recent months been grappling with a consistent shortfall in inflation relative to its self-imposed 2% target. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, increased 1.6% in the year to April after gaining 1.5% in March.

Treasury inflation-protected securities — bonds whose payouts are indexed to consumer prices — show that price growth expectations have slid in recent months. Inflation is a threat to the value of a bond's fixed coupon and principal payments.

Wednesday's decision from the Federal Open Market Committee came after President Donald Trump's repeated criticism of the Fed and Jerome Powell specifically for raising rates and tightening monetary conditions over the last year. Trump, who sees recent Fed policy as damaging to American markets and undermining his bargaining position in trade talks, has broken with tradition in his frequent and vocal criticism of the central bank.

Asked Tuesday whether he wants to remove Powell as Fed Chair, Trump said ""Let's see what he does."" Trump's comments came after Bloomberg News reported Tuesday morning that the White House had looked into demoting Powell in February.

Trump also said Tuesday he will be having an ""extended meeting"" next week with the Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the G-20 meeting in Japan.

Meanwhile, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said Tuesday that the central bank may need to ease monetary policy in the coming months if inflation doesn't bounce back toward its target.

""In the absence of improvement, such that the sustained return of inflation to our aim is threatened, additional stimulus will be required,"" Draghi said.

State Dept. says no 'uptick' DR deaths of Americans after a string of fatal incidents,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/International/us-state-dept-uptick-deaths-americans-dominican-republic/story?id=63806929,"Despite a string of high-profile deaths this year of Americans from illnesses in the Dominican Republic, the U.S. State Department said Wednesday there has not been an ""uptick"" in fatal incidents of Americans in the Caribbean country.

The State Department confirmed at least nine American tourists have died in the Dominican Republic in roughly the past 12 months, and some of their families say they became gravely ill before they perished.

""We have not seen an uptick in the number of U.S. citizen deaths reported to the Department"" in the Dominican Republic, a State Department spokesperson told ABC News.

The spokesperson said that more than 2.7 million U.S. citizens visit the Dominican Republic each year and, as in most countries, ""the overwhelming majority travel without incident.""

The U.S. Embassy in Santo Domingo said last week that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is now helping to probe the deaths of at least three Americans who perished in a five-day span at neighboring hotels in the same resort run by Bahia Principe Hotels & Resorts.

Dominican authorities asked for the FBI's help in conducting toxicology analysis in the investigations stemming from the deaths at the luxury destination, according to officials at the U.S. Embassy.

Nathaniel Holmes, 63, and his fiancée, Cynthia Ann Day, 49, of Maryland were found dead on May 30 in their room at the Grand Bahia Principe La Romana Resort in San Pedro de Macoris on the southeast coast of the Dominican Republic.

Autopsies performed in the Dominican Republic determined preliminary causes of death for both Holmes and Day were respiratory failure and pulmonary edema, or water in the lungs.

A lawyer for the families of Day and Holmes said they are awaiting the results of independent autopsies on the couple.

The couple died just five days after Miranda Schaupp-Werner, 41, of Allentown, Pennsylvania, was found dead at the Luxury Bahia Principe Bouganville hotel at the same resort.

An autopsy performed on Schaupp-Werner determined that she also died from respiratory failure and pulmonary edema, according to the Dominican Republic National Police.

The FBI, at the request of Dominican officials, is conducting toxicology analysis to determine how Holmes, Day and Schaupp-Werner died. The results of the analysis have not been completed.

""The safety of U.S. citizens that live in, work in, and visit the Dominican Republic remains our highest priority,"" Robin Bernstein, the U.S. Ambassador to the Dominican Republic, said in a statement earlier this month. ""These incidents are tragic and we offer our deepest condolences to those personally impacted.""

According to the U.S. State Department's website, 13 Americans died in the Dominican Republic in 2018, but those deaths were not all from natural causes and included homicides, drownings and vehicle accidents.

Nathaniel Holmes/Facebook

The State Department confirmed this week the Jan. 26 death of Thomas Jerome ""Jerry"" Curran, 78, of Bedford, Ohio, who became ill while staying at a different Dominican Republic resort.

Curran's death brings the total of Americans who died in the Dominican Republic since June 2018 to nine.

Other Americans who perished after coming down with illnesses while in the Dominican Republic were Yvette Monique Sport, 51, of Pennsylvania, in June 2018; David Harrison, 45, of Maryland, in July 2018; Robert Wallace, 67, of California, on April 14; Leyla Cox, 53, of New York, on June 10; and Joseph Allen, 55, of New Jersey, on June 13.

It's unclear if Sport and Harrison's death were included in the U.S. State Department's report of Americans who perished in the Dominican Republic in 2018.

Dominican officials are working to reinforce the island's food and beverage safety standards amid the deaths, following reports that some Americans died after consuming beverages from their hotels and suddenly falling ill.

Dominican Tourism Minister Francisco Javier Garcia said in a statement last week that his agency is working with the National Hotel Association ""to reinforce safety conditions and quality control in food, beverages and any other element that has a positive impact on the satisfaction of those who visit our county as tourists.""

But Garcia cautioned against a rush to judgment.

""While what happened is tragic and regrettable,"" García said, ""it is important for everyone who wishes to disseminate information about the situation to do it in context and with perspective. It is advisable to wait for the official reports before speculating on the causes of death."""
Trump has been awarding a lot of Presidential Medals of Freedom. Here’s what that says about his values.,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['E. Fletcher Mcclellan', 'Kyle C. Kopko', 'Christopher J. Devine', 'June At Am']",06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/06/20/trump-has-been-awarding-lot-presidential-medals-freedom-heres-what-that-says-about-his-values/,"

President Trump shakes hands with economist Arthur Laffer after presenting him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom on Wednesday. (Ron Sachs/Bloomberg)

After waiting nearly two years to issue his first Presidential Medal of Freedom, President Trump is picking up the pace.

Last November, the president honored seven recipients, three posthumously — Babe Ruth, Elvis Presley and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. The other four were U.S. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican donor and philanthropist Miriam Adelson and NFL Hall-of-Famers Roger Staubach and Alan Page (also a Minnesota Supreme Court Justice).

In May, Trump handed the Presidential Medal of Freedom (PMOF) to golfing great Tiger Woods in a Rose Garden ceremony. Yesterday, he awarded the medal to economist Arthur Laffer, influential proponent of supply-side economics. Next to be honored is basketball legend Jerry West.

[Trump is giving Arthur Laffer the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Economists aren't smiling.]

What’s the point of conferring Presidential Medals of Freedom?

President John F. Kennedy established the award in 1963, as a way of honoring people who made a significant contribution to American culture, the national interest or world peace. In choosing recipients, presidents can signal the heroes, causes and values with which they want to be associated. Also, presidents can use the medal to reward key supporters and constituency groups.

The decision to award one belongs only to the president. This appears to be attractive for Trump, who has made extensive use of unilateral powers during his presidency.

What’s unites President Trump’s honorees?

What do President Trump’s 10 awards tell us about him and how he differs from his predecessors?

First, Trump likes athletes. So far, half of his selections are professional sports figures. In our research of the history of the award, we found that, before 2018, athletes received only four percent of the total number of medals.

Trump’s fondness for athletic achievement may reflect his zeal for winning, especially in highly competitive settings such as business and politics. Of course, he and his business enterprises are strongly connected to sports, including his golf resorts.

Second, like his predecessors, the president has recognized prominent supporters and members of his political party. Laffer and Scalia are conservative icons, and Hatch was the longest serving Republican senator in U.S. history. Adelson and her husband Sheldon, the casino magnate, donated $113 million to Republican campaigns during the 2018 midterm election cycle.

Third, having a personal connection to Trump doesn’t hurt. Woods, an occasional playing partner of the president, contracted with the Trump Organization to design a golf course for a Trump property in Dubai. Laffer informally advises the president and recently co-authored a book, Trumponomics, praising Trump’s economic policy.

Fourth, compared to other presidents, Trump has issued the lowest number of medals at this stage of the first term since Richard Nixon. Also like Nixon, the president appears to be regularly holding ceremonies for individuals. That runs counter to Ronald Reagan’s example of honoring at least 10 recipients annually in groups of five or more, which set a trend most presidents have followed since. Trump’s pattern of awarding medals sharply contrasts with that of Barack Obama, who conferred more medals than any president, totaling 115 over his two terms.

So far, of the 10 medals Trump has awarded, one has gone to a woman and two to persons of color. That proportion is roughly in line with those awarded by former Republican presidents. Of all those who received medals from Republican presidents, about 85 percent were men and 83 percent were white. By contrast, of the recipients recognized by Democratic presidents, approximately 77 percent were men and 75 percent were white.

Interestingly, Trump has not yet honored a military leader, a type of recipient likely to be selected more often by Republican than Democratic presidents.

How does Trump decide who to recognize?

Like all presidents, Trump is learning about the job while on the job. We do not know why he waited until the 22nd month of his administration to award his first Medals of Freedom, but he appears to understand the award’s significance now.

Trump may be honoring individual medal recipients to get more positive publicity out of frequent ceremonies, as opposed to distributing them all in one or two large gatherings a year. Or his decision-making process may be more idiosyncratic than routine.

Trump is awarding Medals of Freedom much in the way he’s used his power to pardon. Starting in August 2017 when he pardoned former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, the president has issued 12 pardons or clemency orders. For most of these, Trump bypassed the regular process for determining the worthiness of possible recipients, responding mainly to personal appeals or his political allies’ media campaigns.

[Why Trump's pardon of Joe Arpaio isn't like most presidential pardons]

To say Trump’s pardons and Medals of Freedom range widely is an understatement. He reached back decades to award a Medal of Freedom to Babe Ruth, and even further to issue a pardon to Jack Johnson, the early twentieth century heavyweight champion.

What do Presidential Medals of Freedom symbolize? That depends on the president

The Presidential Medal of Freedom is intended to symbolize what Americans value most in their leaders and themselves. President Trump may find that awarding these can help him succeed as a national unifier, a role some observers believe he has failed to perform.

For instance, awarding the Medal of Freedom to Tiger Woods may have been controversial, given the athlete’s turbulent personal life and business ties to Trump. But no one could deny Woods’ staggering athletic record and inspirational comeback story from physical breakdown to this year’s Masters Tournament victory.

Examining these medals offers insight about what means the most to presidents personally. Judging from his awards so far, Trump’s idea of American greatness is connected to cultural icons from the baby boomers’ prime years and earlier; athletic accomplishments; and conservative ideas.

Will Trump award more medals as conflicts with the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives intensify? Possibly. Our research shows that more Medal of Freedom ceremonies have taken place during periods of divided government, possibly because presidents sought positive media coverage during times of partisan conflict.

But Richard Nixon held three Presidential Medal of Freedom ceremonies between March and July 1974, as the Watergate impeachment investigation unfolded. It didn’t make much difference for him.

Homeland Security: We've tested Windows BlueKeep attack and it works so patch now,https://www.zdnet.com,['Liam Tung'],,,,https://www.zdnet.com/article/homeland-security-weve-tested-windows-bluekeep-attack-and-it-works-so-patch-now/,"A single actor is scanning Windows systems vulnerable to the BlueKeep flaw A threat actor hidden behind Tor nodes is scanning for Windows systems vulnerable to BlueKeep flaw. Read more: https://zd.net/2JWjK73

The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) cybercrime emergency response team is warning Windows admins to patch the wormable BlueKeep flaw, after confirming it can be used to remotely execute code on vulnerable PCs.

The US government's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has raised the official alert over a potentially devastating flaw that affects the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service in multiple versions of Windows, from Windows 2000 to Windows 2008.

Microsoft considered CVE-2019-0708, now known as BlueKeep, so severe that it even released a patch for unsupported Windows XP – a measure it hadn't taken since WannaCry wreaked havoc across the globe in mid-2017.

SEE: Cybersecurity in an IoT and mobile world (ZDNet special report) | Download the report as a PDF (TechRepublic)

The bug was reported to Microsoft ahead of its May Patch Tuesday update by the UK's National Cyber Security Centre, the organization under UK spy agency GCHQ tasked with improving the nation's cybersecurity defenses in the public and private sector.

Microsoft released patches for XP because it believed BlueKeep's worm capabilities – the ability to automatically spread from one vulnerable machine to another – could be exploited in an attack on the same global scale as WannaCry, whose worm capabilities were enabled by EternalBlue, the leaked NSA exploit for the SMBv1 file-sharing protocol.

The NSA is also worried about BlueKeep. Earlier this month it urged admins to patch the flaw and change configurations to prevent potential attacks. Its warning followed research that found that at least one million Windows computers were still vulnerable to BlueKeep. The NSA said it was ""likely only a matter of time"" before attacks emerged.

Currently there's no publicly available exploit code for BlueKeep. However, several organizations claim to have developed exploits for it, including Zerodium, McAfee, Kaspersky, Check Point, MalwareTech, and Valthek.

CISA on Monday confirmed it has successfully exploited BlueKeep on a Windows 2000 PC. The agency has not tested other affected versions of Windows.

""CISA tested BlueKeep against a Windows 2000 machine and achieved remote code execution. Windows OS versions prior to Windows 8 that are not mentioned in this Activity Alert may also be affected; however, CISA has not tested these systems,"" it said.

However, CISA has since stepped back from that claim and replaced its original statement with: ""CISA has coordinated with external stakeholders and determined that Windows 2000 is vulnerable to BlueKeep.""

Nonetheless, its advice, like the NSA's and Microsoft's, remains the same: apply Microsoft's May fixes for the RDP BlueKeep bug. Similarly, it recommends enabling Network Level Authentication (NLA), which would shield organizations from any forthcoming BlueKeep attacks. And it suggests blocking TCP port 3389, which is used to start an RDP session.

Should a public BlueKeep exploit emerge or nation-state hackers develop one privately and decide to use it, the potential impact could be very different to WannaCry.

That malware heavily damaged organizations in Europe, most notably the UK's National Health Service (NHS), which faced a $125m WannaCry bill, was forced to cancel 19,000 appointments, and then spent £500,000 on contractors to restore data in the wake of the attack.

Additionally, thanks to suspected Russian state-backed hacking group, ShadowBrokers, public exploit code was available just a month after Microsoft's patch.

SEE: 10 tips for new cybersecurity pros (free PDF)

Security firm BitSight ran an internet scan in mid-June for systems vulnerable to BlueKeep. It too found about a million vulnerable machines, but the exposure to BlueKeep is greatest in China, where less than 50 percent of machines have been patched.

China by far has the most machines in the world that are vulnerable to BlueKeep, amounting to about a third of the million vulnerable machines. It is followed by the US, but more than 75 percent of US machines have been patched.

It seems Europe has learned its lessons from WannaCry and the subsequent EternalBlue-powered NotPetya outbreak. The UK, Netherlands, Germany, France, have all patched over 75 percent of systems with exposed RDP hosts.

Countries in the same bracket as China, with less than 50 percent of machines patched, include South Korea and Hong Kong, while the patch rate in Russia, India, Brazil, and Italy sits between 50 percent and 75 percent.

The VA is improving because it's using more private healthcare,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/the-va-is-improving-because-its-using-more-private-healthcare,"Recently, the battle over the future of veterans healthcare increased in intensity because arguably the two most prominent politicians in the country weighed in on the issue, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and President Trump.

At a town hall in April, Ocasio-Cortez criticized the Trump administration’s efforts to expand healthcare choice for veterans through the Department of Veterans Affairs and said in regards to the VA that “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” It isn’t surprising that Ocasio-Cortez would vigorously defend the VA while attacking reforms meant to give veterans more private healthcare options. Many of her ideological partners, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., consider the VA a model government-run healthcare system and a positive example of “socialism in action.”

A week later, Trump responded to Ocasio-Cortez with a tweet that seemingly agreed with her assertion that the VA is performing well. Underlying his tweet was the implication that the uptick in performance is due to legislation he signed into law that increased choice for veterans and accountability for VA employees — bills Ocasio-Cortez and her allies have criticized.

This exchange between the president and AOC predictably set off a debate about who was right and who was wrong about the VA. Unfortunately, in a world of 280-character tweets and cable news segments that are clipped and shared without context, it is difficult to convey a nuanced position about any public policy issue, including the future of the VA. The reality is the VA is neither completely fixed nor completely broken but is instead an institution at a crossroads with an opportunity to break the cycle of reform and failure that has plagued it since its inception. This is especially true with the recent launch of the Veterans Community Care Program which, if properly implemented, will substantially increase healthcare freedom for veterans through the VA and improve access to medical services.

Even as someone who has been highly critical of the agency for years, I have to admit the VA has made some improvement since the deadly 2014 waitlist scandal.

Between 2014 and 2017, according to a study by the JAMA network, wait times across the VA have generally gone down. However, this decrease occurred while the VA increased the number of private sector appointments by over 50%, demonstrating better use of non-VA providers and the introduction of the albeit imperfect Veterans Choice Program helped improve wait times for veterans.

Despite this good news, the VA still faces many systemic issues that need to be dealt with. Too many VA hospitals are delivering sub-standard care and hundreds of thousands of veterans are still waiting long periods of time for appointments. Additionally, most of the VA’s healthcare facilities are over 50 years old, meaning not only are the buildings increasingly aged but they are not in locations best suited to serve the more dispersed veterans population of the future.

The VA MISSION Act, signed into law last year by Trump, was designed to address these issues. Over the next few years the VA will continue implementing the law, and it faces its first major test with the rollout of the Veterans Community Care Program.

It is critical for the future of veterans healthcare that the VA properly implement all the major components of the VA MISSION Act. Failure to do so will undermine the Trump administration’s VA reform agenda and compromise healthcare for millions of veterans. In addition, any attempts to roll back the VA MISSION Act by members of Congress who oppose giving veterans more healthcare choice — like Ocasio-Cortez — should be strongly resisted.

Finally, as more veterans get care from outside of the VA, elected officials at the state and federal levels must explore ways to eliminate barriers standing in the way of veterans making full use of their new private sector healthcare options. Critical reforms include expanded use of telehealth (as Virginia did) and repealing certificate-of-need laws (as Florida did this year). These and other patient-centered reforms, expand access to health care for both veterans and non-veterans while encouraging innovation.

The VA has improved since 2014, but challenges remain. We all want veterans to get the care they need and deserve. To achieve that, everyone needs to acknowledge that VA healthcare still needs some major improvements and to commit ourselves to ensuring the necessary reforms are made.

Shanahan withdraws as Trump's defense pick as domestic incidents resurface,https://www.cnn.com,"['Zachary Cohen', 'Curt Devine', 'Drew Griffin', 'Michael Warren']",06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/18/politics/shanahan-out-defense-secretary/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump said Tuesday that acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan has ""decided not to go forward with his confirmation process."" Shanahan's withdrawal was announced shortly after the Washington Post published a report detailing a violent incident in 2011 in which his son attacked his own mother with a baseball bat.

""Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, who has done a wonderful job, has decided not to go forward with his confirmation process so that he can devote more time to his family,"" Trump tweeted.

""I thank Pat for his outstanding service and will be naming Secretary of the Army, Mark Esper, to be the new Acting Secretary of Defense. I know Mark, and have no doubt he will do a fantastic job!"" he added.

Trump announced his intention to nominate Shanahan on May 9, but the paperwork necessary to begin confirmation hearings hadn't been filed.

On Tuesday, the Washington Post reported details related to a November 2011 incident in which Shanahan rushed to defend his then-17-year-old son, William, in the days after the teenager brutally beat his mother with a baseball bat.

Two weeks later, Shanahan wrote a memo to prepare his son's initial court appearance, arguing that he had acted in self defense, according to the Post.

But in an interview on Monday, Shanahan told the Post that he later regretted writing the memo and never intended for anyone other than his son's attorneys to read it.

""Quite frankly it's difficult to relive that moment and the passage was difficult for me to read. I was wrong to write those three sentences,"" Shanahan told the Post.

""I have never believed Will's attack on his mother was an act of self-defense or justified. I don't believe violence is appropriate ever, and certainly never any justification for attacking someone with a baseball bat,"" he said.

Later Tuesday, Shanahan released a statement saying he withdrew from consideration after details surfaced related to ""a painful and deeply personal family situation from long ago.""

""After having been confirmed for Deputy Secretary less than two years ago, it is unfortunate that a painful and deeply personal family situation from long ago is being dredged up and painted in an incomplete and therefore misleading way in the course of this process,"" he said.

""I believe my continuing in the confirmation process would force my three children to relive a traumatic chapter in our family's life and reopen wounds we have worked years to heal. Ultimately, their safety and well-being is my highest priority,"" Shanahan added.

Shanahan's decision

Shanahan, who was struggling with how the details surrounding his contentious divorce have resurfaced in recent days, met with Trump in the Oval Office on Monday. The President said his outgoing acting defense secretary informed him on Tuesday morning that he was withdrawing from consideration for the permanent post.

""Pat Shanahan, who is a wonderful person, is, as you know, going to take some time off for family matters,"" Trump told reporters before heading to Florida for a campaign rally.

""I didn't ask him to withdraw. He walked in this morning"" to withdraw, he added.

The President praised Shanahan as a ""terrific person"" and said he only recently learned of the domestic violence allegations.

""I had heard about it yesterday for the first time,"" Trump said of the allegations, which Shanahan had been discussing in interviews with The Washington Post for months, according to the newspaper.

Trump also denied there was an issue with his administration's vetting process, despite multiple individuals withdrawing from consideration for posts after being announced as intended nominees.

""We have a very good vetting process,"" he said.

It was after Shanahan made the decision to withdraw, not Trump, that the President started calling aides and allies asking who should be his next pick. He wanted to be able to name who would take over for Shanahan as soon as he announced his withdrawal, sources said.

An administration official told CNN that Shanahan was fully vetted and that the White House was aware of the domestic abuse allegations in his family -- though not every single detail.

The view early on was that it was not him personally. But as previously reported, even though he was never arrested or charged, there had been growing concerns in recent days his ex-wife would resurface and publicly accuse him of domestic abuse which would then cause parallels to be drawn about the situation involving former White House aide Rob Porter

Court filings detail 2010 incident

In court filings, Shanahan's ex-wife Kimberley accused him of hitting her during a dispute at their home in August 2010.

A police officer who responded to the dispute noted that ""Patrick had a black eye and a bloody nose"" and that Kimberley did not have ""any visible marks"" on her, though Kimberley told the officer Patrick struck her several times in the stomach, according to a police incident report.

His ex-wife, who later changed her name to Kimberly Jordinson, was arrested and charged with assault for the incident. The charges against her were later dropped.

In an unrelated incident, Jordinson was also charged in Florida in 2014, for smashing a car's front and back windshields with a sledgehammer according to a police report, but she was not convicted.

Jordinson told CNN on Tuesday that the FBI never asked her about the 2010 domestic violence incident or the couple's contentious divorce until a few weeks ago.

Jordinson said she has been interviewed by the FBI a total of three times. The first two times were before Shanahan became deputy secretary of defense. She said during those earlier interviews, the agents focused on the incident in which her son beat her with a baseball bat, causing severe injuries.

The FBI returned for a third interview two or three weeks ago, to ask about the 2010 argument, Jordinson said.

Jordinson says she asked the FBI agents why they hadn't asked her about the fight before, and they said a note had previously been placed in the file to conduct a follow-up interview about the 2010 incident, but that interview was never conducted.

When CNN first spoke to Jordinson in January, she said she had not spoken to Shanahan since the 2010 incident, and that the two only communicated through attorneys.

""He is just going to spend the rest of his life hiding the truth, because he does not want the truth to come out,"" she said on Tuesday.

Jordinson also countered reports that she is mentally ill or has a substance abuse problem. ""I have never been diagnosed with a mental condition. I do not take medication for a mental condition,"" she said. She added, ""I have gone to therapy to deal with fallout from this divorce. I'm deeply saddened by what has happened to this family."" She also said she has never abused alcohol or drugs, and has never done illegal drugs.

She told CNN that she is still in the process of suing Shanahan for an additional $300,000-$400,000 for money owed from the divorce and expenses related to the raising of their three children.

Shanahan addressed the issues in a statement earlier this week.

""Though my marriage ended in sorrow and disappointment, I never laid a hand on my then-wife and cooperated fully in a thorough law enforcement investigation that resulted in her being charged with assault against me—charges which I had dropped in the interest of my family,"" he said.

Patrick and Kimberley's daughter Kayla Shanahan released her own statement saying: ""I never once saw my father raise a hand against my mother or against his children. To the contrary, my mother has a history of domestic abuse and physical violence, victimizing my father and her children, as well as having been subject of a restraining order unrelated to our family.""

Their son, Will Shanahan defended his father as a ""source of stability.""

""I and my brother and sister were subject to emotional and physical abuse by our mother. My father was and is the source of stability in our lives, in contrast to the constant physical and emotional trauma inflicted on us by our mother,"" he said in a statement.

Trump taps Esper as acting secretary

Esper, who Trump named as acting defense secretary on Tuesday, has been floated within the administration as a potential Pentagon chief for months — both before and after Trump said he would nominate Shanahan to the post.

Now, as Shanahan withdraws, the President is again considering the former Army secretary for the permanent job — though has only named him to the acting post for now. One White House official said the administration is still regrouping and figuring out their next steps after Shanahan's withdrawal.

Trump said Tuesday that he ""most likely"" will nominate Esper for the permanent job soon.

Ryan McCarthy, the under secretary for the Army, is expected to be named as the new acting Army secretary in the coming days, a person familiar with Trump's thinking said.

Esper was Trump's third pick for army secretary, and has been involved in efforts to secure funding for the border wall and to deploy US troops to the southern border.

Esper received a call from the White House about 30 minutes before the tweet announcing him as acting secretary, according to a US defense official.

The service secretaries, including Esper, will meet later Tuesday afternoon with Shanahan to discuss a transition.

""This is a good move by the administration,"" a senior GOP aide on the Senate Armed Services Committee said, predicting a smooth confirmation should the White House name Esper to the permanent post.

""They don't make him acting without nominating him,"" the aide said. ""Esper would be a very smart pick for the White House.""

Trump was generally aware for months of the rumors about Shanahan and domestic violence allegations, though it's not clear to what extent he knew the details.

The White House had grown increasingly concerned in recent days over Shanahan's issues with his background check, a White House official said. Additionally, Trump began having second thoughts about nominating him after initially telling Shanahan in the Oval Office he would, according to the official.

The official added that Shanahan stylistically didn't fit Trump's mold of what he wanted in a defense secretary and he began to question whether that was the right role for him. Shanahan is more reserved and is not an aggressive and forward type of leader. He also doesn't have military experience.

""The defense secretary plays a leadership role, not a business management role. Huge difference,"" the official said.

Asked about Esper's interest in the secretary of defense role, his spokesman pointed to a December statement in which the Army secretary told the Ft. Worth Star-Telegram: ""I'm very happy and privileged to be secretary of the Army.""

A senior GOP aide on the Senate Armed Services Committee told CNN Tuesday that naming Esper to replace Shanahan was ""a good move by the administration"" and said he would be ""a very smart pick"" should the White House choose to nominate him.

""He would have a very smooth confirmation,"" the aide said, adding that Esper is ""the most qualified in the Department.""

The aide also told CNN that most committee staff are relieved about Trump's announcement.

""We don't have to go through that confirmation battle,"" they said, referring to Shanahan.

An administration official said Esper is ""potentially qualified"" for the permanent job but that several other people are also being considered.

The source added that the White House wants someone as quickly as possible, but that it is just starting the replacement process."
Trump envoy not ruling out using Afghan war law to justify Iranian strikes,https://www.politico.com,"['Nahal Toosi', 'Burgess Everett', 'Bianca Quilantan', 'Matthew Choi']",06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/19/trump-state-department-iran-military-strike-1370531,"Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook said that there is ""no talk of offensive action"" against Iran, but did not rule out the possibility of a war. | Carolyn Kaster/AP Photo foreign policy Trump envoy not ruling out using Afghan war law to justify Iranian strikes 'We’re not seeking military action,' said Brian Hook, the State Department's special representative for Iran. 'There is no talk of offensive action.'

The State Department’s top official on Iran declined Wednesday to rule out the possibility that the Trump administration might justify a military confrontation with Tehran using the 2001 law that authorized the Afghanistan war.

Brian Hook, the department’s special representative for Iran, insisted that any move President Donald Trump makes would be legally sound. But that is unlikely to reassure Democrats and some Republicans who say the president is dangerously escalating tensions with Iran and are fearful Trump’s team will bypass Congress to launch military strikes against the country.

Story Continued Below

“We’re not seeking military action,” Hook told lawmakers at a hearing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee’s Middle East subpanel. He added, however, that if it comes down to such a confrontation, “we will do everything that we are required to do with respect to congressional war powers, and we will comply with the law.”

Hook’s appearance on Capitol Hill comes as the U.S. and Iran are engaged in a standoff in the wake of attacks on oil tankers in the Middle East that Washington blames on Tehran. Iran also said this week that it would soon violate limits on its nuclear program set under a 2015 international agreement.

Democratic New York Rep. Eliot Engel, who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee, was among the lawmakers who pushed Hook on the question of whether the Trump administration believes the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force would cover a military battle with Iran.

“I see a growing risk of miscalculation,” Engel said.

That AUMF was passed after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. It is generally interpreted as giving congressional authorization for U.S. military action in Afghanistan, as well as against al-Qaida and its affiliates.

In recent weeks, some Trump administration officials have tried to suggest that Iran has more substantial links to al-Qaida than is generally believed. That, combined with Trump’s expressed desire to often act unilaterally, has fueled concerns that the administration may invoke the 2001 measure to justify a military battle with Iran.

Hook deferred lawmakers to administration lawyers on the question of the AUMF, but he said “no” when asked if Iran was one of the entities responsible for the 9/11 attacks.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201906/1887/1155968404_6048022275001_6048027772001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

Hook did not rule out the possibility of a war with Iran, although he at one point said that as far as the U.S. is thinking now, “There is no talk of offensive action. It’s a defensive move.”

Hook also said the Trump team’s efforts to starve Iran’s Islamist regime of revenue that it uses to pay militias and terrorist groups in the Middle East is working.

“Hezbollah has placed piggy banks in grocery stores and in retail outlets,” Hook said, referring to the Iran-affiliated militia and political movement in Lebanon that the U.S. classifies as a terrorist group.

The Trump administration wants Iran to come to the negotiating table in the hopes of hammering out an agreement that covers at least four key areas, Hook added: ending Tehran’s nuclear program; curbing its ballistic missile program; stopping its support for terrorist groups and other militias; and halting Iran’s arbitrary detention of U.S. citizens.

“No one should be uncertain about our desire for peace or our readiness to normalize relations” with Iran, Hook said.

In recent days, both Iranian and American officials have simultaneously tried to de-escalate the situation while nonetheless holding out the possibility of military action. Trump, for instance, downplayed the oil tanker attacks in a Time interview earlier this week, and a senior Iranian official on Wednesday said “there will not be a military confrontation” between his country and the U.S.

But the Pentagon did announce on Monday that it was sending an extra 1,000 troops to the Middle East for “defensive purposes.”

Hook insisted on the soundness of U.S. intelligence linking Iran to the attacks on the oil tankers, and he dismissed concerns voiced by Democrats that the Trump administration is cherry-picking the information it is receiving.

At one point, referring to the attacks on two oil tankers last week, Hook said: ""A senior IRGC official confirmed that personnel, IRGC personnel, had completed two actions,"" referencing the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a major Iranian military force.

It was not clear if Hook was saying an IRGC official confirmed the information to the United States or whether the U.S. had picked up that intelligence through other means, such as intercepts.

Iran and the United States have been adversaries for 40 years, and they do not officially have diplomatic relations. But the relationship has grown especially rocky since May 2018, when Trump decided to pull the United States out of the internationally negotiated nuclear deal with Iran.

Trump reimposed nuclear sanctions on Iran that had been removed as part of the deal, and piled on new economic penalties that have badly damaged the Iranian economy.

While Iran’s Islamist government has until now tried to abide by its part of the agreement and restrict its nuclear program, it said this week that it would likely breach some of those restrictions before the end of the month.

Iran’s announcement, as well as the tanker attacks, which Iran denies a role in, have deepened a rift between the U.S. and European allies who have tried to salvage the nuclear deal.

The rising tensions also come as Trump’s pick to lead the Pentagon, Patrick Shanahan, announced this week that he was resigning. Shanahan will hand the acting Pentagon chief role to Mark Esper, currently secretary of the Army."

Paul Manafort’s transfer from Rikers Island shows how corrupt the DOJ really is,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Harry Litman', 'Contributing Columnist Focused On Legal Issues', 'Contributing Columnist', 'June At Pm', 'A Washington Post Contributing Columnist', 'Is A Former U.S. Attorney', 'Deputy Assistant Attorney General.

Paul Manafort leaves the federal courthouse in Washington in 2017. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)

Contributing columnist

Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s legal troubles didn’t end when he was convicted on bank and tax fraud charges in 2018. He’s facing state-level mortgage fraud charges, and because his case is going to trial in New York City, he needed to be transferred between penitentiaries. That is a routine matter and regularly results in the defendant’s transfer to a state penitentiary, here Rikers Island.

But in this case, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen intervened, forwarding to Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. a letter from Manafort’s attorney suggesting that it would not be safe for Manafort to be held on Rikers Island. The result? Manafort will be housed at a federal penitentiary rather than going to Rikers. Should we really care?

Yes we should. If the decision was motivated by politics — and it is very hard to formulate a plausible alternative explanation — it’s an injustice in itself and an indication of rotten goings-on at the Justice Department.

Consider first the magnitude of the favor that the department provided Manafort. Any prisoner would greatly prefer incarceration in either of the two institutions where Manafort will remain to Rikers’ Island, which is a notorious hellhole. (Why Rikers continues to operate at all in its current state is a subject for another column.) Manafort would surely be kept in isolation for his own protection in Rikers, but the difference in the overall conditions at these facilities is enormous.

Now consider how rare it is that Manafort’s request was granted and the role that Rosen, the No. 2 official at the Justice Department, played in facilitating it. It is not simply unusual but unprecedented. I have canvassed colleagues with combined decades of service at the Justice Department, and to a person they aver that they have never heard of a similar situation.

That is not because prisoners don’t ask. It is, in fact, routine to field requests for placement in certain institutions; I did so regularly as a U.S. attorney. The standard-issue response is to let the defendant know that, by law, the decision was for the Federal Bureau of Prisons to make, and that at most, a Justice Department representative could transmit a recommendation.

Finally, consider the reasoning: A spokesman for the Justice Department said the decision was justified by Manafort’s “unique health and safety needs.”

This is bunk of the first order. No doubt Manafort is ill, and no doubt he requires special protection. But are his circumstances unique? Absolutely not. Manafort’s situation is not meaningfully different from dozens of others who are routinely, in fact invariably, resolved many levels below the deputy attorney general and in favor of state incarceration pending state trial.

So we have a one-of-a-kind decision, made at an unprecedented level and justified by fanciful reasoning. Some special factor was obviously at play. It is entirely possible that there were political implications in doing a good deed for Manafort.

It’s not hard to see what those implications might be. Manafort has been the closest thing to a stand-up wise guy in the Trump drama: He managed through squirrelly doublespeak to avoid giving special counsel Robert S. Mueller III the full book on President Trump, and he paid for it in added prison time.

In return, Manafort’s transfer makes it look as though Trump, or Attorney General William P. Barr channeling Trump, is showing him some love with a special favor nobody else ever gets. That’s good for Manafort in the immediate run, and at the same time, it would communicate even more strongly that the way to a pardon is continued noncooperation with federal authorities.

This is all very bad news coming from the Justice Department.

For starters, though we hardly remember this principle because it has been so thoroughly trammeled in the Trump years, it would be a serious breach of protocol if anyone at the White House even communicated with the Justice Department to urge special treatment for Manafort. Any such overture should have been immediately rebuffed.

If that didn’t happen, it would almost be worse because it would mean that the department acted out of subservience to the president’s political goals on its own motion. It is the antithesis of doing justice without fear or favor — rewarding a political ally of the president because he resisted pressure from the Justice Department.

The overall turning of tables could not be more dramatic. Manafort did his best to wriggle out from under the lawful Justice Department investigation of him and the president. Now that same department is acting as his friend, as well as the president’s friend; and friends look out for one another.

That suggests a final lesson from Manafort’s relatively sweet accommodations: Rosen, who was Barr’s handpicked choice, likely comes to the department with a staff that is already integrated with Barr’s. That happens in the case of particularly strong attorneys general. Barr is that, by virtue of his own force of character and his preeminent standing in the Trump universe. As long as Trump is president, Barr enjoys total dominion at the Justice Department. The department’s special treatment of Manafort illustrates why that state of affairs is so worrisome.

"Pompeo overrules experts, keeps Saudi Arabia off US child soldiers list",https://www.cnn.com,"['Michelle Kosinski', 'Zachary Cohen']",06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/19/politics/saudi-arabia-child-soldiers-report-pompeo/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Secretary of State Mike Pompeo decided not to include Saudi Arabia on the State Department's list of countries that recruit child soldiers and overruled his own team of experts, who argued that there was sufficient evidence to do so, a source familiar with the issue told CNN.

While the State Department is legally required to list all countries that use child soldiers, discussions about whether to include Saudi Arabia in the soon-to-be released report sparked a fierce internal debate between State Department officials and in-house experts.

Reuters was first to report the disagreement and Pompeo's decision to leave Saudi Arabia off the list.

A source familiar with the internal discussions told CNN that the State Department's experts on human trafficking recommended that the department include Saudi Arabia, in part, due to reports that the kingdom was using child soldiers from Sudan to fight for the US-backed coalition in Yemen -- a claim they said was corroborated by a military source.

Yet despite acknowledging that there are child soldiers fighting in Yemen, some State Department officials claimed that the evidence fell short of proving they were being led by Saudi commanders and pushed back on the experts' recommendation to include the kingdom on the list.

The source conceded that the decision was a very close call, adding that one could indeed argue there was not sufficient evidence, but the office that handles this issue felt there was enough to support its recommendation.

The State Department responded with only a brief statement to CNN: ""The United States condemns the unlawful recruitment and use of child soldiers. We place great importance on ending the practice.""

Saudi policy under scrutiny

News of the heated disagreement comes as Congress continues to question the Trump administration's policy on Saudi Arabia.

Despite bipartisan criticism over the kingdom's war in Yemen and its role in the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi , the White House has sought an even closer relationship with the Saudis, as is evident by its push to sell them billions of dollars in weapons and munitions despite opposition in Congress.

Those concerns have only been amplified by the Trump administration's recent push to counter Iran and its view of Saudi Arabia as a key player in that effort.

On Wednesday, Rep. Tom Malinowski, a Democrat from New Jersey, accused Pompeo of intentionally misleading the public about Saudi Arabia's use of child soldiers in Yemen.

""Once again, Secretary Pompeo has shown he'll go to any lengths to lie for the Saudi government,"" Malinowski said in a tweet linking to the original Reuters report.

""The Child Soldiers Prevention Act sets up a two step process for identifying and holding accountable governments that use children as soldiers. The first step is a simple factual determination: the State Department must issue a list of countries that do this,"" Malinowski said.

""This is all Pompeo had to do: acknowledge the fact that Saudi Arabia is using at least one child soldier in the war in Yemen. And this fact is impossible to deny,"" he added, pointing to a New York Times story from December 2018 about how Saudi Arabia uses Sudanese militias that recruit children to fight in Yemen.

Malinowski then argued that Pompeo could have included Saudi Arabia on the list but opted not to punish the kingdom with sanctions -- a decision he says he would have opposed but would have been more honest.

""In step 2 of the process, the State Department decides whether a country is making a sincere effort to stop using child soldiers, and, until then, what consequences (like sanctions) should be applied,"" Malinowski tweeted.

""Pompeo could easily have done the honest thing and listed Saudi Arabia as having child soldiers, and then decided not to punish it. I would have disagreed with that decision, but it would have been lawful. Instead, he told a blatant, and utterly unnecessary lie: that the children fighting for Saudi Arabia in Yemen have nothing to do with Saudi Arabia. This is another blow to the credibility of the State Department at a time when it desperately needs it, given the crisis with Iran,"" he added.

Such cases, though, can be hard to prove.

Tillerson faced similar criticism

President Donald Trump's previous secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, faced similar criticism when he declined in 2017 to add Myanmar, Iraq and Afghanistan to the list of countries using child soldiers, also doing so against the recommendation of multiple State Department experts, serving in various bureaus.

That decision prompted a group of State employees to pen a memo accusing department leadership of violating US law by refusing to call out these countries.

The employees wrote, ""Beyond contravening U.S. law, this decision risks marring the credibility of a broad range of State Department reports and analysis and has weakened one of the U.S. government's primary diplomatic tools to deter governmental armed forces and government-supported armed groups from recruiting and using children in combat and support roles around the world.""

At the time, then-State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said some of the allegations involved only ""one or two"" child soldiers, though she agreed that reporters were fair to ask whether one or two was still too many.

She commented in a statement that Tillerson had ""made this decision after considering the credibility of all of the information available to him from multiple sources.""

Asked by CNN what message that sends -- a secretary of state ruling against his own experts' credibility -- Nauert replied, ""I think it says that people had a different opinion on this particular matter, and the secretary weighed that opinion and thought about it."""
"Waves, Sun, Grill and Food Safety",https://www.usda.gov,"['Posted Janice López-Muñoz', 'Bs', 'Msih', 'Public Affairs Specialist', 'Fsis In']",06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2019/06/19/waves-sun-grill-and-food-safety,"Posted by Janice López-Muñoz, BS, MSIH, Public Affairs Specialist, FSIS in Health and Safety

Cooking outdoors is challenging, especially during the summer. Be sure to follow these steps to food safety to prepare for the occasion!

The summer months are the perfect excuse to spend time at the beach. The best memories in my childhood are with my family enjoying a day at the beach grilling. My parents organized every detail of the trip but looking back and knowing what I know now about food safety, our beach grilling fun could have easily been spoiled with bacteria that could have made us sick.

There are always challenges when cooking outdoors, but a little bit of preparation can have you basking in the sun, enjoying some well-deserved beach time with the family.

Before Firing Up the Beach - Grill

Make sure local ordinances allow grilling activities. If yes…it’s time to pack!

Only pack the amount of food you will consume to avoid leftovers.

Season your favorite meats, poultry or seafood at home before packing them for the trip. Remember to wash your hands before handling the raw items and in between spice containers when seasoning.

Pack perishable foods directly from the refrigerator or freezer into the cooler.

Be sure to keep raw meat and poultry tightly wrapped and store them at the bottom of the cooler. This will help keep any running juices away from cooked foods or foods meant to be eaten raw (e.g. fruits, veggies, salsas, guacamole or bean salad).

Pack the drinks in a separate cooler so the food cooler is not opened frequently.

A full cooler will maintain its cold temperatures longer than one that is partially filled. If you still have space in your portable cooler, pack it full with more ice.

Don’t forget to bring moist towelettes and the food thermometer!

Keeping Food Safe Ashore

Once you arrive at the beach, partially bury your portable cooler in the sand, cover it with blankets or towels, and shade it under a tree or with a beach umbrella.

Do not open the lid of your cooler containing perishable foods unless necessary. This will keep perishable foods colder for a longer time.

Don't leave any perishables sitting out in the hot sun for more than 2 hours (1 hour when the temperature is above 90 °F).

Start setting up your grill and get it clean before bringing the food out.

Clean your hands before placing any foods on the grill.

Beach - Grill Time

Make sure your grilled items are safe to eat by using a food thermometer and checking to see if they reached the right minimum internal temperatures: Beef, pork, lamb and veal (steaks, roasts and chops): 145°F with a three-minute rest. Fish: 145°F Ground beef, veal, lamb, or pork burgers: 160°F. Poultry (whole or ground): 165°F.

Serve all your delicious food using clean plates and utensils.

Remember: Clean your hands before starting to eat!

If you have a question about food safety for your summer activities, call 1-888-MPHotline (1-888-674-6854). Hours of operation are 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday, ET. Callers may also listen to food safety messages on various topics, recorded in English and Spanish, 24 hours a day. You can also email or chat via Ask Karen."

With the cost of college rising faster than incomes and a staggering 44 million Americans owing more than $1.5 trillion in student loans, there has been growing concern that students and their families are taking on debt without truly understanding the long-term impact.

﻿Indeed, there is a lot of research exploring this national problem: Nine out of 10 parents and students failed a 2018 quiz about student loan debt. Meanwhile, MarketWatch reported that half of college students taking an AIG survey on personal finance basics got two or fewer questions correct. And in a recent survey from the Brookings Institution, less than 30% of student respondents could correctly answer three questions on inflation, interest and risk diversification.

Trump has previously complained about how Manafort was being treated and has suggested he might pardon him.

Manafort, 70, who is currently serving out a federal prison sentence in Pennsylvania, was expected to be transferred to the infamous Rikers complex as he waited to face mortgage fraud and other state charges brought by the Manhattan District Attorney's office.

Alexandria (Va.) Sheriffs Office

But in a statement to ABC News Monday evening, a senior DOJ official acknowledged that the department stepped in to the dispute last week after Manafort's attorneys raised concerns ""related to his health and personal safety."" During his federal trial, Manafort's physical condition appeared to be deteriorating and at times during hearings he had to use to a wheelchair or a cane.

The New York Times reported Monday that among the DOJ officials to get directly involved was Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, who was confirmed to his position as the department's number 2-ranked official last month.

""Mr. Manafort’s attorneys proposed that he remain in federal custody and be made available to the state when necessary,"" the official said. ""The Department requested the views of New York prosecutors, who did not object to Mr. Manafort’s proposal. In light of New York’s position, and Mr. Manafort’s unique health and safety needs, the Department decided to err on the side of caution by keeping Mr. Manafort in federal custody during the pendency of his state proceedings.""

Manafort has since been transferred to the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Lower Manhattan ahead of his expected arraignment on the state charges.

His attorneys did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABC News.

Several former Obama-era federal prosecutors raised issue with the high-level DOJ intervention, noting it ran counter to typical rules governing detention for federal inmates facing state charges in New York.

President Trump has repeatedly expressed his objections to the treatment of Manafort by federal prosecutors in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.

After the Manhattan District Attorney announced separate state charges against Manafort in March of this year, Trump reacted telling reporters, ""on a human basis, it's a very sad thing.""

The White House did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment on the DOJ decision.

"EPA fast tracking chemical reviews amid Trump deregulation push, environmental group reports",https://www.houstonchronicle.com,"['James Osborne', 'Washington Energy Correspondent', 'Follow James On', 'Past Articles This Author', 'Aaron Wilson', 'Jenny Dial Creech', 'Cary Darling', 'Staff Writer', 'Paul Takahashi', 'Andrew Dansby']",06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/EPA-fast-tracking-chemical-reviews-amid-Trump-14015893.php,"WASHINGTON - New chemicals coming into the marketplace are getting fast tracked for approval by the EPA, despite bipartisan reforms in 2016 designed to increase scrutiny over chemicals and reduce public health risks, according to a new report by the Environmental Defense Fund.

Researchers at the advocacy group found over the past year the Environmental Protection Agency was approving 80 percent of the new chemicals that came before it, a rate in line with EPA approval rates before Congress passed the reforms in 2016.

“Political appointees at EPA have taken every opportunity to undermine the 2016 [reforms] and elevate the industry’s interests over public health,” said Richard Denison, lead senior scientist at EDF. “The consequences of these mistakes will be felt by generations to come.”

The controversy comes amid a wider deregulatory push by the Trump administration, which has criticized EPA for holding up industrial expansion that could add jobs and boost the U.S. economy.

The shift described by Environmental Defense Fund. comes as a boon to many Houston-area chemical manufacturers, which have already seen restrictions on chemicals including trichloroethylene, an industrial cleaning agent, and methylene chloride, a paint stripper, rolled back under the Trump administration.

On HoustonChronicle.com: In Washington, politics around oil, climate in flux

The American Chemistry Council, a trade group representing chemical companies, described the Environmental Defense Fund’s report as “false” and an attempt to “undermine the implementation of [the reforms] and disparage the dedicated staff at EPA and the chemical industry.”

“The 2016 amendments to the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) are being effectively and efficiently implemented,” Jon Corley, a spokesman for the trade group, said.

An EPA spokesman said the agency was “ensuring the safety of chemicals in the marketplace, protecting human health and advancing the agency’s core mission.”

But concern is mounting in Congress that the Trump administration is going too far to appease chemical manufacturers.

“At almost every turn, the Trump administration has failed to live up to the letter and spirit of the historic bipartisan reform,” said Senator Tom Udall, D-N.M. “EPA leaders - starting with [Administrator] Andrew Wheeler - must change course, commit themselves to protecting the public, and carry out the [reforms] as Congress wrote it.”

In one instance, staff at EPA recommended restricted use for a chemical used in air and laundry fresheners called jeffamine diacrylamide because it’s in a class of chemicals commonly associated with elevated risk of cancer. But that recommendation was overruled and the chemical approved without the recommended restrictions, Denison said.

“We don’t know who made decision,” he said. “We’re lucky we know the original decision because EPA posted it on its website, but in response to this and other incidents, they stopped doing that,”

So far the company that makes the chemical, International Flavors and Fragrances of New York, has not released products containing jeffamine diacrylamide onto the market, Denison said.

Critics say Interior's top lawyer came 'close to perjury' during Hill testimony,https://thehill.com,[],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/449176-critics-say-interior-top-lawyer-came-close-to-perjury-during,"A green group is requesting an investigation of the Department of the Interior’s top lawyer, arguing he downplayed his role in the department’s controversial public records review process while testifying in May.

Daniel Jorjani, the principal deputy solicitor at Interior, told senators he did not regularly review documents requested through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) before their release.

But a batch of documents released through a public records request from EarthJustice shows the confusion that stemmed from the policy and how Jorjani was involved in processing the requests.

“He misled Congress and stepped very close to perjury,” said Aaron Weiss, deputy director at the Center for Western Priorities, arguing that Jorjani held back information from lawmakers who inquired about the public record process.

Interior has long been criticized for its policy of allowing political appointees to review FOIA requests about them or their work before being released to reporters and other requesters, including environmental groups.

In addition to his role in the solicitor’s office, Jorjani is also the department’s chief FOIA officer and employees were directed to copy him in their discussions of public records requests.

“It doesn’t pass the smell test to ask him to be sent all these things so he can not look at them,” Weiss said. “There’s clear documentation showing he has been looped in the entire time, so you can't deny that to the Senate in writing -- that’s just lying.”

Jorjani was recently nominated to be the solicitor for Interior, a post that has remained vacant under the Trump administration. Several Democrats have said they will not support his nomination in part because of his lack of response to questions on Interior’s public records policy.

“The Interior Department under President Trump Donald John TrumpBooker hits Biden's defense of remarks about segregationist senators: 'He's better than this' Booker hits Biden's defense of remarks about segregationist senators: 'He's better than this' Trump says Democrats are handing out subpoenas 'like they're cookies' MORE has treated information as a political weapon, regardless of what our laws require or what democracy demands of its leaders,” said Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-A.Z.) chair of the House Natural Resources, said in a statement. “[Interior’s] top lawyer shouldn’t sign off on it.”

Molly Block, a department spokeswoman, said “the process ensures that matters of concern to Department leadership are flagged for awareness. This also allows a FOIA officer to receive contextual information in order to help them better apply the relevant legal standards.”

EarthJustice requested an investigation of Interior’s public records review process from the department's Office of Inspector General (OIG), arguing it imposes barriers and delays in getting information.

Records requested by EarthJustice and included in their complaint to the OIG also answer other questions Jorjani didn’t answer in his testimony to Congress.

Sen. Ron Wyden Ronald (Ron) Lee WydenOvernight Defense: House passes T spending package with defense funds | Senate set to vote on blocking Saudi arms sales | UN nominee defends climate change record Overnight Defense: House passes T spending package with defense funds | Senate set to vote on blocking Saudi arms sales | UN nominee defends climate change record Grassley announces opposition to key Trump proposal to lower drug prices MORE (D-Ore.) pressed Jorjani to disclose how many times Interior’s record review process caused the department to miss litigation deadlines.

In a written response to Wyden, Jorjani said he could not comment on individual litigation matters.

But a review of documents released to EarthJustice suggests there are at least three instances where Interior did not meet court deadlines because they were waiting for political appointees to review FOIA requests.

In a meeting in late May to discuss Jorjani’s nomination, Senate Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Joe Manchin Joseph (Joe) ManchinCritics say Interior's top lawyer came 'close to perjury' during Hill testimony Critics say Interior's top lawyer came 'close to perjury' during Hill testimony The Hill's 12:30 Report — Presented by MAPRx — Trump takes heat for remarks on help from foreign governments MORE (D-W.V.) said Wyden’s questions “lacked the response it deserved” from Jorjani.

“The solicitor must uphold the law above all else, above party politics and ideology. That was not the sense I got,” about Jorjani, Manchin said at the time.

Beck, the Interior spokeswoman, maintained that Jorjani’s role does not often require reviewing FOIA requests.

“He is responsible for providing direction to a FOIA program of over 140 employees working on a caseload that has increased more than 25 percent during this administration. In this role he does not typically review individual FOIA requests,” she said.

Other emails released from EarthJustice show Interior’s career staff were confused by how to process FOIA requests once political appointees were involved.

“What response is needed for us to release the documents? For example, several people responded by saying, ‘Thanks for sharing,’ or just ‘Thank you.’ Is that enough? Can I presume that we can release the records? Do I need to wait for all the people on the email chain to respond a certain way?” asked Clarice Julka, a FOIA public liaison for Interior wrote in April of 2018. “Right now, I’m holding up releases because I’m not sure what response I need to have before I can release. Should I continue to wait on these releases or should I go ahead?”

Later that month she expressed annoyance at delays and other issues stemming from political appointee review.

“It’s very confusing and I feel that we shouldn’t be responsible to read your or their minds about how to handle this since from the past, it’s been very clear that my office will be blamed for anything deemed to be a mistake,” she said.

Interior policy notes that if political appointees do not respond when notified about a FOIA request, it will be considered a green light to proceed with the request.

Despite that, numerous emails between FOIA staffers and other employees at Interior show employees were often seeking explicit approval before fulfilling FOIA requests.

But one email shows Interior Sec. David Bernhardt was hesitant to put his own approval in writing.

An email from a FOIA officer to Julka references a conversation with a woman listed only as Rachel.

“She met with Bernhardt this morning to discuss an upcoming release for litigation that is supposed to go out this Friday, April 27. She indicated that Bernhardt said it could go out then, but she also indicated he will not be putting this affirmation into writing and that if he said it could go out, we do not need to hear from anyone else. I explained that per my most recent understanding, we all need approvals in writing from both the comms office and himself. Rachel told me that was not going to happen this time,” the email said.

Weiss said such a move lacks transparency.

“It begs the question of what else David Bernhardt doesn’t want to put in writing?” he said."
Opinion | A New Trump Battleground: Defining Human Rights,https://www.nytimes.com,['Carol Giacomo'],06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/17/opinion/editorials/trump-human-rights-natural-law.html,"After the horrors of World War II, the United States led in adopting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, recognizing the “inherent dignity” and “equal and inalienable rights” of all people to life and liberty. For three-quarters of a century it has stood for the protection of human rights by the rule of law.

Now, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is establishing a Commission on Unalienable Rights to “provide fresh thinking about human rights discourse where such discourse has departed from our nation’s founding principles of natural law and natural rights,” according to a notice in the Federal Register.

Fresh thinking isn’t necessarily a bad thing. But tampering with a legacy built over decades raises serious questions, especially when the State Department’s human rights bureau and Congress have so far been excluded from the process.

One concern is the reference to “natural law,” which is held to be more powerful than the laws people write, and can suggest a narrower, religious sensibility. When the term natural law has been thrown about, it’s often been by people concerned with what they think is unnatural — homosexuality, transgender rights, reproductive choice and sexual equality."
First on CNN: Controversial political appointee expected to be named Customs and Border Protection press secretary,https://www.cnn.com,['Geneva Sands'],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/18/politics/katharine-gorka-customs-and-border-protection/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Katharine Gorka, a political appointee at the Department of Homeland Security who has stirred controversy for her views on terrorism and her role in the department's efforts to combat violent extremism in the US, is expected to be the new press secretary at Customs and Border Protection.

Acting CBP Commissioner John Sanders told CNN Tuesday that Gorka is expected to take the position and he advocated for her to join the agency.

The move comes as President Donald Trump continues his rhetoric against undocumented immigrants and the increasing number of migrants crossing the southern border and claiming asylum.

Customs and Border Protection is the agency responsible for policing the US borders and facilitating legal trade and travel. It is also the frontline agency dealing with the surge of migrants at the southern border. If Gorka steps into this new role, she will be taking on the public face of the agency at the center of the President's attention, which has been struggling with capacity and resource issues.

The Department of Homeland Security has also seen a major turnover in senior staff in the wake of Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen's forced departure in April. Several CBP officials joined Kevin McAleenan at DHS headquarters when he was named acting Homeland Security secretary.

In response to a request for comment on her new post, Gorka told CNN Tuesday, ""I am honored for this opportunity to serve at CBP.""

Gorka is married to Sebastian Gorka, the former deputy assistant to Trump, who was an outspoken and combative defender of the President's national security agenda, known for his dire warnings of Islamic terrorism while writing for Breitbart.

Sebastian Gorka left the White House in August 2017, in the wake of chief White House strategist Steve Bannon's forced departure.

Both Gorkas wrote for Breitbart, where Bannon served as an executive before and after his time at the White House.

In a 2014, Breitbart story, Katharine Gorka, under the name Katie Gorka, wrote that ""Presidents Bush and Obama both publicly declared Islam to be a religion of peace, which has struck a sour chord for many. ""

""To date, American and Western leaders have preemptively shut down any debate within Islam by declaring that Islam is the religion of peace and that terrorism has nothing to do with Islam,"" she wrote

In another 2014 article, she wrote that the Obama administration ""narrowly defined the enemy as only the most violent jihadists: first Al Qaeda and now ISIS.""

""This inaccurate assessment of the enemy has its roots in left-wing theories about social movements,"" she wrote in part.

Gorka has supporters within the administration and department and was recommended by various people for a DHS policy job. ""She was very good at her job and is very intelligent,"" said the senior official about her time at DHS.

Gorka, who has been with the Trump administration since its beginning, was under consideration to lead the new DHS terrorism prevention office, but was not offered the position, according to two sources. An administration official said DHS did not want her past controversies to be a distraction from the work of the department.

While at DHS, she worked in the policy office on what is known as ""countering violent extremism"" issues, according to the official. Countering violent extremism efforts have historically been associated with preventing individuals from radicalizing and joining or carrying out attacks on behalf of Islamic terror groups, but some activity has been focused on thwarting threats from domestic terror movements, like white nationalist extremists.

In August 2017, the Huffington Post reported that Gorka and other aides worked to eliminate a DHS grant for Life After Hate, which would have been used to expand its outreach and intervention services for former white supremacists and others in the ""criminal underground."" Earlier that summer, DHS, under the leadership of then-DHS Secretary John Kelly, cut some organizations out of grant money to counter violent extremism -- including nearly a dozen that the Obama administration considered worthy of receiving the funds.

A DHS official also previously told the Huffington Post that the department, and Gorka, ""has a productive relationship with (Life After Hate) and has recently met and participated in events with its new leadership.""

A DHS spokesperson told CNN, ""Katie has been a valuable member of the DHS team, helping to advance the department's mission of preventing targeted violence and countering terrorism, regardless of ideology. We look forward to her continued service with the department in her new position at CBP as we work to secure the border and enforce our nation's immigration laws.""

In March, the legal watchdog group Democracy Forward sued the department for records detailing Gorka's role as a senior adviser at DHS, after it was unsuccessful with a Freedom of Information Act request.

""The public deserves to know what Katharine Gorka is doing at DHS, but the Trump administration isn't saying,"" said Democracy Forward spokeswoman Charisma Troiano at the time. ""We're suing to find out whether her extreme and biased views are driving Homeland Security resources away from real threats.""

Troiano said that the organization has yet to receive records and the lawsuit is ongoing.

Earlier this year, American Oversight also requested records from the department for Gorka ""to shed light on DHS counterterrorism efforts.""

""Katharine Gorka, an advisor in DHS's policy office has a long history of working with far-right national security groups, and her writings have been described as anti-Muslim in sentiment,"" wrote Executive Director Austin Evers in a letter to DHS in January.

It is unclear if the press secretary role has been finalized or when Gorka will begin at CBP. The agency's last press secretary left in March to join the communications team at the Environmental Protection Agency."
Moving USDA research agencies is part of Trump’s war on science and statistics,https://www.washingtonpost.com,['Editorial Board'],06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/moving-usda-research-agencies-is-part-of-trumps-war-on-science-and-statistics/2019/06/17/51c85328-9134-11e9-aadb-74e6b2b46f6a_story.html,"IN ITS war on science and statistics, the Trump administration has a habit of sidelining inconvenient information. Last week, it was at it again.

On Thursday, the Agriculture Department announced a decision to relocate two of its research agencies, the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, from Washington to the Kansas City region. The Economic Research Service, which investigates the economics of food, farming, natural resources and rural America, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which was established as part of the Food, Conservation and Energy Act of 2008, play a key role in providing the data essential for honest policy-making.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue initially declared an intention to move these sub-agencies 10 months ago but didn’t specify a location then. The USDA now says the move would put the agencies closer to the agricultural heartland while saving money both for taxpayers and for employees, because Washington is an expensive city. While the rationale may seem plausible , in reality the implications are worrying.

In theory, there’s no reason such agencies couldn’t function well in Kansas City or elsewhere. After all, as with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta, this would hardly be the first time a government agency operates from beyond Washington. But the way this operation has been managed, with insufficient warning and explanation, suggests an intention by the administration to encourage qualified analysts to leave government and stifle independent and objective research.

If carried out, the move will disrupt ongoing scientific research and displace several hundred federal employees with valuable experience. Since the abrupt announcement last August, many of the agencies’ top economists and scientists have quit.

The investigations carried out by these agencies have long underpinned decisions by Congress and by American farmers, much as research from the Bureau of Labor Statistics underpins decisions in others parts of the economy. And much of the information produced by the Economic Research Service has indeed been inconvenient for the administration, as it has illustrated the ills wrought by President Trump’s trade wars and how small farmers were helped only marginally by the 2017 Republican tax overhaul.

Democratic members of the House and Senate have introduced the Agriculture Research Integrity Act, which would bar the move. They are right to do so, but it would be best if the USDA took the hint and retreated from this abrupt and ill-considered relocation. The better way to get sunnier data would be to develop better policies."

Interior spending bill holds Trump administration accountable for 2017 promises,https://thehill.com,[],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/449247-interior-spending-bill-holds-trump-administration,"This week, the U.S. House of Representatives will take up its spending bill for the U.S. Department of the Interior for fiscal year 2020. The bill advanced out of the House Appropriations Committee with $13.8 billion budgeted for the agency, including increases in funding for conservation, public lands and wildlife management, but also containing revenue language related to the proposed Arctic National Wildlife Refuge oil and gas leasing program and aimed at protecting American citizens. The House should pass its appropriations bill with this language intact, and if their colleagues in the Senate truly care about not only preserving our public lands but protecting American taxpayers as well, they will do the same.

Two years ago, the widely opposed Trump tax cuts mortgaged the future of seniors and working families in order to hand massive tax breaks to Wall Street, corporations and the wealthiest 1 percent. At the same time, oil industry allies in Congress were able to circumvent normal legislative channels and take advantage of an expedited legislative process to include an Arctic Refuge drilling program in the tax bill. They knew that winning support for such a controversial measure in an above-board process would otherwise have been impossible.

The tax bill also took the unprecedented step of making oil leasing and development one of the official purposes of the Arctic Refuge — no other national wildlife refuge has oil and gas as a statutory purpose — undercutting the integrity of the Arctic Refuge and setting a dangerous precedent for America’s entire National Wildlife Refuge System.

When the unpopular tax bill passed, the Trump administration and its allies defended the equally unpopular Arctic drilling provision by claiming that opening the Arctic Refuge to leasing would generate billions for the U.S. treasury. What the language of the Interior appropriations bill does now is simply require Interior to set a minimum bid capable of generating the revenues promised by the tax bill — the agency can only move forward with a lease sale if it ensures the sale raises at least half of the $1 billion agreed to in the FY2018 budget resolution. By requiring a floor on what companies must pay to lease a piece of the Arctic Refuge’s fragile coastal plain, this provision holds the Trump administration accountable to its own promises.

Let’s be clear that we believe leasing and development should never occur in the Arctic Refuge, and Rep. Betty McCollum Betty Louise McCollumInterior spending bill holds Trump administration accountable for 2017 promises House Dems call on Trump to cancel plans to speak at July Fourth celebration House Dems call on Trump to cancel plans to speak at July Fourth celebration MORE (D-Minn.), chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee’s Interior-Environment Subcommittee, summed it up succinctly following committee markup of this year’s Interior bill: ""I oppose opening ANWR, but now that it's in the tax bill, we must ensure the American taxpayer is protected.""

From the very beginning, the stated reason for having a federal oil and gas program in the Arctic Refuge was always to raise revenue for the federal treasury. There was never any real evidence to back up the billion-dollar claim, and in fact many experts at the time pointed out that raising the proposed revenue would depend on the highly unlikely scenario of leasing nearly every acre of the coastal plain at sky-high prices. What is illuminating, however, has been the reaction and artificial offense taken by the architects of the Arctic Refuge leasing program to this Interior bill language.

Following the House markup, Sen. Lisa Murkowski Lisa Ann MurkowskiInterior spending bill holds Trump administration accountable for 2017 promises Hillicon Valley: Hacker group targeted electric grid | House Democrats press CBP over facial recognition program | Senators offer bill to protect health data | Groups file FCC complaint over carriers' use of location data Hillicon Valley: Hacker group targeted electric grid | House Democrats press CBP over facial recognition program | Senators offer bill to protect health data | Groups file FCC complaint over carriers' use of location data MORE (R-Alaska), the driving force pushing for Arctic Refuge development, was quoted as saying, ""I think what they've set up is something that's designed to kill exploration in ANWR.""

And in a letter to Rep. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.), the chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, the White House Office of Management and Budget wrote:

In addition, section 118 prohibits DOI from using funds to conduct a lease sale in the Coastal Plain (1002 area) of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, unless that sale meets arbitrary national minimum bid criteria. This restriction imposes unnecessary and unrealistic restrictions on leasing in an area that the Congress has already authorized.

Think about that for a second. The driving force behind the leasing program, Lisa Murkowski, admits that requiring minimum bids today to meet revenue she herself defended two years ago would “kill exploration” in the Arctic Refuge. The Trump administration has put in writing that it believes the projections used to sell Congress and the public on allowing oil development were “arbitrary” and “unnecessary and unrealistic.” As a reminder, the ONLY reason an Arctic Refuge leasing program was able to be included in the reconciliation process in the first places was as a billion-dollar offset for tax cuts.

Call it lying to the American public, call it misleading, but whatever you call it, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has been opened to the risk of a massive oil drilling operation based on willful dishonesty. Experts didn’t buy the numbers then, and they still don’t today. And now we know Murkowski and the Trump administration never really believed their own promises either.

In our opinion: The Department of Agriculture is moving workers to Kansas City. Utahns should hope they can be next,https://www.deseretnews.com,[],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900075743/in-our-opinion-the-department-of-agriculture-is-moving-workers-to-kanas-city-utahns-should-hope-they-can-be-next-blm-usda.html,"Utah is still waiting to see whether the Trump administration decides to move its Bureau of Land Management headquarters here from Washington — a move that makes sense considering how most BLM decisions affect the West much more than any property along the Potomac.

Continuing this trend, the administration announced last week that economists and scientists at the Department of Agriculture will be relocated to Kansas City. This is another move that makes great sense, considering that bureaucracy’s effect on farmers concentrated in the heartland.

The good sense seemed lost on angry employees of the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, however. Many of them stood and turned their backs on Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue as he made the announcement last Thursday.

Frankly, they need to get over it. Those affected by federal decisions have little need for bureaucrats who want to cling to the power structure in Washington.

"" Those affected by federal decisions have little need for bureaucrats who want to cling to the power structure in Washington. ""

CNN cited concerns by employees who don’t want to be separated from the government they serve. That is a perfect example of the problem. They are supposed to serve the people, not the government.

That said, we sympathize with workers who would need to uproot their families, sell houses, leave friends and move to an entirely different part of the country. Such moves are not easy. Millions of people each year face decisions whether to go where their employer wants them to go or to find other work that would allow them to stay. These can be difficult choices, and we acknowledge that, unlike the BLM, where many workers already reside in various states, these agencies operate mainly in Washington. However, we have no doubt that Department of Agriculture employees will weather these changes as well as have others in various industries.

Critics worry about the loss of institutional knowledge if these agencies need to hire new people. This may be a valid concern, but it should be weighed against the possible gains of having fresh eyes with fresh ideas looking at old problems. Stagnation, entrenchment and an attitude of entitlement are bigger concerns in bureaucracies.

These agencies are supposed to produce nonpartisan reports and analyses. That should be as easy to do in Kansas City as it is in Washington, where politics permeate every crevice.

Administrations will shift from conservative to liberal and back again through the years. But having these agencies close to the people they serve will add a new level of accountability.

Besides all this, the move makes great economic sense. The department estimates a savings of $300 million over 15 years. Kansas City has more modest living costs and lower salaries than does Washington.

In addition, the move will be a boon to the Kansas City economy, adding many good-paying jobs.

Perhaps only a Washington bureaucrat could find fault with such a move. Utahns, meanwhile, should hope they soon can host the headquarters of the BLM. Spreading the federal government among the people is a capital idea."
"State Department cuts new funds to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, pending immigration fixes",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/el-salvador-guatemala-honduras-funds-state-department-immigration-fixes,"The State Department announced Monday it will cut new foreign aid to the ""Northern Triangle"" countries -- Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador -- unless their governments take ""concrete action"" to stem the flow of migrants towards the United States.

The aggressive move came less than two weeks after the Trump administration reached a last-minute deal with Mexico, which called for the country's deployment of more troops to its own southern border and tighter asylum protocols. The U.S. and Mexico reached the accord shortly before the White House was set to impose a series of escalating tariffs on its southern neighbor.

President Trump previously pushed in March to cut $615 million in aid to the Northern Triangle, noting that the nations have been home to some of the migrant caravans that have marched through Mexico to the U.S. border to claim asylum, in some cases fraudulently.

On further review, the State Department said the administration has decided to continue to provide $432 million for anti-gang, education, and health initiatives. U.S. officials said the review looked at roughly 700 projects funded with fiscal 2017 money by the United States in the three countries and concluded that a significant number were too far advanced to end them.

MEXICO VOWS TO HELP CENTRAL AMERICAN MIGRANTS AMID CRACKDOWN

However, the latest plans showed roughly $370 million from the fiscal year 2018 budget will no longer be spent on the Northern Triangle and approximately $185 million in funding from the 2017 budget will be withheld, at least for now.

A State Department official told Fox News a re-evaluation would be concluded no later than April 2020.

""We will not provide new funds for programs in those countries until we are satisfied that the Northern Triangle governments are taking concrete actions to reduce the number of migrants coming to the U.S. border,"" State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said. ""This is consistent with the president’s direction and with the recognition that it is critical that there be sufficient political will in these countries to address the problem at its source.""

She added, ""Working with Congress, we will reprogram those funds to other priorities as appropriate.""

Ortagus noted that ""previously awarded grants and contracts will continue with current funding.""

Many Democrats called the decision callous and unproductive.

""As feared, a presidential tantrum will limit our nation’s ability to actually help address the challenges forcing people to flee to the U.S.,"" Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., tweeted.

The Northern Triangle's immigration policies have long rankled the Trump administration. Last December, the U.S. pledged more than $10 billion in aid to Central America and Mexico to help keep migrants put. Later that month, Trump tweeted: ""...Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are doing nothing for the United States but taking our money.

""Word is that a new Caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it,"" Trump added. ""We will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries -- taking advantage of U.S. for years!""

The State Department in March then notified Congress that it would look to suspend 2017 and 2018 payments to the trio of nations.

Meanwhile, Mexico has offered refuge to migrants with credible fears as thousands remain in the country while they await court dates for asylum petitions in the U.S. The understaffed and underfunded Mexican refugee commission has faced a backlog of cases.

But, in recent months, police and immigration have stepped up enforcement in southern Mexico, setting up highway checkpoints, raiding a caravan of mostly Central American migrants and trying to keep people off the northbound train known as ""the beast.""

At the same time, Mexicans have grown increasingly intolerant of the large numbers of migrants passing through their country in an attempt to reach the United States.

A June poll in Mexican newspaper El Universal showed that Mexicans are less receptive to allowing undocumented migrants to come in, or to stay on permanently as refugees, than they were in October, when caravans with thousands of Central American migrants were winding their way north.

Cook County Homeland Security Command Van Moved Amid Complaints,https://patch.com,[],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://patch.com/illinois/evanston/cook-county-homeland-security-command-van-moved-amid-complaints,"EVANSTON, IL — A Cook County command van was moved away from a street festival Saturday in Evanston after the presence of the large Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management vehicle at the Custer Street Fair prompted protests from residents.

The logo for the county emergency management agency, DHSEM, bears some similarity to that of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, commonly called ICE. Some residents complained that instead of increasing the sense of safety among fair attendees, the vehicle needlessly intimidated community members.

In social media posts, Evanston's police and fire departments announced they were working with the city's Office of Emergency Management and the Cook County homeland security department to provide security for the Custer Fair, including the command van and proactive barricades.

""This van is no way affiliated with ICE — Immigration and Customs Enforcement,"" police pointed out.

The mobile command center was subsequently replaced by a city-operated dump truck. Residents said it was relocated to a car dealership parking lot following complaints by neighbors.

Mayor Steve Hagerty responded with a message of support for the van.



""Public safety and being a welcoming city are not mutually exclusive. The City's priority is keeping people safe at the Custer Street Fair, not monitoring people for ICE,"" Hagerty responded on social media. ""I appreciate Cook County providing this Command Center.""



In October 2017, the mayor signed an updated ""Welcoming City Ordinance"" that protects people in the country illegally from being held by federal immigration authorities without a warrant signed by a federal judge. Hagerty has also operated an emergency management consulting company for the past 18 years.

""Should anything go wrong (e.g., weather, man made event, etc.), having a command center nearby is helpful for the emergency response. The Center can also be used proactively to monitor the weather at that specific location. The vehicle is not used in any way as part of immigration enforcement,"" Hagerty said, in an emailed response to concerned residents.

The mayor noted the command center had appeared in Evanston at previous occasions and said city officials would look to give the public the opportunity to check it out during a non-event in the future to see how it helps emergency responders.

""Nonetheless, we understand the size, location, and presence of this vehicle at Custer Street alarmed some people, particularly given the national focus on immigration,"" Hagerty said. ""To address these concerns, show more sensitivity towards our immigrant neighbors, and ensure strong economic activity for our vendors and businesses, in the future we will not use this type of vehicle as a barricade but instead, when we have it, place it nearby in a less public and prominent location.""

Over the past 18 months, the Unified Command Post, or UCP, has been used 41 times for events and festivals across 29 different municipalities in the past 18 months, according to information from county officials provided by Fire Chief Brian Scott. He said the post provides assistance monitoring weather and emergency medical services needs, as well as functioning as a unified emergency management center should something go seriously wrong.

""The mobile unified command center is an $830,000 asset with six on-board computer work stations and state of the art mobile communications suite that helps ensure interoperability. It also includes thermal imaging, a weather monitoring and incident management tools to assist fire and police officers,"" Scott said. Out of respect for some of the concerns raised by residents, he said, it was relocated Sunday to a block north of the fair.

""Given our most recent experience at the 2019 [Custer Street Fair], we will make sure to consider and be sensitive to the concerns raised by the immigrant community and their supporters,"" Scott said. ""Future steps could include pre-education opportunities for the entire Evanston community to see and visit the UCP to learn more about the vehicle as well as strategically placing the vehicle at future events in a less prominent location while still being able to utilize the UCP's full capability.""

Several residents commented in response that people left or did not attend the fair due to the presence of the Cook County vehicle, which could have been mistaken for one operated by federal immigration enforcement authorities.



""I am very disappointed the city decided to bring this command truck without thinking of the [trauma] it is putting our immigrant families through,"" one Evanston resident said. ""We have many resources in Evanston. Our city officials need to think of the decisions it makes if they expect our immigrant community to trust them.""

""My family won't be attending the fair because we feel unwelcome,"" said a Chicago resident. ""This is NOT normal and this is NOT ok. Don't try to normalize it with this lame post. This is totally tone deaf and damaging to the relationship the police force has with the community. Do better.""

Though dozens of commentators were critical of the presence of the vehicle, several people suggested those outraged by its presence were overreacting.



""Does anybody remember Nice France,"" 8th Ward Ald. Ann Rainey asked, a reference to a 2016 vehicular attack on a large outdoor Bastille Day celebration. She said the trailer had been misinterpreted. ""It was used at [Northwestern University's Dillo Day] without comment. Evanston is a wonderful caring City, and I know of no one who lives in fear here. I believe 99% of the population would back me up on that statement.""

""Stop being such a bunch of cry babies and get on with your lives and grow up,"" said a retired Evanston police officer. ""The van not going to hurt you, it's there for your protection. If you don't want to attend, then don't.""

President Donald Trump announced Monday night in a social media post that ICE would ""begin the process of removing the millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States. They will be removed as fast as they come in.""
