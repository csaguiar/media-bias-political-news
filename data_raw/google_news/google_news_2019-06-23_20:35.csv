Trump says he'd rather run against Biden than face another campaign against Clinton,https://www.foxnews.com,"[""Andrew O'Reilly""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-hed-rather-run-against-biden-than-face-another-campaign-against-clinton,"President Trump said that he would prefer to run against former Vice President Joe Biden than have to face another campaign against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

Trump, who has continued to launch criticisms at Clinton even after defeating her in the 2016 presidential race, offered rare praise of the former secretary of state while once again labeling Biden as “sleepy.”

“I actually think that Hillary Clinton was a great candidate. She was very smart. She was very tough. She was ruthless and vicious,” Trump said during an interview on NBC’s “Meet The Press.” “[Biden’s] sleepy. She was not sleepy.”

BIDEN, UNDER FIRE FOR COMMENTS ON SEGREGATIONISTS, GAVE EULOGIES FOR STROM THURMOND, ROBERT BYRD

This is not the first time Trump has claimed that he would prefer running against Biden – who consistently leads a crowded Democratic field and has enjoyed success in head-to-head polls against Trump – to other candidates in 2020.

“I’d rather run against, I think, Biden than anybody,” Trump said earlier this month. “I think he’s the weakest mentally and I like running against people that are weak mentally … The other ones have much more energy.""

Biden was also attacked this weekend by fellow Democratic presidential candidates during speeches at the South Carolina Democratic Party's convention.

Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said on Saturday that voters mustn't ""turn back the clock"" but instead, ""Let's start the next chapter. Let's turn the page.""

It was a demonstration that Biden, who has drawn fire in recent weeks for his reversal on opposing taxpayer funding of abortion and his recollections of working with long-dead segregationist senators, won't become the Democratic nominee without an intense fight, no matter his front-runner's strategy.

Biden had the luxury of the last word Saturday, using his draw as the last of 20 candidates at the rostrum to deliver a rapid-fire litany of policy proposals, including a new pitch for an $8,000 tax credit for child care services.

The former vice president avoided mention of his recent spat with New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who'd called for the former vice president to apologize after recalling how he had to work with virulent segregationists when he was first elected to the Senate in 1972. Booker took particular exception to Biden noting that Mississippi Sen. James Eastland ""never called me boy,"" only ""son.""

In an interview with MSNBC after his speech Saturday, Biden did not apologize, saying his remarks got twisted. ""I do understand the consequence of the word boy, but it wasn't said in any of that context at all,"" Biden says.

Trump says he's not ready for a 2020 election loss,https://www.cnn.com,['Maegan Vazquez'],06-23-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/23/politics/donald-trump-2020-election-not-prepared-loss/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump said in an interview aired Sunday that he's not prepared to lose the 2020 presidential election .

""It would be much better if I said, 'Yeah.' It would be much easier for me to say, 'Oh, yes.' No, I'm probably not too prepared to lose. I don't like losing. I haven't lost very much in my life,"" Trump told NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

Trump also subsequently reasserted that he doesn't ""believe"" in the validity of ""a lot"" of votes cast which show he lost the popular vote in 2016 to Hillary Clinton.

""I'll say something that, again, is controversial. There were a lot of votes cast that I don't believe,"" Trump said.

Outwardly, the President seems to be trudging forward with the idea that he's an unstoppable candidate -- tweeting out a video on Friday showing fictitious Trump campaign signs (e.g. ""Trump 2040"") for every election until just about the end of time.

But within the Trump campaign, polling numbers suggest some concern over his viability in some key states.

The Trump campaign fired several pollsters after internal polling numbers showed the President lagging behind Democratic presidential candidates in key states were made public, multiple sources told CNN last week.

CNN and other outlets first reported the numbers -- which showed Trump trailing former Vice President Joe Biden in states like Michigan and Wisconsin -- weeks earlier, but a purge of the polling team was proposed after Trump grew angry about coverage of them.

On ""Meet the Press,"" the President also spoke about the upcoming election, confirming that Vice President Mike Pence would be his running mate for his 2020 run.

But Trump stopped short of offering Pence an endorsement for a hypothetical 2024 presidential run because the prospect is ""so far out."" Trump was asked the same hypothetical earlier this month on ""Fox and Friends.""

""I'm not even thinking of it. It's so far out. I mean, It's so far out. That would be the only reason,"" Trump told ""Meet the Press,"" Sunday adding, ""Now what happens in 2024? I don't know that Mike is going to run. I don't know who's running or anything else.""

Trump also said it was a ""tremendous embarrassment"" to Biden that former President Barack Obama's hadn't endorsed the former vice president yet.

He also said he ""may"" address election interference with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the upcoming G20 summit.

""Are you going to tell him not to do it?"" ""Meet the Press"" host Chuck Todd asked.

Trump responded, ""I may if you'd like me to do it, I'll do that.""

The President said he believes House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is not giving in to pressure from within her caucus to initiate impeachment proceedings because she fears doing so would benefit him politically.

""I think she feels that I will win much easier,"" Trump said. ""I mean, I've been told that by many people.""

Despite arguing impeachment would boost his reelection prospects, the President said he does not like the specter of impeachment hanging over him.

""I'm not sure that I like having it. Look, I did nothing wrong,"" Trump said before calling impeachment ""a very unfair thing."""
Trump Shrugs Off Khashoggi Killing by Ally Saudi Arabia,https://www.nytimes.com,['Michael D. Shear'],06-23-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/23/us/politics/trump-khashoggi-killing-saudi-arabia.html,"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Sunday shrugged off the brutal dismembering of Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist, just days after a United Nations report described how a team of Saudi assassins called Mr. Khashoggi a “sacrificial animal” before his murder.

The U.N. report urged an F.B.I. investigation into the slaying. But in an interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Mr. Trump said the episode had already been thoroughly investigated. He said the Middle East is “a vicious, hostile place” and noted that Saudi Arabia is an important trading partner with the United States.

“I only say they spend $400 to $450 billion over a period of time, all money, all jobs, buying equipment,” the president told Chuck Todd, the show’s moderator. “I’m not like a fool that says, ‘We don’t want to do business with them.’ And by the way, if they don’t do business with us, you know what they do? They’ll do business with the Russians or with the Chinese.”

Just days after pulling back from striking Iran for its downing of an American surveillance drone, Mr. Trump also said he was “not looking for war,” but added that if the United States went to war with Iran, “it’ll be obliteration like you’ve never seen before.”"
Trump says no preconditions to talks with Iran; warns war would lead to 'obliteration',https://www.foxnews.com,"[""Andrew O'Reilly""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-no-preconditions-to-talks-with-iran-warns-war-would-lead-to-obliteration,"President Trump has expressed his willingness to open talks with Iranian officials without any preconditions – saying that he doesn’t want a war with the Islamic Republic, but if it comes down to an armed conflict it will be “obliteration like you've never seen before.”

In an interview that aired Sunday on NBC’s “Meet The Press,” Trump said the only line he was drawing in the sand when it came to discussions with Iran was that the country could not have a nuclear weapon.

“I'm not looking for war and if there is, it'll be obliteration like you've never seen before,” Trump said. “But I'm not looking to do that. But you can't have a nuclear weapon. You want to talk? Good. Otherwise you can have a bad economy for the next three years.”

GEN. JACK KEANE PRAISES TRUMP'S PRESSURE CAMPAIGN ON IRAN: 'FIRST RATE'

Trump’s interview, which was conducted on Friday, came just hours after he announced on Twitter that he had called off a retaliatory strike on Thursday night following the downing of an unmanned U.S. drone by Iran.

When questioned why he called off the strike at the last minute, Trump said he thought the loss of life that would have occurred in Iran was “not proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone.”

“I thought about it for a second and I said, ‘You know what? They shot down an unmanned drone, plane, whatever you want to call it. And here we are sitting with 150 dead people that would have taken place probably within a half an hour after I said go ahead,” Trump said. “And I didn't like it. I didn't think it was, I didn’t think it was proportionate.”

The president noted that instead of a military strike, his administration plans to ratchet up the already hefty sanctions on Iran.

“We're increasing the sanctions now,” he said. “The response is always going to be very strong.”

Along with the sanctions, the U.S. on Thursday reportedly launched a series of cyberattacks that disabled Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps computer systems that controlled its rocket and missile launchers.

The president’s openness to talk with Iran was countered on Sunday by National Security Adviser John Bolton, who said in a speech Sunday in Jerusalem that Iran should not ""mistake U.S. prudence and discretion for weakness.”

Bolton's tough message seemed to be aimed not only at Tehran, but also at reassuring key U.S. allies that the White House remains committed to maintaining pressure on Iran. Israel, along with Arab countries in the Gulf, considers Iran to be their greatest threat, and Trump's last-minute about-face appears to have raised questions about U.S. willingness to use force against the Islamic Republic.

On Sunday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani blamed the United States' ""interventionist military presence"" for fanning the flames. He was quoted by the official IRNA news agency.

""The region is very sensitive and security of the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman waterways is important to many countries. We expect international bodies to show proper reaction to the invasion move,"" Rouhani said about the downing of the U.S. drone.

Iran's foreign minister also said Bolton was trying to force the U.S. into a conflict with Iran. Javad Zarif tweeted that the presidential adviser was ""moments away from trapping"" Trump into a ""war,"" before the U.S. president called off the strikes against Iran.

The response to Iran’s downing on a U.S. drone has highlighted a growing divide between Trump and his national security adviser.

In his interview on “Meet The Press,” Trump said that Bolton was “absolutely a hawk,” but added that he wanted “hawks” and “doves” equally represented in his administration.

“If it was up to [Bolton] he'd take on the whole world at one time, okay? But that doesn't matter because I want both sides,” Trump said.

Officials accuse DHS chief Kevin McAleenan of leaking ICE raids plan to sabotage operation,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-23-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/officials-accuse-dhs-chief-kevin-mcaleenan-of-leaking-ice-raids-plan-to-sabotage-operation,"This week's big leak about a major Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation was orchestrated by acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan in an effort to sabotage the raids before they were scheduled to take place, according to three current and two former senior administration officials.

In a move he said was to placate Democrats, President Trump announced on Saturday that the nationwide immigration enforcement operation planned to start Sunday — aimed at migrant families who illegally remain in the country despite being denied asylum — was called off to give lawmakers two weeks to work on a plan to fix legal “loopholes” he said have enticed migrants to come to the U.S.

However, all five officials who spoke with the Washington Examiner confirmed McAleenan's decision to go rogue and stymie the operation was what prompted the White House to call off the 10-city operation.

The planned raids in cities such as Los Angeles, Miami, and Houston, were first reported by the Washington Post on Friday.

The sources said only a small number of people in the White House, ICE, and DHS were even aware of the plan’s details, including which cities, the date and time, and who would be targeted.

Two officials said the acting secretary, who was promoted internally in April, had fought for months during closed-door discussions with White House officials, the former acting ICE Director Ronald Vitiello, and the new acting ICE Director Mark Morgan against the plan, which they noted was similar to one the Obama administration carried out in 2015.

“I know he has not approved of this operation for months,” one person familiar with those private conversations said during a phone call Saturday night. “The president wouldn’t leak that. ICE wouldn’t leak that. There’s only a few people involved in these discussions … The only one who could have shared the details of those operations were Kevin.”

“That’s our belief,” a second official said when asked if McAleenan was behind the leak. “The secretary was not supportive from day one.”

The first official said McAleenan may have leaked it so that he could “be the martyr” in the face of anticipated blowback in the future.

A third official claimed McAleenan “cares more about what liberals and 'Never Trumpers' in Congress and the media think of him the achieving the express mission of his department.”

“[T]his will leave an un-erasable mark on his tenure,” the third official wrote in a text message Saturday evening.

Leaking the information would only have “benefitted one person” who had knowledge of the plan, according to the first person, who added there was “no doubt in my mind” McAleenan either told the Post himself or had a close comrade at DHS take care of it.

“His hands were dirty,” that same official said.

McAleenan traveled with the author of the Post report, Nick Miroff, on a government plane down to the border on Wednesday.

DHS did not respond to a request for comment.

Following the Post report Friday, ICE advised the White House not to go forward with the raids, in part because those who were the targets might have fled the locations Enforcement and Removal Operations officers had expected to find them.

“Leaking the locations and details to stop the operation from happening not only harmed operational integrity, but it put the safety and well-being of his own officers in jeopardy,” the third official wrote.

“That’s law enforcement sensitive information. You just don’t reveal that,” the second official said. “It gets people hyped up. It gets the NGOs activated, and then anyone wearing a jacket with the ICE name on it is really chastised. Cities are coming out saying, ‘Here’s how you can protect yourself against it.’”

That same official said the “worst” consequence of the leak, especially if it was directed by the department’s leader, was how it endangered personnel.

“It really jeopardized the safety of law enforcement officers — that’s the part that’s really detrimental,” the official said."

Ex-top CIA official perturbed by John Durham's review of intelligence analysts,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,['Ap Photo Manuel Balce Ceneta'],06-22-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ex-top-cia-official-perturbed-by-john-durhams-review-of-intelligence-analysts,"A former top CIA official warned of dire consequences from the Justice Department's review of the origins of the Russia investigation.

Michael Morell (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)

As part of the ""investigation into the investigators,"" U.S. Attorney John Durham's team reportedly wants to talk to at least one senior CIA counterintelligence official and a senior CIA analyst who examined Russia's role in meddling in the 2016 election.

The review is not a criminal inquiry, but should Durham find criminal activity he can take prosecutorial action. Top CIA officials are said to be anxious over the federal prosecutor's efforts.

Michael Morell, who was deputy director of the CIA during the Obama administration, said Durham's interest in speaking to a CIA analyst concerns him.

""I see no problem with a DOJ review of whether the CIA and other intelligence community agencies lived up to their legal and regulatory responsibilities related to how they handled any information related to U.S. persons — U.S. citizens and U.S. nationals,"" Morell told CBS News, where he is now a senior national security contributor.

""Having said that, I see a DOJ review of whether or not the intelligence analysts made the right call as wholly inappropriate. I cannot ever remember a DOJ review of analysis,"" Morrell added.

""[Durham] and his team have no experience with, or knowledge of, the process of intelligence analysis,"" Morell said. ""He and his team could well impose a law enforcement standard in coming to a conclusion — a much higher bar than exists in the intelligence community for analytic judgments.""

American officials say Attorney General William Barr, who is overseeing Durham's efforts and earlier this year riled Democrats when he said ""spying did occur"" against the Trump 2016 campaign, wants to understand how the CIA coordinated with the FBI and how the agency came to its conclusion that Russian President Vladimir Putin gave the order to sow discord in the election to help Trump and undermine his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton.

That effort culminated in the January 2017 release of a intelligence community assessment, commissioned by former President Barack Obama. In that report, the CIA and FBI expressed ""high confidence"" that Russia sought to boost Trump while the National Security Agency had ""moderate confidence.""

The Senate and House intelligence committees both reviewed the assessment, revealing a partisan divide. While the Senate panel, known for being largely bipartisan, called it a ""sound intelligence product,"" the House Intelligence Committee was more critical. In 2018, the then-GOP led House panel said most of the assessment's analysis ""held up to scrutiny,"" but noted the judgment about Putin ""failed to meet most of the analytic standards set forth in the primary guiding document for [intelligence community] analysis."" Democrats on the committee disagreed with that assessment.

Democrats argue Barr's effort is part of a plan to stonewall the public from learning about President Trump potentially committing obstruction of justice. Upon the conclusion of his Russia investigation, special counsel Robert Mueller laid out 10 instances of possible obstruction but declined to make a determination about whether he should be accused of a crime.

""Trump and Barr conspire to weaponize law enforcement and classified information against their political enemies. The coverup has entered a new and dangerous phase,"" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said in a tweet after the president gave Barr sweeping powers to declassify documents in the investigation.

Siding with Democrats, Morrell said he feels ""strongly"" the Justice Department has ""NO business"" doing a follow-up review of the intelligence community analysis. ""It does not have the knowledge & expertise necessary to get the right answers and it could well have a chilling effect across the analytic community,"" he said in a tweet."
"Pompeo, a Steadfast Hawk, Coaxes a Hesitant Trump on Iran",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Edward Wong', 'Michael Crowley']",06-22-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/22/world/middleeast/trump-pompeo-iran.html,"WASHINGTON — In the days leading up to President Trump’s decision on whether to launch a missile strike against Iran, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo commanded the stage.

After warning that Mr. Trump was prepared to use force because of Iran’s suspected role in oil tanker attacks, Mr. Pompeo flew to Florida on Monday to strategize with generals at Central Command. Back in Washington, he briefed the foreign minister of the European Union on intelligence. By Thursday, he was pressing the case in the White House Situation Room for a strike.

Mr. Pompeo was steering Mr. Trump toward one of the most consequential actions of the administration. Only at the last minute did the president reverse course and cancel the strike.

The confrontation with Iran has put a spotlight on the extent of Mr. Pompeo’s influence with Mr. Trump. In an administration that churns through cabinet members at a dizzying pace, few have survived as long as Mr. Pompeo — and none have as much stature, a feat he has achieved through an uncanny ability to read the president’s desires and translate them into policy and public messaging. He has also taken advantage of a leadership void at the Defense Department, which has gone nearly six months without a confirmed secretary."
VA employees say agency is actively retaliating against whistleblowers,https://thehill.com,[],06-22-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/449882-va-employees-say-agency-is-actively-retaliating-against-whistleblowers,"Three employees at the Department of Veterans Affairs said in new interviews that they were sidelined at their jobs and stripped of responsibilities after they raised alarms about improper treatment of patients.

In interviews with USA Today the three staffers, physician Katherine Mitchell, CT technologist Jeffrey Dettbarn, and physiologist Minu Aghveli said that they were removed from patient care positions to prevent them from learning of future or ongoing abuses at the agency.

The three are set to testify before Congress on a wide range of patient mistreatment this week.

""The VA is two-faced: What it says it does and what it actually does are two entirely different things,"" Mitchell told USA Today. ""Whistleblowers who are brave enough to report problems serve as a vital safety net for veterans. If people can’t identify problems, veterans will suffer and die. That’s what it boils down to.""

""As a physician, nurse, and basically as a human being, I will not back down if someone’s health or safety is being threatened,"" she added in the interview.

Dettbarn, who said he hoped to return to patient care, added that a culture of fear at the agency had led to few staffers advocating on behalf of patients.

""There's nobody there to watch out for the veterans,"" he told the newspaper. ""They've got everybody else scared to say anything. Who's taking care of those patients?""

Sidelining those who speak out, she added, ""jeopardizes the health and safety of every veteran in the system.""

A spokesman for the agency declined to comment to USA Today on the assertions from Mitchell and the others. In a statement to The Hill, an agency spokesperson stressed that the agency was working on implementing new improvements to protect whistleblowers.

""These include providing timelier resolutions, more responsive recommendations and enhancing communications with whistleblowers,"" the spokesperson said.

""VA does not tolerate retaliation against employees who have made a protected disclosure,"" the spokesperson continued. ""Any employee who feels they have been retaliated against for making a protected disclosure is encouraged to contact VA’s Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection (OAWP).""

Trainer Steve Asmussen, sued for the third time by the U.S. Department of Labor

For the third time since 2012, Hall of Fame trainer Steve Asmussen has been sued by the United States Department of Labor for alleged violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 by his KDE Equine LLC, which does business as Asmussen Racing Stable.

The suit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York on June 7, alleges that Asmussen's hot walkers and grooms working at Belmont Park and Saratoga are owed hundreds of thousands of dollars for unpaid overtime pay and that the stable has falsified timesheets.

Asmussen was first sued by the Department of Labor in New York in 2012 and again in Kentucky in 2015. Both suits were settled.

“Since January 2013, Defendants have been enjoined by this Court to comply fully with the Fair Labor Standards Act,” the latest filing reads. “Despite affirmatively recognizing and agreeing to comply with the FLSA as part of their resolution of previous overtime and recordkeeping violations, Defendants continue to willfully withhold from employees hundreds of thousands of dollars in wages owed for long hours caring for Defendants' prize-winning horses.”

The suit alleges the stable “wrongfully” pays flat salaries instead of adhering to labor law requiring overtime after 40 hours worked. It states Asmussen hot walkers routinely work 46.5 hours per week over seven days while grooms typically work a minimum of 60 hours.

“Defendants create falsified timesheets that consistently underreport the number of hours worked by hot walkers and groomers each week, and incorrectly report the start and stop times,” the suit alleges.

Employees often are not given time sheets to review or sign and sometimes are required to sign blank or incomplete sheets, according to the complaint.

The suit also alleges the stable does not adhere to terms and conditions of the H-2B visa program that permits temporary employment of foreign workers.

Trump's tax returns — DOJ trying to put off the inevitable?,https://thehill.com,[],06-23-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/449848-trumps-tax-returns-doj-trying-to-put-off-the-inevitable,"The Department of Justice (DOJ) finally submitted its brief explaining why the secretary of the Treasury and IRS commissioner are not complying with a Congressional subpoena issued to them from House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Nea for Donald Trump’s personal tax returns as well as business-related tax returns and return information from the IRS.

Essentially, the DOJ explained that it viewed the Congressional subpoena to be a pretext to obtain and then publicly disclose the President’s tax returns when he had made it clear that it was not his intention to do so.

The DOJ acknowledged that a plain-language reading of Section 6103(f) of the Internal Revenue Code required compliance and an obligation on the part of the IRS to turn over the requested tax returns — but then the DOJ divined and opined that Chairman Neal’s request had no legislative justification and was a pretextual means to a public disclosure end result that was ultimately motivated by politics.

IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig — a Trump appointee — declined to comply with a written request by Chairman Neal for Trump’s tax returns, passing the buck to his boss, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Steven Terner MnuchinTrump's tax returns — DOJ trying to put off the inevitable? GOP lawmakers want Mulvaney sidelined in budget talks The Hill's Morning Report — US strikes approved against Iran pulled back MORE. Mnuchin also demurred compliance with the Congressional subpoena, explaining that his rejection of the subpoena was upon the advice of the DOJ, whose above referenced written opinion would be forthcoming.

The DOJ opinion asserted that the executive function of government, which the IRS and Treasury Department fall under, has an obligation to protect the confidentiality of tax returns and would not accept the authority of a written request under Section 6103(f) from Congress unless there was an acceptable legislative intent behind the tax return request.

It is here that the rubber meets the road, and it is here that the courts will make their analysis and ultimately their decision.

In anticipation of the coming legal battle over disclosure of Trump’s tax returns, the IRS Office of Chief Counsel drafted a legal opinion titled “Congressional Access to Returns and Return Information.”

IRS Counsel deals with requests for tax returns from authorized agencies every day in each of its offices around the country. There is no more experienced legal authority when it comes to discerning the nuances of IRS disclosure authority than IRS Counsel. It also should be noted that the draft disclosure opinion by IRS Counsel was formulated prior to the placement of current IRS Chief Counsel Michael Desmond, who took office in February 2019.

So President Trump Donald John TrumpFormer Joint Chiefs chairman: 'The last thing in the world we need right now is a war with Iran' Pence: 'We're not convinced' downing of drone was 'authorized at the highest levels' Trump: Bolton would take on the whole world at one time MORE had in place both his hand-picked IRS commissioner, Rettig, as well as Chief Counsel Desmond to advise the Treasury secretary and past Trump business partner, Mnuchin, as to the best legal course to take with regard to the tax return disclosure issue. Yet Mnuchin chose to punt and to rely upon the DOJ for legal advice and ignore that of the best legal experts in the field on the matter.

We can only speculate that the DOJ was brought into this matter in conjunction with the current White House's stonewalling of all written requests and subpoenas from congressional oversight committees. Whatever the reason for the DOJ's entry into the tax disclosure matter, it would appear that the president is being ill served. It is highly likely that an appellate opinion will come down that will mirror that of the draft IRS Counsel opinion in this matter.

A couple of quotes from the IRS draft opinion are dispositive:

“In general, the statutes provide that the Secretary (Treasury) shall furnish returns and return information upon a specific written request from the Chair of the respective Committees... Unlike some other provisions of section 6103, the language in subsection 6103(f)(1) and (2) is mandatory , requiring the Secretary to disclose returns and return information requested from the tax-writing Chairs.”

furnish returns and return information upon a specific written request from the Chair of the respective Committees... Unlike some other provisions of section 6103, the language in subsection 6103(f)(1) and (2) is mandatory requiring the Secretary to disclose returns and return information requested from the tax-writing Chairs.” “Subsection (f)(1) and (2) do not require the Ways and Means and Finance Chair or JCT Chief of Staff to include a reason or purpose for the request. Therefore the Secretary’s obligation to disclose return and return information would not be affected by the failure of a tax-writing committee or the JCT to state a reason for the request.”

It should be noted that Chairman's Neal request did, in fact, include a reference to a need for the House Ways and Means committee to review Presidential audits: ""The Committee is considering legislative proposals and conducting oversight related to our Federal tax laws including but not limited to, the extent to which the IRS audits and enforces the Federal tax laws against a President.""

In a nutshell, what we have here is the Treasury secretary ignoring the advice of his most experienced legal minds with regard to IRS disclosure law and punting the issue to the DOJ and hoping that the creation — some would call a concoction — of an alternate legal issue over the plain-language reading of the IRS disclosure statute will ignite a constitutional issue worthy of a favorable appellate ruling.

Absent that, the only real accomplishment is kicking the can down the political road.

Justice delayed is justice denied.

Huawei sues Commerce Department over seized equipment,https://www.politico.com,['Steven Overly'],06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/21/huawei-commerce-department-lawsuit-1376703,"Huawei is suing the U.S. Commerce Department, saying it mishandled the Chinese company's equipment after a seizure. | Andy Wong/AP Photo technology Huawei sues Commerce Department over seized equipment

Chinese telecom giant Huawei has filed a civil lawsuit against the U.S. government accusing the Commerce Department of mishandling equipment that it seized from the company in 2017.

According to the complaint filed Friday, the U.S. government took possession of several pieces of equipment, which were being shipped from an independent testing facility in the United States to China, in order to determine if the technology was subject to export controls.

Huawei contends it provided the necessary documentation and was told such disputes are usually resolved in 45 days. Nearly two years later, Huawei believes the equipment is still sitting in an Alaskan warehouse, according to the complaint.

Huawei is not seeking financial compensation but instead wants the court to force the Commerce Department to decide whether export control clearance is necessary and, if not, release the equipment.

A spokesperson for the Commerce Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The lawsuit comes as tensions between Huawei and the U.S. government have reached a fever pitch.

The Justice Department charged Huawei earlier this year with violating U.S. sanctions against Iran and stealing trade secrets from U.S. competitors. Meanwhile, Huawei sued the U.S.government, saying a law passed by Congress that banned federal agencies from doing business with the company was unconstitutional.

What's more, the Commerce Department slapped severe trade restrictions on Huawei last month that prevent U.S. companies from selling vital equipment to the company, a penalty that Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei recently said could cost the company $30 billion in lost sales over two years.

Would-be presidents can’t wait to rule by fiat,https://www.bostonglobe.com,[],06-23-2019,2019,6,https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2019/06/23/would-presidents-can-wait-rule-fiat/eyIbk5rwdfF2I3XyxQ1zTN/story.html,"Some of Klobuchar’s promises are wholly conventional (“Visit our troops”) or matters of routine management (“Reduce State Department vacancies”). A few are about as noteworthy as calling water wet (“Fill judicial vacancies”).

‘After four years of Donald Trump,” declared Senator Amy Klobuchar in a statement on Tuesday, “a new president can’t wait for a bunch of congressional hearings to act.” To that end, the Minnesota Democrat, who hopes to become the new president in January 2021, issued a 16-page list of all the “concrete steps she will take in her first 100 days” if she is elected to the White House.

Many, however, would represent real shifts in US policy. Klobuchar’s pledges include the immediate importation of prescription drugs, a boost in the hourly minimum wage for federal contractors to $15, and a return to the Iran nuclear deal. Those aren’t modest adjustments; they would significantly change the way the federal government currently operates. Obviously that’s Klobuchar’s objective — and for many voters, the undoing of President Trump’s work can’t begin soon enough.

But do Americans really want their government to operate on the basis of unilateral presidential decrees? When Klobuchar dismisses any thought of waiting “for a bunch of congressional hearings” before upending the government’s priorities and principles, what she is really dismissing is the constitutional order, which puts Congress, not the president, in charge of changing US law. There is nothing ambiguous about Article I, Section 1 of the Constitution. “All legislative powers,” it begins, “shall be vested in a Congress of the United States.” All — not just the ones a president isn’t too impatient to wait for. Yet Congress is almost an afterthought in Klobuchar’s approach.

The senator from Minnesota is far from alone. Most of the leading Democratic presidential candidates are vowing to bypass Congress and use executive orders to get what they want.

Senator Elizabeth Warren says that on her first day as president, she’ll order a “total moratorium” on new fossil fuel leases, closing the door to drilling for energy offshore and on public lands. Senator Bernie Sanders will ban companies that outsource American jobs from qualifying for federal contracts. Beto O’Rourke would direct US officials to release from detention any undocumented immigrants with no criminal background. And Kamala Harris threatens an ultimatum: If members of Congress don’t “get their act together” and pass new gun-control laws within 100 days of her inauguration, she warns, she will impose the restrictions without them.

This tide of executive unilateralism rises with each incoming president.

George W. Bush authorized the use of “enhanced interrogation techniques,” including waterboarding and other practices widely considered torture, notwithstanding the prohibition of torture under longstanding US law and treaty. Barack Obama insisted many times that he had no authority on his own to waive the deportation of youthful undocumented immigrants — but then did so anyway by executive order in 2012. After Congress refused to fund a massive wall on the Mexican border, Trump declared that a national emergency empowered him to spend the money just the same.

For every such high-profile example of a president making law by edict, many more occur out of the spotlight. Increasingly, the vast powers of the federal bureaucracy are deployed not as Congress directs through legislation, but as presidents command through executive order. One of the first priorities of each incoming president now is to sign a slew of new directives countermanding the old ones. Before Trump entered the White House, he excoriated his predecessor for “constantly issuing executive orders that are major power grabs.” That hasn’t stopped him from spending the last 30 months engaged in power grabs of his own. It won’t stop his successor from going even further.

This is not a partisan complaint. Democrats and Republicans are equal offenders. Presidents are growing more and more autocratic, and that should alarm all Americans, whatever their political leanings. “The natural progress of things is for liberty to yield and government to gain ground,” Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1788. Could even he have imagined, though, just how much liberty Americans would eventually yield? Or just how much power they would allow presidents to amass?

There was a time when even the most dominant presidents took it for granted that they could not simply act without regard to Congress. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln had no choice but to move unilaterally, since the nation was under attack and Congress was out of session. But as soon as legislators returned to Washington, he took pains to secure congressional legitimacy for his actions. The same was true of Franklin Roosevelt. “Even through the World Wars and Depression,” writes Bruce Cannon Gibney in The Nonsense Factory , his sweeping new study of America’s legal system, “FDR accomplished most of his work through Congress . . . returning time and again to Congress and voters for support.”

Today’s presidents and would-be presidents, by contrast, make no secret of their intention to sidestep Congress. We can keep letting them get away with it. But an ever-more-overbearing presidency is not a recipe for American happiness. If that isn’t clear yet, just wait.

Dominican Republic official pushes back as US State Department hikes number of American tourist deaths to 10,https://wtop.com,['News Traffic Weather'],06-22-2019,2019,6,https://wtop.com/world/2019/06/dominican-republic-official-pushes-back-as-us-state-department-hikes-number-of-american-tourist-deaths-to-10/,"Dominican Republic Tourism Minister Francisco Javier Garcia pushed back on reports of a pattern of suspicious deaths of American citizens Friday, as the U.S. State Department hiked the official number of Americans who have died there in the last year to 10.

(SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic) — Dominican Republic Tourism Minister Francisco Javier Garcia pushed back on reports of a pattern of suspicious deaths of American citizens Friday, as the U.S. State Department hiked the official number of Americans who have died there in the last year to 10.

The tourism minister said the number of Americans who have died in the Dominican Republic has actually decreased this year, and that over the last three years there was a 56% reduction in the number of U.S. tourist deaths in the DR.

On Friday, the U.S. State Department confirmed the death of Mark Hurlbut in the Dominican Republic in June 2018.

State Department officials also recently announced that Thomas Jerome “Jerry” Curran of Bedford, Ohio, died on Jan. 26, 2019, while traveling in the Dominican Republic with his wife, Janet.

Curran, a retired police officer, and Hurlbut join a list of eight other people who have died in the Dominican Republic in the last year, including Yvette Monique Sport, who died in June 2018; David Harrison, who died in July 2018; and Robert Wallace, Miranda Schaupp-Werner, Cynthia Day, Nathaniel Holmes and Joseph Allen, who all died this year.

“To say that an exaggerated number of Americans have died in the Dominican Republic, what some media have characterized as an avalanche of deaths, does not correspond with the reality that we are seeing today in the Dominican Republic,” Garcia said.

No link between the deaths has been established, and U.S. State Department officials say there has been no “uptick” in American deaths in the Caribbean country.

The attorney for Holmes and Day, the couple who was found dead in their Dominican Republic hotel room in May, responded to Garcia’s press conference, saying, “We will let the facts and medical reports tell the story. The family continues to mourn the death of their love ones.”

Dominican authorities have asked for the FBI’s help in conducting toxicology analyses in the investigation into the deaths of Schaupp-Werner, Day and Holmes. Garcia did not release any new information about the cases, including toxicology reports that might shed light on the tourists’ cause of death.

FBI officials have informed Dominican authorities that getting the results of the toxicology analyses could take up to 30 days, and it could be an additional two weeks until the results are released. Garcia said the reports so far have not been shared due to privacy concerns.

Speaking specifically about the case of Holmes and Day, Garcia said that because the Dominican Republic has “nothing to hide,” they asked the FBI to participate and to conduct an additional toxicity report.

Garcia said the Dominican Republic’s tourism industry has been a “model” for the world because of its standards.

"USDA move to KC angers workers, but may signal bigger change",https://www.kansascity.com,"['Zeynep Bilginsoy', 'Derek Gatopoulos', 'Associated Press']",,,,https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article231799633.html,"Employees protest plan to move USDA jobs to Kansas City The USDA’s decision to move hundreds of research jobs out of Washington to Kansas City has triggered a backlash among federal employees. Employees stood in silent protest during a meeting about the move to Kansas City. Up Next × SHARE COPY LINK The USDA’s decision to move hundreds of research jobs out of Washington to Kansas City has triggered a backlash among federal employees. Employees stood in silent protest during a meeting about the move to Kansas City.

For USDA researcher Andrew Crane-Droesch, a cross-country move from the nation’s capital to Kansas City is out of the question.

He’s among more than 550 federal workers whose jobs will be shipped from Washington, D.C., to the Kansas City area after the region won out in a competition between cities in 35 states.

This month’s announcement from U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue was a major victory for local economic developers who joined together in a rare bi-state effort to lure the agency to the region. But for workers in the agency’s Economic Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture, the news has provoked a backlash.

Employees turned their backs on the agriculture secretary in silent protest as he announced the news in Washington. And now, as the feds examine potential sites on both sides of the state line, it remains unclear how many employees will actually follow the agency on its 1,000-mile move.

“It’s a mixture of outrage and resignation,” Cran-Droesch said of morale at his office. “Nobody wants to move — nothing against Kansas City.”

The 38-year-old loves his work, which uses machine learning and big data to study the impact of climate change on U.S. agriculture. But he said he’s too personally tied to D.C. to move halfway across the country to stay with the agency.





He doesn’t want to stray far from his aging parents on the East Coast. His wife, a software engineer, has better career opportunities in the Washington area. And the couple is in the middle of adopting their second child.

“Number four, I have a deal-breaking preference to live in a walkable city,” he said, “and I understand Kansas City is not there yet.”

He certainly won’t be the only one staying behind.

“Clearly when you move people from D.C. to Kansas City, the first thing you have to worry about is retention,” said Dan Levine, who advises companies on relocations and economic development efforts at Oxford Economics, a global research firm. “I would expect a high amount of turnover on a move like that. And that might be something that they can for whatever reason tolerate.”

A relocation of such magnitude is rare among federal agencies. But even in the constantly-evolving private sector, Levine said companies rarely force employees to move en masse across the country.

“It’s far more common to open up a new office or a new facility as opposed to closing one plant and relocating employees somewhere else,” he said. “That’s unusual because it’s so disruptive to the business. It’s very unusual when you get into highly skilled jobs because turnover cost is so high.”

While the exceptional move has raised eyebrows across the nation, some experts predict the USDA’s transition to Kansas City could portend future agency departures from the pricey Washington, D.C., market.





“This is a new frontier of economic development,” said John Boyd, principal of corporate site selection firm The Boyd Company in New Jersey.

He said some are pushing to move the National Weather Service to the coastal Southeast. And officials in both Utah and Nevada are hoping to be the next home of the Bureau of Land Management’s headquarters.

Boyd said Republican rhetoric around “draining the swamp” in D.C. has fueled interest in decentralizing the federal government. Plus, many lawmakers and developers fear that projects like Amazon’s HQ2 will only exacerbate wage pressure and the already-high cost of living in the Washington region. The tech giant plans to create 25,000 jobs in Northern Virginia, which real estate experts say is already pushing up housing prices.

“They’re all telling us now that they’re really feeling and hearing this chatter about these projects getting out of the beltway,” Boyd said. “The national zeitgeist at the moment is one that is favoring relocating government agencies out of D.C.”

And that’s in line with the global trends of moving federal workers away from pricey capital cities, said Joseph Parilla, a fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Metropolitan Policy Program who studies economic policies.

He pointed to two efforts in the United Kingdom that sought to move some government agencies out of London: In one instance, the government moved agency work to a relatively small city in Wales, losing much of the workforce in the process. But a move of more than 2,000 British Broadcasting Corporation jobs from London to the Manchester area, which boasts more than 2.5 million people, had much higher retention rates, Parilla said.

“This is completely anecdotal, but I think there’s something to be said for the scale of the place you go to,” he said. “And Kansas City makes a lot of sense.”

Parilla expects to see more departures from Washington, but said they should be done with care: He said policymakers should seek to pair agencies with cities and states that already tout the appropriate expertise and talent — like placing agricultural work in the Midwest.

“There are some things that have to be in Washington, but I think there’s a compelling strategy for moving agencies or parts of agencies that don’t need to be in Washington, D.C. to communities that already have a clustering of certain capabilities,” he said. “Hopefully, maybe Kansas City can serve as a model.”

Does KC have the talent?

USDA’s research positions reportedly pay between $80,000 and $100,000 per year — well above the Kansas City metro’s average pay of $50,200, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.





“From what I understand, there’s a lot of statistics involved in those roles,” said Jerry Hellebusch, president of local staffing firm Morgan Hunter Corporate Search. “I would assume a lot of jobs are going to require skills that your average person in the job market doesn’t have.”





If large numbers of vacancies emerge, they could put pressure on existing local employers, who already face an ultra-tight labor market — the Kansas City metro had an unemployment rate of 3 percent in April.





Low unemployment has forced salaries up across the area, Hellebusch said, with employers increasingly offering signing bonuses and counter offers to lure and keep the best talent.

Local firms can sometimes struggle to recruit talent from the coasts, but he said the area’s relatively low cost of living and enviable quality of life oftentimes win over job prospects.

“When somebody hears they’re getting transferred to Kansas City, they go, ‘Where is that?’” he said. “And then when they get here, they love it and they don’t want to leave.”

‘Huge move, huge transition’

Ahead of the USDA’s decision, the Kansas City Area Development Council worked with leaders from both states to lure the agency to the area. Now, president and CEO Tim Cowden said the group is committed to helping federal employees and their families make the move to Kansas City.

“We understand and empathize with the families and the employees,” Cowden said. “ It’s a huge move, it’s a huge transition.”





He noted that Kansas City is already home to some 35,000 federal workers, including employees at 12 various USDA agencies.





“This is a major regional center for the federal government,” Cowden said. “They are coming to a community that understands the federal workforce, understands the challenges those families will have moving halfway across the United States.”





Kimberly Young, president of the Kansas City Animal Health Corridor, said Kansas City touts a proven ability to attract top talent in the animal health and agricultural fields. She said the 13 land grant universities within a 300-mile radius will help fill any voids caused by USDA’s move.





“They are producing the talent that will be needed,” Young said. “These are very professional, sophisticated jobs. Kansas City has this talent.”





USDA officials did not respond to questions about how many employees they expected to retain through the move. But in a June 13 news release announcing the transition, the ag secretary said the move would actually help recruit top talent with an expertise in agriculture.

But oftentimes, hiring highly educated workers — many of USDA’s researchers tout doctorate degrees — requires a regional or national search, said Peter Mueser, a University of Missouri economics professor who studies labor markets.

“My guess would be that they’ll need to move to a national market,” he said. “When we hire at the University of Missouri, we go to a national market and we interview people all over the country. And I would assume they would do that, too.”

No move is strictly professional and Mueser said researchers’ ties to the D.C. area will complicate the USDA’s effort.

“They’re people with kids and families,” he said. “They don’t want to pull their kids out of school. In contrast, when you go out onto a national market you get people who are willing to move.”





Relocations ‘not done lightly’

It’s unclear if government workers will mirror the activity of their counterparts at private employers. But previous corporate relocations underline the high cost — both in terms of money and human capital — associated with long-distance moves.





“It’s not done lightly,” said George Pretty, an attorney with the Parker Poe law firm in Charlotte, North Carolina, who advises companies on relocations, acquisitions and reorganizations. “Because there are just so many people in various stages of their lives with school, with kids, with spouses at work. It’s a big adjustment for all corporations to make moves, but they do it when there’s a compelling need.”





In this case, Pretty believes it does make sense, as USDA officials have argued, to locate closer to the heart of America’s agricultural industry.

Still, he said only about 35 percent of employees generally stick with private sector employers on long-distance moves, though it’s hard to tell whether that average will translate to a federal workforce.

“But it generally means that this is going to be a blend of new jobs for local citizens and regional citizens and a mix of people transferring into the region with new skills,” he said.





Research from the Scottsdale, Arizona, corporate relocation firm Global Mobility Solutions shows about half of all employees follow their employers’ moves. About three quarters of senior executives will typically stay on board, but only 17 percent of non-managers stick with their employer through a relocation.





Over the last five years, GMS found, companies spent an average of nearly $20,000 to relocate each employee who rented a home and about $49,000 to move each employee who owned a home.





Cost saver, or costly?

The USDA has pointed to potential cost savings as a major driver behind its move. An agency cost-benefit analysis projects Kansas City’s lower cost of living and lower real estate costs to save the agency $300 million over 15 years.





But another analysis by the Milwaukee-based Agricultural and Applied Economics Association concluded that the move will actually cost taxpayers upward of $182 million.





The economists and former USDA administrators who authored the report said the federal government overstated the cost of keeping the agencies in Washington and failed to consider the lost value of research from staffers who resign or move.





The association predicts as many as 50 to 75 percent of transferred employees will quit or retire in lieu of moving to Kansas City.





The group expects it will take years for the USDA to find replacements for the agency’s highly educated workforce — potentially costing millions in lost research capabilities.





“To be frank, America’s agricultural economy today faces serious challenges,” AAEA president David Zilberman said in a news release. “This is the worst possible time to dismantle the USDA’s capability to analyze agricultural markets, crop insurance, and trade policy.”





USDA’s two research agencies already have respective employee vacancy rates of 20 and 26 percent. And workers began leaving both research agencies in the spring when news of the relocation emerged. President Donald Trump has also proposed cutting funds for USDA’s Economic Research Service.

As part of its employee relocation notice, USDA offered buyouts and early retirements to affected workers.





But even as the administration looks to move some employees as soon as next month, members of Congress are working to halt the transfers altogether.





The agriculture budget crafted by the Democratic-controlled House includes language that would restrict the USDA from spending dollars from the ERS and NIFA budgets toward relocating the agencies outside of the Washington, D.C., area.





Lawmakers of both parties from Kansas and Missouri have signed onto an amendment that would strike this language from the budget bill. But even if the legislation passes the House, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Missouri, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said he’s confident it won’t pass the Senate.





“I don’t think it’ll be in the final bill, but we’re paying attention to it,” Blunt said. “I’m confident we’ll be able to have good arguments as to why staying in Washington is not the best thing to do.”

Trump’s decision-making on Iran strike highlights absence of a confirmed defense secretary,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Paul Sonne', 'National Security Reporter Focusing On The U.S. Military', 'June At Pm']",06-22-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trumps-decision-making-on-iran-strike-highlights-absence-of-a-confirmed-defense-secretary/2019/06/22/6f617d8c-950e-11e9-b72d-d56510fa753e_story.html,"When the White House summoned the Pentagon’s top civilian leader to consider a possible military strike against Iran, two men answered the call: Patrick M. Shanahan, the acting defense secretary who had just announced he would step down amid revelations of family violence, and Mark T. Esper, the Army secretary slated to replace him, who had no formal standing to be in the room.

The arrival on Thursday of the two men at the White House, neither of whom came with the Senate’s imprimatur to sit at the table, brought into sharp relief the perils of a civilian leadership void that President Trump has tolerated at the Pentagon for more than half a year since Jim Mattis resigned as defense secretary.

The end result — an 11th-hour reversal of a military strike that could have sparked an open conflict with Iran — fed into the fears of those who saw Mattis as a bulwark against a process that could leave matters of war and peace up to Trump’s last-minute whims and his interactions with cable news commentators. The deliberations over how to respond to Iran’s downing of an unmanned U.S. drone highlighted the absence of a top Pentagon civilian leader armed with the experience and status necessary to influence the commander in chief.

[‘I stopped it’: How Trump’s last-minute reversal on Iran unfolded]

“In the end this is a human process,” said Leon Panetta, who served as defense secretary and CIA director for President Barack Obama. “What human beings tend to do is they make judgments about people who are at the table, and whether or not they have the strength and the position and the knowledge and the experience to be able to voice their opinions.”

“If they know that somebody is acting,” Panetta said, “if they know that somebody is just there on a temporary basis, then mark my words: There is an automatic assumption that what they say doesn’t carry a lot of weight.”

Signs have emerged that the crisis with Iran has possibly been a wake-up call for the White House about the need to install a permanent leader at the Pentagon quickly, despite Trump’s predilection for acting officials. After urging from impatient Republican lawmakers, Trump announced late Friday that he would nominate Esper to replace Mattis on a permanent basis.

“The Department does not discuss meetings with the Commander in Chief — including who is in attendance,” Jonathan Hoffman, a spokesman for the Pentagon, said in a statement. “There is no confusion by anyone at the Pentagon — or to our adversaries — as to who is the head of the United States Department of Defense.”

He said Shanahan would be acting secretary until midnight on Sunday, and Esper will take over the first minute of Monday.

Esper comes with defense qualifications that outstrip Shanahan’s, having served for years as an Army officer, a policy adviser in Congress, a top Pentagon official, a defense industry lobbyist and an executive at a well-known conservative think tank. Most recently, he ran the U.S. Army as its top civilian, overseeing the manning and equipping of the largest branch of the American military by personnel.

Esper studied in the same U.S. Military Academy class as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, giving him a long-standing relationship with the most important fellow Cabinet official for most secretaries of defense. He also has worked for the past year and a half in tandem with Gen. Mark A. Milley, the top uniformed officer in the Army, who is due to take over this fall from Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr. as next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

“It’s crucial to have someone at the helm of the Pentagon who can look across the complicated international security landscape, across the regional issues and the functional issues, and recognize the pros and cons of using military force,” said Mara Karlin, a former top Pentagon strategist in the Obama administration who is now a professor at Johns Hopkins University. “Shanahan did not have the political experience or the policy experience to do this, but appeared to be trying.”

Karlin said that Esper has demonstrated a willingness to choose internal winners and losers in his management of the Army — a critical quality for a defense secretary — and also comes with a wealth of other experience in defense matters.

“The question is what does meaningful civilian control of the Pentagon look like?” Karlin said. “I think there is evidence that Army Secretary Esper could exert that. He has worked across the Washington apparatus. He has touched this world from a whole bunch of different perspectives.”

Whether Esper can gain the personal trust of Trump, and feel comfortable expressing independent views in front of the president, remains to be seen. During his nearly six months as acting secretary, Shanahan regularly faced explicit questions about his independence and standing with the president. With the imprimatur of the Senate, Esper may also be able to choose appointees for a number of Pentagon positions occupied by acting officials and build out a more robust staff.

Esper’s likely confirmation later this year comes after the extraordinary events surrounding Iran, which raised questions for former top officials about the decision-making process involving military action.

Previous presidents, including Obama and Bill Clinton, have made late-stage decisions to stand down on military strikes in the works, but Trump’s description of the moments that led up to his decision is what raised alarm bells for some former officials.

In tweets and an interview with NBC News, Trump said that minutes before the military action was due to launch, he asked his generals how many Iranians would die, and when he heard approximately 150, he stopped the planned strike because he felt it wasn’t proportionate. If the president’s version of events is true, former top Pentagon officials say, it represents at worst a breakdown in the chain of command and at best a departure from the traditional practice of running through the casualty impact of military actions well before any decisions are made.

“I can’t think of a more chaotic situation than to have the president abort an operation while military forces are moving into position to conduct a military action — and do so on the basis that he wasn’t told pertinent information,” said Jeremy Bash, a former top official at the Pentagon and the CIA during the Obama administration. He described that process, if it played out the way Trump described it, as a “train wreck.”

The lack of a confirmed defense secretary during the deliberations Thursday also would have put an unfair onus on the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Eric Edelman, a former U.S. ambassador and top Pentagon official in the George W. Bush administration. The chairman is the official military adviser to the president, but the defense secretary is supposed to present the broader implications of any military options, and they tend to coordinate on their position on a military strike before presenting options to the White House.

“You’ve created this imbalance where you have one guy with a foot out the door and the other guy who hasn’t been nominated yet — how are they going to opine or say anything meaningful that is going to have an impact on the process?” Edelman said. “Then it puts everything in the hands of the chairman, which isn’t fair.”

Ultimately, the decision about the use of force rests with the commander in chief; a deliberative and considered process leading up the decision is designed to give the president confidence that all options were examined carefully. It also can assure the public that decisions possibly resulting in the death of U.S. troops, enemy forces or civilians on the ground are made in a way that isn’t cavalier.

“The toughest decision a president has to make is to deploy forces in harm’s way. Every president I’ve worked with, that’s what tears their insides out,” Panetta said. “But if you at the very least go through that process — and evaluate all these issues and the consequences — then at the end of the day you have to make a tough decision, but at least it is one that is carefully considered.”"
Justice Department files antitrust suit to stop massive acquisition by Quad/Graphics,https://www.jsonline.com,"['Rick Romell', 'Published A.M. Ct June']",06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.jsonline.com/story/money/business/2019/06/21/justice-department-files-antitrust-suit-stop-big-quad-graphics-acquisition/1519957001/,"CLOSE

The U.S. Justice Department is suing to block Quad/Graphics Inc.'s proposed $1.4 billion acquisition of LSC Communications, saying the merger would combine the only two significant magazine, catalog and book printers in the country.

""LSC is Quad’s primary competitor,"" Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim said in a statement. ""If this deal were allowed to proceed, Quad would dominate the markets for magazine, catalog, and book printing services and be able to raise prices and reduce quality at the expense of publishers, retailers, and, ultimately, American consumers.”

The two companies are by far the largest printers in the U.S. and their ""intense, head-to-head competition"" has benefited customers, the department said.

Sussex-based Quad, one of the largest private employers in Wisconsin, said it would ""vigorously defend"" the proposed acquisition. The firm said the Justice Department is ignoring ""dynamic conditions"" in commercial printing and the fact that printers compete not just with each other but with burgeoning digital advertising channels such as Google and Facebook.

""Given the continued migration of advertising dollars to digital channels,"" printers have pursued consolidations to reduce overcapacity and battle more effectively with digital competitors, Quad said in a statement.

Neither Quad nor LSC has been a stellar performer of late. LSC lost money in two of the last three years. Over that same period, Quad netted 1.5% on its sales and saw revenue decline.

Both, though, are large companies, with dozens of manufacturing and distribution plants and tens of thousands of workers.

Quad as of December had the equivalent of 20,600 employees, including 8,000 in Wisconsin and 16,900 across the U.S. Sales last year hit $4.2 billion.

Chicago-based LSC was created in 2016 when RR Donnelley & Sons Co. spun off the wing of its business that concentrated on printing magazines, catalogs, retail inserts and books.

LSC employed 22,000 people as of December, including 18,700 in the U.S. Its 2018 sales totaled $3.8 billion.

In an interview last fall, Joel Quadracci, Quad's chairman, president and CEO, said the acquisition of LSC would give Quad the scale and cash-generating capacity to smooth its transition toward becoming not just a printer but ""more of a marketing services partner"" to its customers.

""This is a defining moment in Quad’s 47-year journey,"" Quadracci said.

Sprinkled throughout the Justice Department's complaint, filed Thursday in federal court in Chicago, are examples of how the government says intense competition between Quad and LSC has benefited customers.

When the two printing giants dueled for a contract with a major book publisher, the government alleges, one LSC executive, likening the competition to the Battle of Gettysburg, declared, ""We must win"" — only to see Quad scoop up the account by offering the publisher a deal that would save it $37 million over its current arrangement.

In another case, the complaint says, Quad tried to keep a magazine publisher from switching to LSC by offering a 25% price cut. But when the publisher told LSC of the ""Godfather deal"" Quad had offered, LSC responded with even better terms. It won the contract, and the publisher realized $6.5 million in immediate benefits, the complaint says.

Such episodes, the government alleges, demonstrate why LSC's chief executive told investors a merger with Quad could lead to ""pricing stability"" and eliminate such battles between the companies.

According to the complaint, Quad and LSC control a high percentage of web offset presses in the U.S. and all rotogravure presses — the types of equipment publishers turn to for printing long runs of magazines.

Meanwhile, the government said, a presentation by Quad’s board of directors described LSC and Quad as holding a combined 69% of the catalog printing market.

In a statement, Quadracci said merging with LSC would help ensure print's viability as a channel for publishers and retailers.

""Our goal is to make print a more effective and affordable media option to that of digital giants such as Google and Facebook,"" Quadracci said. ""The DOJ does not appear to recognize the competitive effect of digital media on the print industry.""

The government, for its part, said in its complaint that people will continue to demand printed magazines, catalogs and books. Because of that, a digital-only platform is not an effective substitute to print for many publishers, the complaint said.

"State Department condemns Iran, China for persecuting religious minorities",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Carol Morello', 'National Reporter Focusing On Foreign Policy', 'State Department']",06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/state-department-condemns-iran-china-for-persecuting-religious-minorities/2019/06/21/97b5621d-89c9-40d5-b86c-ea87a25b933b_story.html,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, with Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom Sam Brownback, left, and State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus, speaks about the 2018 International Religious Freedom Annual Report on June 21. (Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)

The State Department condemned China and Iran on Friday for treating religious minorities as national security threats meriting surveillance, imprisonment and sometimes death.

In introducing the annual report on International Religious Freedom, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo struck an unusual personal note, noting he had been a Sunday school teacher and a church deacon, and took a swipe at Washington.

“That might sound unusual to a lot of people inside the Beltway,” he said. “But I am one of millions of Americans, and billions of people across the world, who live in the knowledge of a higher power. I often humbly reflect on how God’s providence has guided me to this office, to defend this cause.”

Samuel Brownback, the ambassador for religious freedom, said: “We believe there is no more important time for the United States to promote religious freedom than now.”

The annual report looks at the government policies that violate religious belief and practices in every country of the world except the United States.

China and Iran are among 10 countries of particular concern when it comes to religious freedom, meaning they may face sanctions. The chapters are considerably longer than those of North Korea, which Brownback called “horrible” for religious freedom, or on Myanmar, where ethnic Rohingya have been subjected to harassment and violence.

The report was released amid growing tensions between the United States and Iran, as well as China.

The United States and China have been in a trade war for nearly a year. While talks go on, the Trump administration has shied away from placing sanctions on Chinese officials involved in the detention of 1 million or more ethnic Uighurs and other minority Muslims in the northwest region of Xinjiang. Brownback said some sanctions have been placed on the manufacturers of equipment used to surveil religious minorities, and the United States frequently raises its concerns publicly.

Iranian Christians and other religious minorities are among those who have lost opportunities to emigrate to the United States as part of deep cuts in refugee admissions from Iran. Brownback said the criteria for religious minorities getting preference as refugees changed during the Obama administration, and it is time for the policy to be reviewed.

The religious freedom report lists detailed accounts of religious minorities in countries around the world who were subjected to “death, forced disappearances, and organ harvesting in prison because of their religious beliefs or affiliation.”

Pompeo has spoken forcefully against the treatment of Uighur Muslims sent to what he has called “reeducation camps.” U.S. attempts to berate the Chinese have sparked little change, however. After Pompeo met with four Uighurs in March to discuss human rights abuses, the aunt and uncle of one of them, a U.S. citizen, learned his aunt and uncle had been moved from a camp and sentenced to eight years in prison.

The report said Chinese Christians also have been increasingly oppressed, with authorities closing churches, burning bibles and ordering believers to renounce their faith.

The chapter on Iran accuses the government of meting out harsh punishments to those who are not Shiite Muslims. Iran’s penal code specifies death for crimes like enmity against God, corruption on earth and insulting the prophets.

But there is little the U.S. government can do about it, except protest publicly. With no diplomatic relations between Tehran and Washington, the report says, U.S. diplomats “did not have opportunities to raise concerns directly with the government over its religious freedom abuses and restrictions.”"
Hundreds of migrant caravan members found to have US criminal histories: DHS files,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hundreds-of-migrant-caravan-found-to-have-criminal-histories-dhs-files,"Hundreds of illegal immigrants attempting to cross the southern border as part of massive migrant caravans were found to have criminal histories in the U.S., according to newly obtained Department of Homeland Security documents.

The DHS files were provided to House Oversight Committee Republicans in May and included internal data showing more than 1,000 migrants traveling as part of caravans to the border within the past nine months had “U.S. criminal histories” and hundreds had “U.S. criminal convictions.”

BORDER ARRESTS SKYROCKET IN MAY, AS OFFICIALS DECLARE 'FULL-BLOWN EMERGENCY'

The files detailed one migrant caravan of nearly 8,000 individuals that started toward the border in October 2018 and arrived south of California by December. According to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), 660 of them had U.S. criminal convictions—with 40 convicted of assault or aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and three convicted of murder.

In January 2019, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) tracked another caravan that left Honduras with more than 3,300 migrants. ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) team identified that 860 of those individuals had U.S. criminal histories, including more than 20 convicted of assault or aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, nearly 30 convicted of sexual offenses, two convicted of violence against law enforcement, and one convicted of attempted murder.

The documents, provided to House Oversight Republicans, also revealed that CBP is currently monitoring another “movement of several groups ranging in size from 1,000 to 4,000” in the Mexican states of Chiapas and Veracruz, but did not specify how many of those migrants are believed to have criminal records.

In a letter to DHS Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan on Thursday, committee Ranking Member Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, requested further information about caravan members with criminal backgrounds to “assist” in their “oversight of the crisis at the southern border and better understand the threat posed by large caravans.”

Jordan requested arrest warrants, court documents and other materials detailing the criminal histories of the migrants in the January 2019 and October 2018 caravan; an update of CBP’s monitoring of the caravan movement in Mexican states; and summaries of ICE HSI materials by July 5.

In his letter, Jordan referred to President Trump’s decision in February to declare a national emergency and referred to his comments that the “southern border is a major entry point for criminals, gang members, and illicit narcotics” threatening “core national security interests.”

The newly revealed DHS information comes amid a stunning surge across the border this year. Last month, the number of migrants apprehended at the southern border skyrocketed to levels not seen in over a decade, with CBP reporting nearly 133,000 arrests in May. The number surpassed 144,000 when counting migrants deemed inadmissible—more than a 30 percent increase from the prior month and double the influx recorded at the beginning of the year. The number was the highest monthly total in more than 13 years, officials said.

“We are in a full-blown emergency,” Acting CBP Commissioner John Sanders said earlier this month. In April, authorities recorded 99,304 arrests.

FOOTAGE SHOWS MIGRANTS WALKING AROUND BORDER WALL TO ENTER US

McAleenan, in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, also warned that 90 percent of asylum seekers skip their hearings after being released into the U.S.

The continued crisis at the border comes as Trump has sought to extend and shore up the border wall, declaring a national emergency in a bid to divert billions toward construction -- an effort being challenged in the courts.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration announced that it had reached a deal with Mexico to drop threatened tariffs on Mexican imports in exchange for Mexico increasing efforts to limit U.S.-bound migration flows from Central America.

Through the agreement, the U.S. is slated to extend its policy of returning asylum applicants to Mexico while their claims are processed. The U.S. also committed to accelerating asylum claims while Mexico said it will “offer jobs, healthcare, and education according to its principles.”

The deal also stated that Mexico will take “decisive action” to dismantle smuggling and trafficking operations, while both countries will increase cooperation to protect the border.

Chip stocks fall after Commerce Dept bars 5 more Chinese companies from buying US parts,https://www.cnbc.com,['Yun Li'],06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/21/chip-stocks-fall-after-commerce-dept-bars-5-more-chinese-firms-from-buying-us-parts.html,"The U.S. Commerce Department has banned five more Chinese entities from buying U.S. components after blacklisting telecom giant Huawei last month.

Higon, Chengdu Haiguang Integrated Circuit, Chengdu Haiguang Microelectronics Technology, Sugon and Wuxi Jiangnan Institute of Computing Technology are the five Chinese firms added to the department's entity list, according to a filing.

The department said the activities of these companies ""pose a significant risk of being or becoming involved in activities contrary to the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States.""

Shares of U.S. semiconductors came under pressure after the announcement. Advanced Micro Devices tumbled more than 3%, while Xilinx and Nvidia also fell 2.2% and 1.5%, respectively.

The move came before President Donald Trump's key meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the G-20 summit this month to discuss the lingering trade differences. The U.S. and China have slapped tariffs on billions of dollars worth of each other's goods, while ramping up tit-for-tat threats in the ongoing trade war.

The Commerce Department said Sugon and the Wuxi Jiangnan Institute of Computing Technology are the leaders in China's development of exascale high-performance computing.

Sugon has publicly acknowledged ""a variety of military end uses and end users of its high-performance computers,"" the department said. Wuxi Jiangnan Institute of Computing Technology's mission is ""to support China's military modernization,"" the department noted.

The U.S. restrictions on Huawei have forced many American chipmakers and tech companies including Google to cut ties with the Chinese giant. Huawei's U.S. chip suppliers, including Qualcomm and Intel, are reportedly quietly lobbying to ease the Huawei ban."
"White, bright dot in Dayton sky could be part of DOD program",https://www.whio.com,[],,,,https://www.whio.com/news/local/mysterious-bright-white-dot-dayton-area-may-part-department-defense-program/fDedxeoSef2yHdP8TASuFM/,"Published: Thursday, June 20, 2019 @ 1:12 PM



— A bright, white dot spotted over the Dayton area and numerous suburbs of the city could be part of the U.S. Department of Defense’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, also known as DARPA.

>> Live Doppler 7 Radar

“DARPA launched three balloons from Cumberland, Maryland, in a flight test for the Adaptable Lighter Than Air Program,” said Heather Babb, spokeswoman for the Department of Defense. “ALTA will demonstrate capability for wind-borne navigation of a lighter-than-air vehicle over extended ranges.”

>> PREVIOUS: What was that bright, white dot hanging over parts of the Miami Valley?

Babb stopped short of confirming that the bright, white dot spotted by numerous News Center 7 viewers was indeed a DARPA balloon, however another spokesperson for DARPA said given the location it was likely one of their balloons.

Sightings of the object were reported Tuesday to News Center 7 from viewers in Xenia, Englewood, West Milton, West Carrollton and Eaton.

DARPA’s ALTA program’s balloons can fly at altitudes of more than 75,000 feet.

“While they do not have independent propulsion, the ALTA vehicle is designed to navigate by changing altitude and thus taking advantage of different wind profiles aloft,” according to DARPA’s website.

DARPA dates back to the launch of Sputnik in 1957 and also has played roles in precision weapons and stealth technology, and other technology advances such as the Internet, automated voice recognition, language transition and GPS.

DARPA is comprised of about 220 government employees in six technical offices, who oversee about 250 research and development programs."
EPA to connect Loudoun homes contaminated by landfill to public water,https://wtop.com,['News Traffic Weather'],06-21-2019,2019,6,https://wtop.com/loudoun-county/2019/06/epa-to-connect-loudoun-homes-contaminated-by-landfill-to-public-water/,"The privately owned and operated Hidden Lane Landfill was a 25-acre disposal site that health officials with Loudoun County and Virginia deemed to be the likely source of drinking water contamination in the Board Run Farms community that was first discovered in 1989.

More than 120 properties in the Broad Run Farms community affected by Hidden Lane Landfill superfund site groundwater contamination will be hooked up to the public water system by the federal Environmental Protestion Agency, according to Virginia’s Loudoun County.

The construction won’t cost property owners a dime but it will cost the agency millions.

The privately owned and operated Hidden Lane Landfill was a 25-acre disposal site that health officials with both the county and Virginia deemed to be the likely source of Broad Run Farms drinking water contamination first discovered in 1989.

The chemical that was discovered is called trichloroethylene, or TCE. According to the National Toxicology Program (an interagency group coordinated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services), it’s primarily used in two ways: to make hydrofluorocarbon chemicals, especially refrigerants, and as a solvent to remove grease from metal parts.

The NIH also says it’s a known carcinogen and can increase the risk of cancer.

“We are grateful to the EPA for this decision and while we advocated for the extension of public water to the entire Broad Run Farms community, this is a significant action that will benefit those residents most directly impacted in the community,” Algonkian District Supervisor Suzanne Volpe, who represents the area on the Board of Supervisors, said in a Thursday news release.

“I would also like to commend the dedicated and long-term efforts of Loudoun County staff as well as the Virginia Department of Health and the Department of Environmental Quality for getting us to this milestone.”

There’s no word yet on when construction of the new water lines is slated to begin.

Justice Dept review of intel in Russia probe fuels fears of politicization,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Olivia Gazis'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/justice-department-review-of-intelligence-in-russia-probe-fuels-fears-of-politicization/,"A mix of concern, confusion and defiance has spread through elements of the intelligence community as a murky picture emerges of Attorney General William Barr's review of its investigative and analytical work on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

In particular, current and former intelligence officials are questioning the purpose and propriety of the attorney general's intention, first reported by The New York Times, to enlist John Durham, the U.S. attorney for the District of Connecticut, in scrutinizing the analytical judgments that led a group of agencies to conclude that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign to boost then-candidate Trump's electability.

That judgment, put forth in a declassified Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA) commissioned by former president Barack Obama and released in January 2017, pooled the findings of the CIA, FBI and NSA. The CIA and FBI expressed ""high confidence"" in that conclusion, while the NSA had ""moderate confidence.""

""I see no problem with a DOJ review of whether the CIA and other intelligence community agencies lived up to their legal and regulatory responsibilities related to how they handled any information related to U.S. persons – U.S. citizens and U.S. nationals,"" said Michael Morell, a former CIA deputy director who is a CBS News senior national security contributor. ""Having said that, I see a DOJ review of whether or not the intelligence analysts made the right call as wholly inappropriate. I cannot ever remember a DOJ review of analysis.""

""[Durham] and his team have no experience with, or knowledge of, the process of intelligence analysis,"" Morell said. ""He and his team could well impose a law enforcement standard in coming to a conclusion — a much higher bar than exists in the intelligence community for analytic judgments.""

Both the House and Senate Intelligence Committees have already examined the process by which the ICA was assembled and offered their declassified assessments.

In their March 2018 final report on Russia's active measures, Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee — without describing what kind of evidence was examined — said ""most"" of the ICA's analysis ""held up to scrutiny."" But they criticized its judgment on Putin's strategic objectives for having ""failed to meet most of the analytic standards set forth in the primary guiding document for IC analysis."" (The committee's Democrats dissented from that view.)

That document – Intelligence Community Directive 203 – stipulates, among other things, that analytic products should be ""objective,"" ""timely,"" and ""independent of political consideration.""

But in July, the Senate Intelligence Committee — whose leadership has maintained a vastly more united and bipartisan front than the fractious panel in the House — issued a declassified summary of a months-long assessment that found the ICA to be a ""sound intelligence product."" The committee said it had reviewed ""thousands of pages of source documents and conducted interviews with all the relevant parties — including agency heads, managers, and line analysts — who were involved in developing the analysis and drafting the assessment.""

""In all the interviews of those who drafted and prepared the ICA, the Committee heard consistently that analysts were under no politically motivated pressure to reach any conclusions,"" the summary said. ""All analysts expressed that they were free to debate, object to content, and assess confidence levels, as is normal and proper for the analytic process.""

Analytical disagreement, the committee said, was ""reasonable, transparent, and openly debated.""

The Senate panel is expected to release a declassified version of a far more extensive report on the ICA in the coming months, though the bulk of their assessment is likely to remain classified.

Asked whether the Justice Department's review was duplicative of the panel's work, a spokeswoman for the Senate Intelligence Committee declined to comment.

Morell said a DOJ probe into analysts' conclusions could have a ""chilling effect"" on the analytic process.

""Any analyst asked to submit to an interview with Durham's investigators will want to have their own personal attorney at their side,"" he said. ""Imagine that — needing an attorney to explain an analytic judgment.""

""This will all be watched closely inside the IC and the prospect that DOJ prosecutors may ask questions about how an analyst came to a conclusion could well lead analysts to demur,"" Morell said.

A Democratic House Intelligence Committee official who requested anonymity to discuss ongoing, sensitive matters said the panel had engaged at multiple levels with multiple intelligence agencies and had ""heard a sense of anxiety"" and ""palpable unease.""

The official expressed concern that ""purposeful overreach"" by DOJ could undermine what have been shown to be sound conclusions, and that normal differences of opinion raised in the course of discussion that would go into crafting an analytical judgment could be exploited for political purposes.

In this case, the official said, in what could be a politically motivated effort to score-settle with former CIA Director John Brennan — has been sharply critical of President Trump — routine, healthy discussion could be cast as Brennan putting his thumb on the scale.

""There is no evidence that was the case. These assessments have withstood continued scrutiny for more than two years, and have only been buttressed by continued analysis and collection,"" the official said.

A spokesman for Mr. Brennan declined to comment. The CIA and NSA declined to comment. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The House Intelligence Committee's Democratic chairman, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, said at the National Press Club this week that he had met personally with Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, but the committee has otherwise had ""very little visibility"" into the scope and progress of the review. A Senate Intelligence Committee official also said that panel was in close communication with the intelligence community and similarly had not been offered details about the review beyond the contents of a letter the Department of Justice sent earlier this month.

In its letter, sent in response to an earlier inquiry from the House Judiciary Committee, DOJ indicated the review was ""broad in scope and multifaceted, and is intended to illuminate open questions regarding the activities of U.S. and foreign intelligence services as well as non-governmental organizations and individuals."" It did not explicitly mention a review of analytic processes or the ICA itself."
DOJ investigating Jared Kushner transactions in Deutsche Bank money-laundering probe,https://www.salon.com,[],06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.salon.com/2019/06/20/doj-investigating-jared-kushner-transactions-in-deutsche-bank-money-laundering-probe/,"The Department of Justice has opened a criminal investigation into potential money laundering by Deutsche Bank, including transactions linked to White House adviser and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner.

The investigation apparently centers on why Deutsche Bank officials failed to alert the Treasury Department about potentially suspicious transactions by Kushner’s family and company in 2016, including transactions involving Russian individuals, the New York Times reports.

Reportedly, bank officials did not submit the reports to Treasury, even though its employees prepared ""suspicious activity"" reports on the Kushner transactions and others. A spokesperson for Kushner Cos., the family's real estate corporation, told the Times that the firm is not under investigation.

The DOJ has already contacted Tammy McFadden, a former anti-money-laundering compliance officer at the bank who told the Times in May that she flagged transactions involving Kushner’s company but that her superiors had declined to file the suspicious activity reports with the federal government.

Some of McFadden’s colleagues had similar experiences in 2017 when they flagged transactions by entities owned by President Trump. It is unclear whether the FBI is investigating the bank’s handling of those transactions, according to the Times' report.

Congressional Democrats have already received some files from Deutsche Bank as they probe the bank’s dealings with Trump. Deutsche Bank was the only mainstream financial institution willing to lend Trump money after a series of high-profile bankruptcies and defaults in the 1990s. The bank lent him more than $2 billion over the last two decades, including $350 million that Trump still owes, the Times reported.

Two House committees have subpoenaed Deutsche Bank for records related to Trump but the president sued to block the bank from turning the files over. A federal judge rejected Trump’s request to block the subpoena and the president's lawyers are currently appealing that ruling.

Deutsche Bank has been under a DOJ investigation since 2015, according to the Times, when agents probed the bank’s role in laundering money for wealthy Russians. The bank was hit with steep fines in both the U.S. and the United Kingdom, but has not faced any criminal charges. The DOJ expanded its investigation last fall.

McFadden told the Times last month that she was fired by Deutsche Bank last year after raising concerns over the bank’s practices and has since filed complaints with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators.

On Wednesday, the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) also called on the Federal Reserve System to investigate whether Deutsche Bank had violated the law by refusing to submit the suspicious activity reports on the Kushner and Trump transactions.

“Deutsche Bank’s careless attitude towards banking compliance laws and failure to police its accounts may now be impacting American government at the highest levels,” said CREW executive director Noah Bookbinder. “Questions about transactions between President Trump and foreign actors whose conduct seemingly warranted suspicious activity reports, potentially facilitated by Deutsche Bank, harms the public legitimacy of the institution of the presidency itself.”"
"DHS cancels some Global Entry appointments as summer travel heats up, citing border crush",https://www.cnn.com,['Geneva Sands'],06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/20/politics/global-entry-canceled-appointments-resources-border/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Department of Homeland Security has had to cancel some Global Entry appointments as the summer travel season heats up as it transfers people to help at the southern border, a department official tells CNN.

Global Entry is a Customs and Border Protection program that ""allows expedited clearance for pre-approved, low-risk travelers upon arrival"" in the US. The Trusted Traveler Programs website , which includes Global Entry, already has an alert warning applicants that the ""extended partial government shutdown has resulted in a backlog,"" of applications and renewals.

The personnel shift comes amid a swell of migrant families and children that have arrived at the US border this year. The influx has strained DHS immigration resources and caused concerns about overcrowding and delayed US Border Patrol processing.

In response to efforts at the border, ""CBP is temporarily reducing staff at Global Entry Enrollment Centers nationwide and reassigning them to support frontline traveler processing during the busy summer months,"" Customs and Border Protection said in a statement.

""Regrettably, this situation has forced the cancellation of some scheduled appointments and may make it difficult to schedule an immediate interview,"" the statement said.

Former EPA staffer says Wheeler lied to Congress,https://thehill.com,[],06-20-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/449626-former-epa-staffer-says-wheeler-lied-congress,"A longtime former Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) staffer is accusing Administrator Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerOvernight Energy: Trump proposal would nix agency reviews of long-term climate impacts | Greens rip decision | House votes to block offshore drilling for one year Overnight Energy: Fight over fuel standards intensifies | Democrats grill Trump officials over rule rollback | California official blasts EPA chief over broken talks | Former EPA official says Wheeler lied to Congress Former EPA staffer says Wheeler lied to Congress MORE of lying in a letter he wrote to Congress Thursday that denied agency staff were shut out as EPA developed a controversial rollback on Obama-era fuel standards.

Critics of the rollback have long contended that the EPA sidelined its Office of Transportation and Air Quality when developing the rule. The office is home to the agency’s in-house lab for testing vehicles emissions.

ADVERTISEMENT

Wheeler denied that accusation this week, but Jeff Alson, a former senior policy advisor to that office, said Wheeler is not telling the truth.

“I know that is a lie because I was there. I was one of 20 people at EPA working on this for a decade,” Alson told The Hill. Alson retired in April of last year after working 40 years at the agency.

The issue of sidelined staffers came to a head as lawmakers probed the stalled negotiations between EPA and California, which has long had more stringent standards for vehicle fuel economy and is fighting the EPA rollback.

As lawmakers grilled EPA officials over the failed negotiation, the EPA delivered a letter from Wheeler that blamed California for the standstill.

It also accused the state’s negotiator, California Air Resources Board Chair Mary Nichols, of incorrectly saying the Office of Transportation and Air Quality were shut out of the rulemaking process.

""Her testimony that EPA professional staff were cut out of this proposal's development is false,"" Wheeler wrote.

Alson said the administration has denied pushing aside career staff before, but he found this instance particularly grievous.

“To see it in a formal letter that was given to Congress and to specifically accuse someone else of lying when in reality that person was being truthful and when Administrator Wheeler was the one doing the lying, it just put me beyond the point of no return,” he said.

The EPA said Wheeler's letter speaks for itself.

""Career, professional staff within the Office of Air and Radiation were involved in the development of the proposal and continue to be involved in the final stages as we work with NHTSA to finalize this rule,"" a spokesperson said in an email to The Hill.

A key pillar of former President Obama's environmental legacy involved strengthening fuel emissions standards for cars to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2026. But Trump's rollback would freeze the average fuel economy at 37 mpg.

Alson said his office did have two or three “check the box” meetings with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the other agency involved in drafting the rollback, but he said the agency did not collaborate with his EPA office in developing the standards and would not share any of their information with the EPA.

“NHTSA would say nothing about what they were assuming. They wouldn’t give us a copy of their models, they wouldn’t share their assumptions, they wouldn’t share their projections of how much the standards were going to cost,” he said. “They wouldn’t give us anything.”

When Bill Wehrum, EPA’s head of the Office of Air and Radiation, appeared before the House Energy and Commerce Committee Thursday, several Democrats questioned him about the role of the Office of Transportation and Air Quality.

Rep. Paul Tonko Paul David TonkoOvernight Energy: Fight over fuel standards intensifies | Democrats grill Trump officials over rule rollback | California official blasts EPA chief over broken talks | Former EPA official says Wheeler lied to Congress Former EPA staffer says Wheeler lied to Congress Democrats grill Trump officials over fuel standard rollback MORE (D-N.Y.) pointed a Government Accountability Office report that said, “NHTSA cannot be expected to have the same level of in-house expertise related to vehicle power train design and environmental issues as EPA.”

When Tonko pressed Wehrum on the Office of Air and Radiation’s involvement, Wehrum said their work with NHTSA was a “very powerful combination.”

“EPA has had a substantial amount of involvement,” Wehrum said.

Alson said retirement has freed him to talk in ways his colleagues who still work at the EPA cannot. He has been vocal in his opposition to the rollbacks, including penning an op-ed in The Hill, but said he has held back from addressing inaccuracies from administrator's until now.

“The truth is Mary Nichols is telling the truth and Administrator Wheeler is lying, and it’s shameful and it breaks my heart that the man that heads up the agency where I worked for 40 years and spent my life trying to make the world a little bit better can blatantly lie to the American public.”"

Trump also hammered House Democrats for putting his former top communication advisor Hope Hicks ""through hell,"" after pictures of Hicks testifying before a closed-door session on Capitol Hill earlier in the day leaked on social media.

Hicks is the Executive Vice President and Chief Communications Officer for Fox Corporation, and Fox News is a subsidiary of Fox Corporation.

""They're not allowed to do that. It's probably illegal,"" Trump said, referring to the leaked pictures of Hicks. Some Democrats complained that Hicks, in her appearance before the House Judiciary Committee, was ordered by the White House to stay quiet about her time as an aide to Trump, citing legal privileges.

But, Trump condemned Democrats' ongoing hearings on collusion and obstruction as an attempt at a ""do-over"" of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.

""Take a look at Ukraine,"" Trump said. ""How come the FBI didn't take the server from the DNC? Just think about that one, Sean."" That was a reference to the DNC's decision in 2016 to turn over its server to the private security firm Crowdstrike, rather than the FBI, after what prosecutors said was a Russian-led hack.

The Hill's John Solomon reported earlier Wednesday that the FBI, in search warrant affidavits, relied heavily on leaked Ukrainian financial documents concerning former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort -- even though the bureau was repeatedly warned that the documents were untrustworthy and likely fake.

Earlier this year, Ukraine Prosecutor General Yurii Lutsenko opened a probe into the so-called ""black ledger"" files that led to Manafort's abrupt departure from the Trump campaign. The investigation commenced after an unearthed audio recording showed that a senior Ukrainian anticorruption official apparently admitted to leaking Manafort's financial information in 2016 -- including his ties to pro-Russian actors in Ukraine -- to benefit Clinton.

CLINTON-UKRAINE ALLEGATIONS 'BIG,' TRUMP SAYS

A Ukrainian court recently ruled that the Manafort leak amounted to illegal interference in the U.S. election. A 2017 investigation by Politico found that Ukrainian officials not only publicly sought to undermine Trump by questioning his fitness for office, but also worked behind the scenes to secure a Clinton victory.

""I don't hear Russia much anymore. You know, they've given up on that one."" — President Trump

Trump told Hannity the episode was hardly surprising, given that the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee (DNC), through the firm Fusion GPS, funded British ex-spy Christopher Steele's creation of an unverified and largely discredited dossier. The FBI went on to cite the dossier in secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court applications to surveil former Trump aide Carter Page.

""I think it's a disgrace,"" Trump said.

Numerous issues with the Steele dossier's reliability have surfaced, including several that were brought to the FBI's attention before it cited the dossier in its FISA application and subsequent renewals. Mueller's report made plain, for example, that former Trump attorney Michael Cohen did not travel to Prague to conspire with Russian hackers seeking to access Democrat files, as the dossier alleged.

Mueller also was unable to substantiate the dossier's claims that Page had received a large payment relating to the sale of a share of Rosneft, a Russian oil giant.

""The fact is, they were spying on my campaign, using intelligence agencies to do it. ... We're trying to figure out whether they listened to my calls. That would be the ultimate. We'll see what happens. If that happens, we'll probably find out. If they spied on my campaign and they may have, it will be one of the great revelations in history of this country. It will be very interesting. I think we're gonna find out.""

Trump said Attorney General Bill Barr is working ""very hard"" to get to the bottom the matter.

DOJ INVESTIGATING NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AS PART OF ONGOING REVIEW OF FBI MISCONDUCT

The lengthy phone conversation began with Trump recounting the Tuesday night launch of his campaign in the jam-packed Amway Center in Orlando. Thousands of Trump supporters arrived more than 40 hours in advance to secure a spot, despite sweltering Florida heat. Some had been camped in chairs for several nights.

""It was an incredible scene -- and outside there were thousands of people,"" Trump told Hannity, comparing the atmosphere to that of a national college football championship. ""It was just an electric evening. ... It's a tailgate party for our country.""

Trump noted that the U.S. has become ""number one in the world in energy,"" referring to the fact that the U.S. is the world's leading crude oil producer. The head of the International Energy Agency said in 2018 that, because of the ""shale revolution,"" the U.S. ""is becoming the undisputed leader of oil and gas production worldwide.”

The positive economic indicators, Trump said, have led Democrats to desperately pivot to discussing obstruction, now that Mueller's report found no evidence of Russian collusion by the Trump campaign, despite multiple efforts by Russian-linked actors to involve the Trump team in its hacking efforts.

""I don't hear Russia much anymore. You know, they've given up on that one,"" Trump said, before touting his administration's economic successes. ""We have the best, lowest unemployment rate for blacks, Asians, Hispanics -- nobody's ever seen numbers like this... If the other side had won, we'd have gone into a depression.

""We have more poeple working today -- almost 160 million people -- than have ever worked in the history of our country,"" Trump added. ""Think of it -- it's a great number.""

Trump also denied a Wall Street Journal report that he will live-tweet the upcoming Democrat primary debates, but suggested it might not be a bad idea.

""Instead of fake news, I'll make them correct news -- and maybe that's OK,"" Trump joked.

""When I make a speech, like last night -- there was a fantastic woman in the front with a sign, 'Please keep tweeting, it matters,'"" Trump continued. ""And, I think it does matter. I don't do it because I enjoy it. When somebody says an outright lie on MSNBC or CNN ... I can counteract those lies, and I have many more followers than they do."""
Shocker: DOJ Files Suit to Block Quad From Acquiring LSC Communications,https://www.piworld.com,['Mark Michelson'],06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.piworld.com/article/shocker-doj-files-suit-to-block-quad-from-acquiring-lsc-communications/,"In what many printing industry observers, including myself, view as a shocking development, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Antitrust Div., filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on June 20 seeking to block Quad’s proposed $1.4 billion, all-stock acquisition of LSC Communications.

According to an article published by CTFN that quoted a person with inside knowledge of negotiations which were in process to reach a settlement agreement, ""As early as the morning of June 20, the DOJ was prepared to approve the merger with divestitures, but Quad's lawyers pushed back on the package."" The same individual also reportedly indicated that some type of resolution could still be presented, at some point, that would meet DOJ approval.

However, the DOJ lawsuit (click here to read the full complaint) on the surface appears very adamant about its opposition to the proposed merger of the two companies, and doesn't specifically divulge what divestitures would be required, if any, for the antitrust regulatory agency to ultimately approve the deal.

If the transaction is not consummated by Oct. 30, 2019 — or if there is a final, non-appealable court order preventing the acquisition — either Quad or LSC can terminate their merger agreement. In this case, Quad would also be required to pay LSC a “regulatory approval reverse termination fee” of $45 million.

The DOJ complaint maintains that the transaction would combine the only two significant U.S. providers of magazine; catalog; and education and one-color trade book printing services, denying publishers and retailers throughout the country the benefits of competition that has spurred lower prices, improved quality, and greater printing output.

“American publishers and retailers rely on Quad and LSC to print and distribute billions of magazines, catalogs, and books each year,” said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, of the DOJ’s Antitrust Div., in a statement. “LSC is Quad’s primary competitor. If this deal were allowed to proceed, Quad would dominate the markets for magazine, catalog, and book printing services, and be able to raise prices and reduce quality at the expense of publishers, retailers, and, ultimately, American consumers.”

The lawsuit also contends that Quad/LSC’s gravure (Quad is the only remaining gravure long-run publication printer) and web offset printing and distribution resources vastly exceed those of their competitors, making them ""the only realistic options for many publishers and retailers.""

The DOJ complaint, which also cited several examples, alleges that Quad’s proposed acquisition of LSC would put an end to the “price war” between the two head-to-head competitors and allow the combined company to dominate the magazine; catalog; and education and one-color trade book printing markets.

They bid aggressively against each other by leveraging their scale and scope, and by undercutting one another’s prices, the DOJ complaint argued. This has led to reduced margins, which ultimately led Quad and LSC to contemplate a merger. ""As LSC [chairman, president and] CEO Tom Quinlan remarked to investors mere months before the current deal was announced, combining LSC and Quad would eliminate 'battle[s]' between the two and could help lead to '[p]ricing stability,'” the DOJ indicated.

The DOJ complaint specifically quotes internal presentations and emails describing the level of intense competition that exists between Quad and LSC:

Internal documents outline the “two-horse race between LSC and Quad.”

A Quad internal presentation explained, “we are the only printer other than LSC that can offer the largest publishers a complete solution.”

Executives observed a publisher “exploiting the fact that LSC [and] Quad[’s] CEOs want to beat each other into oblivion.”

A senior Quad executive remarked of LSC, “We’ve been in a price war with them for some time. Don’t see that changing.”

After hearing news of the merger, one Quad executive reflected on a recent battle between it and LSC and remarked, “I admit, in the case of [a large customer] I’m taking significant satisfaction in the news ... I’m sure it’s a bitter pill for them to swallow.”

Quad and LSC Will Defend Their Case Vigorously

For their part, Sussex, Wis.-based Quad and Chicago-based LSC plan to fight the ruling ""vigorously,"" arguing that their merger would create a highly efficient print manufacturing and distribution platform that will strengthen the role of print in an increasingly multichannel media world dominated by digital advertising.

“The DOJ’s position ignores the dynamic conditions in the U.S. commercial printing industry, which consists of nearly 50,000 companies, generates an estimated $76 billion in aggregate annual revenues, and provides ample competition for the supply of printed products, especially in the face of decreasing demand,"" Joel Quadracci, Quad chairman, president and CEO, said in a release issued by Quad. ""Neither Quad nor LSC accounts for more than 5% of that total print industry revenue. By comparison, two digital media companies, Google and Facebook alone, have worldwide digital ad sale revenues totaling more than $75 billion – nearly the same amount as the entire printing industry.

""This underscores a key point: Our competition is not only other printers, but also other forms of media. Quad is in the business of manufacturing advertising and, therefore, is a direct competitor to digital channels,"" Quadracci added. ""Given the continued migration of advertising dollars to digital channels, the printing industry has pursued platform consolidations as a key way to eliminate inefficient and expensive overcapacity, streamline operations and create the efficiencies. This will help ensure print remains an economically feasible alternative to digital channels for publishers and retailers.

""Our goal is to make print a more effective and affordable media option to that of digital giants such as Google and Facebook. The DOJ does not appear to recognize the competitive effect of digital media on the print industry.""

Similarly, LSC issued a statement contending why the merger would benefit the companies’ clients:

There is significant excess capacity in the printing industry today and this transaction would improve efficiencies and lower printing costs;

Many printers have the capability to print the same jobs as LSC Communications or Quad and successfully compete with both companies on quality and price;

Barriers to expansion and entry in the printing business are low and printers can easily expand their production capacity through acquisitions or with modest capital expenditures on equipment and facilities that are readily available; and

The trend toward digital substitution increases competition and disincentives price increases.

“We believe that the DOJ is wrong in its assessment of our transaction and that its action is counterproductive, especially in the context of the industry trends and continued consolidation,"" LSC Chairman, President and CEO Quinlan said. ""We continue to believe that our proposed combination will provide an overall more efficient experience for our clients.""

What Were the Stumbling Blocks for Approval?

As reported by Printing Impressions earlier, apparently one of the DOJ's issues was the fact that Quad is the only remaining printer with rotogravure printing capabilities suited for long-run (1 million or more copies) publication printing. More likely, though, what DOJ considered is the dominant position the combined entities would have on the mailing and distribution side of the business.

In May 2018, LSC announced its acquisition of RR Donnelley's Print Logistics business. That followed on the heels of its July 2017 acquisition of Fairrington Transportation, a mailing and logistics provider. And, in November of last year, it purchased The Clark Group, a third-party logistics provider of distribution, consolidation, transportation management and international freight forwarding services.

As one savvy reader commented to Printing Impressions, ""Unless the DOJ intercedes, Quad is going to have a virtual monopoly on mail consolidation such as co-mail, co-pal and cross-docking, and also on newsstand distribution. Other than a small company here or there, nobody else has the kind of firepower that Quad will have.

""I should point out that other printers have long relied on RRD/LSC/Quad or companies they have recently acquired, like Fairrington or The Clark Group, for these distribution services,"" he added. ""Let's face it, Quad is not paying for the merger via synergies by combining Quad with LSC. They will pay for it by charging more for distribution of printed product. They can — and will — muscle their smaller competitors out of business to take the work that fits their platform.

""These are the conversations I have had with competitors in the printing business and partners in the publishing world. But because we all will rely on Quad for these services, we can only hope and pray the DOJ intercedes some how,"" he concluded.

For now, the wish of that printer appears to have been granted. And, one can only wonder about the amount of turmoil that must now be occurring internally within the Quad and LSC organizations, as well as among their respective customer bases. For some time now the companies undoubtedly have been preparing their internal operations and advising their external customer bases in preparation for the merger they assumed would happen. But now, with this latest development, everything remains up in the air as to whether or not the deal will ultimately be consummated.

In the end, that's not good for Quad nor LSC. Nor is that sense of uncertainty good for an industry as a whole that — at least from the perspective of Wall Street and Main Street — is already facing a large degree of uncertainty and upheaval."
"A worthless degree? Betsy DeVos wants to change rules for which colleges stay open, close",https://www.usatoday.com,"['Chris Quintana', 'Published A.M. Et June']",06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2019/06/21/college-closing-accreditation-betsy-devos-u-s-department-education/1505318001/,"CLOSE Trump's education secretary's plans for reforming U.S. education revolve around charter schools and vouchers. Video provided by Newsy Newslook

Going to Brightwood College in the 2018 fall semester was supposed to be a safe bet. So thousands of students enrolled across the country.

For those students and others, a degree is supposed to be a lifeline. They sink in time and money that could be spent in the workforce, all for the prospect of higher earnings and a more fulfilling career.

But Brightwood students’ investment didn’t pay off. What’s more, a regulatory group had signed off on the college’s programs – only to change its mind.

Accreditation, as it’s called, is meant to prevent predatory or shoddy schools from leading students astray. And the Accrediting Council of Independent Colleges and Schools had given its signal to students that Brightwood was a worthwhile investment.

Yet in December 2018, the agency revoked the accreditation of Education Corp. of America, which ran the Brightwood locations and other colleges across the country. The closures of dozens of institutions followed swiftly. Students had spent the time and money but still had no degrees and no clear path forward.

Don't be one of them: A college closed, leaving thousands without a degree. How to keep it from happening to you

Alexis Gurrola, a dental assisting student at Brightwood College, said she was told December 5 the college was closing. She said students and staff were told they would finish out the week, but that classes would not resume the following week. (Photo: Rachel Denny Clow/Caller-Times)

Many of them still struggle. In a Facebook group for students of the closed college, some commiserate over what they call worthless degrees. Others try to give advice about how to get their student loan discharged or receive their transcripts.

What’s more, the Accrediting Council of Independent Colleges and Schools had a checkered history itself. President Barack Obama's administration had moved to strip it of its powers to OK school programs, but after a legal battle, President Donald Trump's administration undid that move.

The Education Corp. of America colleges were just some of the institutions that suddenly closed in recent years. ITT Tech closed in 2016. Corinthian Colleges did the same in 2015. Both had been accredited by ACICS. The accrediting group said it gave multiple warnings, but the colleges weren't able to meet its standards.

What happened?: The trouble at for-profit colleges, in 5 graphs

Now, the Education Department is looking to change the arcane and bureaucratic process of accreditation.

Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and accreditors of universities say new rules will ultimately allow colleges to offer programs more quickly and effectively. That means students landing a job in fields that are hiring, they say.

“With these reforms, our nation’s colleges and universities can spend more time and effort on serving students and less time, energy, and money focused on bureaucratic compliance,” DeVos said in a statement.

Critics of the newly proposed rules say they would make it easier for shady colleges to operate for longer and with less federal oversight.

Many colleges are already doing a poor job of preparing students, said Clare McCann of the think tank New America. Giving them more latitude under the guise of innovation may lead to students taking chances on junk programs, she argued.

“What these regulations really do is make it so it is much harder to hold those schools accountable,” McCann said.

If anything, the government should hold these agencies to a higher standard, she said.

The public has until July 12 to give feedback on the proposed changes. Here’s what you should know.

Did your college close? Why Brightwood College, Virginia College closed — and what students should do

What is accreditation?

To receive federal money, universities must meet the quality standards of an accrediting organization. According to the Education Department, these agencies ensure schools have “qualified instructors, an adequate curriculum, and necessary support services” for students. In other words, they’re meant to prevent students from ending up with worthless degrees.

Accreditation can essentially be seen as a seal of quality for students, the government and even future employers. And students atunaccredited colleges can’t access federal money in the form of student loans.

The government doesn’t directly accredit schools, but the Department of Education does decide who is and isn’t fit to be an accreditor. The new rules were agreed upon by department officials, accreditors, college leaders and students during several negotiation sessions.

What’s the Education Department trying to do?

Among the changes, the proposed rules would allow colleges to offer new programs with less scrutiny from accreditors. The idea is that colleges could see a hole in the workforce and quickly come up with a new degree or credential to fill it. Accrediting agencies and for-profit colleges like this proposed change.

Under the current rules, it may take months to make changes to a program’s curriculum, said Judith Eaton, president of the Council for Higher Education Accreditation. The group is made up of 3,000 colleges, and it focuses on accreditation. The new rules, she argued, would mean a less onerous process for accreditors when dealing with the federal government. And, she said, the new rules may make it so that universities feel free to experiment with, for example, new credentialing programs or increased online courses.

If a college or accrediting group abused the new rules, the Education Department should crack down quickly, she said.

What about colleges that fail?

The proposed rules would also allow schools that have failed to meet accreditation standards up to four years to fix their problems – double the previous amount of two years. The rationale? These changes sometimes take a long time, and allowing the university to fix a problem may lead to more students graduating.

Closing an underperforming college right away, in contrast, may leave those students without an education and nowhere to go to finish their degree.

That is a change welcomed by Nicholas Kent, a vice president at Career Education Colleges and Universities, a group of for-profit colleges.

Critics have said the measure may allow bad colleges to do more damage, but Kent called that description “disingenuous,” saying different programs will have different needs. A nine-month certificate program, he said, will need less time to fix a problem compared with a 6-year-doctoral program.

And he said accreditors are not required to give four years to everyone. Instead, they have the discretion to do so, and they can set up other check-ins.

But allowing a bad institution to operate longer may mean more students attend the failing institution, wasting time and money. And it could cost taxpayers more money because the school could continue to get federal grants and loans, Antoinette Flores, an associate director at the liberal Center for American Progress, has argued.

Plus, she said, the proposed rules could make it easier for outside entities to buy failing colleges. The Department of Education wants to limit a new owner's liability.

“In practice, that means we’re never going to see any of these institutions going away,” Flores said. “That increases the likelihood we’re recycling failed, toxic assets in the system, and we’re never really getting rid of the lowest performances.”

What happens next?

Want to review the proposed rules yourself? Visit the Federal Register, where the proposal is available in its entirety.

The period for public comment ends July 12, so if you have an opinion, file it on the Federal Register's website.

Any rule changes would follow the public comment period.

For the new director and CEO of the VA Southern Nevada Healthcare System, a sense of duty and service goes back generations.

William “Bill” Caron, who just finished his second week at the helm of the North Las Vegas VA facility, is an Air Force veteran who began his medical career as a physical therapist at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana.

His grandfather served in World War II, and his father is a Vietnam-era veteran.

“Being a veteran and coming from a family of veterans, I was always compelled to serve this great nation,” he said Friday. “Even though I spent many years in the private sector, I really felt drawn back to service.”

Caron will oversee delivery of health care to 63,000 veterans, a $540 million annual operating budget, and ensure outpatient and inpatient services are available to more than 140,000 veterans residing in Clark, Lincoln and Nye counties.

Experience and leadership

“We are excited to bring Bill on board as the new Director of the VA Southern Nevada Healthcare System,” John Brandecker, Veterans Integrated Service Network 21 director, said in a press release. “His sound leadership qualities and proven experience will be valuable assets for the facility, the employees and volunteers, and most importantly, for the Veterans we are honored to serve.”

Caron, who holds a bachelor’s degree in physical therapy and a master’s degree in health care administration, joined the VA in 2010 as associate director of the Oscar G. Johnson VA Medical Center in Iron Mountain, Michigan.

From 2014 to 2017, he served as associate director at the VA Southern Nevada Healthcare System, which included a stint as acting director from May to December 2015. He worked alongside former director Peggy Kearns, who retired April 13 after 36 years of service.

In 2017, he became director of the Southern Arizona VA Health Care System in Tucson, Arizona.

Prior to joining the VA, Caron was a U.S. Navy Hospital Corpsman Reservist while in college and began his medical career as a physical therapist in the private sector.

He then entered active duty with the U.S. Air Force where he served in the Biomedical Service Corps as a physical therapist at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana.

He also served in leadership roles during a 14-year career in the private sector where he managed multiple clinical services. He is also a fellow of the American College of Health Care Executives.

‘Keep marching forward’

Caron said he sees the chance to come back to Southern Nevada as a way to keep expanding the North Las Vegas hospital.

“We have a unique opportunity here at VA Southern Nevada to continue to grow, just like the city is growing, in a progressive manner,” he said. “We’re in the infancy stage of growing our research program, as well as our academic collaboration.”

Caron said he’s excited to continue to participate in the growth of UNLV’s medical school. He hopes to match Tucson with a robust academic affiliation to work with medical students, residents and fellows to develop high, complex care.

“We have the potential here to become a level 1A, highest complexity facility as well because of that progressive environment,” he said. “There’s a road to go to get there, but it’s definitely within our cross-hairs.”

Caron said he hopes to expand upon the foundation that Kearns set, by focusing on primary care, recruitment, staffing, mental health and specialty care. He especially is focused on staying aligned with federal initiatives that support outreach for veterans suicide.

“It takes a village. …The important component we’re finding is we need veterans to engage in the mental health services we provide,” he said. “Those that do engage are far less likely to attempt and, God forbid, complete suicide.”

Caron said he is looking forward to being involved in the Southern Nevada community, which he said is appreciative and supportive of the veteran community.

“The VA, much like your time in the military, is a family. All gave some, and some gave all,” he said. “That has helped me stay grounded and stay focused on what the goal is. Despite the bureaucratic hurdles we run into sometimes, we just have to keep marching forward.”

"Trump EPA snubs carbon capture, an emissions reduction technique favored by environmentalists and Republicans",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-22-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/trump-epa-snubs-carbon-capture-an-emissions-reduction-technique-favored-by-environmentalists-and-republicans,"The Trump Environmental Protection Agency is dismissing a technology that is favored by many Republicans and is widely considered to be among the most effective at slashing emissions from coal plants.

EPA’s Affordable Clean Energy, or ACE, rule, finalized last week to replace President Barack Obama's signature climate change rule, the Clean Power Plan, does not include carbon capture and storage, also known as CCS, in a list of six technologies that utilities can consider to reduce carbon emissions and make their plants more efficient by burning less coal to produce the same amount of electricity.

The snub of carbon capture, critics say, shows the agency is not serious about combating climate change.

""Based on the rejection of CCS, it's hard to conclude the EPA leadership takes the job of regulating carbon pollution seriously,” said Julio Friedmann, a researcher who studies carbon capture at the Center for Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. Friedmann was formerly principal deputy assistant of the Energy Department’s Office of Fossil Energy in the Obama administration.

Carbon capture technology removes carbon dioxide from a power plant's exhaust, so as to not release it into the atmosphere, and traps the emissions underground.

The EPA argues carbon capture has not been “adequately demonstrated” on a commercial scale and is too expensive.

“Our view of the law is that when states develop emissions limits, it cannot be based on carbon capture,” an EPA senior official told reporters on a press call this week.

To be sure, carbon capture is not considered very energy efficient. It requires a chunk of the energy produced by the power plant to run the capture and storage process. So to include carbon capture as part of a rule that aims to bolster coal plant efficiency doesn't make sense.

“CCS could help continued participation of a coal unit, but not because it makes a unit more efficient,” said Christi Tezak, a managing director at ClearView, an energy research group.

But the problem, critics say, is that the EPA is wrong to only accept efficiency improvements at coal plants, because it's an insufficient way to reduce carbon emissions.

The administration explicitly rejected the more expansive approach of the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan that would have required utilities to move away from coal and switch to natural gas or renewables in order to meet a national emissions limit. The ACE rule does not set any federal emissions limit.

While carbon capture was not part of the Clean Power Plan, the United Nations’ international climate panel considers the technology a crucial tool to fight climate change.

""Focusing solely on power plant efficiency as means of emissions reductions seems inadequate,” Friedmann said. “In order to achieve the kind of profound emissions reductions we need, carbon capture should be considered.""

The Trump EPA has snubbed carbon capture in other ways.

It is the process of revising another Obama-era rule regulating new coal plants, as opposed to existing ones, that would have effectively required plants be built with CCS.

The Trump EPA prefers to not require carbon capture, with the agency using the same argument that carbon capture is not viable or cheap enough.

Friedmann disagrees with EPA’s contention.

Carbon capture costs have dropped by more than 50% over the past 10 years, he said.

Eighteen large facilities around the world, including two at coal power plants, currently capture and store 30 million tons of carbon each year.

For example, the Petra Nova coal plant outside Houston, America’s only successfully running carbon capture facility, sends the carbon dioxide via pipeline to nearby oil fields, where it is used to assist in the extraction of crude oil. The sale of carbon dioxide as a commodity for use in products such as cement, plastics, fuel, and carbon fiber helps to offset the added cost of the CCS technology.

There are more carbon capture projects coming, encouraged by expanded tax credits passed into law in bipartisan votes in Congress last year and signed by President Trump.

""CCS has certainly been adequately demonstrated,” Friedmann said. “Many people said renewables were not cost effective until they were. We've heard this before and it does not square with our experience.""

EPA officials say they do not mean to slight carbon capture. EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler told reporters this week that coal plant operators would not be banned from installing carbon capture as part of the ACE rule. States are also free to encourage the use of carbon capture as part of carbon-free electricity mandates.

“It doesn't preclude CCS from taking place,” Wheeler said of the ACE rule.

But carbon capture cannot qualify toward fulfilling whatever emissions limit states decide to impose to meet the requirements of the ACE rule.

EPA’s air office chief Bill Wehrum, the main author of the ACE rule, said carbon capture could still succeed without his agency promoting it.

“Our job is to let the markets do what they do best to improve efficiency, develop technology, and reduce emissions,"" he said. ""We are seeing technologies like carbon capture being developed today and they will continue being developed. This rule doesn’t get in the way of that.”"

The recent cyberattack on a U.S. Customs and Border Protection subcontractor didn’t expose just the faces and license plates of thousands of U.S. travelers. It also revealed the inner workings of a complex surveillance network that border authorities have long sought to keep secret.

CBP officials have downplayed the significance of the material taken in the hack, saying only that fewer than 100,000 photos of travelers had been compromised and that none of those had been posted to the “dark Web,” the corner of the Internet where stolen documents are often traded and displayed.

That assessment, however, woefully understates the number of sensitive documents that are now freely available on the Web — so much material, totaling hundreds of gigabytes, that The Washington Post required several days of computer time to capture it all.

The documents offer an unusually intimate glimpse of the machinery that U.S. officials depend on for the constant monitoring of legal immigration through the border. They also illuminate the government’s plans for expanding its use of license plate readers and facial-recognition cameras, including such details as how many cameras are focused on which traffic lanes at some of the busiest border crossings in the world.

The hoard of hacked documents includes detailed schematics, confidential agreements, equipment lists, budget spreadsheets, internal photos and hardware blueprints for security systems.

Among potentially sensitive government material are internal Department of Homeland Security handbooks, border surveillance diagrams and dozens of signed nondisclosure agreements between the subcontractor and government authorities, as well as companies such as Microsoft and the defense-contracting giant Northrop Grumman. Microsoft and Northrop Grumman did not respond to requests for comment.

The files also offer extensive detail on — and, in some cases, a literal road map to — equipment that has been installed at U.S. military bases and the United States’ most highly trafficked border gateways.

“This is red meat for their competitors . . . [and] a whole set of domestic and foreign terrorists and criminals who might want to use that information,” said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a Washington think tank.

“This is a pretty stark view into one of the cogs of the U.S. surveillance state,” he said, adding that federal authorities “may have to change some of that operational stuff pretty quickly before people take advantage.”

Taken as a whole, the documents provide a rare look into the U.S. government’s dependence on a cluster of little-known private contractors to martial its efforts to monitor who enters and leaves the United States.

The firm whose computer systems appear to have been breached, Perceptics, is an obscure presence in the world of federal contracting: a 40-year-old company based in a strip mall in Farragut, Tenn., a Knoxville suburb, that many privacy advocates say they had never heard of until recently. But its technology, the documents show, helps form the core of a security engine that has photographed virtually every car and truck crossing the border over the past decade in a process for which there is little public oversight.

Hackers posted the cache of documents onto the dark Web, where files are hidden from search engines and accessible only through special software, such as the Tor browser, that allow for enhanced encryption and user anonymity.

The Post obtained a link to the dark Web directory that hackers first sent to the Register, a British tech news site. Some of the documents have since been posted to the broader Internet by the group Distributed Denial of Secrets, making them more easily accessible for a mainstream audience.

The Post provided a detailed outline of the contents of this story to CBP and Perceptics officials before publication, but neither entity provided a comment. None of the documents The Post reviewed was marked classified.

The documents include detailed records about multiyear CBP contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars covering technology upgrades at all ports of entry. The records include the exact names, costs and quantities of hardware components for a number of ports, including San Ysidro, the largest port of entry between the United States and Mexico and one of the busiest border crossings in the world.

One PowerPoint presentation, dated in April, appears to outline a recent visit from CBP officials, who were offered a facility tour and hands-on experience with the license plate scanners. The presentation outlined systems that Perceptics was testing for “face capture for biometrics,” including examples of drivers’ faces being photographed and analyzed. “We overcome blocked faces,” the presentation said, a reference to faces obscured by sunglasses or car visors.

[Trump renews pledge to deport millions, but ICE reality is far more limited]

The records also include an exhaustive array of photos captured by fixed, handheld and mobile license plate readers made by Perceptics, which has said its scanners capture more than 200 million license plates a year. Many of the reports include photos taken from multiple angles of a single car, truck or motorcycle, showing the license plate, the vehicle and the driver’s unobscured face.

Contract documents from the past decade show that the role of Perceptics in federal security efforts goes beyond license plate readers to providing other equipment, such as bomb-detecting “under-vehicle surveillance systems,” to U.S. border crossings, Drug Enforcement Administration checkpoints, military bases and air stations. Funding documents suggest the company has also worked with officials in the United Arab Emirates as well as with a special-forces unit in Saudi Arabia.

Also available are internal company documents including financial statements, project budgets, internal passwords, sales and marketing material, and information about employees’ performance reviews, insurance coverage and pay.

Few specifics are known about the hack itself. The CBP acknowledged the intrusion in a statement June 10, saying it learned of the cyberattack on May 31. That statement said that no CBP networks or databases were breached and that it had “not yet verified” that the stolen data was from CBP holdings. It blamed an unnamed contractor for leaving confidential material vulnerable to attack, saying it had violated agency rules by moving copies of license plate and travel images onto its private network.

But that account leaves many questions unanswered, including how CBP first learned of the breach. Journalists with the Register published a report on the breach on May 23, eight days before CBP says it became aware of the attack. The Register report detailed the cache of documents and said it appeared to include many license plate images.

CBP officials have declined to comment further, citing an ongoing forensic investigation that “will determine the original sources of the data, and provide the details needed to ensure the appropriate response actions are taken.”

Perceptics officials also decline to comment. While CBP hasn’t confirmed that Perceptics was the company involved in the breach, the company’s name appears on many of the files, and the CBP statement sent to The Post last week included “Perceptics” in the title of the document.

[ICE is tapping into a huge license-plate database, ACLU says, raising new privacy concerns about surveillance]

A number of other questions remain. CBP said it has “removed from service all equipment related to the breach” but has offered no details, and the agency has declined to say how the hackers broke into the subcontractors’ systems, how long they had access to confidential material and whether other companies had been targeted.

In a letter last week to Department of Homeland Security leaders, Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) asked what CBP had done to prevent future breaches and whether affected travelers had been notified, adding, “Anything other than full transparency is unacceptable.” In a separate letter, Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) asked whether the FBI was responding and whether travelers’ other personal information could be at risk. The agency has yet to officially respond to either letter, the senators’ representatives said. The FBI referred comment to CBP.

The breach also raises questions about how aggressively federal authorities monitor the private subcontractors they depend on to fulfill their mandate. The Trump administration has directed intense attention toward the U.S.-Mexico border, with mass arrests and border-security measures such as the “extreme vetting” initiative touted as key to enhancing national security.

But those tactics have also drawn scorn from some lawmakers, who have said the push from federal officials to gather an ever-increasing amount of data in the name of greater security is tantamount to an eternal dragnet that can put people in harm’s way.

“It is outrageous that DHS allowed individuals’ sensitive data to be compromised, but this case also highlights the risks of collecting this information in the first place,” Markey said in a statement this week. “This personal, sensitive [data] becomes a gold mine for bad actors, and the effects could be devastating for the victims of a breach.”

[Perspective: Don’t smile for surveillance: Why airport face scans are a privacy trap]

More than a million people cross through points of entry on the American border every day, according to CBP, including roughly 300,000 by car, truck and other passenger vehicles. To surveil them, the government relies on companies such as Perceptics, which in 2015 said it was the sole provider of license plate scanners for passenger vehicle inspections “at all land border ports of entry in the United States, Canada and at the most critical lanes in Mexico.”

DHS officials say license plate readers are an important tool for “identifying, apprehending and removing” people crossing the border illegally. But information on all vehicles crossing the border is recorded into a database made accessible to more than a dozen federal agencies, including for drivers not accused of a crime.

Vehicle information, location and time of crossing can be stored on DHS servers for up to two years, or longer if “linked to an active law enforcement investigation,” DHS officials said in 2017. License plate readers are also hidden near “known smuggling routes” and installed on CBP vehicles, allowing them to record the license plates of every vehicle that passes by.

Dave Maass, a senior investigative researcher at the digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation who has studied police surveillance, said Perceptics is “virtually unknown” and often overshadowed by Vigilant Solutions, whose license plate reader technology is used by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and local police agencies.

Both companies, he said, have benefited from an increasingly close relationship between surveillance technology vendors and the government.

[Oregon became a testing ground for Amazon’s facial-recognition policing. But what if Rekognition gets it wrong?]

“There’s this imbalance of power in making decisions, where the discussions are between law enforcement and salespeople, and policymakers and the public aren’t involved,” Maass said. “The reasons for surveillance end up being driven by profit, as opposed to the needs for public safety,"" he added. “These agencies shouldn’t be collecting more data than they absolutely need . . . or can absolutely protect.”

It remains unclear who spearheaded the attack. A hacker using the pseudonym “Boris Bullet-Dodger” first contacted journalists last month and offered a list of the stolen files, and a site on the dark Web attributes the attack to Team Snatch, a cybercrime group that has also taken credit for other corporate hacks and ransom attempts.

A site on the dark Web listing Perceptics files also includes large troves of data purportedly taken from other companies, including a New York corporate consulting agency, a German computer system company and a Texas accounting firm.

The Perceptics breach, some experts said, could serve as a milestone for the potential hazards of expanded government monitoring. Rachel Levinson-Waldman, senior counsel at the think tank Brennan Center for Justice, pointed to new State Department rules that require everyone who applies for a U.S. visa to provide details of the social media accounts they used over the past five years.

“This kind of breach highlights the dangers of mass collection of sensitive data. And it should not come as a surprise,” Levinson-Waldman said. “Large-scale collection of personal information is not costless. Congress must exercise vigorous oversight and demand that agencies limit the sensitive information they collect and safeguard the data in their possession.”"

"10-year Treasury yield drops as low as 1.97%, first time below 2% since November 2016",https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/19/us-treasury-yields-tick-higher-as-investors-await-federal-reserve-meeting.html,"A chart showing the U.S. 10-year treasury yield below 2% as of 11:49 p.m. ET Wednesday.

The policymaking committee of the Fed also dropped the word ""patient"" from its statement, a sign interpreted by some investors as a hint that the central bank hasn't abandoned the idea of a rate cut in 2019. The Fed tweaked its statement to acknowledge that inflation is ""running below"" its 2% objective.

Though the central bank maintained the target overnight lending rate , that decision was accompanied by a growing number of officials open to one rate cut by the end of 2019 with eight members in favor. However, the consensus still didn't expect a reduction until 2020 at the earliest.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell below 2% for the first time since November 2016 on Wednesday — breaching a key psychological level — after the Federal Reserve struck a more dovish tone in its June policy statement and Chair Jerome Powell said that the case for easier monetary policy had strengthened.

At around 11:58 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to price, declined below 2% to 1.9821% — around its lowest levels since November 2016. The yield on the 2-year slipped to 1.7209%, its lowest level since 2017. The 3-month Treasury bill yield ticked lower to 2.175%, as of 7:30 p.m. ET.

While stock investors and home buyers may initially cheer the drop in the benchmark for corporate bond and mortgage rates, the return to levels not seen in more than two years raises serious questions about the state of the economy.

Softer economic gauges like May's anemic jobs report — which showed that the U.S. economy added just 75,000 positions — and a lackluster consumer pricing print suggested to economists and fixed-income traders earlier this month that the central bank may have to assure markets of its willingness to step in if GDP growth decelerates.

Speaking to reporters after the central bank meeting, Powell said policymakers are worried about certain economic data and see an improving case for easier policy.

""Overall, our policy discussion focused on the appropriate response to the uncertain environment,"" he said. ""Many participants now see the case for somewhat more accommodative policy has strengthened,"" Powell said.

Traders are now pricing in a more than 80% chance of a rate cut in July and 70% probability of another reduction in September, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.

""It was largely what the market was looking for: I don't think they went too far as to spook the market in any way,"" said Tom Garretson, a fixed-income strategist at RBC. ""Seeing that eight [officials] are seeing a rate cut this year was dovish.""

""This is mostly an inflation story,"" he added. ""If you look at GDP forecast for 2020 they're up to 2% from 1.9% ... even if they were worried about tariffs, it didn't show up in their forecast.""

The Fed has in recent months been grappling with a consistent shortfall in inflation relative to its self-imposed 2% target. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, increased 1.6% in the year to April after gaining 1.5% in March.

Treasury inflation-protected securities — bonds whose payouts are indexed to consumer prices — show that price growth expectations have slid in recent months. Inflation is a threat to the value of a bond's fixed coupon and principal payments.

Wednesday's decision from the Federal Open Market Committee came after President Donald Trump's repeated criticism of the Fed and Jerome Powell specifically for raising rates and tightening monetary conditions over the last year. Trump, who sees recent Fed policy as damaging to American markets and undermining his bargaining position in trade talks, has broken with tradition in his frequent and vocal criticism of the central bank.

Asked Tuesday whether he wants to remove Powell as Fed Chair, Trump said ""Let's see what he does."" Trump's comments came after Bloomberg News reported Tuesday morning that the White House had looked into demoting Powell in February.

Trump also said Tuesday he will be having an ""extended meeting"" next week with the Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the G-20 meeting in Japan.

Meanwhile, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said Tuesday that the central bank may need to ease monetary policy in the coming months if inflation doesn't bounce back toward its target.

""In the absence of improvement, such that the sustained return of inflation to our aim is threatened, additional stimulus will be required,"" Draghi said.

The House Intelligence Committee has “very little visibility” into the three Justice Department investigations into the intelligence officials who launched the Russia probe, the panel’s chairman Adam Schiff said on Wednesday.

It’s a situation that has Schiff concerned, given his fears that the probes are politically motivated.

Story Continued Below

“It’s an effort to amplify the counter-narrative, and to ignore what the Russians did, and what they will do in the next election,” Schiff said at a National Press Club event on Wednesday. ""We’ve already seen a disturbing erosion of our checks and balances” with regard to the White House’s contact with DOJ, he added.

DOJ’s Office of the Inspector General has been investigating the origins of the Russia probe since last year. Attorney General Bill Barr launched a parallel investigation in May, tapping John Durham to spearhead the inquiry around the time special counsel Robert Mueller was wrapping up the two-year probe, which concluded Trump’s campaign did not criminally conspire with Russian intermediaries to disrupt the 2016 election. Barr said he wanted to find out whether there was inappropriate government “spying” on the Trump campaign that drove suspicions of a Kremlin link.

According to The New York Times, Durham’s efforts have since zeroed in on the CIA analysts responsible for the conclusion that Russian President Vladimir Putin interfered in the 2016 election specifically to help Trump win. The focus has alarmed some in the national security community who worry that Durham’s probe will cast doubt on the apolitical nature of intelligence gathering and give credence to the president’s misleading claims that Obama-era officials tried to sabotage his campaign.

Those fears have been exacerbated by Trump’s decision to give Barr sweeping declassification authority, a power usually delegated to intelligence leaders for their own evidence.

Schiff indicated that, despite asking the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Justice Department to keep him informed about any official declassification requests from Barr, the House Intelligence Committee — which oversees the intelligence community — remains largely in the dark about what the agencies are having to produce and whether their cooperation is voluntary or being compelled.

“I have discussed personally with the Director of National Intelligence [Dan] Coats my profound concern about what Bill Barr is doing in particular,” Schiff said. “Namely, his desire to provide cover to the president by investigating the investigators.”

Others are less anxious about Durham’s probe, noting that the CIA has been investigated by Durham before and is accustomed to this kind of oversight. They point to 2008, when Attorney General Michael Mukasey appointed Durham to conduct a criminal investigation into the destruction of torture tapes made by the CIA years earlier. That probe was expanded and later resulted in full criminal investigations into the deaths of two detainees, which ultimately wrapped in 2012 with no charges brought against anyone in the agency.

It’s unclear, though, what mandate Durham is operating under and whether he is looking at the intelligence agencies with an eye to recommending criminal charges. He has not been appointed to lead a criminal investigation, and the Justice Department has formally described the inquiry as only as a “review.” Durham also won’t be leaving his day job as the U.S. Attorney for the District of Connecticut.

Schiff, meanwhile, said he is still trying to get answers from the FBI about the counterintelligence findings of Mueller’s investigation, and whether the counterintelligence investigation launched in early 2017 into Trump himself was ever formally closed.

While the FBI has “started to provide some answers” and increased briefings, Schiff said, they’ve been reluctant to go into any detail. “They’re just telling us about process,” Schiff said. “Like everything else, it’s like pulling teeth, and our patience is growing fatigued at this point.”"

Paul Manafort leaves the federal courthouse in Washington in 2017. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)

Contributing columnist

Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s legal troubles didn’t end when he was convicted on bank and tax fraud charges in 2018. He’s facing state-level mortgage fraud charges, and because his case is going to trial in New York City, he needed to be transferred between penitentiaries. That is a routine matter and regularly results in the defendant’s transfer to a state penitentiary, here Rikers Island.

But in this case, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen intervened, forwarding to Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. a letter from Manafort’s attorney suggesting that it would not be safe for Manafort to be held on Rikers Island. The result? Manafort will be housed at a federal penitentiary rather than going to Rikers. Should we really care?

Yes we should. If the decision was motivated by politics — and it is very hard to formulate a plausible alternative explanation — it’s an injustice in itself and an indication of rotten goings-on at the Justice Department.

Consider first the magnitude of the favor that the department provided Manafort. Any prisoner would greatly prefer incarceration in either of the two institutions where Manafort will remain to Rikers’ Island, which is a notorious hellhole. (Why Rikers continues to operate at all in its current state is a subject for another column.) Manafort would surely be kept in isolation for his own protection in Rikers, but the difference in the overall conditions at these facilities is enormous.

Now consider how rare it is that Manafort’s request was granted and the role that Rosen, the No. 2 official at the Justice Department, played in facilitating it. It is not simply unusual but unprecedented. I have canvassed colleagues with combined decades of service at the Justice Department, and to a person they aver that they have never heard of a similar situation.

That is not because prisoners don’t ask. It is, in fact, routine to field requests for placement in certain institutions; I did so regularly as a U.S. attorney. The standard-issue response is to let the defendant know that, by law, the decision was for the Federal Bureau of Prisons to make, and that at most, a Justice Department representative could transmit a recommendation.

Finally, consider the reasoning: A spokesman for the Justice Department said the decision was justified by Manafort’s “unique health and safety needs.”

This is bunk of the first order. No doubt Manafort is ill, and no doubt he requires special protection. But are his circumstances unique? Absolutely not. Manafort’s situation is not meaningfully different from dozens of others who are routinely, in fact invariably, resolved many levels below the deputy attorney general and in favor of state incarceration pending state trial.

So we have a one-of-a-kind decision, made at an unprecedented level and justified by fanciful reasoning. Some special factor was obviously at play. It is entirely possible that there were political implications in doing a good deed for Manafort.

It’s not hard to see what those implications might be. Manafort has been the closest thing to a stand-up wise guy in the Trump drama: He managed through squirrelly doublespeak to avoid giving special counsel Robert S. Mueller III the full book on President Trump, and he paid for it in added prison time.

In return, Manafort’s transfer makes it look as though Trump, or Attorney General William P. Barr channeling Trump, is showing him some love with a special favor nobody else ever gets. That’s good for Manafort in the immediate run, and at the same time, it would communicate even more strongly that the way to a pardon is continued noncooperation with federal authorities.

This is all very bad news coming from the Justice Department.

For starters, though we hardly remember this principle because it has been so thoroughly trammeled in the Trump years, it would be a serious breach of protocol if anyone at the White House even communicated with the Justice Department to urge special treatment for Manafort. Any such overture should have been immediately rebuffed.

If that didn’t happen, it would almost be worse because it would mean that the department acted out of subservience to the president’s political goals on its own motion. It is the antithesis of doing justice without fear or favor — rewarding a political ally of the president because he resisted pressure from the Justice Department.

The overall turning of tables could not be more dramatic. Manafort did his best to wriggle out from under the lawful Justice Department investigation of him and the president. Now that same department is acting as his friend, as well as the president’s friend; and friends look out for one another.

That suggests a final lesson from Manafort’s relatively sweet accommodations: Rosen, who was Barr’s handpicked choice, likely comes to the department with a staff that is already integrated with Barr’s. That happens in the case of particularly strong attorneys general. Barr is that, by virtue of his own force of character and his preeminent standing in the Trump universe. As long as Trump is president, Barr enjoys total dominion at the Justice Department. The department’s special treatment of Manafort illustrates why that state of affairs is so worrisome.

Chaos within the EPA exposes Americans to toxins like asbestos,https://thehill.com,[],06-21-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/449756-chaos-within-the-epa-exposes-americans-to-toxins-like-asbestos,"Three years ago, there was bipartisan euphoria when President Obama signed the Frank L. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (LCSA) into law. The updated Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) finally gave the EPA regulatory authority to protect Americans from dangerous toxic substances like asbestos, a known human carcinogen. During the pen signing ceremony, Obama said the much-needed legislation was a crucial step forward, remarking, ""The [old] system was so complex, it was so burdensome that our country hasn't even been able to uphold a ban on asbestos.""

The ongoing battle for chemical safety reform continues.

Met with confrontation, Pruitt’s regulatory rollbacks and ethics violations forced him to resign 12 months after his Senate confirmation. Pruitt wasn’t alone. Many who formerly worked at American Chemistry Council (ACC) now hold high-level EPA positions. Most notably, Nancy Beck, was selected to head the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention (OCSPP). Overseeing the toxic chemical unit, Beck carried out Trump’s seeming pro-industry agenda. The revolving doors continue as Beck now heads to the White House's National Economic Council.

The EPA attempted to ban asbestos in 1989, but was sued by Corrosion Proof Fittings, a company that used asbestos in their products. In 1991, an appeals court overturned the ban, resulting in a failure to ban the deadly chemical through TSCA.

Nearly 70 countries have already banned asbestos, but sadly, three years after Obama signed LCSA into law, U.S. asbestos imports, use, and deaths continue. Each year, nearly 40,000 Americans die from preventable asbestos-caused diseases such as lung cancer, mesothelioma, cancer of the larynx and ovary and asbestosis (fibrosis of the lungs). For each life lost, a shattered family is left behind.

For more than a century, asbestos has been confirmed to cause suffering and deaths. The EPA has failed to protect public health and the environment by banning asbestos. Without a ban, asbestos remains lethal and legal today and can be found in consumer products, cosmetics, automotive products, and building materials.

The chlor-alkali industry is the primary asbestos importer and user of raw asbestos for the manufacturing of industrial chlorine and caustic soda. Knowing that there is no safe or controlled use, it’s incredulous that asbestos imports actually surged last year. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the chlor-alkali industry imported 750 metric tons of raw asbestos from Brazil and Russia.

The late Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) fought hard for meaningful chemical reform, and TSCA is on track to fail, again. The EPA’s present asbestos evaluation excludes the risk of asbestos in millions of homes, schools, and offices. Furthermore, industry-friendly rules like the “significant new use” rule (SNUR) is just another attempt to negate asbestos risk.

Trump has long been fascinated with asbestos, and said once on Twitter, “If we didn't remove incredibly powerful fire retardant asbestos & replace it with junk that doesn't work, the World Trade Center would never have burned down.”

Last summer, ADAO discovered that Uralasbest, a Russian asbestos company, placed a seal with Trump’s face on their product with the note ""Approved by Donald Trump, 45th President of the United States.""

In a court filing on Thursday, U.S. Attorney BJay Pak and lawyers from the civil rights division in Washington alerted a federal judge in Atlanta to recent Justice Department positions concerning the constitutional requirements for housing prisoners with serious mental illness.

The motion — called a “statement of interest” — was filed in a case that demands improved conditions at the South Fulton Municipal Regional Jail in Union City. The suit, filed in April, said mentally ill women are being held in isolation under horrific conditions that increase their risk of serious psychological harm.

It was filed on behalf of two women, identified as M.J. and K.H., and the Georgia Advocacy Office, which protects the rights of people with disabilities.

The Justice Department’s filing alerted U.S. District Court Judge Billy Ray to the civil rights division’s lengthy investigation of the Hampton Roads Regional Jail in Portsmouth, Va. That probe, concluded in December, found the jail failed to provide adequate medical and mental health care to inmates and that prisoners were unconstitutionally held in restrictive conditions for prolonged periods of time.

Atlanta lawyer Joe Whitley, a former U.S. attorney here, called the Justice Department’s entry into the Atlanta case a potentially significant development.

“This is not something they ordinarily would do,” Whitley said. “Apparently they’ve seen things that caused them concern. The role of the civil rights division and the Department of Justice is often necessary to assure that people who are confined are treated in a manner consistent with the Constitution.”

Sarah Geraghty, a lawyer for the Southern Center for Human Rights, welcomed the Justice Department’s interest in the case.

“The fact that it chose to weigh in shows the gravity of the human rights violations at issue,” said Geraghty, who represents the female inmates. “The conditions being challenged in this case are strikingly similar to those found to violate federal law at the Hampton Roads jail.”

Some of the mentally ill women at the Union City jail have been found incompetent to stand trial for their alleged offenses. M.J., for example, was arrested in October for criminal trespass while proselytizing at The Mall West End. The 20-year-old woman has been unable to post $500 bond.

The lawsuit against the Union City jail included graphic photos of unsanitary jail cells and detailed grim conditions for the women detainees. The conditions “can result in dramatic worsening of symptoms, decompensation, psychosis, self-mutilation and suicide,” the suit said.

Some inmates at the South Fulton Municipal Regional Jail use their issued bedding to soak up water that floods the cell floors, according to a federal lawsuit filed in April by the Georgia Advocacy Office and two women being held there. Inmates who use their bedding to clean up flooding are left with no sheets or blankets to sleep on, the lawsuit says. This image is included in the federal lawsuit.

In recent court filings, Fulton County attorneys say plaintiffs M.J. and K.H. and other inmates “present unique security concerns as a result of their psychiatric disabilities.”

“(Their) disruptive, if not violent, behavior and their significant hygiene concerns dictate that their time outside their cells must be limited,” the county said. “The penological interests of safety and security for M.J. and K.H. and their fellow inmates, the staff and the general public who visit the jail dictate the amount of time inmates spend in their cells.”

The county has asked Ray to dismiss the lawsuit and to deny an injunction sought by the plaintiffs’ lawyers that says the women inmates should be allowed to spend four hours a day outside their cells, including one hour of outdoor time.

In a recent court filing, the plaintiffs’ lawyers included a sworn statement by their forensic psychiatry expert, Jeffrey Metzner, a professor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.

The south Fulton Jail’s so-called mental health pods are essentially solitary confinement units that warehouse the female detainees, he said. “Such warehousing, in conditions of confinement that include very little out-of-cell time, results in many of these detainees’ mental illnesses either deteriorating or not improving despite such illnesses being very treatable in an appropriate setting.”
