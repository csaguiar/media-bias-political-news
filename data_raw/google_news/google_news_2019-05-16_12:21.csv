Former media mogul Conrad Black has been granted a full pardon by President Donald Trump for his prior conviction on counts of fraud and obstruction of justice, for which he spent more than three years in prison.

Black, a Trump supporter who wrote the fawning biography Donald J. Trump: A President Like No Other in 2018, once controlled Hollinger International, which at one point was the world’s third-largest English language newspaper company. Hollinger was the publisher of The Daily Telegraph (UK), Chicago Sun-Times (US), and The Jerusalem Post (Israel), as well as hundreds of smaller community newspapers.

But a complicated corporate controversy over some of the company’s assets saw Black found guilty in a Chicago court of diverting funds for personal benefit from money due to Hollinger International, as well as obstruction of justice.

He served nearly 42 months in Florida prison and was fined $125,000 as a result of the convictions. The Hollinger group was subsequently dismantled in a wave of criminal and civil lawsuits that followed. However, some contended Black had accurately predicted the decline of print media and tried to divest the company of those assets, saving shareholder value rather than manipulating for his own benefit.

The criminal violations in Black’s case were for removing 13 boxes of paperwork from his offices a few days before moving, and receiving $285,000 as a non-compete payment that was approved by an independent director and publicly disclosed, but never signed by the parties because of a secretarial error. The US Supreme Court overturned other charges of mail fraud and obstruction.

In a White House statement, Black was described as “an entrepreneur and scholar” who has a “distinguished reputation for helping others” and worked as a tutor in prison. “In light of these facts, Mr. Black is entirely deserving of this Grant of Executive Clemency,” the statement read.

The statement lauded Black as “the author of several notable biographies and works of history. These include comprehensive biographies of Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Richard M. Nixon, a complete history of Canada, and an impressive essay evaluating how the world would have been different had Japan not attacked Pearl Harbor.” It did not mention the Trump biography.

The release also cited character references from a diverse slate of supporters, including Dr. Henry A. Kissinger, Sir Elton John, Rush Limbaugh, and the late William F. Buckley, Jr.,"
Ex-FBI lawyer: Officials were 'quite worried' Comey appeared to be blackmailing Trump with dossier,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Joseph Wulfsohn', 'Joseph A. Wulfsohn Is A Media Reporter For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fbi-officials-were-quite-worried-comey-appeared-to-be-blackmailing-trump-with-dossier,"Former FBI general counsel James Baker said this week that he and other officials were ""quite worried"" that former FBI Director James Comey appeared to be blackmailing then President-elect Trump during a 2017 meeting regarding salacious allegations found in the Steele dossier.

On the latest episode of the Yahoo News podcast ""Skullduggery"" broadcast on Tuesday, Baker said he and others were so concerned about Comey briefing Trump on January 6, 2017 on Russia's interference in the election as well as the controversial dossier that ""analogies"" were made to J. Edgar Hoover, the former FBI director who famously abused his power to blackmail individuals.

""We were quite worried about the Hoover analogies, and we were determined not to have such a disaster happen on our watch,” Baker said, hoping to convey to the incoming president that they did not want to continue the ""legacy"" of Hoover's blackmailing.

Baker did not recall the moment he first heard about the Steele dossier but remembered the bureau taking it ""seriously"" and said that they were ""obligated to deal with it"" and determine whether or not anything about it was true, but insisted they didn't accept it ""as gospel."" He did, however, believe Trump had to be briefed on the dossier because it was ""about to be disclosed to the press.""

The former top FBI lawyer explained why he clashed with Comey over whether to tell Trump that he wasn't the subject of the Russia investigation. According to Baker, he argued that the then President-elect's activities ""fell into the category"" of being a subject and he didn't think it was ""accurate"" to say otherwise. By contrast, Comey repeatedly told Trump that the president was not under investigation before his dismissal in May 2017.

Nonetheless, Baker said he supported any investigation that is looking into the origins of the Russia probe.

“I welcome scrutiny,” Baker said. “I plan to fully cooperate with the department to help them figure out what happened. Because I believe what happened was lawful, at least based on every piece of information that I have.”"

An incumbent president with a middling approval rating and mounting controversies is usually an easy draw for primary challengers.

Look to Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush. All three presidents survived intraparty battles, but those primary fights left their reelection campaigns so hobbled — exposing longstanding weaknesses with their bases — that each went on to lose out on four more years in the White House.

But even if a viable GOP challenger to President Trump does emerge, it's unlikely he or she could make much headway or have a lasting impact on the president's chances in November. That's because Trump's firm grasp on the Republican Party could help him emerge not only victorious, but relatively unscathed by a primary challenge.

Political polarization is higher than ever, according to Princeton University professor of history and public affairs Julian Zelizer. And the slice of the electorate that likes Trump isn't budging, no matter what the president may say or do. Meanwhile, those who don't like him are resolute in their disdain, leaving a smaller block of persuadable voters than there were in previous elections.

""Trump has essentially remade the Republican Party in his image,"" said Zelizer. ""So many people aren't going to believe anything that the Mueller report says, and they take whatever Trump says as gospel. That just to me is another stumbling block that you probably didn't have in a post-Watergate era.""

In 1976, President Gerald Ford was already in a debilitated position. The Republican was an incumbent that had never been elected president (or even vice president) and was uniquely challenged in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal, President Richard Nixon's resignation and his own subsequent controversial pardon of Nixon. So it's not surprising former California Gov. Ronald Reagan mounted a near-upset bid against him.

During the primaries, momentum swung back and forth between the two GOP candidates. The first ballot of voting at the 1976 Republican National Convention was razor-thin: 1,187 delegates for Ford and 1,070 for Reagan, just a 117 vote difference. But Ford did narrowly clear the 1,130 delegates needed to secure the nomination. Such a fractious ending would prove prescient months later as he lost to former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter, netting 240 electoral votes to the Democrat's 297.

Four years later amid a sagging economy and the hostage crisis in Iran, Carter himself would be hamstrung as he sought a second term. Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy, whose brothers had both sought the presidency, saw an opening. But despite strong numbers at the outset of the primary, Kennedy would peter out as his personal scandals surfaced and Carter simply out-organized him. Their fight would continue through 1980 Democratic convention though, where Kennedy, having finished with just over a third of the primary votes, admitted he couldn't win.

The famous not-really-a-concession speech Kennedy gave at the New York City convention laid out his own idealistic vision rather than trying to boost Carter.

""For me, a few hours ago, this campaign came to an end,"" the political scion told the crowd. ""For all those whose cares have been our concern, the work goes on. The cause endures. The hope still lives. And the dream shall never die.""

As a result, it was Kennedy who got the raucous applause and seemed like the hero of the 1980 DNC, not the incumbent president who had actually won the nomination. Facing a renewed Reagan in the general election, Carter was walloped, winning just 49 electoral votes to the Republican's 489.

Perhaps it's President George H.W. Bush's re-election battle that best foreshadowed the era of Trump. The former vice president and CIA director saw sky high approval numbers in the aftermath of the Gulf War. But the economy would slow, giving conservative commentator Pat Buchanan a divide he could exploit by waging a bid based on fighting the ""culture wars.""

Buchanan would falter and end up taking less than a quarter of the primary vote away from Bush, and billionaire Ross Perot running as an independent in the general election also deeply harmed the incumbent's chances. But there was an anti-establishment vein within the GOP Buchanan may have helped awaken. It might have taken decades to fully manifest, but many saw Trump as the eventual embodiment of what Buchanan helped to shape.

History doesn't always repeat itself

Trump seems to have a stronghold on his party that no candidate can shake. As Barbara Perry, director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia's Miller Center put it, Trump has simply proven, time and time again, ""that all previous rules do not apply.""

""When we look back at the lessons of history, they may repeat themselves, but they haven't so far,"" Perry said. ""He may get a challenge by either a strong gadfly or a strong personality or a strong presence in the party,"" just as Ronald Reagan was to Ford in 1976 and Ted Kennedy was to Carter in 1980. ""But I don't see that person on the horizon.""

There are some possible challengers emerging to Trump, but Perry is right that less than nine months before the nominating process begins, no Republican has stood out as a formidable alternative.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld is the only major announced candidate so far after running for vice president on the Libertarian Party ticket in 2016 along with former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson. But Weld certainly doesn't seem to have the heft of past White House challengers that could irrevocably damage a sitting president.

Some of the potential heavyweights who are still mulling bids include former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who also sought the GOP nomination last time, and popular centrist Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who's already made some early state moves.

Frequent Trump agitators like former Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake and former Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker were also floated early on. Flake has since ruled out a 2020 run, but the recently retired Corker still sounds open, saying recently that Trump ""purposely seeks to divide"" the American people and someone should challenge him.

""Philosophically, you could look at it and say that it would be a good thing for our country should that occur,"" Corker said during the TIME 100 Summit last month. ""If you had a real primary, where you had someone that was really being listened to, and of substance, things that we were talking about — and I could go through a list of them — they would actually be debated in a real way.""

There might once have been other names on that list — prominent 2016 doubters like South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham or former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. Despite their blistering criticism almost four years ago toward the polarizing reality TV show host and businessman, they too have come around and been loyal allies of Trump in the case of Graham, or a onetime part of his administration, with Haley serving as UN ambassador until last year.

The president's poll numbers reflect the waning influence of the once vocal critics may have had within the party — winning over converts, even if he may have polarized more independent voters.

The most recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey shows a staggering 90 percent of Republicans approve of the job Trump has done, leaving little room for a challenger to grab a foothold. And for now, there's no GOP option who seems like they could truly compete with Trump, given the unprecedented way he has tried to centralize the Republican National Committee around his re-election bid and ward off a primary challenge.

Tribalism is a force that Corker also lamented, saying at the TIME event that Trump ""has an unusually visceral contact with the Republican base as it's made up today... That's in some ways where the electorate is today, where it has become very tribal in nature."""

A massive GOP backlash toward Intelligence Chair Richard Burr followed. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo congress GOP sees end of Russia probe after Don Jr. subpoena fight fizzles Senate Republicans are eager to put the embarrassing intraparty fight behind them.

Senate Republicans can finally see the finish line on the Russia investigations.



With Donald Trump Jr. agreeing to an interview with the Senate Intelligence Committee after a brief but explosive fight over Chairman Richard Burr’s subpoena, Republicans see the committee’s two-year bipartisan investigation into Russian interference winding down.



“We’re near the end,” Burr (R-N.C.) said in a brief interview. “The first iteration of the report is out for declassification right now. I can’t tell you how long that takes. I’m hopeful we’ll push that out in a couple weeks.”

Those words are sure to come as a relief to Senate Republicans.

“It should be the end of it. It better be the end of it,” said Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.). A conclusion after the Trump Jr. subpoena battle is “appropriate, it’s clean. It maybe even restores some confidence in the process.”

The Senate Intelligence Committee’s probe has at times created an awkward dynamic between the GOP and the White House, and Republicans are eager to see it come to a close. That would leave House Democrats as the only remaining investigators — which would help Republicans paint the continued scrutiny as a partisan exercise meant to harm Trump.

“I would expect that a lot of the Democrats wish that [Trump Jr.] hadn’t come because they’d rather keep the narrative alive. It’s going to end this narrative. Done,"" said Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), who is up for re-election in 2020 and faces a conservative primary challenger. Tillis backed Burr's work as chairman but said he disagreed with the subpoena.

""We need to get over it,” Tillis said. “So this produces closure on this side and we can just watch the circus on the other side of the Hill.”

Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee have emphasized that their investigation into alleged Russian interference is about oversight and vastly different than special counsel Robert Mueller’s deep dive into potential criminal conspiracy between Trump’s campaign and the Kremlin along with obstruction of justice by the president.

The Senate investigation, led by Burr and Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner (D-Va.), has remained largely bipartisan, a stark contrast to the one from the House Intelligence panel previously led by Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) or House Democrats’ new wave of probes.

Yet over the past week the tension between Burr and many of his GOP colleagues became the main story. Shortly after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s “case closed” speech on the Senate floor, the Trump Jr. subpoena became public and created a massive GOP backlash toward Burr. But the chairman stood firm, grinning while he roamed the Senate and refusing to comment on the criticism.

Now that the GOP infighting has passed and Trump Jr. has agreed to come back for a final round of closed-door questioning, senators say the investigation is likely almost over with findings set to be unveiled in a bipartisan manner.

“The Senate Intel Committee worked very hard to keep this as non-partisan as possible” said Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), a former Intelligence Committee member. “That’s a positive thing if they can get all the way to the end.”

Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) added he doesn’t think “there’s any doubt you’re at the end.” Earlier this week, when it was unclear whether Trump Jr. would comply with the subpoena, some were preparing for the possibility that the Senate would have to vote on enforcing compliance — putting Republicans in the tough position of either siding with Trump or their Senate colleague. Grassley said the Senate is “better off” not having to do that.

Yet not everyone is satisfied. Sen. Rand Paul is frustrated that Burr hasn’t already closed shop.

“I don’t think it’s wise of the committee nor Republicans to keep beating a dead horse,” the Kentucky Republican said.



Democrats said Wednesday that Trump Jr.’s appearance before the panel was a positive development, but they were quick to dismiss Republican calls to move on.

“The Republicans declared it was over before it even started, so I don’t even pay any attention to that. They’re just trying to spin it in the same way that [Attorney General William Barr] tried to spin the Mueller report,” said Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), who added that there are still outstanding law enforcement investigations that are nonpartisan.

Although the Senate is disengaging, the House’s battle with Trump over the Mueller report and its explosive evidence of potential obstruction of justice is only beginning.

House Democrats have launched a series of investigations into the administration and have called on the Justice Department to provide the unredacted version of the report. They’re demanding that Mueller testify and the House Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed former White House counsel Don McGahn, a key witness in the Mueller probe.

Trump, meanwhile, is rejecting all Democratic oversight requests. The White House sent a letter Wednesday to House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) accusing him of harassing the president in response to the committee’s wide-ranging probe on potential corruption and obstruction of justice.

The move is unlikely to halt Nadler’s inquiries.





“They say the Justice Department can’t hold him accountable since a sitting president cannot be indicted and now they’re saying that Congress cannot hold a president accountable,” Nadler said in response. “The American people ought to be astonished by a claim by the White House that the president cannot be held accountable, that he’s above the law, that he is in fact a dictator.”

Republicans are more than happy to change the subject, not wanting to get tied in any way to the probes into Trump. That’s especially true for those who are up for reelection and eager to cultivate Trump’s supporters.

If the Senate Intelligence Committee’s bipartisan investigation is indeed ending, Republicans insist that remaining congressional investigations into Trump — all in the House — will be viewed as pure politics.

“Now the Mueller report is concluded, there’s not much else for us to do other than I think sort of wrap it up,” said John Cornyn (R-Texas), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. “I understand the political temptation for our Democratic friends is they’re never going to want this to end. But I don’t think there’s much justification for continuing on much longer.”"
House Democrats fall in line with Pelosi’s no-impeachment strategy despite Trump’s defiance,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Rachael Bade', 'Congressional Reporter', 'Mike Debonis', 'Congressional Reporter Covering The House Of Representatives', 'May At Pm']",05-15-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-democrats-fall-in-line-with-pelosis-no-impeachment-strategydespite-trumps-defiance/2019/05/15/ce888e1a-7725-11e9-b3f5-5673edf2d127_story.html,"President Trump, who is refusing to cooperate with more than 20 congressional investigations, instructed current and former aides Wednesday to ignore a House committee’s request for documents in the latest act of defiance that has prompted Democrats to declare that the nation is facing a constitutional crisis.

But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told Democrats in a closed-door caucus meeting Wednesday morning to stick to their policy agenda ahead of the 2020 election rather than initiate impeachment proceedings. And not a single lawmaker challenged her, according to a person in the room who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private meeting.

The events underscored that Pelosi has managed to hold the line on her no-impeachment stance despite Trump’s ongoing resistance and relentless liberal pressure for Democrats to try to oust the Republican president. Most notably, she has quelled an internal clamor and kept even the most vocal impeachment proponents and eager investigators in check as Democrats increasingly look to the courts to settle the fight between Congress and the chief executive.

In the nearly hour-long session heavily focused on health care, Pelosi was the only one to bring up impeachment, acknowledging that some Democrats are complaining.

“Why aren’t we impeaching the president?” she said, parroting their words. “Why aren’t we impeaching him? They get a little down,” she said of frustrated members of her party.

“The point is that we need to show [voters] that we are doing all of these other things that they care about so much,” Pelosi said. Not a single lawmaker in the room protested.

In the latest example of the president’s resistance, the White House told House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) that it was refusing a broad demand for records and testimony sent to 81 Trump allies and affiliated companies.

In his letter, White House counsel Pat Cipollone repeated a claim the White House and Trump’s business have begun making — that Congress is not a law enforcement body and does not have a legitimate purpose to investigate the questions it is pursuing.

[No ‘do-over’ on Mueller probe, White House lawyer tells House panel, saying demands for records, staff testimony will be refused]

Before the White House letter, Nadler seemed to walk a fine line on impeachment during a CNBC interview, saying Trump is making it “increasingly difficult” to avoid it but also arguing that the House is probably not headed in that direction.

“It depends on what comes out,” Nadler said. “It depends where the American people are, whether they want to go that way or not. I don’t want to make it sound as if we’re heading for impeachment. Probably we’re not.”

Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week”: “We are already a bitterly divided country, and an impeachment process will divide us further.”

Democrats have issued numerous subpoenas in their investigations as they seek documents and witnesses related to Trump’s businesses, his tax returns and details on administration policies. The president and senior officials have refused to comply.

Lawmakers are also seeking the unredacted version of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election and the underlying evidence to determine whether they should impeach Trump. But the Justice Department has refused to relinquish much of that information, despite a congressional subpoena.

For Democrats, their hopes rest with the courts. Nadler told reporters Wednesday that he would issue subpoenas for any information he needs that the White House is blocking — then take the matter to court after a series of contempt votes if they refuse.

But House Democratic leaders have yet to schedule a vote for the first package of contempt resolutions, including one for Attorney General William P. Barr. House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) told reporters that a full House vote on Barr’s contempt citation, approved by the Judiciary Committee last week, and any others wouldn’t occur until next month at the earliest.

That would set up a future lawsuit — perhaps weeks or months later — to enforce the contempt citations in the federal courts.

“This case may take some time, but ultimately I think the courts will . . . rule on behalf of the Congress of the United States and its legitimate constitutional capacity to oversee the executive branch,” Hoyer said.

[Trump asserts executive privilege over Mueller report; House panel holds Barr in contempt]

On Tuesday, a federal judge gave Pelosi allies hope that the courts would come to their rescue, expressing skepticism about a Trump move to quash a congressional subpoena and promising to fast-track the case to deliver a quick verdict.

“I would like to thank the president for helping our court case immensely,” said Rep. Ted Lieu, a California Democrat on the Judiciary Committee and member of Pelosi’s leadership team. Asked whether it was time to impeach Trump, Lieu responded: “Not there yet. I think we would try a court case first.”

Ironically, Democratic investigators could benefit from starting impeachment proceedings, legal experts argue, because they would have a greater chance of getting some of the documents.

Democrats’ falling in line despite their anger toward the president is yet another reminder of Pelosi’s hold on her caucus, power Trump often tells associates he admires. Lawmakers say they ­either trust her political instincts or are privately afraid of incurring her wrath.

Even the most impassioned impeachment backers such as Reps. Al Green (D-Tex.) and Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) have declined to organize against or lobby Pelosi to reconsider. Not one has taken her on by name to increase public pressure for impeachment.

“For the speaker, as a leader of the caucus, she has to consider a lot more than I do, and we would expect her to do that — that’s why she is the leader and the speaker,” said Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.), a former police officer who wants to start impeachment proceedings but had only good things to say about Pelosi’s strategy. “And I think she will get to the place, in a very strategic way, that we need her to get to. I trust her judgment.”

It’s a turnabout for Pelosi. She put down an uprising after the 2018 election as a group of rebels tried to deny her a second stint as speaker. But since then, particularly after Pelosi steered her party through a 35-day government shutdown fight with Trump, rank-and-file members have deferred to her on issues such as impeachment.

Only billionaire Democratic donor Tom Steyer has dared to challenge Pelosi directly on impeachment, but even then he has done so carefully. This week, Steyer name-checked Pelosi on social media and wrote a San Francisco Chronicle op-ed arguing that Democratic leadership was making a mistake by refusing to impeach Trump.

“Speaker Pelosi and conventional wisdom are wrong,” Steyer wrote on Facebook on Monday. “Impeachment — in addition to being the right thing to do — is also good politics for Democrats.”

Still, even Steyer has refrained from hosting an impeachment town hall in the San Francisco area. His group “Need to Impeach” has hosted town halls in the districts of Democratic chairmen.

Still, not every Democrat is content with Pelosi’s strategy.

House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raúl M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.) said that “at some point, as every committee gets stonewalled . . . the case for impeachment as a mechanism to get what we need . . . gets stronger and stronger.”

Asked whether he thinks Pelosi will support impeachment eventually, Grijalva replied: “I think a lot of people are going to have to reconcile themselves to that.”

Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a liberal, said Pelosi has been clear that she needs to see public support for such an effort before she moves ahead, especially with Republicans controlling the Senate and insisting Democrats should stop investigating the president.

“I think she’s left the door open, but she’s not going to lead an effort which doesn't have the significant majority of the Congress behind it,” Khanna said.

Khanna scoffed at the prospect of anyone trying to push Pelosi into it: “People have been betting against Nancy Pelosi on losing the trust of the caucus for 20 years, and they always tend to be wrong.

Democrats, in the meantime, plan to take turns Thursday reading the redacted, 448-page Mueller report.

Shortly after President Donald Trump announced plans to yank U.S. troops out of Syria last December, a group of lawmakers came to the White House to talk him out of the idea, which critics called a threat to national security.

Trump responded by calling in the man who oversees his Twitter account.

Story Continued Below

“Get Dan Scavino in here,” Trump called out in the middle of the meeting earlier this year. In walked a man in his early forties with close-cropped brown hair.

“Tell them how popular my policy is,” Trump instructed Scavino, who, according to two people with knowledge of the exchange, proceeded to walk lawmakers through the positive reaction he had picked up on social media about Trump’s Syria decision.

The sudden pivot from geostrategy to retweets and likes surprised the lawmakers. It was a remarkable moment given that not long ago Scavino was managing Trump’s golf club. But for Scavino himself, it was just another day on the job.

With few allies left in the West Wing, Trump frequently leans on his unassuming social media guru for affirmation and advice about how his most sensitive policies will be received, according to interviews with more than two dozen current and former White House officials, and others close to the president.

Scavino met Trump as a 16-year-old golf caddie and has spent much of his adult life by his side. Today he sits just feet from the Oval Office and is present at most meetings, tapping away on his laptop in the background. He has joined Trump on trips to Saudi Arabia, Argentina and other far-flung destinations.

And officials say he talks to the president more than just about anybody else aside from Trump’s own family members, ping-ponging in and out of the Oval sometimes more than a half-dozen times a day. Aides wanting a read on Trump’s mood often check in with Scavino, who can be counted on to know.

To admirers, Scavino is a social media pioneer who fine-tunes Trump’s critical bond with his supporters. To critics, he is a yes-man and enabler who has no business working in the White House. As he did in the meeting about Syria, Scavino routinely provides rationalizations or justifications for the president’s most controversial policy directives, from his attacks on NFL players to his hard line on immigration — moves that Scavino has told the president thrill the #MAGA warriors on Twitter.

One thing everyone agrees on is that Scavino is a survivor — somebody who has become one of Trump’s closest confidants inside a White House from which nearly all of Trump’s original staff have departed.

As Trump embarks on his reelection campaign, Scavino is the last of four completely trusted original insiders currently still at his side. Gone are his former bodyguard and sidekick Keith Schiller; communications director Hope Hicks; and body man John McEntee.

But most important is his role as caretaker of Trump’s explosive Twitter feed, which both rallies the president’s supporters and drives Washington’s daily news cycles.

In an interview with POLITICO, Trump acknowledged that Scavino plays a key role in shaping the tweets he can fire off by the dozens each day.

“Oftentimes, I’ll go through Dan,” Trump said. “You know, I’ll talk it over. And he can really be a very good sounding board. A lot of common sense. He’s got a good grasp.”

He also called Scavino indispensable as his social media chief during the 2016 campaign and touted him as a key asset for 2020.

“When I was running, I knew that Hillary had 28 people — and I had Dan. ... They used to say that we ran an unsophisticated campaign. And after we won, they said we ran one of the most sophisticated campaigns ever,” Trump said.

Scavino holds what would be a second-tier job in any other administration. But in Trump’s world it comes with the top White House salary of $179,700, coveted assistant to the president status and, as of last month, an upgraded title: senior advisor for digital strategy.

The president has cycled through five communications directors since taking office, including the recently-departed former Fox News executive Bill Shine, and has finally concluded he doesn’t need one, according to associates. He has himself — and Scavino.

“He is essentially the comms department of the White House,” said Steve Bannon, Trump’s former chief strategist.

Scavino acts first and foremost as Trump’s validator — adopting what one official called a “let Trump be Trump” approach that now defines a White House from which a series of officials who sought to rein Trump in have been pushed out. One former White House official joked that he creates a “safe space” around the president.

But Trump’s critics worry the president isn’t well-served by Scavino’s positive reinforcement and that using social media metrics to influence weighty policy decisions is dangerous.

Trump “has this interest in data, but it’s Trumpian data, which means it’s a little bit of cotton candy and it’s not grounded in reality,” said Trump biographer Tim O’Brien. “Politicians have been using polls for decades to gauge policies, but Twitter followers have nothing at all to do with whether his Syria policy is popular.” (Trump eventually backtracked on his plans to withdraw all U.S. troops from Syria. The administration decided to leave 400 troops in the country.)

Some who have witnessed Scavino’s interactions with the president up close say he is constantly reassuring Trump and regaling him with data points about how beloved he is. One person said he witnessed Scavino dismissing the string of tell-all books about the White House that infuriated the president, including Michael Wolff’s “Fire and Fury.”

“It’s this overt gushing to the president,” a former White House official said, adding that he recalls thinking, “Is Dan serious? Does he really feel that way?”

Yet it’s Scavino’s validation of the president that gives him influence. During his frequent visits to the Oval Office, conversations with the president on Air Force One or pull-asides in the president’s private study, Trump asks Scavino’s feedback on a range of subjects, pressing him about how his tweets are playing, whether his policies are popular and what he thinks about potential administration hires, aides said.

Trump, in the interview with POLITICO, downplayed his influence on policy. “I don’t think Dan wants too much to get involved with policy,” he said.

It’s a remarkable rise for the New York native who met Trump as a teenage caddie and became general manager of Trump’s golf club in Westchester County, New York before volunteering for his 2016 campaign.

Exactly how Trump’s tweets get made is a closely held secret inside the White House. But White House officials and even the president himself acknowledge that Scavino’s fingerprints can be found all over Trump’s feed.

Asked directly if Scavino helps write his tweets, Trump said, “Generally, I’ll do my tweets myself,” but he allowed that his aide helps shape his missives “on occasion.”

Scavino — who regularly monitors Reddit, with a particular focus on the pro-Trump /r/The_Donald channel — has helped craft some of Trump’s most memorable social media moments.

It was Scavino who devised the “Game of Thrones”-themed motif that has repeatedly appeared in White House messaging in recent months, including a presidential tweet aimed at Iran last fall that featured an image of Trump with the words “Sanctions are Coming.”

He also worked with Trump to pre-plan one of the president’s first public responses to the release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report, according to two administration officials. The April 18 tweet, timed to post minutes after Attorney General Bill Barr wrapped up his press conference about the report, declared: “No collusion. No obstruction. For the haters and the radical left Democrats — Game Over.”

That tweet also borrowed its font from the hit HBO series — never mind that the network objected in a statement last November that it “would prefer our trademark not be misappropriated for political purposes.”

White House officials have repeated the “game over” message for weeks, insisting that it’s time for Democrats and the media to move on.

“He has a knack for phrasing things in a way that can drive news cycles,” said White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. “Corporations pay people millions of dollars to break through on social media like that.”

While Trump used to dictate many of his tweets to Scavino, who would post them on his behalf, the president has grown more accustomed to tweeting unilaterally from his own account. When he does dictate his tweets to Scavino, the president is particular about exactly how they should be written, specifying capitalization and punctuation, White House officials said. The result is a sometimes-confounding presidential style guide in which the first letter of words like “collusion” and “witch hunt” are almost always capitalized.

The White House has created a separate review process for tweets that don’t originate from Trump or Scavino. Staffers propose a tweet, circulate it for feedback and then send it to Scavino, who sometimes “Trumps it up” before getting the president’s approval, according to a former White House official. Scavino has spent so much time around the president that he is an expert mimic of Trump’s speech patterns and predilections.

“He does a better a job at channeling Trump than anyone,” another former White House official said. (Sometimes, tweets deemed too hot even for Trump’s feed are posted on Scavino’s personal account.)

The pressure of being Trump’s messenger can sometimes be intense. Last March, Trump dictated a tweet to Scavino saying that then-national security adviser HR McMaster was leaving the White House. But before sending it out, Scavino scrambled to make sure aides knew the tweet was imminent, according to a former White House official.

At the start of Trump’s presidency, White House officials took much greater pains to contain his rapid-fire tweeting. Scavino would present Trump with several draft tweets to choose from every morning that would allow Trump ""a release valve,"" according to a person close to the president. The president circled the tweets he liked, and Scavino would send out the ones that he picked.

That setup didn’t last long, this person said. Trump ""wasn’t feeling the actual euphoria of typing the tweet himself and … then within 15 seconds seeing it blasted on one of the cable shows.”

Scavino maintains his strong relationship with Trump and many senior officials in the White House by maintaining a low profile and keeping to himself — staying notably above the backstabbing, mistrustful White House fray. One former White House official called him the “least jazzy person” in the Trump orbit. More often than not, Scavino can be found in his office, on his laptop with headphones in his ears, White House officials said.

Scavino is also admired for his aversion to talking to reporters. He declined interview requests for this story.

“He’s somebody who the president knows has no personal motivation. He’s not doing this for himself,” said Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser.

Even so, Scavino has developed a following among tech-savvy Trump supporters online, especially in the pro-Trump corners of Reddit, where his tweets and videos often catch fire.

Scavino’s own Twitter account, which has more than 368,000 followers, has become a home for the many behind-the-scenes videos and photos that Scavino takes on his travels alongside Trump, which often give him a better vantage point than journalists.

His personal Twitter feed also displays a combative, populist sensibility virtually indistinguishable from Trump’s. When the president was feuding with MSNBC hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski in 2017, Scavino tweeted, “#DumbAsARockMika and lover #JealousJoe are lost, confused & saddened since @POTUS @realDonaldTrump stopped returning their calls! Unhinged.”

He has also unwittingly exposed his inexperience in politics and government, including in a 2017 tweet about a potential Trump visit to “Palestine.”

In his interview with POLITICO, Trump dismissed persistent rumors that Scavino might leave the White House.

“I would hope he’ll stay for another six years and maybe another four after that and then another four after that,” Trump said, adding that he only jokes about extending his term to drive the media crazy.

Trump often asks Scavino to tell visitors how many followers he has on social media — insisting that his aide tally followers across Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and other platforms, instead of just Twitter, where former President Barack Obama dwarfs Trump’s follower count of 60 million by more than 45 million.

“How many people do I have?” Trump asked Scavino during the Syria meeting earlier this year with lawmakers, referring to his follower count.

Aides say Trump regularly complains about losing followers in what he suspects is politically-motivated censorship of conservatives — but which Twitter attributes to a recent crackdown on spam accounts.

Trump confronted Twitter’s CEO Jack Dorsey about the matter in an Oval Office meeting last month. Seated beside Dorsey was Dan Scavino."
"China's Huawei, 70 affiliates placed on U.S. trade blacklist",https://www.reuters.com,"['David Shepardson', 'Min Read']",05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-huaweitech/chinas-huawei-70-affiliates-placed-on-us-trade-blacklist-idUSKCN1SL2W4,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department said on Wednesday it is adding Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and 70 affiliates to its so-called “Entity List” - a move that bans the telecom giant from buying parts and components from U.S. companies without U.S. government approval.

FILE PHOTO: The Logo of Huawei is seen at its showroom in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China March 29, 2019. REUTERS/Tyrone Siu/File Photo

U.S. officials told Reuters the decision would also make it difficult if not impossible for Huawei, the largest telecommunications equipment producer in the world, to sell some products because of its reliance on U.S. suppliers.

Under the order that will take effect in the coming days, Huawei will need a U.S. government license to buy American technology. Huawei did not immediately comment.

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement President Donald Trump backed the decision that will “prevent American technology from being used by foreign owned entities in ways that potentially undermine U.S. national security or foreign policy interests.”

The dramatic move comes as the Trump administration has aggressively lobbied other countries not to use Huawei equipment in next-generation 5G networks and comes just days after the Trump administration imposed new tariffs on Chinese goods amid an escalating trade war.

The Commerce Department said the move comes after the U.S. Justice Department unsealed an indictment in January of Huawei and some entities that said the company had conspired to provide prohibited financial services to Iran. The department said it has a reasonable basis to conclude that Huawei is “engaged in activities that are contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interest.”

Huawei reported first-quarter revenue of $27 billion last month and said it had shipped 59 million smartphones in the first quarter.

In March 2016, the Commerce Department added ZTE Corp to the entity list over allegations it organized an elaborate scheme to hide its re-export of U.S. items to sanctioned countries in violation of U.S. law.

The restrictions prevented suppliers from providing ZTE with U.S. equipment, potentially freezing the Huawei rival’s supply chain, but they were short-lived. The U.S. suspended the restrictions in a series of temporary reprieves, allowing the company to maintain ties to U.S. suppliers until it agreed to a plea deal a year later.

In August, Trump signed a bill that barred the U.S. government itself from using equipment from Huawei and ZTE.

Senator Ben Sasse, a Republican, said “Huawei’s supply chain depends on contracts with American companies” and he urged the Commerce Department to look “at how we can effectively disrupt our adversary.”"
"Dispute erupts over whether Brennan, Comey pushed Steele dossier, as DOJ probe into misconduct begins",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dispute-erupts-over-whether-brennan-comey-pushed-steele-dossier-as-doj-probe-into-misconduct-begins,"A high-level dispute over which senior government officials pushed the unverified Steele dossier amid efforts to surveil the Trump campaign has broken out into the open again, after it emerged that Attorney General William Barr appointed a U.S. attorney to examine the origins of the Russia investigation and determine if the FBI and DOJ's actions were ""lawful and appropriate.""

Sources familiar with the records told Fox News that a late-2016 email chain indicated then-FBI Director James Comey told bureau subordinates that then-CIA Director John Brennan insisted the dossier be included in the intelligence community assessment on Russian interference, known as the ICA.

Fox News was told that the email chain – not yet public -- referred to the dossier as ""crown material,"" but it was not clear why this apparent code was used. On Tuesday night, former GOP Rep. Trey Gowdy said on Fox News' ""The Story with Martha MacCallum"" that ""Comey has a better argument than Brennan, based on what I've seen.""

A day earlier, Gowdy told Fox News, ""Whoever is looking into this, tell them to look into emails"" from December 2016 involving Brennan and Comey. Gowdy, who is now a Fox News contributor, said his assessment was based on sensitive Russia records he reviewed as then-chairman of the Republican-led House Oversight Committee.

But in a statement to Fox News, a former CIA official put the blame squarely on Comey.

""Former Director Brennan, along with former [Director of National Intelligence] James Clapper, are the ones who opposed James Comey’s recommendation that the Steele Dossier be included in the intelligence report,"" the official said.

""They opposed this because the dossier was in no way used to develop the ICA,"" the official continued. ""The intelligence analysts didn't include it when they were doing their work because it wasn't corroborated intelligence, therefore it wasn't used and it wasn't included. Brennan and Clapper prevented it from being added into the official assessment. James Comey then decided on his own to brief Trump about the document.""

Fox News has reached out to Comey's legal team twice, and provided the statement from the former CIA official, but did not receive a reply on the record.

In March, Republican Sen. Rand Paul leveled similar allegations on Twitter, citing a ""high-level source"" who said Brennan had ""insisted that the unverified and fake Steele dossier"" be included in the January 2017 ICA.

FOX NEWS EXCLUSIVE: INTERNAL FBI TEXTS SHOW DOJ WARNED FBI OF 'BIAS' IN KEY FISA SOURCE -- BUT FBI PRESSED ON

Clapper previously testified that the dossier was not ultimately used in the ICA. News that Comey had briefed Trump personally on the dossier before the inauguration -- purportedly to warn him of potential blackmail threats -- leaked within days and opened the door for media outlets to publicize the dossier's lurid claims.

Whether the FBI acted appropriately in obtaining the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant to Trump campaign aide Carter Page is now the subject not only of U.S. Attorney John Durham's new probe, but also the ongoing review by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz. U.S. Attorney for Utah John Huber has been conducting his own investigation separately, although details of his progress were unclear.

As one example, in its FISA application, the bureau repeatedly and incorrectly assured the court in a footnote that it ""does not believe"" British ex-spy Christopher Steele was the direct source for a Yahoo News article implicating Page in Russian collusion, and instead asserted that the Yahoo article provided an independent basis to believe Steele.

Steele has told a British court that he briefed multiple news organizations during the fall of 2016 -- including Yahoo News.

Gowdy's remarks echoed Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who told Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" this past weekend that he was pushing to declassify documents that would expose the FBI's poor efforts to corroborate the dossier.



""There's a document that's classified that I'm gonna try to get unclassified that takes the dossier -- all the pages of it -- and it has verification to one side,"" Graham said. ""There really is no verification, other than media reports that were generated by reporters that received the dossier.""

Graham cited a report from The Hill's John Solomon that the FBI was told expressly that Steele, the bureau's confidential informant, had admitted to a State Department contact he was ""keen"" to leak his discredited dossier for purposes of influencing the 2016 election.

Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec’s written account of her meeting with Steele on Oct. 11, 2016, was sent to the FBI prior to the bureau's FISA warrant application to monitor Page, according to records unearthed in a transparency lawsuit by Citizens United.

Opinion | The Fight Over How Trump Fits in With the Other 44 Presidents,https://www.nytimes.com,['Thomas B. Edsall'],05-15-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/opinion/trump-history-presidents.html,"I raised the question with Steven Levitsky, a political scientist at Harvard who wrote the book “How Democracies Die” with his government department colleague Daniel Ziblatt.

Levitsky, responding to my emailed query, wrote:

There may well be something to the claim that Trump’s is a disjunctive presidency representing the end of the Reagan era. But to jump from there to the conclusion that he does not pose a serious threat to democratic institutions strikes me as facile. Such a claim too easily sets aside important contextual differences between this administration and those of other “disjunctive” presidents.

Levitsky provided a long list of contemporary factors that distinguish the Trump presidency from the Hoover and Carter presidencies, including

extreme partisan polarization along overlapping social/cultural/cleavages, the hardening of partisan identities and the rise of intense negative partisanship, the crystallization of white identities and the perception among some white voters of threat in the face of decades of immigration and steps toward racial equality; dramatically higher levels of income inequality and declining social mobility; the weakening of party elites’ gatekeeping capacity, reinforced by the introduction of party primaries, and, in the context of extreme polarization, the erosion of key democratic norms.

Levitsky’s argument goes beyond the overarching political environment to Trump’s character.

Trump “has shown himself,” Levitsky continued,

to be a more openly autocratic figure than any of the other disjunctive president I am aware of. So we have a president with authoritarian instincts in a context of extreme partisan polarization (such that Republicans line up behind Trump no matter what) and weakened norms. That strikes me as quite a bit different — and more threatening — than say, the Carter presidency.

In addition, Trump must be viewed as the avatar not only of an American political phenomenon but a global one.

Levitsky argues that the “disjunctive presidency” theory

lacks any comparative or global perspective. There are changes occurring globally that have unleashed illiberal or populist right wing reactions across much of the industrialized West. Whether it is globalization, migration and ethnic diversification, technological change, or some combination thereof, at least some of the dynamics that are occurring in the US cannot be understood in a vacuum. It would therefore be silly to assume that the context in which we are operating in 2019 is easily comparable to those of 1924-28 or 1976-80.

Ziblatt, Levitsky’s co-author, argued in an email that it is a highly risky proposition to take any comfort in a theoretical construct placing Trump as the endpoint of the Reagan era:

It is very, very dangerous way to feel reassured and to write off the Trump presidency as the final, dying days of the Reagan era. There are certainly analogies to be drawn from earlier eras but it is only an analogy, not a law of history.

Trump stands apart from past presidents in his willingness to capitalize on what Ziblatt identifies as an “existential fear” among voters in the face of broad demographic change:

The huge demographic changes underway in the U.S. since the 1970s have prompted Republican existential fear about the future and an increasingly stiff resistance to democracy itself. Like Conservatives in Europe before 1914 or Southern Democrats in the 1890s, fear of the future means a greater willingness to play dirty and to block the emergence of any “recuperative presidency.”

Theda Skocpol, professor of government and sociology at Harvard, sharply criticized the Skowronek-Balkin theory because it masks what she contends is a fundamentally different and dangerous moment in American politics:

We are in a very extreme period in U.S. political history because of the radicalization of the GOP and the apparent willingness of virtually all of its officeholders, candidates, and big donors to go along with authoritarian and anti-democratic measures of many kinds, not just presidential power grabs but legislative and judicial steps to curtail voting and organizational rights of opponents, in essence rigging future electoral contests in a very minority rule direction.

Skocpol warned of “mechanistic over-optimism,” writing that “things will look very different if Trump is re-elected, as he may very well be.” The current state of politics “is no ordinary cyclical turn,” she notes. “I would rank this period as one of the most conflictual since the late 1960s and early 1930s and the one with the greatest potential for actual regime change since the Civil War.”

There are some political scientists who generally agree with the Skowronek theory of cyclical regime change but who raise concerns about how well Trump fits into that analytic structure.

Julia Azari, a political scientist at Marquette University, poses a basic question about attempts to place Trump within a repetitive historical context:

We have both a president who is distinct in history and an era in political time that differs from previous ones in important structural ways. This combination points to the limits of history as a clear set of instructions for what might happen next.

In an email, Azari wrote that

the overall dynamics of party competition have changed in part because, for the first time in US history as far as I can tell, race and immigration are sorted between the two parties.

In the case of Trump, Azari points out that

Presidents who violate norms, especially those about the boundaries of their power, tend to be reconstructive presidents who reset the terms of debate and the expectations for the presidency — FDR and Jackson are perhaps the clearest examples of this.

Trump, in this context, is more like a reconstructive president than a disjunctive president:

Trump has also changed the language and, I think to some degree altered the identity and agenda of the Republican Party — and of the Democrats, who are responding to him. Trump has altered how we use political language — we all use adapted Trumpisms all the time, like make X great again or a riff on “build the wall."" He looms large in politics and in culture. This is not a typical disjunctive trajectory.

Azari was a student of Skowronek’s at Yale and believes his cyclical theory of regime change remains “incredibly useful for looking at politics.”

Both Azari and Skowronek acknowledge, however, that something that does not fit the theory of regime change may be taking place in American politics."
China sells most U.S. Treasuries in nearly two-and-a-half years,https://www.reuters.com,"['Richard Leong', 'Min Read']",05-15-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-treasury-securities/china-sells-most-us-treasuries-in-nearly-two-and-a-half-years-idUSKCN1SL2U4,"(Reuters) - China sold the most U.S. Treasuries in almost 2-1/2 years in March amid uncertainty about a trade deal between Beijing and Washington, data from the U.S. Treasury Department released on Wednesday showed.

Since last week after a dismal 10-year Treasury auction, there has been renewed speculation whether China may sell its U.S. debt in retaliation for increased tariffs on $200 billion of its exports to the United States.

The latest data on China’s U.S. bond holding were collected before a sudden breakdown in trade talks between the world’s two biggest economic powers 1-1/2 weeks ago and prior to the U.S. duty hike on Chinese goods, which went into effect on Friday.

China sold $20.45 billion in Treasuries in March, the most since October 2016, following $1.08 billion in purchases the month before.

China’s stake in Treasuries fell for the first time in four months to $1.121 trillion in March, which was the lowest since May 2017 when it was $1.102 trillion. It was $1.131 trillion in February, the data showed.

“The decline this month brings China essentially flat to where they were in February, erasing the increases from December through February,” Jefferies LLC’s senior money market economist Tom Simons wrote in a research note.

Despite the drop in Treasuries holdings, the world’s second-largest economy remained the largest U.S. creditor.

On the other hand, Japan raised its Treasuries holdings to $1.078 trillion, the highest since November 2017, from $1.072 trillion in February.

However, another set of Treasury data showed Japan sold $11.07 billion in U.S. government debt in March, the most for U.S.’s No. 2 foreign creditor, since February 2018.

Meanwhile, foreigners resumed sales of Treasuries in March as U.S. 10-year yields fell to 15-month lows after the Federal Reserve signaled it would not raise interest rates in 2019, according to the latest Treasury data.

They sold $12.53 billion in U.S. government debt in March after buying $19.91 billion the month before.

“Private investors have been big buyers of Treasuries since the beginning of the second half of 2018, but foreign official institutions have been inconsistent,” Simons said.

Official overseas selling of Treasuries coincided with a dollar rally in March spurred by safe-haven bids for the greenback amid worries about the global economy, trade tension and uncertainty around Brexit.

Central banks of export-oriented countries often sell their Treasury holdings to defend their currencies from a sharp appreciation of the greenback.

Overseas accounts also sold stocks for 11 straight months, reducing their equity stakes by $23.64 billion in March.

On the other hand, they bought $4.74 billion in agency securities and $1.11 billion of corporate bonds.

OUTFLOW PERSISTS

The latest data showed a net outflow from the United States totaling $8.1 billion in March, slower than the revised $21.5 billion in February.

Foreign central banks and other government entities accelerated their reduction of U.S. assets, selling $21.7 billion in March versus a revised $10.1 billion the month before.

The official foreign sales in March were offset by net purchases by private overseas investors which acquired $13.6 billion in U.S. assets after a revised $11.4 billion in sales in February."
"US non-essential personnel ordered to leave Iraq Embassy, consulate",https://www.foxnews.com,['Brie Stimson'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/state-department-orders-all-non-essential-personnel-to-leave-iraq,"The State Department has ordered all non-emergency personnel at the U.S. Embassy and consulate in Iraq to leave the country amid rising tensions between the U.S. and Iran.

The announcement was made in a security alert on its website early Wednesday morning. The alert also said that normal visa services would be temporarily suspended.

This comes amid a standoff between the U.S. and Iran, which has recently threatened to pull out of the nuclear deal and resume higher uranium enrichment if no new deal is put in place.

The move coincided with Germany's decision on Tuesday to suspend training of Iraqi soldiers due to tensions in the region, though the government indicated no specific threats to its own troops.

German Defense Ministry spokesman Jens Flosdorff says that Germany is “orienting itself toward our partner countries, which have taken this step.”

The country currently has about 160 German soldiers in Iraq as part of the fight against ISIS, about 60 of them at a base north of Baghdad where Iraqi forces are being trained.

IRANIAN PRESIDENTIAL AIDE SAYS TRUMP WILL 'GET A WAR' FOR LISTENING TO 'THE MUSTACHE' JOHN BOLTON

Trump warned Iran on Monday afternoon that it will “suffer greatly” if the country does “anything” in the form of an attack, a remark that came in the wake of revelations that U.S. military experts suggested “Iran or its proxies” damaged four commercial ships off the coast of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Sunday.

This also came just days before the regime warned it easily could destroy a naval fleet sent by the United States in order to ward off a potential threat to U.S. commercial interests.

“Their billion[-dollar] fleet can be destroyed with one missile,” Ayatollah Tabatabai-Nejad said, according to Reuters.

“If they attempt any move, they will ... [face] dozens of missiles because at that time [government] officials won't be in charge to act cautiously, but instead things will be in the hands of our beloved leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,” he warned.

GEN. JACK KEANE SAYS REPORT TRUMP HAS UPDATED PLANS TO SEND 100,000 TROOPS TO IRAN IS 'DISTORTION OF WHAT REALLY HAPPENS'

Last week, U.S. officials said urgent ""credible threats"" from Iran against Americans were detected and the embassy advised against all travel to the region, citing “heightened tensions.”

The president denied Tuesday the reports that the administration was planning to send more than 100,000 troops to the region in the wake of the war with Iran, but adding, “Would I do that? Absolutely ... If we did that, we’d send a hell of a lot more troops than that.”

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo backed the president's claim, saying ""We fundamentally do not seek war with Iran, we’re looking for the regime to simply stop conducting assassination campaigns throughout Europe,” he said Tuesday in the seaside resort of Sochi, Russia.

Iran's Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also downplayed the escalation. Iran's state TV quoted Khamenei on Tuesday as calling negotiations with the U.S. ""poison"" and saying: ""This is not a military confrontation, because no war is going to happen.""

Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters, said: ""Neither we, nor they are seeking war, they know that it is not to their benefit.""

Iranian state media reported Wednesday however that Khamenei followed up these remarks by saying it wouldn't be difficult for the Islamic Republic to enrich uranium to weapons-grade levels amid rising tensions with the U.S., state media reported Wednesday.

The many problems with Trump’s legal claim that Congress can’t investigate him,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Aaron Blake', 'Senior Political Reporter', 'Writing For The Fix', 'May At Pm']",05-15-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/05/15/trump-says-congress-cant-investigate-him-justice-department-seems-disagree/,"

White House counsel Pat Cipollone listens as first lady Melania Trump speaks at a Be Best anniversary celebration last week. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)

The White House’s position on Congress’s authority to investigate President Trump, it seems, is that it has none. A federal judge practically laughed at Trump’s attorney Monday when he made that argument, but White House counsel Pat Cipollone has now doubled down.

“Congressional investigations are intended to obtain information to aid in evaluating potential legislation,” Cipollone wrote to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) on Tuesday, “not to harass political opponents or to pursue an unauthorized ‘do-over’ of exhaustive law enforcement investigations conducted by the Department of Justice.”

The defiant letter is the culmination of weeks of the White House saying it wouldn’t comply with basically any subpoenas from the Democratic-controlled House. You can’t do that without making some kind of legal argument as to why, of course. Apparently the White House has landed upon saying Congress can’t investigate anything the president does unless it pertains to legislation.

That kind of precedent would lead to a whole host of problems.

The first is the one federal judge Amit Mehta noted Monday. When Trump lawyer William Consovoy tried to argue that Congress had no such right, Mehta noted that this standard would render illegal the congressional Watergate and Whitewater investigations, which led to the resignation of one president and the impeachment of another.

Mehta asked whether “a president was involved in some corrupt enterprise, you mean to tell me, because he is the president of the United States, Congress would not have power to investigate?” Consovoy answered in the affirmative, if it was “not pursuant to its legislative agenda.”

So how do you hold a president accountable for illegal actions? The Justice Department has determined that it can’t indict a sitting president. Given that policy, special counsel Robert S. Mueller III decided he couldn’t even accuse Trump of the crime of obstruction of justice. The only remedy for presidential wrongdoing, then, is through impeachment, which is enshrined in the Constitution. According to Consovoy and Cippolone’s logic, though, the Justice Department can only assemble the evidence and Congress can do nothing but decide whether to impeach.

But what happens if the Justice Department, which is under the control of presidential appointees, declines to provide the evidence — either wholesale or piecemeal, as we saw in the Mueller report’s redactions? And what happens if it declines to investigate altogether? Congress would have no means to collect its own evidence to make its constitutionally protected judgment about impeachment.

And finally, the Justice Department itself seems to disagree with this argument — and it said so in the very same memo that exempts a sitting president from indictment.

In a 2000 update to the original 1973 Office of Legal Counsel opinion, a footnote reads (key part in bold):

Moreover, in the event of suspicion of serious wrongdoing by a sitting President, the media and even Congress (through its own investigatory powers) would likely pursue, collect and preserve evidence as well. These multiple mechanisms for securing and preserving evidence could mitigate somewhat the effect of a particular witness’s failed recollection or demise. By contrast, many civil litigants would lack the resources and incentives to pursue and preserve evidence in the same comprehensive manner.

So in arguing that a president is exempted from indictment, the Justice Department pretty much states as a matter of fact that Congress can conduct its own investigation — even stating flatly that it has “investigatory powers.” And the powers it’s describing clearly pertain to presidential wrongdoing, rather than some related legislative purpose.

This, of course, is only an advisory opinion, so it’s legal significance in the looming Trump court battles is up for debate. But it seems pretty telling that the Justice Department saw congressional investigations as a remedy for the lack of an ability to indict and prosecute a sitting president.

Which makes the argument that the Trump team is making all the more remarkable and audacious."
State Department's red flag on Steele went to a senior FBI man well before FISA warrant,https://thehill.com,[],05-14-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/443710-state-departments-red-flag-on-steele-went-to-a-senior-fbi-man-well-before,"In all Washington investigations, the essential questions become who knew it and when did they know it.

In the case of FBI informant Christopher Steele and the credibility of his now-disproven Russia collusion allegations against Donald Trump Donald John TrumpNapolitano claims Trump violated separation of powers 3 times in last week Work on surprise medical bills goes into overdrive Trump pardons media tycoon, former GOP leader of California State Assembly MORE, we have some important clarity: Government officials confirm that an October 2016 email revealing that Steele met with State Department officials — a breach of protocol for an informant if it was unauthorized — was sent to an FBI counterintelligence supervisor.

Multiple sources confirm to me that the recipient of the State Department email was Special Agent Stephen Laycock, then the FBI’s section chief for Eurasian counterintelligence and now one of the bureau’s top executives as the assistant director for intelligence under Director Christopher Wray.

The email to Laycock from Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec arrived eight days before the FBI swore to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that it had no derogatory information on Steele and used his anti-Trump dossier to secure a secret surveillance warrant to investigate Trump’s possible ties to Moscow.

Officials tell me that Laycock immediately forwarded the information he received about Steele on Oct. 13, 2016, to the FBI team leading the Trump-Russia investigation, headed by then-fellow Special Agent Peter Strzok.

Laycock was the normal point of contact for Kavalec on Eurasian counterintelligence matters, and he simply acted as a conduit to get the information to his colleagues supervising the Russia probe, the officials added.

The officials declined to say what the FBI did with the information about Steele after it reached Strzok’s team, or what the email specifically revealed. A publicly disclosed version of the email has been heavily redacted in the name of national security.

While much remains to be answered, the email exchange means FBI supervisors knew Steele had contact with State and had reason to inquire what he was saying before they sought the warrant. If they had inquired, agents would have learned Steele had admitted to Kavalec he had been leaking to the news media, had a political deadline of Election Day to get his information public and had provided demonstrably false intelligence in one case, as I reported last week.

Current and former FBI officials told me it would be a red flag for an FBI informant on a sensitive counterintelligence case such as Russia to go talking about his evidence with another federal agency without authorization.

Kevin Brock, the former FBI assistant director for intelligence, said the State Department’s email in October 2016 ordinarily should have triggered the FBI to reevaluate Steele as a source.

“This is quite important,” Brock said. “Under normal circumstances, when you get information about the conduct of your source that gives rise to questions about their reliability or truthfulness, you usually go back and reevaluate their dependability and credibility.

“It doesn’t always mean immediate discontinuation of the source. But there are policy requirements that you exercise some form of prudence, and conduct further vetting to determine whether this source can be utilized going forward. This is particularly true if the source’s information is being used in an affidavit or some other legal process.”

FBI confidential sources such as Steele sign a confidentiality agreement and undergo a training session on the do's and don’ts of informing, an event known in intelligence parlance as an “admonishment.” FBI records show Steele underwent “admonishment” training and signed an acknowledgement on Feb. 2, 2016.

The FBI fired Steele as an informant on Nov. 1, 2016, claiming he was caught leaking to the news media. But by that time Steele’s intelligence already had been used as the main evidence to secure a Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant against the Trump campaign on Oct. 21, 2016.

The public version of Kavalec's email blacked out Laycock’s name as the recipient and listed an attachment file when it was delivered last month to the conservative group Citizens United under an open records request. The blacked-out version contained only a single visible sentence, in which Kavalec wrote the FBI supervisor: “You may already have this information but wanted to pass it on just in case.”

Officials familiar with Kavalec’s email would only describe the contents as having to do with something Steele told the State Department during an Oct. 11, 2016, visit. They said the attachment was not a copy of Steele’s now-infamous dossier or a complete set of Kavalec’s typed notes from her conversation with the informant. Rather, they say, it was information Steele shared with Kavalec that she felt needed to be transmitted to the bureau.

The officials also declined to address another mystery that has caught congressional investigators’ attention: Kavalec had two exchanges with FBI officials about Steele approximately two weeks before her meeting. The email contacts on Sept. 29-30, 2016, have been redacted, except for a single phrase “Thank you Kathy.” Congressional investigators want to know if the earlier exchange resulted in Kavalec learning in advance of Steele’s work for the FBI, or was a further tipoff to the FBI of Steele’s intention to visit State, a department where he had offered pro bono information in the past.

An FBI spokeswoman declined comment. Laycock did not respond to phone and email requests for comment. State officials declined to discuss the documents.

Republican House and Senate investigators who spent two years reviewing the Russia case say they were not provided the details of Kavalec’s contact with Steele or told about the existence of her handwritten and typed notes.

Lawmakers believe the new memos provide additional evidence Steele was unsuitable to be an informant before his dossier was used to justify a FISA warrant.

Their concern is heightened by the fact that Steele was working simultaneously as an FBI informant and as a paid researcher for Fusion GPS, the firm hired by Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonFrustrated GOP senators want answers from Trump on Iran Progressive group targets Susan Collins over Trump judicial pick Poll: Biden leads Trump by double digits in Pennsylvania MORE’s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to find Russia dirt on Trump in hopes of defeating him in the election.

Congressional Republicans have said publicly for months that the FBI failed to adequately inform FISA judges that Steele was working for Trump’s rival and had a bias against the GOP nominee, or that his dossier was unverified and contained demonstrably false information.

Defenders of the FBI have countered that there isn’t evidence to prove the bureau knew Steele was leaking to the media or was hired by the Clinton campaign and the DNC until after the FISA warrant was filed.

Biden expands lead over rivals for 2020 U.S. presidential nomination despite lack of support from millennials: Reuters/Ipsos poll,https://www.reuters.com,"['Chris Kahn', 'Min Read']",05-15-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-poll/biden-expands-lead-over-rivals-for-2020-u-s-presidential-nomination-despite-lack-of-support-from-millennials-reuters-ipsos-poll-idUSKCN1SL1XI,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden has expanded his lead over a wide field of candidates for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination by 5 percentage points since he entered the race in late April, according to a monthly Reuters/Ipsos poll.

The poll released on Wednesday found 29% of Democrats and independents said they would vote for Biden in the state nominating contests that begin next year. That is up from 24% who said so in a poll that ran in late April, days before Biden announced his bid.

Biden led the field among all major demographic groups except millennials (ages 18-37), who favored U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont over Biden 18% to 16%.

Biden, 76, remains in the strongest position for the top of the ticket despite questions about his age and centrist positions. He also has faced criticism over his unwanted touching of women and his treatment of law professor Anita Hill three decades ago during Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’ confirmation hearing.

The monthly survey showed 29% of women who identify as Democrats and independents said they backed Biden, up 4 points from last month.

And among registered Democrats, those who supported other candidates still listed Biden as a top alternative if their choice dropped out of the race, according to the poll.

“That means that there is not a significant anti-Biden block of voters split between the other candidates,” said Chris Jackson, a polling expert at Ipsos.

“At this moment, Joe Biden is a clear front-runner in the Democratic primary,” Jackson added.

The Democratic nominee will likely face Republican President Donald Trump in the November 2020 election.

Besides Biden, 13% of Democrats and independents said they would vote for Sanders. None of the other candidates received more than 6% support in the poll.

With more than a month until the candidates square off in the first televised debates and 18 months before the 2020 presidential election, the American public appears to be selecting candidates they know best.

Less than 20% of Democrats said they were familiar with many of the candidates, including U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, Montana Governor Steve Bullock, Washington Governor Jay Inslee and Wayne Messam, mayor of Miramar, Florida. In comparison, more than 84% said they were familiar with Biden and Sanders.

However, Biden probably is not leading on name recognition alone, said Kyle Kondik, a political analyst at the University of Virginia Center for Politics.

“It’s not valuable if people know you but don’t like you,” Kondik said. “We saw that for (former Florida Governor) Jeb Bush in 2015. He had good name ID - everyone knew his family name - but he wasn’t polling as well as Biden is now because Republicans didn’t like him.”

The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English throughout the United States from May 10-14. It gathered responses from 1,132 Democrats and independents and has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 3 percentage points.

Respondents were asked to pick from 23 potential Democratic nominees, including New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who is expected to announce his plans this week. The poll did not include 89-year-old Mike Gravel, a former U.S. senator from Alaska, who is running.

"State Department official cited Steele in emails with Ohr after flagging credibility issues to FBI, docs reveal",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/state-department-christopher-steele-bruce-ohr-judicial-watch-russia-dossier,"Shortly after the 2016 presidential election, then-Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec and Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr discussed new allegations concerning the Trump campaign's Russia connections that were sourced to British ex-spy Christopher Steele, according to documents made public Wednesday.

The previous month, in October 2016, Kavalec had met with Steele and documented his political motivations in writing -- particularly that Steele's client was ""keen"" to see his anti-Trump materials ""come to light"" prior to the election. Kavelec forwarded her written notes, in which she also pointed out that some of Steele's claims were apparently false, to a senior FBI executive.

Despite Kavalec's concerns, the FBI used Steele's information to obtain a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant targeting former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page just weeks later. The warrant application did not clearly state that the dossier's creation was funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC).

The email correspondence between Ohr and Kavalec highlighted Steele's influence in the DOJ and State Department even as concerns about his reliability mounted, and shed new light on a pivotal period in federal authorities' probe of the Trump team.

The documents were unearthed this week as part of a transparency lawsuit by the group Judicial Watch.



On Nov. 21, 2016, Kavalec began by thanking Ohr for stopping by to discuss the OCDETF (Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force), then added: ""Regarding the person I mentioned, Simon Kukes, below are a couple of links to the story I mentioned.""

DEEP STATE OF PANIC: DISPUTE ERUPTS OVER WHETHER BRENNAN, COMEY PUSHED STEELE DOSSIER



The first was a Mother Jones piece entitled, ""A Major Russian-American Oil Magnate Is Putting Big Money Behind Trump’s Campaign."" The second was an OpenSecrets article, ""Russian-born oil magnate gives big to Trump Victory.""

The articles reported that Russian-American oil magnate Simon Grigorievich Kukes had donated $150,000 to the Trump campaign and a related committee, his first donations in a federal election campaign.



""On this campaign donation story, I just wondered what, assuming this is true, the original source of the funding might have been,"" Kevalec wrote, noting that State Department colleague Tom Firestone had previously introduced her to Kukes personally.



Ohr responded: ""Thank you for taking the time to meet with us. I really hope we can get something going here."" Ohr did not specify exactly what he meant.



""This is very interesting -- I may have heard about him from Tom Firestone as well, but I can't recall for certain,"" Ohr continued. ""We will take another look at this. Thanks again, and I look forward to seeing everyone at the next meeting.""



In a follow-up email, Kevalec said she was ""re-looking"" at her notes from her October 2016 meeting with Steele, whose anti-Trump views are now widely known.

“I see Chris [Steele] said [Simon] Kukes has [sic] some connection to Serge Millian,"" Kevalec wrote to Ohr. Millian is a Russian businessman and a purported source for the Steele dossier.

The Hill's John Solomon first reported details of Kevalec's meeting with Steele, which Fox News later confirmed. On Nov. 1, 2016, the FBI fired Steele as a source, citing his leaks to the news media.



But the FBI had already relied on much of Steele’s work to pursue a FISA warrant against Page in October 2016. And emails previously uncovered by Judicial Watch revealed that Ohr remained in regular contact with Steele even after he was fired by the FBI as a source -- effectively providing Steele a back channel to reach the FBI and Justice Department.

According to Kevalec's notes, Steele told her of “a technical/human operation run out of Moscow targeting the election"" and acknowledged that he wanted his allegations publicized in advance of the 2016 presidential election.

Steele also told Kevalec that “payments to those recruited are made out of the Russian Consulate in Miami,"" according to Kevalec's notes. Kevalec quickly debunked Steele's assertion, writing in her memo: “It is important to note that there is no Russian consulate in Miami.”

WHO IS THE US ATTORNEY THAT BARR APPOINTED TO LOOK INTO FBI, DOJ MISCONDUCT?

Fox News reported earlier this year that Ohr's own meetings with Steele in 2016 were shared by Ohr with his expansive circle of contacts inside the department -- including senior FBI leadership and officials later assigned to Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.



Additionally, Bruce Ohr's wife, Nellie, worked for Fusion GPS, the research group that commissioned the dossier. Nellie Ohr conducted extensive opposition research on Trump family members and campaign aides while working there, according to a transcript of her closed-door interview with Congress released earlier this year.

Her tenure at Fusion GPS lasted from October 2015 to September 2016.

Nellie Ohr also testified that when she was hired by the firm’s co-founder Glenn Simpson, he was aware that her husband was a high-level Justice Department official."

DHS also asked the Pentagon to provide about 350 personnel to help run non-detention related operations at the camps, including maintenance functions.

Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin says battle over President Turmp's tax returns could go to court,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/treasury-secretary-steve-mnuchin-battle-president-turmps-tax/story?id=63050172,"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Wednesday accused congressional Democrats of ""weaponizing the IRS"" by trying to obtain President Donald Trump's tax returns and suggested the battle may ultimately have to be decided by the courts.

“Mr. Secretary, doesn’t Congress as a separate branch of government have a legitimate interest in determining whether or not the IRS is enforcing tax laws with respect to the President of the United States?"" Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, asked Mnuchin at a Capitol Hill hearing. He was referring to the law that requires the IRS to audit every president's tax returns.

Mnuchin responded: ""Mr. Senator, I want to be respectful in answering this and I’m not trying to avoid your question, but the answer is that there is a difference in interpretation between Congress and us and the Department of Justice around this law that not only impacts the president and this Congress but has a very big impact on every single taxpayer in weaponizing the IRS.""

""And this is why there are three branches of government so if there is a difference of opinion, this will go to the third branch of government to be resolved,"" he said.

Mnuchin was testifying before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee just two days ahead of Friday's deadline set by the Rep. Richard Neal, the Democratic chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, for Mnuchin and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig to respond to a subpoena for six years of the president's tax returns. The request came after Mnuchin rejected an earlier request by Neal.

""First of all, we haven't made a decision, but I think you can guess which way we are leaning on our subpoena,"" Mnuchin said. ""To the extent that we don't and there is litigation, I take great comfort that there's a third branch of government to deal with this important issue.""

Patrick Semansky/AP

The president’s lawyers and White House are expected to challenge the move and have argued that Democrats’ request does not serve a legitimate legislative purpose, an argument the administration made in its rejection of the Democrats’ initial request.

The committee chairman, Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., pushed back against Van Hollen's line of questioning regarding Trump's tax returns by laying out a scenario where a member of Congress could try to obtain anyone's returns.

""How about you send me all the tax returns from every candidate among my Democratic friends running for the president of the United States? Now, I'm not interested in it for political reasons, I just want to study the IRS and I think I'll start with these returns. How much confidence do you think the American people will have in the internal revenue service and the privacy concerns if we start doing that in this country?"" Kennedy said.

Mnuchin said he thought that ""would be very dangerous.""

""I think it would also be very dangerous to provide you with returns of large Democrats or Republicans who made political gifts, or leaders of industry, or leaders of labor unions,"" Mnuchin said."
Interior chief dismisses climate concerns in first Natural Resources hearing: 'I haven't lost any sleep over it',https://thehill.com,[],05-15-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/443894-interior-chief-dodges-climate-questions-during-first-natural,"Democratic House lawmakers on Wednesday pressured Interior Secretary David Bernhardt to commit to considering climate change in all future agency decisions, but the former energy lobbyist wouldn’t take the bait.

“What’s the number for how concerned you are about us hitting 415 parts per million of carbon dioxide?” Rep. Matt Cartwright Matthew (Matt) Alton CartwrightOvernight Energy: Dems press Interior chief to embrace climate action | Lawmakers at odds on how to regulate chemicals in water | Warren releases climate plan for military Interior chief dismisses climate concerns in first Natural Resources hearing: 'I haven't lost any sleep over it' Overnight Health Care — Presented by PCMA — McConnell delivers fierce attack on Medicare for all | Barr defends efforts to overturn ObamaCare | Senators push drug industry 'middlemen' over prices MORE (D-Pa.) asked Bernhardt regarding a recent study that found carbon dioxide levels are the highest in human history.

“I haven’t lost any sleep over it,” Bernhardt responded.

Democrats on the House Natural Resources Committee grilled the newly appointed Interior Secretary over his thoughts on climate change and how the agency, which oversees drilling on national lands, should consider climate impacts as it drafts its policies.

“You have the discretion to issue oil and gas leases on federal lands. There are certain laws that require the department to take climate change into account when it's managing its land. And so Interior would have the ability to make choices that would be consistent with those goals,” Rep. Diana DeGette Diana Louise DeGetteOvernight Energy: Dems press Interior chief to embrace climate action | Lawmakers at odds on how to regulate chemicals in water | Warren releases climate plan for military Interior chief dismisses climate concerns in first Natural Resources hearing: 'I haven't lost any sleep over it' A new age for tobacco — raising the age to 21 is a smart move MORE (D-Colo.) told Bernhardt at the hearing.

Bernhardt pushed back on insinuations that environmental laws bound him to ease off President Trump Donald John TrumpNapolitano claims Trump violated separation of powers 3 times in last week Work on surprise medical bills goes into overdrive Trump pardons media tycoon, former GOP leader of California State Assembly MORE’s energy independence agenda, which includes expanding oil and gas leasing on public lands.

Emissions from drilling on public lands make up nearly a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S, according to a federal report released last November.

“I think if you all have a view on climate change that says don’t develop energy on federal lands that’s fine. You have to go through a process of codifying it and providing that direction. And if you provide it, I’ll faithfully execute it,” Bernhardt told the lawmakers.

“Just to say from today forward, David Bernhardt says, ‘No development on public lands,’ I do not have that authority.”

Rep. Mike Levin (D-Calif.) challenged Bernhardt’s claim that the Interior chief didn’t have enough authority to make decisions on global warming without a congressional bill.

“You claim that Congress hasn’t given you enough direction to address climate change,” Levin said. “What type of direction would you want Congress to give you to make it clearer?""

Bernhardt said he wasn’t given specific direction to stop drilling.

“Whatever you think you can do to stop it. If that’s what you want to do, go for it. But that should happen in this body. That’s not something the Department of Interior does with a magic wand,” he said, shrugging off the obligation.

Democratic lawmakers challenged Bernhardt on a range of issues during the committee hearing, his first as Interior head. Questions revolved around reports that he signed off on policy decisions that ultimately benefited various former lobbying clients of his and that he’s been stonewalling providing members with requested internal documents.

Rep. Alan Lowenthal Alan Stuart LowenthalOvernight Energy: Dems press Interior chief to embrace climate action | Lawmakers at odds on how to regulate chemicals in water | Warren releases climate plan for military Interior chief dismisses climate concerns in first Natural Resources hearing: 'I haven't lost any sleep over it' Pelosi, Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez place transgender pride flags outside Capitol Hill offices MORE (D-Calif.) pointed to a slide of a page of computer code sent to lawmakers among the batches of documents they requested from Interior.

“I call this the gibberish slide. I have no idea what this says, but you sent it on,” Lowenthal said.

Liberal lawmakers on the committee challenged that while Interior had provided large quantities of documents, they had not provided information specific enough to their requests, which they labeled a clear attempt to obfuscate.

“There is quantitative response to the request and qualitative response to the request… The qualitative response is our point. While we have reams of paper, we don’t have quality content,” said Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz), chairman of the committee.

Grijalva had previously been vocal about his frustration with Interior’s lack of response to requests for documents. The testiness between the Interior Department and his committee nearly exploded into a standoff two weeks ago when Bernhardt wouldn't commit to a date to testify before it.

Bernhardt later agreed after Grijalva promised to first hold a one-on-one meeting with him.

“The committee needs to know what kind of relationship we're going to have with you as an equal branch of government from now on,” Grijalva asked Bernhardt at the hearing.

“I’d like to hear from you if you feel the same way the President does in terms of committee oversight. Can we expect to have a healthy relationship with the Interior Department?”

Bernhardt acknowledged there was frustration, and said maybe they could find a way to sit down again and discuss expectations further."
Sean Hannity: DOJ inspector general FISA abuse probe is 'done and it's devastating',https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/sean-hannity-doj-inspector-general-fisa-abuse-probe-is-done-and-its-devastating,"Fox News host Sean Hannity says he is hearing that the Justice Department inspector general's investigation into alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse is ""done and it's devastating.""

He made the assertion during his evening program on Wednesday and asked Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., if he also had heard any word on the investigation.

Graham, whose Judiciary Committee had been conducting his own FISA abuse inquiry, said he could not verify if Inspector General Michael Horowitz is done, but added that he expects the eventual report to be upsetting to anyone who cares about the rule of law.

Hannity first brought up the prospect of Horowitz's investigation being complete earlier in the show, speaking with Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett and former Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who is now a Fox News contributor.

""I have sources telling me that Horowitz perhaps is even finished with his report and certainly the attorney general has been briefed on what is coming,"" Hannity said. He also referred to former U.S. Attorney Joe diGenova saying Horowitz determined that the three FISA extensions against onetime Trump campaign aide Carter Page were illegally obtained and was on the brink of finding the first FISA was completely illegal.

The completion of Horowitz's investigation would be news. Attorney General William Barr recently predicted that it would be complete in either late May or June, but there has been no official word of its progress since.

A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment.

Horowitz announced his investigation in March 2018 in a statement that said his office was examining the Justice Department's and FBI's compliance with legal requirements as well as policies and procedures in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court related to Page as part of a larger counterintelligence probe into President Trump's campaign. Horowitz also said he would “review information that was known to the DOJ and the FBI at the time the applications were filed from or about an alleged FBI confidential source. Additionally, the OIG will review the DOJ’s and FBI’s relationship and communications with the alleged source as they relate to the FISC applications.” This “alleged FBI confidential source” is British ex-spy Christopher Steele, who authored the unverified dossier on Trump's ties to Russia that was used by the FBI in the Page warrant applications.

Horowitz can recommend that people be prosecuted. Jarrett noted that U.S. Attorney John Durham, whom Barr has tasked with reviewing the origins of the Russia investigation, could then ""subpoena people to haul them in front of a grand jury. I suspect there is a grand jury and they're well on their way to potential criminal indictments.""

Jarrett said the people ""likely"" in legal jeopardy are former FBI Director James Comey, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, former FBI General Counsel James Baker, former FBI special agent Peter Strzok, former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, ""maybe"" former CIA Director John Brennan and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, and ""certainly"" Steele and Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson."
"Homeland Security to allow border wall to go through national monument, wildlife refuge",https://www.cbsnews.com,[],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/homeland-security-to-allow-border-wall-to-go-through-national-monument-wildlife-refuge/,"The U.S. government plans on replacing barriers through 100 miles of the southern border in California and Arizona, including through a national monument and a wildlife refuge, according to documents and environmental advocates.

The Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday again waived environmental and dozens of other laws to build more barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Funding will come from the Defense Department following the emergency declaration that President Donald Trump signed this year after Congress refused to approve the amount of border wall funding he requested.

Barriers will go up at Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, a vast park named after the unique cactus breed that decorates it, and Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge, which is largely a designed wilderness home to 275 wildlife species. The government will also build new roads and lighting in those areas in Arizona.

Environmental advocates who have sued to stop the construction of the wall say this latest plan will be detrimental to the wildlife and habitat in those areas.

""The Trump administration just ignored bedrock environmental and public health laws to plow a disastrous border wall through protected, spectacular wildlands,"" said Laiken Jordahl, who works on border issues at the Center for Biological Diversity.

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment but has typically not said much about construction plans.

At Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, row after row of cactuses decorate 516 square miles of land that once saw so much drug smuggling that over half the park was closed to the public. But illegal crossings in that area dropped off significantly in the past several years, and the government in 2015 reopened the entire monument for the first time in 12 years.

While Arizona has seen an increase in border crossers over the last year, most are families who turn themselves in to Border Patrol agents. The number of drugs that agents seize in the state has also dropped significantly.

But the government is moving forward with more border infrastructure.

The waivers the department issued Tuesday are vague in their description of where and how many miles of fencing will be installed. The Center for Biological Diversity says the plans total about 100 miles of southern border in both Arizona and California, near Calexico and Tecate.

In Arizona, construction will focus on four areas of the border and will include the replacement of waist-high fencing meant to stop cars with 18- to 30-foot barriers that will be more efficient at stopping illegal crossings.

The government has already demolished refuge land in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas and construction is set to begin any day. On one section of the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge, crews have used heavy construction equipment to destroy a mix of trees, including mesquite, mulberry and hackberry. Those trees protect birds during the ongoing nesting season.

According to plans published last year, the cleared land will be filled in and a concrete wall will be installed, with bollards measuring 18 feet installed on top.

After months of public outcry, Congress forbade U.S. Customs and Border Protection from building in the nearby Santa Ana wildlife refuge or the nonprofit National Butterfly Center. But it didn't stop money from going to wall construction in other refuge lands, nor did it stop the government from building in otherwise exempted land due to the emergency declaration, said Marianna Trevino Wright, the butterfly center's director.

""They're going to have to protect us in every single spending bill going forward, and they have to protect us against the state of emergency,"" Wright said. ""And this administration has made it clear ... that they don't want any exemptions."""
The DOJ won’t say why Rudy Giuliani hasn’t registered as a foreign agent under FARA law,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/why-isnt-rudy-giuliani-registered-as-a-foreign-agent-fara-lobbying-in-ukraine-a9289f19677e/,"Amid last week’s furor about Rudy Giuliani pledging to dig up dirt on Joe Biden in Ukraine — and Giuliani’s claim that he wanted to “meddl[e] in an investigation” regarding Biden’s son in Ukraine — was a small, buried detail that may yet unravel Giuliani’s entire plan.

Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, has worked in Ukraine since Trump’s inauguration, nominally as a security adviser to the city of Kharkiv with his firm Giuliani Partners. However, one of his local clients claimed last week that Giuliani provided far more than technical advice and a handful of photo-ops.

According to Ukrainian developer Pavel Fuks, Giuliani had been hired to work as a “lobbyist” for the government of Ukraine, as well as for the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. “This is stated in the contract,” Fuks told the Times. The claim backs up local media coverage of the relationship, with one Ukrainian magazine writing that Fuks hired Giuliani in order to create an office in the U.S. for “supporting investment” in Kharkiv. As Mother Jones reported, Giuliani connected with Fuks via TriGlobal Strategic Ventures, a New York-based company that has “advised Russian oligarchs and others with Kremlin ties.”

Giuliani denied Fuks’ claim, saying that Trump remains his “only client.” Giuliani didn’t respond to ThinkProgress’ questions on the matter, and ThinkProgress’ efforts to contact Fuks were unsuccessful.

If anyone needs to be investigated, it’s Rudy Giuliani. Rudy was “a lobbyist for Kharkiv and Ukraine” but failed to register under FARA. His clients, Pavel Fuks and Gennadiy Kernes, have reported ties to organized crime. How is he different than Manafort? https://t.co/O0ZdUkmoex — Michael Carpenter (@mikercarpenter) May 10, 2019

However, Fuks’ claim adds significant fuel to longstanding concerns about Giuliani’s decision not to register as a foreign agent with the Justice Department — even as the agency goes to unprecedented lengths to enforce the Foreign Agents Registration Act.

FARA regulations, on the books since 1938, had remained an afterthought for decades. But thanks to Trump’s rise, and due especially to the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, FARA has seen new life. The DOJ already created a new task force to strengthen FARA, making sure that those working on behalf of foreign governments and officials disclose and detail their work with the DOJ, and prosecutors have shown a new willingness to finally enforce the regulations.

In just the past year, failing to register with FARA has tripped up former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and former White House counsel Gregory Craig — both of whom were found guilty of failing to register their work on behalf of the former Ukrainian government. Manafort’s former business associate Rick Gates pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate FARA.

Giuliani, though, has thus far managed to escape scrutiny. And no one’s quite sure why.

Last September, months before Fuks claimed that Giuliani had been hired directly to lobby on behalf of Ukraine, a number of Democratic senators signed a letter to the DOJ requesting information on Giuliani’s FARA filings (or lack thereof). Giuliani admitted last year that he’d never filed a single FARA registration.

The senators specifically pointed to Giuliani’s work in Ukraine, including a press release linking Giuliani with Kharkiv Mayor Gennady Kernes, himself a former member of the party affiliated with ousted Ukrainian strongman Viktor Yanukovych. Both Manafort and Craig were indicted for failing to disclose FARA-related work on behalf of Yanukovych’s regime.

The senators writing to DOJ — including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), and Sen. Tom Udall (D-NM) — specifically singled out Giuliani’s work in Ukraine:

Giuliani’s work on behalf the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine, whose mayor is a member of the Party of Regions is also concerning. The Ukrainian Party of Regions’ connections to the Russian Government and anti-democratic activity are well-documented. Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, who both served in senior roles on the President’s 2016 campaign team, were convicted of or pleaded guilty to criminal acts in part because of their work on behalf of this Russian-backed Ukrainian political party. Mr. Giuliani’s financial connection to the organization, the organization’s close ties with the Russian government, and Mr. Giuliani’s ongoing public advocacy against Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election raises further questions that warrant review.

And it’s not just Giuliani’s work in Ukraine. As the senators noted, Giuliani’s efforts at recruiting foreign clients — all while working closely with the sitting president — have spanned the globe. He’s represented the Mujahideen-e Khalq (MEK), an Iranian opposition group, in its efforts to lift their Foreign Terrorist Organization designation from the State Department. He recently signed up with Bahrain’s Ministry of the Interior, as The Daily Beast found. And, perhaps most notably, he wrote a remarkable letter to Romanian authorities, chastising the country’s prosecutor for being too effective at combating corruption — all while working at the behest of another lobbyist representing an official caught up in Romania’s anti-corruption dragnet.

But it was Giuliani’s misadventures in Ukraine that gained the most notoriety. And over the past week, the questions — about Giuliani’s aims, about who’s paying for his travel, about how much Trump knows — have only grown.

The DOJ, though, has been silent. As multiple staffers working for the Democratic senators told ThinkProgress, the DOJ never even bothered to reply to their inquiries about Giuliani’s FARA status.

“DOJ never responded to our letter,” a spokesperson for Udall told ThinkProgress. “However, we did confirm that they received it.”

As Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), another signatory of the letter requesting information on Giuliani’s FARA status, tweeted last Friday, “Giuliani has reportedly been paid by foreign [governments] + political parties, including in Ukraine, but FAILED to register as a foreign agent as the law requires. This is EXACTLY why I joined @SenatorTomUdall to ask DOJ to investigate. We never got a reply.”

Giuliani, unsurprisingly, has long denied any need to register as a foreign agent. Despite the fact that experts on FARA regulations have pointed to Giuliani’s foreign work time and again — both in terms of his speeches and political activities — as examples of FARA-related work, Giuliani has claimed that he’s not influencing American policy.

However, Giuliani also offered a caveat last week: “I don’t think I’m influencing American government except on behalf of my client to further an investigation.” That is, Giuliani admitted that he’s not working to “influence” U.S. policy — except when it comes to his client, the president of the United States.

It doesn’t appear concerns about FARA regulations will slow Giuliani’s work anytime soon. Despite calling off his trip to Ukraine — and despite Fuks’ claims that he has paperwork clarifying Giuliani’s work as a lobbyist in Ukraine — Giuliani has refused to acknowledge any issues with his work in Ukraine, especially as it pertains to FARA.

As he said on Friday, when it comes to Ukraine, “I’m going to make sure that nothing scuttles the investigation that I want.”"
DOJ seeks to appeal rulings advancing Dems' Emoluments Clause lawsuit against Trump,https://thehill.com,[],05-14-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/443712-doj-requests-to-appeal-rulings-advancing-dems-emoluments-clause,"The Department of Justice (DOJ) on Tuesday requested that a judge allow a higher court review previous rulings in favor of a lawsuit alleging President Trump Donald John TrumpNapolitano claims Trump violated separation of powers 3 times in last week Work on surprise medical bills goes into overdrive Trump pardons media tycoon, former GOP leader of California State Assembly MORE has violated the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution.

The DOJ attorneys argue in the filing that there is enough ""difference of opinion"" on the legal questions in the lawsuit, including the definition of the Emoluments Clause, that an appeals court should review Judge Emmet Sullivan's rulings before the case advances.

And the Justice Department, which is representing the president in the lawsuit filed by more than 200 Democratic lawmakers, argue that the “exceptional circumstances” of the case mean that a higher court should review its merits even before the lawsuit advances in district court.

“[D]espite the 150-year unbroken history of federal courts refraining from enjoining a sitting President in the performance of his official duties, this Court determined that it has the power to do so,” the filing reads.

The lawyers also argued that an appeals court could either significantly narrow the scope of the lawsuit, or rule that the Democratic members of Congress behind the complaint don’t have standing to sue and shutter the case altogether.

And they claim that Sullivan’s ruling on the lawsuit last month “broadly interpreted the Foreign Emoluments Clause in a manner that calls into doubt the constitutionality of conduct of public officials — from President George Washington to President Barack Obama Barack Hussein Obama5 steps toward minimizing your cyber risk DOJ seeks to appeal rulings advancing Dems' Emoluments Clause lawsuit against Trump Fewer graduates are choosing government jobs MORE — that has been accepted throughout history.""

The DOJ lawyers also requested that Sullivan, a Clinton appointee, temporarily halt proceedings in the lawsuit while he considers their motion and continue that stay if a higher court does take up their appeal.

""This case presents the unprecedented circumstance of impending civil discovery against the sitting President of the United States concerning his compliance with a constitutional provision in his official capacity. Any discovery would necessarily be a distraction to the President’s performance of his constitutional duties,"" the filing reads.

If the judge grants the motion, the D.C. Circuit will likely take up the appeal.

The Democratic members of Congress behind the lawsuit argue that Trump is in violation of the Emoluments Clause when he profits from foreign governments without congressional approval.

They have pointed to Trump’s global businesses, and their continuing operations while he is in office, as evidence that he is violating the clause.

The Justice Department has argued that Trump cannot violate the clause with any commercial profits, but only if he receives gifts or directly profits from an action he takes as president on behalf of foreign officials. DOJ is representing Trump in the case because he is being sued in his official capacity as president and not as an individual.

Trump is also facing a lawsuit from D.C. and Maryland alleging that he violated the Emoluments Clause."
Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta’s chief of staff forced out,https://www.politico.com,['Ian Kullgren'],05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/14/labor-chief-of-staff-forced-out-1321669,"Nick Geale, chief of staff for Labor Secretary Alex Acosta (shown), reportedly alienated not only Labor officials but also ""people at the White House."" | Win McNamee/Getty Images employment Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta’s chief of staff forced out

Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta’s chief of staff will be forced out by the end of this month after an investigation by the White House raised questions about his professional conduct.

A DOL spokesperson confirmed Nick Geale‘s departure Tuesday but did not provide further details.

Story Continued Below

White House officials instructed Acosta to fire Geale after its review concluded that Geale's interactions with employees were damaging DOL morale, according to two former Trump administration officials with direct knowledge of the investigation.

According to the former officials, Geale created a culture of fear inside DOL’s headquarters with profanity-laced tirades and belittlement of subordinates.

“There are times when he goes completely loony,” said one of the former Trump officials, recalling Geale pounding the table and screaming during a meeting.

Geale, in a written statement, called the DOL staff “dedicated and professional,"" and said he was “very excited to spend time with my new family and take on the next challenges of our journey.”

One of the former Trump officials recalled a particularly fraught encounter in which Geale became furious about what he perceived as poor preparation for a meeting.

“Nick came into my office screaming and yelling and throwing papers on my desk,” the former official said. “I chose to leave [DOL] because I didn’t get any work done.“

“He’s abusive, he’s abrasive, he tries to be intimidating, he’s condescending,” the former official added. After this person complained to Acosta about Geale's rages, nothing changed. “He ratified Nick’s behavior,” the former official said. “He was privy to it.“

Bloomberg Law reported that in April 2018 Geale sent out a memo ordering the agency's top political appointees to ""physically remain in the Frances Perkins [Building] on the day before a hearing until all hearing preparation is completed.... No agency head is allowed to be out of town or otherwise even leave the building on the day before the Secretary testifies without affirmative permission from either Molly [Conway, deputy chief of staff] or me.”

A third person with knowledge of the situation said Geale alienated not only DOL officials but also ""people at the White House."" Some White House officials also expressed frustration to POLITICO with the slow pace of deregulation at DOL, and blamed that at least in part on Geale.

Acosta’s own proclivity for caution continues to bother Republican allies who expected a more forceful advocate for business. For instance, DOL has struggled for months to finalize a rule that would privatize some of the agency's apprenticeship training, as it was instructed to do by a 2017 order from President Donald Trump. Enthusiasm for the initiative is tepid inside DOL.

“Very few people, if any, in the building think that this will work,” another DOL official said.

News of the dismissal was first reported by Axios.

Geale‘s forced departure is more bad news for Acosta, who has spent the last few months fending off criticism of a 2008 plea deal he reached with billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein when Acosta was a U.S. attorney in Florida. A federal judge in February ruled that the Justice Department’s failure to notify Epstein's victims of the plea deal before it was finalized violated the 2004 Crime Victims' Rights Act.

""In many positions at the Department of Labor, on Capitol Hill, and as a member of the National Mediation Board, Nicholas Geale is a national expert on labor issues,” Acosta said in a statement. “After years of hard work here at the Department, I wish him the best on his future endeavors.”

Former DHS officials ousted over push back on Trump administration's plan to arrest thousands of migrants,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Ryan Gaydos', 'Ryan Gaydos Is An Editor For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/former-dhs-officials-ousted-over-push-back-on-trump-administrations-plan-to-arrest-thousands-of-migrants,"Former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and a top immigration official challenged a previously secret White House plan to arrest thousands of migrant parents and children in nearly a dozen U.S. cities, Fox News confirmed Monday.

The Trump administration wanted to target migrant families that had crossed into the U.S. from Mexico in attempt to show that the U.S. wasn't going to back down on its border stance by detaining and deporting illegal immigrant families, The Washington Post first reported, citing several current and former Homeland Security officials.

NEW TRUMP WH POLICY LETS DEPUTIES DETAIN IMMIGRANTS ON BEHALF OF ICE, SUBVERTING 'SANCTUARY' LAWS

The operation included fast-tracking immigration court cases and allowing the U.S. to deport those who failed to show up in their hearings as well as coordinating raids against parents with children in several cities, including New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and several other major metropolitan areas, Fox News confirmed.

Nielsen and top immigration official Ronald Vitiello pushed back on the administration’s plan, citing lack of preparation, public outrage and worries that the operation could use border resources. Stephen Miller and ICE Deputy Director Matthew Albence were supportive of the plan arguing that such an operation could deter migrants from crossing into the U.S., according to The Washington Post.

Nielsen and Vitello’s were concerned over the operation and logistics over the plan and not the ethical reasons behind it, according to the newspaper. Nielsen also worried that targeting parents and children might detract from the White House’s goal of going after so-called “criminal aliens.”

“There was concern that it was being hastily put together, would be ineffective and might actually backfire by misdirecting resources away from critical border emergency response operations,” a Homeland Security official told The Washington Post.

Nielsen and Vitello’s push back was reportedly part of the reason why Trump pushed both officials out of the administration.

Neither Homeland Security nor the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement have commented on the report. Miller, through a White House spokesman, declined comment to The Post.

Nielsen left her position after only 16 months on the job. The Associated Press, citing two sources, reported that Nielsen had been frustrated with the difficulty of getting other departments to help deal with the growing number of families crossing the southwestern border.

Ex-top FBI lawyer James Baker: DOJ inspector general FISA probe will find 'mistakes',https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ex-top-fbi-lawyer-james-baker-doj-inspector-general-will-find-mistakes-in-fisa-probe,"Former FBI General Counsel James Baker said on Monday he expects the Justice Department inspector general to find ""mistakes"" committed by the bureau in its handling of the Trump-Russia investigation.

Inspector General Michael Horowitz is examining the Justice Department's and FBI's compliance with legal requirements as well as policies and procedures in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court related to onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

Baker, who admitted last week the inspector general makes him ""nervous,"" said the government watchdog will probably find some errors.

""The inspector general is looking at everything we did,"" Baker said on CNN. ""If the IG usually finds mistakes that we made, so I expect him to find mistakes this time.""

Baker said last week at an event in Washington, D.C., that he took a leading role in overseeing the FISA warrant applications to obtain the authority to spy on Page. Baker said on Monday he does not believe there was any intent from the people he worked with to do ""anything wrong or illegal,"" including politically motivated spying.

Baker was appointed FBI general counsel in January 2014 and reassigned by FBI Director Christopher Wray in December 2017. Last year, it was reported that Baker was resigning, and since has written for Lawfare and joined the R Street Institute.

Attorney General William Barr has said he expects Horowitz to complete his investigation in late May or June. A particular issue in the investigation is the FBI's reliance on an unverified dossier in the FISA warrant application process."

A few months after William P. Barr joined the Justice Department in 1989 as head of the Office of Legal Counsel, he issued an unsolicited opinion warning Bush administration officials to watch out for “legislative encroachments” on the authority of the president.

The memo from the new 39-year-old Justice official surprised some government officials and constitutional scholars with its ominous language about congressional maneuvers that “could strike at the heart of executive power.”

The Barr memo, as it came to be known, was considered so challenging to congressional prerogatives that his Democratic successor in the Office of Legal Counsel, Walter E. Dellinger III, made it a priority six years later to replace the opinion with one he considered more measured.

“It was a very high priority to supersede the Barr memo with one that recognized the authority of Congress and took a more nuanced view of separation of powers,” Dellinger said in an interview.

“I don’t know anyone that has a more robust view of inherent presidential authority than Bill Barr,” Dellinger added. “There is nobody who is to his right on this issue.”

Embracing a theory that the Constitution grants presidents sweeping authority, Barr is part of a group of conservative intellectuals who have been leading the charge to expand the powers of the executive branch over the past four decades. The doctrine, which gained support amid a backlash against post-Watergate constraints on the presidency, is back in the fore as President Trump and Congress are locked in a bitter fight over the bounds of executive power.

During his first tour at the Justice Department, Barr issued a controversial secret opinion saying that the president could order the FBI to take people into custody in foreign countries, a ruling that paved the way for the arrest in Panama of then-leader Manuel Antonio Noriega.

Two years after that, Barr offered another far-reaching interpretation of presidential power, advising President George H.W. Bush that he did not need congressional approval to invade Iraq. Later, as attorney general, he backed Bush’s pardons of six Reagan administration officials charged in the Iran-contra investigation, a move the independent counsel described at the time as “a coverup.”

Now, back at the helm of the Justice Department under Trump, Barr is in a singular position to put his philosophy into action. In just a few months, he has made his imprint, defending the White House as it pushes a hard-line immigration policy, defies congressional subpoenas and boldly asserts the reach of executive privilege. Barr recently appointed a U.S. attorney to investigate the origins of the special counsel’s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election, a probe for which Trump has publicly called.

[‘Investigate the investigators’ is new Trump rallying cry to counter Mueller report]

Critics say Barr is providing the intellectual framework to enable Trump’s view of an imperial presidency and stonewall legitimate requests for information from Congress.

Richard Ben-Veniste, a former Watergate prosecutor, called the administration’s attempts to buck subpoenas “a serious escalation of the president’s effort to defy congressional oversight of the executive branch” and “a deep erosion of the fundamental precepts of the balance of power.”

“You can’t have a president acting as though he is the monarch,” he said.

Barr declined a request for comment.

A Justice Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the attorney general’s thinking, said that in his 40-year career, Barr “has been a respected and leading legal voice and his views reflect mainstream conservative legal thought.”

Barr has not been alone in advocating robust executive powers, a view articulated by Edwin Meese, attorney general under President Ronald Reagan; the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and Watergate-era Solicitor General Robert Bork, among others.

But Barr popularized, codified and interpreted the concept, helping put the theory into practice, legal experts and colleagues said.

“Barr’s great contribution is that he tried to make this theory a regular feature in the executive branch,” said John Yoo, who worked in the Office of Legal Counsel in the George W. Bush administration and wrote memos sanctioning the use of enhanced interrogation techniques, which many consider torture, after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

At times, Barr has pulled back from his role as the defender of the presidency. He was a backer of independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr when he was investigating President Bill Clinton, saying criticism by Clinton allies appeared to be an attempt to impede the investigation. He took a different stance when it came to assessing Trump’s attacks on the investigation by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III.

“There is substantial evidence to show that the president was frustrated and angered by a sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency, propelled by his political opponents, and fueled by illegal leaks,” Barr said last month at a news conference before the release of the Mueller report.

'Do what you have to do'

Barr began his government service as a CIA analyst and legislative affairs officer during the 1970s, when the agency was being investigated by Congress for excesses exposed during the Nixon era. He then served in the Reagan White House, working with vice presidential adviser C. Boyden Gray on an initiative to rein in regulatory agencies.

Friends and colleagues describe him as a constitutional scholar who has long been fascinated with the presidency. His views on executive power were also shaped by a concern about the diminution of presidential authority after Watergate, and further underlined after the 2001 terrorist attacks.

Jonathan Turley, a professor of constitutional law at George Washington University and a friend of Barr’s for decades, describes him as an intense, hands-on lawyer who would think nothing of writing a 10-page legal memo to a friend, associate or top government official.

“He makes me look well-rounded,” Turley said. “I am widely viewed as a dysfunctional legal geek. Bill Barr talks about the criminal code the way other people talk about baseball. It’s the subject he finds most engrossing.”

Colleagues say Barr has been influenced by the “unitary executive” theory, rooted in Article II of the Constitution, which holds that the president controls the entire executive branch. Such views were articulated by several of the Founding Fathers, who believed that presidents have “reservoirs of power,” Yoo said, noting that Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson discussed the need for presidents to have the authority to manage crises and unanticipated events.

Some legal scholars see Barr’s interpretation of the unitary executive as an aggressive expansion of presidential power that could undermine the independence of agencies such as the Federal Reserve.

“There are principled people who share this view today but, if it became law, it would be a radical sea change from almost 100 years of U.S. government practice and Supreme Court precedent,” said Martin Lederman, who served in the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel for nearly a decade.

As soon as he joined the Justice Department in 1989, Barr began arguing against attempts by Congress to interfere with the president’s appointment power and seek sensitive executive branch information, among other moves.

“Only by consistently and forcefully resisting such congressional incursions can executive branch prerogatives be preserved,” he wrote in his unsolicited memo that July.

The current Justice Department official said his opinion did not break new ground, but served as “a brief guide to allow non-specialists at other agencies [to] identify the kinds of separation-of-powers problems that often appeared in legislation.”

Dellinger said that although he agreed with many specific conclusions in Barr’s 1989 opinion, he sharply disagreed with others, calling it “a blunt instrument that did not sufficiently respect the role of Congress.”

Dawn Johnsen, a Clinton administration appointee who served as a deputy assistant attorney in the Office of Legal Counsel in the years after Barr left the department, said Barr’s view of the Constitution’s appointments clause “in some respects was extreme and in our view wrong. We disavowed it and did not follow it.”

That same summer, Barr wrote a secret opinion saying that the president had “inherent constitutional authority” to order the FBI to take people into custody in foreign countries in violation of international law. The opinion was a reversal for the office, which had concluded the opposite nine years earlier.

That December, Bush launched an invasion of Panama and seized Noriega, who was bought back to the United States to stand trial on charges of drug smuggling and money laundering.

In a 2001 interview with the University of Virginia’s presidential oral history project, Barr recalled getting a call from the White House asking whether the president could order troops into the streets of Panama City to help insurgents, and defeat Noriega and his supporters.

“I basically said, ‘Just go out there and do what you have to do,’ ” Barr said.

When members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee sought to review Barr’s legal reasoning in the Noriega case, he declined to provide them with his official opinion, instead offering a 13-page memo describing the “principal conclusions.”

Two years later, when the full opinion became public after it was subpoenaed by Congress, Barr was criticized for not being fully transparent with lawmakers. His description of the opinion failed to note that it authorized the president to ignore the U.N. Charter, a historic change in the U.S. view of international law — and presidential power.

“That is the first instance that I know of in which any U.S. government official took the view that the president has the authority to put the U.S. in breach of the United Nations Charter, a treaty principally written and promoted by the U.S.,” Lederman said. Although this view has more adherents today, Lederman said the notion that “the president alone could put the U.S. in breach of the charter was a novel and radical proposition at the time.”

The Justice Department said that Barr’s opinion reflected a long-established view by the executive branch, adding that he provided congressional testimony about a legal question that was the subject of a confidential opinion.

To longtime friends and fellow conservatives, the opinions he wrote simply reflect Barr’s principled views.

“He is a proponent of a strong executive, and has been all of his life,” said J. Michael Luttig, a former federal appeals court judge who worked closely with Barr at the Justice Department in the Bush era.

“It is not only natural but expected that an attorney general — who after all is an officer of the executive branch, not of the Congress or the judiciary — would be a proponent of presidential power,” he added.

On Jan. 8, 1990, Barr, then the deputy attorney general, was called to the White House to discuss a possible invasion of Iraq.

At the session in the Cabinet Room, attended by Gray, who was then White House counsel, Defense Secretary Richard B. Cheney and national security adviser Brent Scowcroft, Barr was asked by Bush whether an invasion required congressional approval, according to his oral history interview.

Barr told Bush that he did not need congressional approval to invade — and could even ignore a congressional resolution of disapproval, if one were passed.

“It’s irrelevant,” Barr recalled telling Bush about such a vote, adding: “It’s just an expression of opinion. They can’t change the Constitution by expressing their opinion on the matter. I would say you could still do it.”

Barr used the moment to school more senior government officials on the history of war powers, according to an account in Bob Woodward’s 1993 book, “The Commanders.”

The deputy attorney general said that there had been more than 200 occasions when presidents had committed military forces to act unilaterally. Of those, only five included congressional declarations of war, he said.

Barr told the group the situation they faced most closely resembled the Korean War, when President Harry Truman committed troops without a congressional resolution.

Still, Barr urged Bush to seek congressional support to strengthen his position.

He was interrupted by Cheney, who was deeply skeptical of consulting Congress before the invasion, according to Barr’s University of Virginia interview.

“You’re giving him political advice, not legal advice,” he recalled Cheney saying.

The deputy attorney general retorted: “No, I’m giving him both political and legal advice. They’re really sort of together when you get to this level.”

Although presidents of both parties have authorized military action without congressional approval during the past half a century, a vigorous debate continues about when the Constitution requires congressional consent.

Barr also played a pivotal role in the Iran-contra investigation, recommending that Bush pardon former defense secretary Caspar W. Weinberger and five other Reagan administration officials charged for their roles in the arms-for-hostages scheme.

When he did so on Christmas Eve in 1992, Bush said the pardons were merited because the men involved had long records of public service, had acted out of patriotism and had already suffered damaged careers and financial losses.

But independent counsel Lawrence Walsh said in a statement at the time that the presidential pardons were part of a “cover-up” that “undermines the principle that no man is above the law.”

In his oral history, Barr described Walsh as “a head hunter” who “had completely lost perspective.”

He declined to discuss Walsh further, saying: “I don’t know what to say in polite company.”

Barr took a different view when Starr, as independent counsel, investigated Clinton — an inquiry that began with an examination of the suicide of Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster and Arkansas real estate investments and expanded into Clinton’s relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.

In March 1998, Barr joined with three other former attorneys general in lambasting the Clinton White House for criticizing Starr, saying the president’s allies appear “to have the improper purpose of influencing and impeding an ongoing criminal investigation and intimidating possible jurors, witnesses and even investigators.”

They wrote that although they opposed the independent counsel act, anyone serving in that position “should be allowed to carry out his or her duties without harassment by government officials and members of the bar.”

The current Justice Department official said that even though Barr had concerns about the independent counsel act, he has supported such investigations in the past.

“Attorney General Barr’s statements about the Starr investigation and his support for the integrity and character of Ken Starr reflected his views on those matters, and are hardly inconsistent with his view of the independent counsel statute itself,” the official said.

For his part, Starr said in an interview that he and Barr shared concerns about the independent counsel law, which Congress declined to renew when it expired in 1999.

“We were both firmly of the view that the post-Watergate reform represented an unconstitutional intrusion into the power of the executive, a view that was advanced by attorneys general of both parties,” he said.

Last June, Barr — then in private practice — sent an unsolicited 19-page memo to Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, challenging the basis of Mueller’s investigation into possible obstruction of justice by the president.

“Constitutionally, it is wrong to conceive of the President as simply the highest office within the Executive branch hierarchy,” he wrote. “He alone is the Executive branch.”

Less than a year later, Barr — now installed at the head of the Justice Department — gave Congress his “principal conclusions” on Mueller’s findings, adding that he and Rosenstein concluded that the special counsel did not find sufficient evidence to support a charge of obstruction.

During his short tenure back as attorney general, Barr has already supported some of Trump’s most controversial policy decisions. He issued an order directing immigration judges to deny some migrants a chance to post bond, supporting Trump’s promise to end the “catch and release” of migrants crossing the border. During congressional testimony last month, he defended administration’s efforts to strike down the Affordable Care Act.

And last week, the Justice Department backed Trump as the president asserted executive privilege over Mueller’s report, his first such exercise of that executive authority.

Hours later, the House Judiciary Committee voted along party lines to hold Barr in contempt of Congress for ignoring a congressional subpoena.

Legal experts have said that the administration’s refusal to comply with congressional demands threatens to undermine Congress’s authority, embedded in the Constitution as a separate branch of government.

Dellinger, who criticized some of the opinions Barr issued at the Office of Legal Counsel during the first Bush administration, said he is even more concerned about him serving a president like Trump.

“This is a president uniquely in need of restraining forces, and I am concerned that Mr. Barr’s approach is not one of restraint,” Dellinger said.

For his part, the president seems thrilled with his new attorney general.

“He’s an outstanding man, he’s an outstanding legal mind,” Trump said of Barr after the attorney general’s day-long grilling from the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this month, which included a defense of executive authority. “He performed incredibly well.”

Luttig, Barr’s longtime friend, said Barr did not take the job to back Trump politically but rather “to protect the rule of law and help navigate the country through this tumultuous moment,” adding that the attorney general has a deep reverence for the Justice Department and the FBI.

Barr “is disinterested in the incumbent president as a political figure,” said Luttig, and “views his responsibilities and obligations as solely to the Constitution.”

"Exxon and Energy Department Team Up on Biofuels, Plastics Research",https://www.scientificamerican.com,"['John Fialka E E News', 'About The Author S', 'John Fialka', 'Recent Articles', 'E E News']",,,,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/exxon-and-energy-department-team-up-on-biofuels-plastics-research/,"Research collaborations for cleaner, more energy-dense biofuels and recyclable plastics are at the heart of a new agreement between Exxon Mobil Corp. and Department of Energy laboratories.

Bill Farris, associate director of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, Colo., explained that the agreement will give scientists better insights into future energy markets and ways to scale up cleaner forms of energy.

“Exxon has to think about how you scale things up,” Farris said in an interview about Exxon’s commitment to contribute $100 million to research by NREL and 16 other DOE laboratories over the next 10 years. “That’s probably one of the things we’re most excited about: taking things into the marketplace at scale. NREL could never do that alone.”

He said discussions that led to the agreement last week—one of the largest research projects that DOE labs have with a commercial company—started with biofuels and then expanded to a broad array of joint research discussions that are still underway. The labs and Exxon started talking about the agreement in November 2017.

They began with Vijay Swarup, vice president of research and development at Exxon Mobil Research and Engineering Co. “Sparks started to fly, we developed a good relationship,” recalled Farris.

In a statement released last week, Swarup said the research partnership is intended to “explore ways to bring biofuels and carbon capture and [energy] storage to commercial uses across the power generation, transportation, and manufacturing sectors.”

Exxon is the largest publicly traded international oil and gas company, and it has stressed that the agreement with DOE is designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions “on a global basis.”

Biofuels will likely be essential to that effort in the transportation sector, explained Farris, because while research has shown that electric cars can reduce greenhouse gases, the trucking and aircraft industries will require more energy-dense fuels to reduce their emissions. NREL has been experimenting with various biofuels to deliver extra energy, and Exxon has focused on algae-based fuels to fill the gap. But it will likely take more experiments and collaborations to see what technology can be scaled up for global use.

One possibility that’s intriguing researchers is fuel made from captured carbon dioxide emissions. Both NREL and its sister laboratory in West Virginia, DOE’s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), are working on capturing emissions and putting them to use.

Exxon is interested in that, as well, along with ways to store energy. The use of hydrogen-based fuels as a way to store renewable forms of energy from electricity sources, such as solar and wind power, is another research objective.

“We see renewable energy producing electricity at very, very low costs in the future,” explained Farris, pointing to uses in transportation, buildings, factories and homes.

NREL has smaller research partnerships with other major oil companies, including Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Norway’s Equinor ASA and France’s Total SA. “They’re all trying to figure out what future markets are going to look like. Where Exxon is coming from, for example, the planet is going to have 9 billion people, and the quality of their life depends on that energy, and that energy has to have lower carbon,” added Farris.

One of the questions under scrutiny by oil companies, he said, is what future gas stations will look like. While Exxon hasn’t raised the question yet in its discussions with DOE, “I have to think they’re interested in that,” Farris said.

Major oil companies own a large number of gas stations, and in the future they may be required to supply fuel cell-powered cars with hydrogen to recharge electric cars quickly and to supply biofuels for heavy trucks.

Exxon, Farris noted, has a substantial presence in the chemical industry, and one of its research objectives is plastics that don’t use petroleum feedstocks, or that can be recycled to rid the world of its plastic waste problem, which is mounting annually.

In the near future, dozens of Exxon scientists from Texas and the East Coast will be coming to Golden to work on some of these projects with their counterparts at NREL. “If you can increase the contact time between researchers, we think you get better results,” Farris said.

"FDA can’t control death penalty drugs, DOJ says",https://www.politico.com,['Josh Gerstein'],05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/14/fda-death-penalty-drugs-1323248,"“The Constitution and numerous federal statutes presuppose that capital punishment will remain available and that the federal government will defer to States over methods of execution,” the opinion says. | California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation via Getty Images legal FDA can’t control death penalty drugs, DOJ says

The Justice Department issued a legal opinion that could lead to more executions in the U.S. by easing the availability of drugs used to carry out lethal injections.

The opinion from the Office of Legal Counsel says the Food and Drug Administration lacks the authority to regulate drugs or other items when used in connection with the death penalty.

Story Continued Below

The immediate effect of the Trump administration decision is unclear because of a court injunction issued in 2012 barring the FDA from allowing the importation of a key execution drug, sodium thiopental. Shortages of that drug have led many states to scale back or halt executions in recent years.

In a statement, an FDA spokesperson said the agency would “follow the conclusion of the opinion to the extent permissible” by the 7-year-old order, which remains in effect.

The 26-page opinion , signed by Assistant Attorney General Steven Engel, indicates that it was sought by the attorney general's office, but does not say when. OLC opinions are traditionally treated as controlling law within the executive branch. Courts often take note of such high-level legal advice when it is made public, but are not obliged to follow the opinions.

Engel’s opinion argues that drugs and other items intended for use in executions are not covered by the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, passed in 1938 and repeatedly updated by Congress. The legal memo also says that conclusion is reinforced by so-called federalism problems that could arise from federal officials trying to enforce such regulations in a way that would frustrate state efforts to carry out executions.

“The FDCA cannot be read as authorizing FDA to effectively ban capital punishment, because that reading would contravene or render moot a host of federal statutes that presuppose the lawfulness of capital punishment,” Engel wrote in the opinion, dated May 3 and released by the Justice Department on Tuesday evening.

“The Constitution and numerous federal statutes presuppose that capital punishment will remain available and that the federal government will defer to States over methods of execution,” the opinion says. “Interpreting the FDCA to bar the importation, sale, and distribution of articles intended for use in executions would conflict with that settled understanding. The FDCA’s definitions of ‘drug’ and ‘device’ are broad, but breadth alone fails to manifest the intent needed to alter federal-state relations so dramatically with respect to capital punishment.”

While the 2012 injunction was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit the next year, Engel’s opinion downplays the significance of those rulings. “Neither the district court, nor the D.C. Circuit, addressed the broader question of FDA’s jurisdiction,” the opinion says.

When the only U.S. manufacturer of sodium thiopental stopped production in 2009, states began scrambling to find stocks of the drug in the U.S. and abroad. After the 2012 injunction, the FDA moved to halt such imports. In 2015, it blocked a shipment headed for a Texas prison.

Because of the shortage, states have turned to a variety of other methods for executions, including substitutions for thiopental in a three-drug combination and the use of a single drug, pentobarbital. Some of the new methods resulted in a spate of episodes in which the condemned gasped, convulsed or cried out during the execution process.

States have carried out about 25 executions a year since 2015, a significant drop-off from the previous two decades. The last federal execution was in 2003.

The TSA Is Sending Hundreds of Employees to the Border,http://nymag.com,['Adam K. Raymond'],05-15-2019,2019,5,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/05/the-tsa-is-sending-hundreds-of-employees-to-the-border.html,"The scene at the U.S.-Mexico border. Photo: David Peinado/NurPhoto via Getty Images

As many as 400 Transportation Security Administration (TSA) employees will soon arrive at the southwest border to work alongside Customs and Border Protection to address an increasingly problematic border situation, CNN reported Wednesday. The move was subsequently acknowledged by a TSA spokesman. “TSA, like all DHS components, is supporting the DHS effort to address the humanitarian and security crisis at the southwest border. TSA is in the process of soliciting volunteers to support this effort while minimizing operational impact,” spokesman James Gregory said.

It’s unclear just what the TSA employees will be doing at the border — CNN says they’ll receive legal training and then be “designated as immigration officers and assist Customs and Border Protection officers and agents with their work.” What does seem clear is that there’s a greater possibility for something bad to happen while they’re away.

In internal emails obtained by CNN, the TSA says transferring employees comes with “some risk as we enter a very busy summer” and that it represents an “additional challenge” for the agency.

TSA airport screeners of the type familiar to most travelers aren’t the ones being redeployed, but rather behind-the-scenes air marshals and “security ops” officers.

Removing these officers from airports at the start of the summer travel season seems like a risky political play, potentially exposing the Trump administration to criticism if anything goes wrong. And it doesn’t require a disaster: Recall that it was the bad press stemming from long waits and painful delays at airports brought on in part by a shortage of TSA agents that helped end this year’s government shutdown.

It’s possible, though, that the Trump administration might see any airport chaos brought about by the TSA transfer as a boon of sorts: If moving agents away from airports makes life hell for travelers, they may blame migrants and the border “crisis” for their misery — music to the administration’s ears."
"Trump administration breaks campaign promise, purges 200,000 VA healthcare applications",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-13-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/trump-administration-breaks-campaign-promise-purges-200-000-va-healthcare-applications,"""The current state of the Department of Veterans Affairs is absolutely unacceptable,” presidential candidate Donald Trump said when speaking at a rally on Oct. 31, 2015, in front of the retired battleship USS Wisconsin in Norfolk, Va.

""Over 300,000 — and this is hard to believe, and it’s actually much more than that now — over 300,000 veterans died waiting for care,"" said Trump.

Trump’s strong condemnation of the Obama administration’s handling of the backlog of hundreds of thousands of veteran benefits claims made him the overwhelming choice for many veteran voters in 2016.

But after two years in the White House, the Trump administration has decided to execute a plan to purge 200,000 applications for VA healthcare caused by known administrative errors within VA’s enrollment process and enrollment system — problems that had already been documented by the Office of the Inspector General in 2015 and 2017.

In purging this massive backlog of applications, the VA is declaring the applications to be incomplete due to errors by the applicants, despite the OIG findings and in violation of the promise Trump made to fix the system. This purge has the dual effect of letting the VA avoid the work of processing the applications and absolving the agency of any responsibility for veterans’ delayed access to health and disability benefits.

Under the supervision of Dr. Richard Stone, the executive in charge of the Veterans Health Administration, VHA managers last November instructed the agency’s IT staff members to purge over 200,000 pending healthcare applications.

Such a profound decision to deny veterans benefits should have to come from someone higher up — the president or the Secretary of Veterans Affairs — not from a career bureaucrat who has not been elected or confirmed by the Senate.

This purge flies in the face of previous guidance provided by lawmakers. On March 3, 2017, Senate and House Veterans Affairs committee members sent a joint letter to the VA, instructing the agency to delay its plans to purge these records. The committees wanted the VA to send new letters to veterans, informing them of their application status and potential equitable relief or financial reimbursement for service-connected health expenses caused by enrollment system errors, as prescribed by law.

Currently, VA is skirting this provision of the law by blaming veteran applicants for the agency’s own mistakes processing health and disability claims. As a result, to win benefits wrongfully denied due to VA’s administrative errors, veterans are forced to go to court and pay legal fees out of whatever benefits they ultimately win.

The Trump administration’s decision opens the door to the agency purging any future backlog of veteran claims for benefits by falsely declaring the applications incomplete due to veteran error.

This is the second time the VA has been caught using its IT department to adjudicate benefits for veterans. In January 2017, the IT department auto-enrolled over 70,000 Iraq and Afghanistan combat veterans whose applications had erroneously been held up until they could meet a “means test” — that is, prove their income level. This mass-approval of applications was done in preparation for then-Under Secretary David Shulkin’s confirmation hearing.

They did this without bothering to fix the systemic error that required proof of income from combat veterans, who aren’t required to provide it. As a result, there are still more than 20,000 Iraq and Afghanistan combat veterans being denied healthcare benefits due to an erroneous means-test requirement.

Moreover, the means test error in the enrollment system not only affects veteran access to healthcare benefits, but it also causes billing errors for thousands of veterans each year.

The Veterans Health Administration’s Member Services office, which manages the enrollment system, had to reexamine over 6,000 veteran income verification cases, because veterans were overbilled for medical copays ranging from $200 to $3,000. About 1,000 veterans are believed to receive fraudulent bills from the VA every month due to this known system error.

Despite being aware of these systemic issues for years, VA has not initiated an outreach campaign to educate the veteran community about what to do if their application is in a pending status or if they get a fraudulent bill due to missing means-test information.

Instead, the agency has chosen a policy of sending a single notification letter for pending applications, despite knowing that 25% of the letters mailed to veterans are returned or placed on hold due to bad address information in the enrollment system.

Iraq and Afghanistan combat veterans routinely have incorrect address information in the enrollment system because they do not have permanent non-military addresses at the time of enrollment during the demobilization process.

The VA could resolve this problem through its data-sharing agreement with the Internal Revenue Service and Social Security Administration, to get current addresses for veterans in the pending backlog. But unfortunately for veterans, it is the VA’s practice to use information from the IRS and SSA only for the purposes of billing and verifying veterans’ dates of death.

All of these issues could be easily fixed. This is why President Trump’s reversal on this issue is so disappointing to the veteran community. Many veterans are asking why the enrollment system was not included in the President’s VA information technology modernization plan.

As a result, 200,000 applications have been purged, violating Trump’s promise. Currently, over 300,000 additional veteran healthcare applications remain in a pending status and will most likely be purged in the near future.

In the absence of executive leadership from the White House, veterans will continue to be denied access to their healthcare benefits at a rate of nearly 5,000 new pending healthcare applications per month.

Rosenstein slams Comey for becoming a 'partisan pundit',https://www.politico.com,"['Caitlin Oprysko', 'Burgess Everett']",05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/14/rod-rosenstein-james-comey-doj-1319967,"Former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein called the investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia justified and pledged he would never have let anyone interfere with that investigation. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Politics Rosenstein slams Comey for becoming a 'partisan pundit'

Former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein criticized former FBI Director James Comey for becoming a “partisan pundit” in the two years since he was fired by President Donald Trump.

In some of Rosenstein’s first extended remarks since leaving the Justice Department last week, the former deputy attorney general called Comey’s dismissal, which set off a firestorm in Washington and resulted in the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller, “reasonable under the circumstances,” citing Comey’s handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation.

Story Continued Below

Rosenstein, who authored the memo that the Trump administration initially held up as the reason for Comey’s firing, said the president did not tell him what to put in that memo. And he said that though he didn’t dislike Comey — “On the contrary, I admired him personally” — the former FBI director crossed certain “bright lines” that were “not within the realm of reasonable decisions.”

“I would be the last one to condemn anyone for a judgment call,” Rosenstein said in remarks to the Greater Baltimore Committee's annual meeting. “These jobs are difficult. They involve choices that invite criticism.”

Still, the former deputy attorney general said “the clearest mistake” Comey made was announcing his recommendation about the investigation into Clinton’s private email server at a news conference in which he discussed “details about the investigation without the informed consent of the prosecutors and the attorney general.” He also criticized Comey for his letter to lawmakers in the 2016 presidential campaign's final days informing them the Clinton email investigation had been reopened.

The former deputy attorney general said that had he been in Trump’s shoes when the president was deciding whether to fire Comey in 2017, he would have included “a more balanced analysis of the pros and cons.” He also said he would have ensured Comey’s dismissal was carried out with “far more respect and far less drama,” alluding to Comey finding out about his dismissal on TV during a trip to Los Angeles.

“So I do not blame the former director for being angry. I would be too if I were in his shoes,” Rosenstein said. ""But now the former director seems to be acting as a partisan pundit, selling books and earning speaking fees while speculating about the strength of my character and the fate of my immortal soul. I kid you not.""

Rosenstein’s criticism of Comey is the latest salvo in what has evolved into a war of words between the two former colleagues. Comey has become a major public figure in the wake of his dismissal and has been at times lauded as a hero by Trump’s critics. Several weeks ago, Comey penned an op-ed in The New York Times ripping into Attorney General William Barr and accusing Barr and others in Trump’s administration of lacking the “inner strength” to stand up to the president and writing that Trump “eats your soul in small bites.” In a televised town hall last week, Comey described Rosenstein to CNN’s Anderson Cooper as a person “of accomplishment but not real sterling character, strong character.”

""That is disappointing,"" Rosenstein shot back Monday. ""Speculating about souls is not a job for police and prosecutors.""

But while he defended Trump’s decision to fire Comey and his own role in the move, Rosenstein criticized the president’s manner of doing so and called the department’s investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia justified and said he would never have let anyone interfere with that investigation.

The former deputy attorney general argued that several of Trump’s campaign aides were under FBI investigation for their communications with Russian agents.

“At the time these were allegations. They were leads, what we call predication,” he said, adding later that the department was “not out to get anyone — we’re out to follow facts.”

He also appeared to take credit for an investigation into the Russia probe’s origins, telling the audience he wanted to ensure the Justice Department's inspector general was conducting a thorough examination of the surveillance of the Trump campaign."
Interior's border surge puts more officers in unfamiliar role,https://thehill.com,[],05-15-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/443727-interiors-border-surge-puts-more-officers-in-unfamiliar-role,"The Interior Department has doubled the number of law enforcement officers it’s sending to the border, according to new data reviewed by The Hill, putting police who usually patrol national parks and wildlife refuges in the new and unfamiliar role of dealing with a surge in immigration.

Since the pilot program began last May, Interior has increased the number of law enforcement officers assigned to assist U.S. Border Patrol under its surge support operations, from 22 to 47.

Critics of the Trump administration’s deployment say the Interior officers are untrained to handle immigration issues at the border.

“Quite frankly, they are just being thrown into the mix and there isn’t any training,” said Michael Shalton, president of the U.S. Park Police (USPP) Fraternal Order of Police. “They are just supplementing and being told to do whatever Border Patrol tells them to do.”

USPP officers are ill-equipped for the border assignments because for many of them, urban policing is their primary role, Shalton said. Park police are traditionally tasked with overseeing federal parks and roadways in Washington, D.C., New York City and San Francisco.

“It’s an officer safety concern. And as far as folks receiving adequate training in a desert environment, officers in the Northeast aren’t really being prepared for that,” he said. “We have voiced concerns, but it has fallen on deaf ears.”

Officers participating in the year-old pilot program now outnumber permanent Interior law enforcement staff assigned to federal lands along the Mexican border, according to agency figures.

The roughly 47 officers sent from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), National Park Service (NPS) and Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) for three-week temporary posts along the border exceed the 41 full-time staff stationed at the parks and refuges adjacent to Mexico.

While the number of officers detailed to the border is small when compared with the thousands of National Guard troops recently assigned to the area, critics say the absence of officers from their regular posts is a big drain on an already-shrinking staff.

“I have no problem with reporting whatever mission we’re tasked with doing, but we have to have adequate staffing here and we have to be supplemented,” Shalton said.

He said there are about 570 officers in D.C., a decrease of almost 100 from a decade ago.

“That’s a lot for a small agency,” he added.

Former Wyoming GOP lawmaker mulling Senate bid to replace Enzi MORE, who said it would be one of several steps the agency would take to ""secure the homeland.""

The Senate last month confirmed Secretary David Bernhardt as the new agency chief.

First labeled as a pilot program designed to bolster President Trump Donald John TrumpNapolitano claims Trump violated separation of powers 3 times in last week Work on surprise medical bills goes into overdrive Trump pardons media tycoon, former GOP leader of California State Assembly MORE’s border security initiative, the operation is expected to continue detailing Interior’s park police and wildlife refuge enforcement officers to the border.

The agency's budget request for 2020 highlights the border surge as an ongoing priority. Interior asked for $930.3 million in law enforcement funding for such programs starting Oct. 1.

“The Department of the Interior manages hundreds of miles along the U.S. southern border, and our law enforcement officers are vested partners in the administration’s border security efforts,” Interior wrote in its March budget overview. “This budget continues to support a robust law enforcement program.”

The request for border enforcement funding comes as the department overall faces steep budget cuts. Trump’s spending proposal for 2020 calls for slashing Interior's budget by 14 percent.

The Interior Department is already facing a more than $11 billion maintenance backlog that some experts say was compounded by this year’s 35-day partial government shutdown, when the majority of parks remained open to the public.

As part of the surge, Interior law enforcement officers were initially stationed at places like South Texas National Wildlife Refuge and Organ Pipe Cactus National Park in Arizona, according to an internal document obtained by The Hill through a Freedom of Information Act request.

The memorandum dated May 1, 2018, and signed by Scott Cameron, acting Interior assistant secretary, said Border Patrol (BP) chose areas they believe “best address the support mission.”

“The DOI’s commitment to this surge mission will assist BP in preventing illegal entry into the United States, and will protect our federal lands, to include the natural and cultural resources as well as enhance visitor safety and experience,” Cameron wrote.

Interior declined to provide any update on new locations for law enforcement officers along the border.

The agency says it has reason to celebrate the initiative. Interior officers have apprehended 7,183 migrants and seized 1,487 pounds of marijuana on federal land along the border, according to internal data shared with The Hill.

“The 2020 budget helps foster safe and drug-free communities by increasing funding for law enforcement,” the agency wrote in its budget proposal.

Larry Cosme, national executive vice president for the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, said some Interior officers supported their mission at the border.

""We, the men and women, civil servants, place the needs of our country above ourselves sometimes,” he said. “In this case, homeland defense and security is the need of our country and the men and women stand by to serve, protect and defend. At this time, it is along the southern border.”

But one NPS law enforcement officer who was detailed to the border said the arrest and drug-seizure numbers are little to boast about.

“Fifteen-hundred pounds on DOI land seems like nothing. That doesn’t seem low for now, though, because there is less marijuana on DOI lands than there were two years ago,” the officer told The Hill, pointing to the overall drop in marijuana smuggling at the border.

“This is an inappropriate use of government money. ... The numbers are the same. I was kinda hopeful that when Zinke left this would fade away, and this is very clearly not fading away.”

For comparison, U.S. Border Patrol seized 300,289 pounds of marijuana and arrested 396,579 illegal crossers in fiscal 2018.

Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, which oversees Interior, called the department’s border program “a sustained attack on the rule of law.”

“The president’s border policies have gone from a political stunt to a sustained attack on the rule of law. He and his friends in Washington lie to the public and manipulate immigration data to excuse their racist, counterproductive efforts to militarize our border with one of our oldest allies,” Grijalva, whose congressional district borders Mexico, told The Hill in a statement Tuesday.

“Treating law enforcement agents like the president’s personal toys is a hallmark of a banana republic, not a functioning democracy,” he said.

Interior did not respond to a request for comment.

Grijalva on Wednesday will lead House Democrats in grilling Bernhardt, who is attending his first hearing in front of the committee as Interior chief, and the role of agency officers is expected to come up.

“The Interior Department needs to explain immediately why these transfers are a good use of taxpayer money,” Grijalva said. “And if it can’t, this farcical program needs to shut down.”"

In a letter released Tuesday, Wyden (D-Ore.) asked Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to turn over any communications his agency has had with the White House or Trump’s personal lawyers related to Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal’s (D-Mass.) request last month for the returns.

Wyden also wants details of any meetings, discussions, memoranda and other documents related to the denial.

“I am concerned that you are taking unprecedented steps that seriously undermine the ability of the congressional tax-writing committees to obtain tax return information necessary to the performance of their legislative duties,” Wyden wrote.

He sent a separate letter to IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig asking for details of his contacts with the agency’s legal staff regarding Neal's request.

The letters come one day before Mnuchin and Rettig are slated to appear before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on the Treasury Department’s annual budget request.

Neal last month requested six years' worth of Trump’s personal returns and some of his business returns under a 95-year old statute allowing the heads of Congress’ tax committees to examine anyone’s private tax information. Mnuchin refused, saying Democrats do not have a legitimate reason for seeking the filings, and he now faces a May 17 deadline to comply with a subpoena for the records.

VA Sec. Wilkie: A breakthrough in health care for veterans is coming in June -- Here's what to expect,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Robert Wilkie', 'Robert Wilkie Is The Secretary Of The U.S. Department Of Veterans Affairs']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/sec-robert-wilkie-bringing-bipartisan-reform-to-veterans,"Imagine if Republicans and Democrats worked together to pass reforms that improve the lives of millions of people.

And imagine if those reforms put America’s veterans at the center of their health care decisions, leading to better customer service for our nation’s heroes.

This isn’t hypothetical. It happened last year when Congress passed the MISSION Act.

TRUMP REPORTEDLY TAKING BROAD LOOK AT VETERANS CONVICTED OF BATTLEFIELD CRIMES

The law gives the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) the ability to provide veterans with the best health care possible, whether at VA health care facilities or with community providers.

The legislation sailed through Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support and the strong backing of veterans service organizations.

President Donald J. Trump’s signature put us on a path to implementing these reforms. On June 6, the MISSION Act will enable VA to consolidate the department’s community care efforts into a single, simple-to-use program that will empower veterans with the ability to choose the health care providers they trust.

So what can veterans expect on June 6?

Less red tape, more satisfaction and predictability for patients, more efficiency for our clinicians, and better value for taxpayers.

Veterans will be eligible to get community care for a variety of reasons, including when VA can’t provide the treatment they need or when care outside our system is in the best medical interest of the patient.

We listened to veterans and heard they preferred standards based on drive times rather than driving mileage because those standards better reflect veteran experiences, especially in large urban areas with lots of traffic.

To ensure our veterans are spending their time getting care instead of driving to it, patients facing an average drive time of 30-minutes or more for VA primary or mental health care, or non-institutional extended care services, will have the option of choosing a community provider closer to home. For specialty care, the drive-time standard will be an average of 60 minutes.

And to get veterans the care they need when they need it, VA patients facing a 20-day or more wait time for primary or mental health care, or non-institutional extended care services, will have the option of choosing a community provider who can deliver that care faster. For specialty care, the wait-time standard will be 28 days.

For additional convenience and timely treatment, eligible veterans will also have access to urgent, walk-in care that gives them the choice to receive certain services at participating community clinics in their communities. (To access this new benefit, veterans will select a provider in VA’s community care network and may be charged a copayment.)

Veterans will be encouraged to ask VA about these new options, and well-trained staff will be available to help them quickly understand their choices.

These exciting and important changes speak to my top priority – delivering the best medical customer service and offering veterans more health care choices.

With the MISSION Act, the future of the VA health care system will lie in the hands of veterans – precisely where it should be.

While we still have more work to do, the VA is making progress.

We are seeing more patients than ever before, more quickly than ever before and studies show VA now compares favorably to the private sector for access and quality of care – and in many cases exceeds it.

And veterans have noticed.

Patients’ trust in VA care has skyrocketed to 87.7 percent, and in the last fiscal year, VA completed more than 58 million internal appointments – a record high and 623,000 more than the year before.

VA employees are noticing improvements as well. VA ranked sixth out of 17 Federal Government agencies in the Partnership for Public Service’s most recent “Best Places to Work” survey, up from 17th the year prior.

To maintain the trust of our veterans, we must continue to deliver. And we will constantly innovate, upgrade, and pursue ways to better serve our Nation’s heroes.

The MISSION Act is a vital part of this effort, giving VA the ability to implement the best practices we’ve learned in our nearly 75 years of experience offering community care.

The core of the doctor-patient relationship is trust. President Trump promised veterans that this core value would shape the VA.

DHS to divert air marshals to border to manage surge in migrant crossings: report,https://thehill.com,[],05-15-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/latino/443962-dhs-to-divert-air-marshals-to-border-to-help-handle-migrant-surgereport,"The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has reportedly begun reassigning federal agents from airports to the U.S.–Mexico border in order to help manage the surge of migrants attempting to cross into the United States.

The New York Times reported Wednesday that Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has requested hundreds of volunteers to send to the border to help transport migrants, hand out meals and provide legal aid.

A Homeland Security official reportedly told the paper that some of the agents will come from the Federal Air Marshal Service and from the Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response team. Such agents typically provide security, undercover, at airports and on airplanes, four department officials told the paper.

The volunteers who are reassigned reportedly make up less than 1 percent of the TSA's 60,000 employees, according to the Times. The group will not include agents who conduct airport security screenings.

“The department is considering all options to address the humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border,” DHS Acting Assistant Secretary Tyler Q. Houlton told the Times. “We will continue to work with our work force to find dynamic solutions and funding to address this very serious problem.""

Homeland security officials reportedly told the paper that the reassignments have raised concerns about longer waiting periods for commercial vehicles at ports of entry, as well as fears of security risks going unmonitored.

The Hill has reached out to DHS and TSA for comment.

The Times noted that DHS in recent months has sent Coast Guard teams and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents who usually conduct criminal probes to the border amid a surge in migrants crossing into the U.S. The Coast Guard is part of DHS.

Last month saw more than 98,900 migrants cross into the U.S., according to federal statistics. Customs and Border Protection officials detained 109,144 migrants at the southern border, marking the highest number in more than a decade."

Columnist

Reading George Packer’s sprawling, mesmerizing biography “Our Man: Richard Holbrooke and the End of the American Century,” I felt a shock of recognition. Not just because I knew Holbrooke and could so readily recognize him in Packer’s novelistic portrait. I realized that Holbrooke could be egomaniacal, but, like Packer, I liked and respected him anyway. He was charming company and a supportive mentor, at least when you were no threat to him — and I wasn’t.

But there’s another reason I felt a pang of familiarity while devouring “Our Man”: Packer’s description of Holbrooke reminded me of the protagonist of my book “The Road Not Taken: Edward Lansdale and the American Tragedy in Vietnam.” Lansdale was a legendary covert operative who, while working for the CIA, masterminded the defeat of the Hukbalahap rebellion, a communist insurgency in the Philippines, in the early 1950s, and then moved to Saigon, where in 1954 he helped create the state of South Vietnam.

There were, to be sure, many differences between them. Lansdale was never as ambitious or egotistical as Holbrooke, who once told a girlfriend, “I’m going to be the next Henry Kissinger.” (“That was the end of her fling with Holbrooke,” Packer writes.) Nor was he a social climber like Holbrooke, who cultivated powerful older men such as W. Averell Harriman and romanced successful women such as TV journalist Diane Sawyer. Lansdale’s ambition was to advance the cause of democracy in Asia, not himself. He even hesitated to accept an offer from President John F. Kennedy to become the U.S. ambassador to South Vietnam. Holbrooke, by contrast, was incessantly scheming for self-advancement. The only jobs he refused were the ones he judged beneath his exalted status. Holbrooke’s epic womanizing also put Lansdale to shame. Lansdale had only one mistress — Pat Kelly, the great love of his life — and he eventually married her after the death of his first wife.

But despite the many differences, I detected a strong resemblance between Holbrooke and Lansdale. Both were unconventional, strong-willed, occasionally ruthless characters. Both were animated by a powerful, perhaps excessive, faith in the United States as a force for good. Both played by their own rules. And both could not hide their disdain for deskbound, risk-averse bureaucrats.

The similarities were not coincidental. Holbrooke’s first job as a tyro diplomat in 1963 was working in Saigon for the U.S. Embassy’s Office of Rural Affairs. Its head was Rufus Phillips, a courtly Virginian, late of Yale University and the CIA, who was a protege of Lansdale’s. He taught the young Holbrooke the tenets of “Lansdalism”: To win a war among the people, you had to win over the people rather than blow them to smithereens. This was a simple yet powerful insight, later labeled “population-centric counterinsurgency,” that Holbrooke imbibed long before it became fashionable.

Phillips also reflected Lansdale’s informal and idealistic approach. Rural Affairs was a “shirtsleeves” outfit where no one stood on protocol and everyone was encouraged to get close to the Vietnamese people. Before long, Holbrooke was a provincial representative far from the comforts of Saigon. Decades later, when Holbrooke was appointed special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Packer writes, he modeled his office on Rural Affairs — “the freedom and openness, the hostility to bureaucratic convention, the sense of excitement and risk.”

That Holbrooke ended his career working for the secretary of state, rather than being secretary of state himself, was a source of endless frustration to him. So, too, was the fact that his advice was constantly ignored. Lansdale suffered a similar, agonizing fate: He was sidelined from Vietnam policy in the Kennedy administration as the United States was drawing closer to a quagmire that he saw more clearly than most. When Lansdale went back to Vietnam in 1965 to work on winning “hearts and minds,” he was as ineffectual as Holbrooke proved to be on Afghanistan policy in 2009-2010.

Both Holbrooke and Lansdale blamed others for their downfall, but ultimately both sabotaged themselves through a lack of self-awareness. While interviewing for a job in the Obama administration, Holbrooke corrected President-elect Barack Obama when Obama referred to him as “Dick.” “Would you do me a favor, Mr. President?” Holbrooke said. “It’s important to my wife that you call me ‘Richard.'” Little wonder Obama had an instant aversion to him. Lansdale was similarly clueless in his dealings with Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara. He would lecture on how to fight the Viet Cong while failing to notice the secretary’s eyes glaze over. “He was turning McNamara off,” a subordinate told me, “but waxing more and more enthusiastic, speaking more rapidly.”

The tragedy of Holbrooke’s and Lansdale’s lives is that if they had attained higher office, they might have changed U.S. foreign policy for the better, perhaps avoiding costly mistakes in Vietnam and Afghanistan. They certainly could have done better than many of the inoffensive nonentities who supplanted them. As it was, they achieved a great deal — Lansdale in defeating communism in the Philippines, Holbrooke in negotiating peace in Bosnia. But their maverick ways ultimately caused them to be rejected by the system. Presidents in the future would be well-advised to show greater tolerance for troublemakers and truth tellers.

Dems tee up new document fight with DOJ over Obamacare,https://www.politico.com,['Kyle Cheney'],05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/14/democrats-doj-obamacare-1318932,"Attorney General William Barr's decision to stop defending the constitutionality of Obamacare has lead to heightened scrutiny from Democratic lawmakers. | Alex Wong/Getty Images Health care Dems tee up new document fight with DOJ over Obamacare

House Democrats are mounting yet another confrontation with the Justice Department that could lead to subpoenas, but this time it's not about special counsel Robert Mueller's report — it's about health care.

Five committee chairmen foreshadowed a possible subpoena as soon as May 24 if Attorney General William Barr declines to provide documents related to his decision to stop defending the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act — the health care law signed by President Barack Obama in 2010.

Story Continued Below

In letters to Barr and White House counsel Pat Cipollone, the chairmen wrote they've been asking since April 8 for documents connected to the decision, as well as testimony from four key officials involved in the effort. The request, they said, sought a response by April 22 but that the reply fell short. Now, they've given the Justice Department two more weeks to meet the committees' demands. They've also asked the White House to make budget director Russ Vought available for an interview.

""If we do not receive a response by this date, we will have no choice but to consider alternative means of obtaining compliance,"" the lawmakers wrote.

The letters are signed by Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), Energy and Commerce Chairman Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.), Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.), Education and Labor Chairman Bobby Scott (D-Va.) and Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.).

Nadler's committee has already voted to hold Barr in contempt for refusing to provide an unredacted version of Mueller's report to Congress as well as Mueller's underlying evidence. But the full House has yet to consider the committee's effort. Speaker Nancy Pelosi indicated last week that other committees may want to combine similar contempt proceedings into one overarching floor vote that could come in the next few weeks.

Democrats are also locked in confrontations with the Trump administration over accessing Trump's tax returns — a request made by Neal's Ways and Means Committee. The House Intelligence Committee has demanded access to Mueller's report, as well, on national security grounds and has issued a subpoena for his files last week.

The new effort on health care could become part of Democrats' broader strategy if they continue to accuse the Justice Department of stonewalling by the time the new deadline arrives on May 24. But persuading other lawmakers to wait until June — after a weeklong Memorial Day recess — for a comprehensive contempt vote could be difficult. Rank-and-file Democrats have been clamoring for punitive measures against Barr for weeks for his handling of Mueller's report.

Democratic leaders believe that picking a fight on health care is better politics than other demands are — and the skirmish shows their efforts to confront the Trump administration have policy dimensions and aren't just Trump-focused investigations.

Democrats have attributed the Trump administration's efforts to overturn the health care law, known as Obamacare, to ""politically motivated forces"" in the White House. The Obama White House took a similar step in 2011 when the Justice Department, at Obama's urging, stopped defending the Defense of Marriage Act, which barred federal recognition of same-sex marriages — a move social conservatives denounced at the time.

The Department of Justice declined to comment.

Pompeo shares details on 'escalating' Iran threats in Brussels: U.S. State Department,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",05-14-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-iran-pompeo/pompeo-shared-details-on-iran-threats-with-nato-state-department-idUSKCN1SJ1XN,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo shared information on “escalating” threats from Iran with European allies and NATO officials during meetings in Brussels on Monday, the U.S. special representative for Iran said.

“Iran is an escalating threat and this seemed like a timely visit on his way to Sochi,” Brian Hook told reporters, referring to Pompeo’s planned visit to Russia on Tuesday for meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.

Pompeo canceled a visit to Moscow on Monday and stopped in Brussels instead, en route to Sochi.

“The secretary wanted to share some details behind what we have been saying publicly,” Hook said. “We believe that Iran should try talks instead of threats. They have chosen poorly by focusing on threats.”

Hook said Pompeo, while in Brussels, also discussed reported attacks on several oil tankers off the coast of the United Arab Emirates.

Asked if Pompeo was blaming Iran for the attacks, Hook said: “We discussed ... what seemed to be attacks on commercial vessels that were anchored off Fujairah ... we have been requested by the UAE to provide assistance in the investigation, which we are very glad to do.”

Asked if he himself believed there was the possibility of an Iranian role, Hook had no comment.

The UAE said on Sunday that four commercial vessels were sabotaged near Fujairah emirate, one of the world’s largest bunkering hubs lying just outside the Strait of Hormuz. It did not describe the nature of the attack or say who was behind it.

Saudi Arabia said Monday that two of its oil tankers were among those attacked and described it as an attempt to undermine the security of crude supplies amid tensions between the United States and Iran.

The UAE on Monday identified the vessels as very large crude carrier (VLCC) tanker Amjad and crude tanker Al Marzoqah, both owned by Saudi shipping firm Bahri. The other two were UAE-flagged fuel bunker barge A. Michel and Norwegian-registered oil products tanker MT Andrew Victory."

"DOJ inspector general found Carter Page FISA extensions were illegally obtained, Joe diGenova says",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-11-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-inspector-general-found-carter-page-fisa-extensions-were-illegally-obtained-joe-digenova-says,"The Justice Department inspector general has determined the three Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant extensions against onetime Trump campaign aide Carter Page were illegally obtained, attorney Joe diGenova said on Thursday.

In an investigation that began last year, Inspector General Michael Horowitz is examining the Justice Department's and FBI's compliance with legal requirements as well as policies and procedures in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court related to Page as part of a larger counterintelligence probe into Trump's campaign.

The inspector general inquiry is expected to be completed in either late May or June, and diGenova, a former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, said Democrats on Capitol Hill are working overtime to investigate and discredit President Trump.

""They are doing that as a diversionary tactic away from the inevitable conclusions of the DOJ inspector general, Michael Horowitz, who, by the way, we have learned has concluded that the final three FISA extensions were illegally obtained,"" diGenova said on Fox Business. ""The only question now is whether or not the first FISA was illegally obtained.""

He pointed to memos, obtained by conservative group Citizens United through open-records litigation, that suggest the FBI might have misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in the first warrant application about an unverified dossier.

Horowitz ""apparently, as a result of those disclosures ... which he was unaware of — the bureau hid those memos from Horowitz — as a result of that they're doing additional work on the first FISA. It may be that all four FISAs will have been obtained illegally,"" diGenova said.

The dossier, compiled by ex-British spy Christopher Steele, contained salacious and unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia. It was used by the FBI to obtain the authority to wiretap Page, an American who had suspicious connections to the Russians. The first warrant application was submitted in October 2016, after which there were three renewals at three-month intervals, including in January, April, and June 2017.

The memos obtained by Citizens United, and shared with the Washington Examiner, show Steele met with Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec on Oct. 11 and admitted he was encouraged by a client to get his research out before the 2016 election, signaling a possible political motivation. The timing of the meeting is notable, as it was 10 days before the FBI used Steele's unverified dossier to obtain the original warrant to wiretap Page.

Senate and House investigators told The Hill they too were unaware of the documents, which were given to and redacted by the FBI, and one member of Congress referred the memos to the Justice Department inspector general. ""They tried to hide a lot of documents from us during our investigation, and it usually turns out there’s a reason for it,"" House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said.

A memo from the House Intelligence Committee in February 2018 alleged Steele was paid over $160,000 by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign through the Perkins Coie law firm and opposition research group Fusion GPS to ""obtain derogatory information on Donald Trump's ties to Russia."" The memo also said the FBI never informed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of the dossier's Democratic benefactors or Steele's anti-Trump bias when it applied to spy on Page, who was investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller over his interactions with Russians but was never charged.

In a rebuttal to the House Intelligence GOP memo, Democrats argued the Justice Department and FBI ""met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis needed to meet FISA's probable cause requirement.""

In recent days top former officials at the FBI have defended their handling of the warrant applications. Former FBI Director James Comey said during a CNN town hall on Thursday that “the most important part” of the dossier was on “Russians coming for the American election,” which he asserted was “consistent with our other intelligence” and “true.” Former FBI General Counsel James Baker, who acknowledged he ""wanted the burden on me to a significant degree"" in preparing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act application paperwork, said it would have been ""gratuitous"" to name the U.S. persons — the Hillary Clinton campaign and DNC — in the documents.

Both Comey and Baker said they are confident the bureau did nothing wrong in obtaining the warrants, although Baker admitted the inspector general makes him ""nervous.""

DiGenova appeared on Fox Business with his wife and legal partner Victoria Toensing. She accused FBI Director Christopher Wray of ""hiding"" Comey's ""sins.""

DiGenova served as an independent counsel in the 1990s for a case on former President Bill Clinton's passport before he was elected. Last year, it was announced diGenova and Toensing were joining Trump's legal team for the federal Russia investigation, but that plan was nixed within days.

He had been highly critical of Mueller's Russia investigation, claiming that Trump had been ""framed"" by the Justice Department and the FBI."

A liberal watchdog group said Monday it plans to sue the Commerce Department to obtain records relating to Secretary Wilbur Ross’ “lies” about his decision to add a citizenship question to next year’s Census questionnaire.

Restore Public Trust said in a complaint filed Monday afternoon in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that it has filed several requests for records under the Freedom of Information Act that call into question Ross' justification for adding the citizenship question to the Census, and the group is demanding the release of those documents.

Story Continued Below

The question, which the Trump administration plans to include for the first time since 1950, is at the center of a legal battle that last month reached the Supreme Court. Civil rights groups and several local and state governments have sued the administration to have the question struck from next year’s survey, which is used to apportion congressional seats, Electoral College votes and billions in federal funding.

Restore Public Trust is suing for the release of a tranche of documents that the group says will show Ross was misleading in congressional testimony over how the question came to be added to the Census. Ross has said he added the question “solely” at the request of the Justice Department, which said in a memo that the question would help it better enforce parts of the Voting Rights Act.

But emails turned over as part of the lawsuits have showed that Ross was in contact with former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach about the question, and he had asked the Justice Department to request the question. The Commerce Department has defended Ross' testimony, arguing that the new communications only supplement the record.

The Commerce Department declined to comment Monday, citing pending litigation.

Researchers at the Census Bureau have said adding the question could result in depressed response rates among the Hispanic residents, a demographic that already sees lower rates of response to the decennial survey. Critics of the question have argued that the question is aimed at diluting the political power of Democratic-leaning areas home to Hispanic communities. Separately, Commerce has been accused of violating administrative procedure and adding the question without proper vetting of its potential effect on Census responses.

The lawsuit filed Monday cites three FOIA requests submitted by the group last December and on April 12 seeking communications regarding the Census, including emails sent or received by Ross and some of his top current and former aides, as well as Kobach and Census Bureau and DOJ officials, relating to the Census.

According to the group, they have received no communication from the Commerce Department concerning their requests, even though FOIA requires agencies to respond within 20 days or provide notice that their response will be delayed. The document requests are likely to overlap with those the House Oversight Committee voted last month to subpoena from the Commerce Department.

“The American people have a right to know what Secretary Ross and the rest of Trump’s political appointees discussed behind closed doors as they devised a scheme to make the census less representative for all Americans,” said Kyle Herrig, senior adviser to Restore Public Trust. “Even more disturbing than Secretary Ross’s attempts to avoid public scrutiny is his apparent lies to Congress and evasion of Congressional oversight.”

The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case last month and appears poised to side with Ross, overturning the ruling of lower courts and letting the citizenship question stand. DOJ has said in court filings that the Census Bureau must finalize printed questionnaires by the end of next month to meet production deadlines.

Amid the legal drama over the citizenship question last month, Ross also caught flak for rejecting two invitations from House and Senate appropriators to testify before their committees about his agency's budget request for the upcoming fiscal year, saying his appearance would be a distraction and offering to send other officials from the department.
