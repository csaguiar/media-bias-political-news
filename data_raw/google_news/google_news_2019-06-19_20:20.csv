"New poll offers Trump dose of good news, amid 2020 campaign launch",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Paul Steinhauser', 'Paul Steinhauser Is A Politics Reporter Based In New Hampshire.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/poll-trump-2020-launch,"Hours after he formally kicked off his 2020 re-election campaign, a new national poll offers some encouraging numbers for President Trump.

The release Wednesday of a Suffolk University survey for USA Today comes a day after another poll in the crucial presidential battleground state of Florida showed the president trailing -- and as several other polls have similarly shown high-profile Democratic candidates ahead.

THE LATEST POLLS FROM FOX NEWS

But the USA Today/Suffolk University survey showed 49 percent of Americans approving of the job Trump’s doing as president, with 48 percent giving him a thumbs down.

That’s a more positive showing for Trump compared with other recent polling of his presidential approval rating.

And in the new survey, 49 percent of voters predicted Trump would win re-election, with 38 percent pointing to a victory by the eventual Democratic presidential nominee. Further, the poll indicated that if the November 2020 general election were held today, the president would narrowly edge an unnamed Democratic nominee -- 40-37 percent, with 9 percent supporting an unnamed third-party candidate and 14 percent undecided.

That result differs from other recent national and early primary and caucus voting state polls, which indicate Trump trailing some of the leading Democratic White House hopefuls in hypothetical general election matchups. Trump's 2020 re-election campaign manager has slammed such non-partisan surveys as ""the biggest joke in politics,"" and the president frequently rails against them.

Trump trailed former Vice President Joe Biden – the clear front-runner right now in the race for the Democratic nomination – 50-41 percent in a Quinnipiac University poll in Florida that was released on Tuesday. The survey also suggested Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont topping Trump 48-42 percent and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts ahead of the president 47-43 percent in hypothetical November 2020 showdowns.

""President Donald Trump trails both former Vice President Joseph Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders in general election matchups and basically ties other leading Democratic challengers,"" Quinnipiac University poll assistant director Peter Brown said. ""While most Florida voters are feeling better financially, President Trump remains underwater with a 44 percent job approval rating and a 51 percent disapproval rating.""

TRUMP FORMALLY KICKS-OFF 2020 RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN

The Quinnipiac University poll was released a few hours before Trump kicked off his 2020 re-election bid in a jam-packed arena in Orlando. Trump edged Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election to capture Florida’s 29 electoral votes. Democratic President Barack Obama narrowly won the state in the 2008 and 2012 elections.

Trump's re-election campaign manager, Brad Parscale, is taking aim at such polls.

""The country is too complex now just to call a couple hundred people and ask them what they think. There are so many ways, and different people that are gonna show up to vote now,"" Parscale told CBS News. ""The way turnout now works, the abilities that we have to turn out voters – the polling can't understand that. And that's why it was so wrong in 2016. It was 100 percent wrong. Nobody got it right. Not one public poll.”

TRUMP'S EYE POPPING SINGLE DAY FUNDRAISING HAUL

While Trump’s facing early warning signs in many national and early voting state polls, raising campaign cash has not been an issue. Trump’s re-election campaign and related committees raised an eye-popping $24.8 million in the 24 hours surrounding the president’s campaign kick-off, according to Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel.

“@realDonaldTrump has raised a record breaking $24.8M in less than 24 hours for his re-election. The enthusiasm across the country for this President is unmatched and unlike anything we’ve ever seen! #trump2020 #KeepAmericaGreat,” McDaniel tweeted early Wednesday morning.

The USA Today/Suffolk University poll was conducted June 11-15, with 1,000 registered voters nationwide questioned by live telephone operators. The overall sampling error was plus or minus 3 percentage points.

The Quinnipiac University poll was conducted June 12-17, with 1,279 Florida voters questioned by live telephone operators. The overall sampling error is plus or minus 3.3 percentage points."
"Trump administration threatens furloughs, layoffs if Congress doesn’t let it kill personnel agency",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Lisa Rein', 'Reporter Covering Federal Agencies', 'The Management Of Government In The Trump Administration', 'June At Pm']",06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-administration-threatens-furloughs-layoffs-if-congress-doesnt-let-it-kill-personnel-agency/2019/06/19/b7200fda-9135-11e9-b58a-a6a9afaa0e3e_story.html,"Margaret Weichert, acting director at the Office of Personnel Management and deputy director for management at the Office of Management and Budget. (Office of Personnel Management)

The Trump administration is threatening to furlough — and possibly lay off — 150 employees at the federal personnel agency if Congress blocks its plan to eliminate the department.

The Office of Personnel Management is preparing to send the career employees home without pay starting on Oct. 1, according to an internal briefing document obtained by The Washington Post. The employees could formally be laid off after 30 days, administration officials confirmed.

The warning of staff cuts is the administration’s most dramatic move yet in an escalating jujitsu between Trump officials and Congress over the fate of the agency that manages the civilian federal workforce of 2.1 million.

Even as House Democrats and some Republicans signal that Congress is not going to break up the 5,565-employee department, the administration is moving forward in defiance. Trump appointees paint a dire picture of a corner of the government in financial free fall and failing to carry out its mission. They want a commitment from Congress by June 30 to agree to disband the agency — or they say they’ll be forced to trim staff.

“This is a crisis building for years,” Margaret Weichert, deputy director for management at the Office of Management and Budget and acting OPM director, said in an interview.

“We believe a legislative solution would be the most straightforward answer,” she said. “But we’ve made it very clear we can’t wait without action.”

Weichert said the administration is “committed to structural change. We can’t just say that because something has been done a certain way for the last 40 years that that’s acceptable.” She confirmed the possible furloughs and layoffs and said they were “a last resort we are trying to avoid.”

Trump officials say that OPM is a broken agency that should be wiped clean and restarted. They cite security weaknesses that led to a massive data breach, inefficient hiring policies and a backlogged system of processing paperwork for retiring employees.

Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), who leads a panel overseeing government operations on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said Weichert hasn’t made a business case to kill the agency.

“At the end of the day, we have to make sure the agency works better or functions better in another place,” he said, acknowledging that OPM has “done a terrible job with retiring employees.”

“I want to see how this plan is cheaper for the taxpayer and better for the federal workforce,” Lankford said. “It’s hard to get to a determination of how this makes things better.”

The proposed breakup would pull apart OPM and divide it among three other departments.

Most of its functions would move into the General Services Administration, the government’s real estate and procurement arm. OPM’s backlogged security clearance system already is shifting to the Defense Department, through legislation previously passed by Congress.

OPM’s leadership would shift from an agency director to a Senate-confirmed deputy in the GSA and a position within the White House budget office responsible for federal workforce policy that the president would appoint.

The plan to dismantle the agency was the brainchild of a senior career official at the budget office. Weichert, a private-sector executive focused on improving business operations before she joined the Trump administration, has committed to it with a vengeance.

She’s told her staff that she is “planning to play chicken with Congress,” according to three officials familiar with the comments.

Critics say she is deliberately starving the agency in order to kill it.

“This is not a proposal that says, ‘How do we prop up OPM so it carries out its mission?’ ” said Jeffrey Neal, former personnel chief at the Department of Homeland Security and now a senior vice president at ICF, a consulting firm. “It’s more like pushing it over the edge so it fails.”

Dozens of employees have quit or retired in recent months amid the uncertainty.

The administration has been laying the groundwork for more than a year to kill the department and merge its functions, and it has asked Congress to approve the transfer.

But the bold plan, the first time in modern history that a large federal department would disappear, has no buy-in from Democrats on Capitol Hill and their allies in the labor movement, who are smarting from more than two years of confrontation with President Trump’s get-tough, anti-union policies.

“After realizing they were not going to prevail on the merits of the proposal,” Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee’s panel on government operations, said in an email, “the Trump Administration is taking 150 federal employees hostage unless we consent to a plan that has no rationale and is nothing more than a political gambit to give the White House control of our long-standing merit-based civil service system.”

Weichert’s rationale for the furloughs is tied to the revenue OPM gets for the government’s background check system for employee security clearances. The system is shifting to the Defense Department on Oct. 1, with 2,500 to 3,000 staff departures to the Pentagon.

The transfer will leave a $70 million hole in OPM’s budget from lost revenue for the clearance checks. Weichert said all but $23 million can be made up through other sources. The shortfall would be covered by eliminating the 150 jobs in OPM.

But House Democrats are moving quickly to block Weichert. The House Appropriations Committee passed legislation last week that would forbid the administration from spending any money to “reorganize or transfer any function” from OPM or enter into any agreements to shift work currently done by the agency. The legislation also provides $43 million for the next fiscal year to make up for lost revenue from the security clearances.

That legislation has yet to clear Congress. Weichert said the extra money amounts to a Band-Aid. She said she’s working to move hundreds of OPM technology and personnel services employees to GSA. Democrats say the moves require congressional approval and would not be legal.

Trump officials are in the process of withdrawing a longtime agreement that lets OPM independently operate its Washington headquarters at 1900 E St. NW. The withdrawal will make the GSA the agency’s landlord, charging higher overhead costs than OPM now pays on its own.

A report by a federal watchdog this week concluded that killing the agency would hinder, not ease, the long-standing retirement claims backlog.

“Potential changes in organizational affiliation, policy, budget and staff may make it difficult for OPM to plan for large-scale changes in its operations,” the Government Accountability Office said.

The American Federation of Government Employees and the National Federation of Federal Employees, which represent OPM and GSA staff, have scheduled a June 25 rally at Triangle Park in downtown Washington to protest the breakup."
Trump EPA rolls back Obama’s coal crackdown,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Alex Pappas', 'Alex Pappas Is A Politics Reporter At Foxnews.Com.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-epa-rolls-back-obamas-coal-crackdown,"Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler on Wednesday finalized the agency’s plan for replacing Obama-era regulations on emissions from coal-fired power plants, part of a long-running effort by the Trump administration to roll back environmental rules.

TRUMP EPA OVERHAULS OBAMA-ERA REGULATIONS FOR COAL-FIRED POWER PLANTS

While the Obama administration and Democrats saw the Clean Power Plan as a crucial component in international efforts to curb global warming, Republicans have long claimed those regulations went too far and were too costly. From the start of President Trump’s administration, his Environmental Protection Agency has been working to overhaul the program, which was halted by the Supreme Court in 2016 before going into effect.

During a press conference, Wheeler formally signed the Affordable Clean Energy Rule, which would give individual states wide discretion to decide whether to require limited efficiency upgrades at individual coal-fired power plants. Wheeler said the changes are being made because ""the American public elected a president with a better approach.""

The ACE rule, once fully implemented, allows states to select their own energy plans. States will be given three years to submit the plan and the EPA will have 12 months to approve it. Wheeler called it a sign that ""fossil fuels will continue to be an important part of the mix"" in the U.S. energy supply.

In remarks, he also contrasted the ACE rule with proposals being pushed by left-wing politicians, like New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

""The contrast between our approach and the Green New Deal, or plans like it, couldn't be clearer,"" Wheeler said. ""Rather than Washington telling Americans what type of energy they can use, or how they can travel, or even what they can eat, we are working cooperatively with the states to provide affordable, dependable, and diverse supply of energy that continues to get cleaner and more efficient.""

Democrats and environmentalists ripped the move. The rule will go into effect shortly after publication in the Federal Register, but court challenges are expected.

New York Attorney General Letitia James said Tuesday she plans to sue the EPA over the rule. ""This is yet another prime example of this administration's attempt to rollback critical regulations that will have devastating impacts on both the safety & health of our nation,"" the Democrat tweeted.

Joseph Goffman, an EPA official under President Barack Obama, said he feared that the Trump administration was trying to set a legal precedent that the Clean Air Act gives the federal government ""next to no authority to do anything"" about climate-changing emissions from the country's power grid.

The Obama rule, adopted in 2015, sought to reshape the country's power system by encouraging utilities to rely less on dirtier-burning coal-fired power plants and more on electricity from natural gas, solar, wind and other lower or no-carbon sources.

Supporters of the revised rule say the Obama-era plan overstepped the EPA's authority.

""The Clean Power Plan was designed largely to put coal out of business,"" said Mandy Gunasekara, a former senior official at the EPA who helped write the replacement rule.

Trump's overhaul is meant to let states ""figure out what is best for their mission in terms of meeting modern environmental standards"" and providing affordable energy, she said.

With coal miners at his side, Trump signed an order in March 2017 directing the EPA to scrap the Obama rule. It was one of the first acts of his presidency.

Who In The House Is Calling For Impeachment?,https://www.npr.org,"['Elena Moore', 'Thomas Wilburn', 'Sean Mcminn']",06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.npr.org/2019/06/19/733536620/who-in-the-house-is-calling-for-impeachment,"Who In The House Is Calling For Impeachment?

California Democratic Rep. Katie Porter publicly backed an impeachment investigation Monday evening, posting a video on Twitter on her decision. Porter is one of just two House Democrats who represent competitive districts and are publicly backing impeachment of President Trump.

Porter's announcement was met with immediate GOP backlash and a threat that the move ""will cost Porter her seat"" in 2020. Rep. Tom Malinowski of New Jersey is the other so-called ""Frontline"" Democrat who says the House should launch an inquiry. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee designated 44 legislators whose districts are seen as key to holding on to the House in 2020.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who has the most influential voice in the decision on whether to move forward, has repeatedly stated that she plans to focus on current congressional committee investigations into Trump before talking about an impeachment inquiry.

Currently, 69 Democrats and one Republican in the House of Representatives support beginning an impeachment inquiry into Trump for potential obstruction of justice. Out of those 69 Democrats, almost all share two important qualities: Their seats are safe in 2020, and they are not members of the House Democratic leadership team.

Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan is the only Republican to back launching an inquiry, and he has received criticism from constituents and the GOP for his decision.

Among the House Democrats who are most influential in this process — key committee chairs investigating the president and his aides, top leaders and, of course, the speaker herself — only one has signaled she favors impeaching the president. Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters, D-Calif., has been calling for impeachment since the early days of Trump's presidency; she wrote in a February 2017 tweet that her ""greatest desire was to lead [Trump] right into impeachment.""

E.P.A. Finalizes Its Plan to Replace Obama-Era Climate Rules,https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/climate/epa-coal-emissions.html,"While it instructs states to reduce emissions, the new measure sets no targets. Instead, it gives states broad latitude to decide how much carbon reduction they consider reasonable and suggests ways to improve efficiency at individual power plants.

Jeffrey R. Holmstead, who served in the E.P.A. during both Bush administrations and now represents utility companies as a lawyer for the firm Bracewell, said he thought the current Supreme Court would be skeptical of any presidential effort to regulate carbon emissions under existing law.

“I t will establish what the E.P.A. can and can’t do,” Mr. Holmstead said of the new Trump rule. “I think it really will tie the hands of future administrations.”

Environmental groups say the Trump rule will slow the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions at a time when scientists warn that countries must rapidly decarbonize to avoid the most severe effects of climate change, including heat waves, extreme storms, droughts and floods.

Mr. Wheeler has said the Trump administration’s plan is legally sound, will not damage the economy and will still go a long way toward reducing carbon .

He maintained that, when the new measure is fully implemented, it will reduce carbon emissions in the power sector by 34 percent below 2005 levels, roughly equal to the goals of the Clean Power Plan.

Mr. Wheeler also said the rule could lead to new coal plants in the United States. “I don’t know who is going to invest in a new coal fired power plant, but we’re leveling the playing field to allow that investment to occur,” he said."
"Trump Admin Hid Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan’s Dark Past, Senators Say",https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Erin-Banco Sam-Brodey Lachlan-Markay Noah-Shachtman', 'Erin Banco', 'Sam Brodey', 'Lachlan Markay', 'Noah Shachtman', 'National Security Reporter', 'Congressional Reporter']",06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-admin-hid-acting-secretary-of-defense-patrick-shanahans-dark-past-senators-say,"The senators tasked with vetting Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan say they were unaware of the accusations of domestic violence in his family that led to his resignation Tuesday. The altercations never came up during Shanahan’s 2017 confirmation hearing for the position of Deputy Secretary of Defense, lawmakers told The Daily Beast, nor did it arise as he was preparing to assume the role of Pentagon chief permanently.

“We’ve been wondering why we have not gotten an FBI report. It has seemed slow to us. And now we understand why,” said Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, adding that he “didn’t know” about Shanahan's ex-wife’s arrest for punching Shanahan in the face, nor his son’s arrest for attacking his mother with a baseball bat, until reports surfaced in USA Today and the Washington Post about the alleged incidents.

President Donald Trump nominated Shanahan, a former Boeing executive, for defense secretary in March 2019. Since then, his confirmation process lingered, leaving the Pentagon without a confirmed leader for the longest stretch in history and raising concerns among lawmakers who were told that the postponement was partly because of a hold up by the FBI. At least one of those lawmakers called for an investigation on Tuesday as to why they had not been told by the administration about Shanahan’s past.

“I want to know what was known, and whether it was fully disclosed,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), who also sits on the armed services committee, told The Daily Beast. “It was material to this nomination when he was proposed for deputy secretary, as well as named his nominee as secretary, although the full paperwork was never sent to us.”

The administration is supposed to turn over all relevant docs pertaining to a nominee’s background check. But that didn’t happen, according to a former Senate Armed Services Committee staffer.

“This never came up the first time around [when Shanahan was nominated to be Deputy Defense Secretary in 2017]. Trust me, I’d remember. And the FBI vetting process is thorough. We would routinely get things like a nominee who had tried coke once in the 1980s,” the ex-staffer told The Daily Beast.

“If these domestic issues are as serious as being reported, SASC would have been told,” the ex-staffer added. “And I would know. Which leads me to conclude that this stuff was never reported to the committee. Not sure why that happened, but I see no other explanation.”

Shanahan announced Tuesday that he would no longer seek to be confirmed as Defense Secretary and would be resigning from his post at the Pentagon. The news came as reports surfaced that he had downplayed his son’s assault on his ex-wife, and that both he and his ex-wife had both claimed, back in 2010, that they had been punched in the face by the other after drinking. Part of the altercation reportedly took place in front of their home in Seattle. USA Today obtained recordings from the night of the incident.

“My husband is throwing punches at me,” Shanahan’s ex-wife Kimberly Jordinson told a 911 offcer, according to USA Today. “He’s been hitting me… I don’t need a medic, I need you guys to get him out of the house… He’s just swinging punches at me.”

Shanahan maintains that he never “laid a hand on” his former wife.

“After having been confirmed for Deputy Secretary less than two years ago, it is unfortunate that a painful and deeply personal family situation from long ago is being dredged up and painted in an incomplete and therefore misleading way,” Shanahan said in a statement Tuesday. “I believe my continuing in the confirmation process would force my three children to relive a traumatic chapter in our family's life.”

In the case of high level appointees like secretary of defense, FBI investigators are able to marshal more resources for a more detailed background check than most civil servants would normally get. “They do up to about 40 face-to-face interviews,” said John Berry, an attorney who represents clients in security clearance cases, said. “A normal person with a top secret clearance, they may come and talk to like five or ten folks.”

Attorneys say that, absent any more revelations about Shanahan, the domestic violence allegations against his wife and son would probably not have stopped most applicants from getting a clearance, assuming investigators knew about them.

“The reason this probably slipped through is because, as far as I can tell, Shanahan was never charged with anything. So nothing would’ve popped up in a national criminal database check,” said Brad Moss, a national security lawyer with extensive experience handling clearance cases.

Shanahan’s resignation comes at a particularly fraught time for the Defense Department. Officials there are in the midst of dealing with increasing escalations with Tehran, and on Monday the administration announced that it was prepared to send an additional 1,000 troops to the Middle East to counter Iran’s presence in the region. Amid the absence of a confirmed secretary, the State Department has lead the way on Iran policy, crafting the maximum pressure campaign along with Treasury that’s led to more than a thousand sanctions designations against the country. State has also held briefings with Congress about Iran over the last several weeks.

While Tuesday’s revelations caught many lawmakers by surprise, others said they had been made aware of them before they were reported publicly.

“I know he’s been accused of things for a long time… he also is, keep in mind, he went to confirmation as the deputy. So that’s a process,” said Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-OK), the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

A senior White House official told The Daily Beast that Shanahan’s withdrawal has been expected for “a couple weeks” in light of the incidents, reports of which had been circulating internally.

“One concern was it would turn into another Kavanaugh situation,” the official said, referring to the highly contentious confirmation fight over the Supreme Court Justice. The White House anticipated that Senate Democrats might seize on reports of domestic problems in Shanahan’s home to attempt to tie him to the larger problem of domestic violence in the military.

Of particular concern, the White House official said, was Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), a member of the Armed Services Committee, Democratic presidential candidate, and longtime critic of the Pentagon’s handling of sexual assault and abuse cases against female service members. Though not directly analogous to the litany of documented cases of such assaults, reports about Shanahan’s private life, the White House worried, might hand Gillibrand and like-minded committee Democrats a cudgel to wield against Shanahan’s nomination.

Shanahan’s replacement, Mark Esper, is currently the secretary of the Army and has a long history of working in top positions in the military and with government contractors, including Raytheon. Those who’ve known Esper over the years say he has the attitude of an entrenched bureaucrat who is eager to please his bosses.

“He was one of the top five guys in our class and he is highly regarded in the Trump administration,” said one former senior Pentagon official who attended school with Esper. Esper was also a classmate of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1986.

“He is very good at figuring out what his superior wants and he delivers,” the former official said. “And Mark’s approach to his work is to focus on the core mission in front of him—to prevail against the U.S.’s competitors. And he knows in this case those rivals are Russia and China.”

House Republicans demand hearing after State Dept. cites 'multiple security incidents' under Clinton leadership,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republicans-demand-hearing-after-state-dept-cites-multiple-security-incidents-under-clinton-leadership,"House Oversight Committee Republicans on Tuesday formally called for an immediate hearing on security breaches at the State Department during Hillary Clinton's leadership, after the department said Monday it had uncovered ""multiple security incidents"" involving more than a dozen employees.

In a letter to Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., ranking committee Republicans Jim Jordan, Mark Meadows and Jody Hice said State Department officials conducting the ongoing security review into the matter should testify.

""We request a hearing to examine widespread security protocol breaches at the State Department concerning former Secretary Hillary Clinton’s private email server,"" the Republicans wrote. ""The unorthodox and unsecure arrangement she maintained exposed classified, national security and diplomatic-sensitive information to a myriad of risks and related issues.

'OMG': TOP HILLARY AIDE STUNNED BY APPARENT EMAIL HACK ATTEMPT IN MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, FBI DOCS SHOW

""The wide-ranging fallout from these mishandling instances should not be minimized and obscured,"" they added.

On Monday, the State Department disclosed that it had identified ""multiple security incidents"" involving current or former employees' handling of Clinton's emails, and that 23 ""violations"" and seven ""infractions"" have been issued as part of the department's ongoing investigation.

The information came in a letter to Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, who is responsible for overseeing the security review.

""To this point, the department has assessed culpability to 15 individuals, some of whom were culpable in multiple security incidents,"" Mary Elizabeth Taylor, the State Department's assistant secretary in the Bureau of Legislative Affairs, wrote to Grassley. ""DS has issued 23 violations and seven infractions. ... This number will likely change as the review progresses.""

President Trump highlighted the finding in a tweet overnight, questioning whether Democrats would investigate and saying, ""This is really big.""

Former House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, now a Fox News contributor, said Tuesday that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo should personally handle the probe into departmental misconduct.

""I love Mike Pompeo as the secretary of state,"" Chaffetz said. ""I have the greatest respect for him, he's got his very full plate, but he has to personally get involved with this. Some people should be fired, they should lose their security clearances and they should be in jail.""

The State Department, dubbing the matter ""serious,"" said it expected to conclude its investigation by Sept. 1. The department acknowledged that the probe was unusually time-consuming.

""Given the volume of emails provided to the department from former Secretary Clinton's private email server, the department's process has been necessarily more complicated and complex requiring a significant dedication of time and resources,"" Taylor wrote.

Taylor also noted that disciplinary consequences were pending, and that internal referrals have been made to State Department Human Resources and security officials, even where employees involved no longer work with the department.

Clinton's private email use has remained in the spotlight, as the DOJ looks into potential misconduct in the handling of federal authorities' surveillance and intelligence operations in 2016. Then-FBI Director James Comey said in 2016 that Clinton's handling of classified information was ""extremely careless"" -- but that ""no reasonable prosecutor"" would bring charges.

Last month, a trove of partially redacted FBI documents from the agency's investigation into whether Clinton mishandled classified information -- a probe known as the ""Midyear Exam"" -- revealed that top Clinton aides were shocked at apparent attempts to hack her private email servers.

The document release revealed numerous episodes in which the Clinton team either suspected it had been hacked or seemingly acknowledged that security measures had come up short.

""omg,"" top Clinton aide Huma Abedin wrote to Justin Cooper, the technology pro overseeing Clinton's private home-based email servers, when he told her shortly after midnight on Jan. 9, 2011, that ""someone was trying to hack us.""

And this past March, it was revealed that the Justice Department ""negotiated"" an agreement with Clinton's legal team that ensured the FBI did not have access to emails on her private servers relating to the Clinton Foundation. Former FBI Agent Peter Strzok testified about the arrangement during a closed-door appearance before the House Judiciary Committee last summer, according to a transcript released this year.

The agreement was reached, Strzok said, because ""according to the attorneys, we lacked probable cause to get a search warrant for those servers and projected that either it would take a very long time and/or it would be impossible to get to the point where we could obtain probable cause to get a warrant.""

The DOJ's goal, Chaffetz said at the time, was to ""make sure they hear no evil, see no evil -- they had no interest in pursuing the truth."""

WASHINGTON -- Paul Manafort, former campaign chairman for Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, will not be transferred to New York's infamous Rikers Island jail after the Department of Justice cited health concerns.

Manafort is serving seven and a half years in federal prison on charges related to his foreign lobbying efforts as part of former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. He was being held in a federal prison in Pennsylvania but has been transferred to a federal facility in Manhattan, Reuters reported.

However, Manafort was supposed to be transferred to Rikers Island in New York later this month as he awaits trial in state court for multiple charges under New York law for residential mortgage fraud, conspiracy and falsifying business, according to the New York Times.

Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen last week sent a letter to Manhattan prosecutors saying that the Department of Justice was monitoring where Manafort would be held in New York, the Times reported.

And, Manafort will no longer be transferred to Rikers Island, according to the Times. A senior DOJ official in a statement to ABC News said that the department got involved after Manafort's attorneys raised concerns ""related to his health and personal safety.""

During Manafort's federal trial, his lawyers said he had gout.

President Donald Trump has in the past said that he thought Manafort's sentence was ""very unfair"" and has complained about how his former campaign manager has been treated.

"Exclusive: Overruling his experts, Pompeo keeps Saudis off U.S. child soldiers list",https://www.reuters.com,"['Jonathan Landay', 'Min Read']",06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-saudi-childsoldiers-exclusive/exclusive-overruling-his-experts-pompeo-keeps-saudis-off-us-child-soldiers-list-idUSKCN1TJ25H,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has blocked the inclusion of Saudi Arabia on a U.S. list of countries that recruit child soldiers, dismissing his experts’ findings that a Saudi-led coalition has been using under-age fighters in Yemen’s civil war, according to four people familiar with the matter.

The decision, which drew immediate criticism from human rights activists and a top Democratic lawmaker, could prompt new accusations that U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration is prioritizing security and economic interests in relations with oil-rich Saudi Arabia, a major U.S. ally and arms customer.

Pompeo’s move followed unusually intense internal debate. It comes amid heightened tensions between the United States and Iran, the Saudis’ bitter regional rival.

State Department experts recommended adding Saudi Arabia to the soon-to-be released list based in part on news reports and human rights groups’ assessments that the desert kingdom has hired child fighters from Sudan to fight for the U.S.-backed coalition in Yemen, the four sources said.

The experts’ recommendation faced resistance from some other State Department officials who, according to three of the sources, argued that it was not clear whether the Sudanese forces were under the control of Sudanese officers or directed by the Saudi-led coalition.

A New York Times report in December cited Sudanese fighters saying their Saudi and United Arab Emirates commanders directed them at a safe distance from the fighting against the coalition’s foes, Iran-aligned Houthi militias.

“The allegations of recruiting child soldiers are completely incorrect and are not based on any evidence or factual findings,” said Colonel Turki al-Malki, a spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition. He instead accused the Saudis’ foes of using child fighters in Yemen.

Pompeo rejected the recommendation from the experts, who are from the State Department’s anti-human trafficking office, said the four sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. The office has a key role in investigating the use of child soldiers worldwide.”The United States condemns the unlawful recruitment and use of child soldiers. We place great importance on ending the practice wherever it occurs,” a State Department official said in response to Reuters’ questions. The official, however, did not specifically address the Saudi decision or whether any consideration was given to Riyadh’s security ties to Washington.

Instead of adding Saudi Arabia to the list, Sudan will be reinstated after being removed last year, three of the sources said.

A spokesman for Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, which has contributed fighters to the Yemen war, said the force is affiliated with Sudan’s military. “Based on Sudanese laws, it does not recruit minors,” he said. He did not directly respond to a question on who controlled Sudanese forces in Yemen.

The UAE government did not respond to a request for comment.

The child soldiers list will be part of the State Department’s annual global Trafficking in Persons report, which is due to be released on Thursday in a ceremony led by Pompeo and Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter.

BAN ON U.S. AID

The Child Soldiers Prevention Act of 2008 requires the State Department to report annually on countries using child fighters, defined as “any person under 18 years of age who takes a direct part in hostilities as a member of governmental armed forces.”

Foreign militaries on the list cannot receive U.S. aid, training and weapons unless the president issues full or partial waivers of those sanctions based on “national interest.” Trump and his predecessors have done this in the past for countries with close security ties to the United States.

“This is reprehensible,” U.S. Senator Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a post on Twitter. “Is there no limit to what the Trump Admin is willing to do to cover for #SaudiArabia’s human rights abuses and violations of international norms?”

Sarah Margon, director of Human Right Watch’s Washington office, said: “This decision shows clearly that the Trump administration is using political manipulation and dismissing evidence – at the expense of kids – in order to protect Saudi Arabia.”

While internal debates over issues like child soldier violations often take place ahead of the release of the annual State Department list, this one was especially heated, several of the sources said.

Since the end of 2016, the Saudi-led coalition has deployed as many as 14,000 Sudanese at any given time, including children as young as 14, to fight in Yemen, offering payments of up to $10,000 per recruit, according to the New York Times. The article cited Sudanese fighters who had returned home and Sudanese lawmakers.

In Washington, the Yemen conflict is a contentious issue well beyond the State Department.

Republican and Democratic lawmakers, citing evidence of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s role in the 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and angered by the civilian toll from the Saudi-led air campaign in Yemen, have ramped up efforts to block Trump’s multibillion-dollar arms sales to Saudi Arabia.

Congressmen Tom Malinowski and Ted Lieu organized a letter to Pompeo from more than a dozen lawmakers in March that said they were “gravely concerned by credible reports” of the Saudi-led coalition deploying Sudanese child fighters in Yemen.

They called for a U.S. investigation, including into whether they had been armed with U.S.-made weapons, and also asked for an inquiry into “credible evidence of Houthi forces forcibly conscripting minors into combat.”

BLOODY CONFLICT

Sudan sent thousands of troops to Yemen with the Saudi-led coalition that intervened in the civil war in 2015 against the Houthis, who had captured most of the main populated areas of the country and forced President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi into exile.

Almost from the start, accusations of the use of child soldiers have dogged the parties to the bloody conflict.

A report by an independent group of experts to the U.N. Human Rights Council in August 2018 found that all sides in Yemen “conscripted or enlisted children into armed forces or groups and used them to participate actively in hostilities.”

The Trump administration has faced controversy in the past over its handling of the child soldier issue.

Reuters reported in 2017 that then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson opted to remove Iraq and Myanmar from the child soldiers list and rejected a recommendation to add Afghanistan to it, despite the department publicly acknowledging that children were still being conscripted in those countries.

The State Department said at the time that while the use of child soldiers was “abhorrent,” it was still in “technical compliance with the law.” Pompeo, who succeeded Tillerson, reinstated Iraq and Myanmar on the list last year."

Homeland Security: We've tested Windows BlueKeep attack and it works so patch now,https://www.zdnet.com,['Liam Tung'],,,,https://www.zdnet.com/article/homeland-security-weve-tested-windows-bluekeep-attack-and-it-works-so-patch-now/,"A single actor is scanning Windows systems vulnerable to the BlueKeep flaw A threat actor hidden behind Tor nodes is scanning for Windows systems vulnerable to BlueKeep flaw. Read more: https://zd.net/2JWjK73

The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) cybercrime emergency response team is warning Windows admins to patch the wormable BlueKeep flaw, after confirming it can be used to remotely execute code on vulnerable PCs.

The US government's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has raised the official alert over a potentially devastating flaw that affects the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service in multiple versions of Windows, from Windows 2000 to Windows 2008.

Microsoft considered CVE-2019-0708, now known as BlueKeep, so severe that it even released a patch for unsupported Windows XP – a measure it hadn't taken since WannaCry wreaked havoc across the globe in mid-2017.

SEE: Cybersecurity in an IoT and mobile world (ZDNet special report) | Download the report as a PDF (TechRepublic)

The bug was reported to Microsoft ahead of its May Patch Tuesday update by the UK's National Cyber Security Centre, the organization under UK spy agency GCHQ tasked with improving the nation's cybersecurity defenses in the public and private sector.

Microsoft released patches for XP because it believed BlueKeep's worm capabilities – the ability to automatically spread from one vulnerable machine to another – could be exploited in an attack on the same global scale as WannaCry, whose worm capabilities were enabled by EternalBlue, the leaked NSA exploit for the SMBv1 file-sharing protocol.

The NSA is also worried about BlueKeep. Earlier this month it urged admins to patch the flaw and change configurations to prevent potential attacks. Its warning followed research that found that at least one million Windows computers were still vulnerable to BlueKeep. The NSA said it was ""likely only a matter of time"" before attacks emerged.

Currently there's no publicly available exploit code for BlueKeep. However, several organizations claim to have developed exploits for it, including Zerodium, McAfee, Kaspersky, Check Point, MalwareTech, and Valthek.

CISA on Monday confirmed it has successfully exploited BlueKeep on a Windows 2000 PC. The agency has not tested other affected versions of Windows.

""CISA tested BlueKeep against a Windows 2000 machine and achieved remote code execution. Windows OS versions prior to Windows 8 that are not mentioned in this Activity Alert may also be affected; however, CISA has not tested these systems,"" it said.

However, CISA has since stepped back from that claim and replaced its original statement with: ""CISA has coordinated with external stakeholders and determined that Windows 2000 is vulnerable to BlueKeep.""

Nonetheless, its advice, like the NSA's and Microsoft's, remains the same: apply Microsoft's May fixes for the RDP BlueKeep bug. Similarly, it recommends enabling Network Level Authentication (NLA), which would shield organizations from any forthcoming BlueKeep attacks. And it suggests blocking TCP port 3389, which is used to start an RDP session.

Should a public BlueKeep exploit emerge or nation-state hackers develop one privately and decide to use it, the potential impact could be very different to WannaCry.

That malware heavily damaged organizations in Europe, most notably the UK's National Health Service (NHS), which faced a $125m WannaCry bill, was forced to cancel 19,000 appointments, and then spent £500,000 on contractors to restore data in the wake of the attack.

Additionally, thanks to suspected Russian state-backed hacking group, ShadowBrokers, public exploit code was available just a month after Microsoft's patch.

Security firm BitSight ran an internet scan in mid-June for systems vulnerable to BlueKeep. It too found about a million vulnerable machines, but the exposure to BlueKeep is greatest in China, where less than 50 percent of machines have been patched.

China by far has the most machines in the world that are vulnerable to BlueKeep, amounting to about a third of the million vulnerable machines. It is followed by the US, but more than 75 percent of US machines have been patched.

It seems Europe has learned its lessons from WannaCry and the subsequent EternalBlue-powered NotPetya outbreak. The UK, Netherlands, Germany, France, have all patched over 75 percent of systems with exposed RDP hosts.

Countries in the same bracket as China, with less than 50 percent of machines patched, include South Korea and Hong Kong, while the patch rate in Russia, India, Brazil, and Italy sits between 50 percent and 75 percent.

Trump's acting defense secretary is out — and this chaotic administration prepares for war,https://www.salon.com,[],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.salon.com/2019/06/19/trumps-acting-defense-secretary-is-out-and-this-chaotic-administration-prepares-for-war/,"After months of ducking cameras and avoiding public accountability as the U.S. ramps up its aggressive military posture towards Iran, President Trump’s acting secretary of defense, Patrick Shanahan, invited a pair of Washington Post reporters into his apartment for an in-depth interview. Just before the story published on Tuesday, however, Trump took to Twitter to make another major personnel announcement: Shanahan is out as the head of the Pentagon.

Advertisement:

Shanahan was never confirmed by the Senate and served in an “acting” capacity for six months, before withdrawing his name for consideration following an extended FBI criminal background investigation that apparently revealed allegations of domestic abuse. He reportedly traveled to the White House on Tuesday to withdraw from the confirmation process. A former Boeing executive who was only recently cleared in an ethics probe over suspicions he had shown favoritism to his former employer, Shanahan was brought on by Trump as acting secretary after former Secretary Jim Mattis left the administration abruptly, following Trump's announcement that he would pull U.S. troops out of Syria over Mattis’ objections.

This new shakeup at the Pentagon comes one day after Shanahan announced that the U.S. will send 1,000 troops to the Middle East, after earlier announcing an additional 5,000 troops will be sent to the region. Shanahan was reportedly scheduled to attend a Tuesday meeting with the Defense Policy Board before his departure was announced, but curiously was not scheduled to travel to Tampa later this week to meet with U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), the group tasked with leading military operations in the Middle East. Instead, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is not in the military chain of command, will sit with those who would carry out any strikes against Iran. In fact, no Pentagon officials are expected to attend the briefing.

Shanahan’s abrupt departure is not exactly a big shock. Trump has lost more than a dozen Cabinet-level secretaries in his first two years in office. It is certainly concerning nonetheless. The administration is clearly gearing up for some sort of military confrontation with Iran and there will likely be no congressionally confirmed leader of the military to oversee the operation.

On Tuesday, Trump named Mark T. Esper, the current secretary of the Army and a former Raytheon executive, to take over for Shanahan as acting secretary. He did not say whether Esper would be nominated for the permanent position. Trump, who came into the presidency with less government experience than any commander in chief in decades, may never again confirm a secretary of defense, opting to just appoint a roster of ""acting"" leaders for as long as possible. anybody bothers to press him. Shanahan was on the job half a year without facing his constitutionally-mandated Senate confirmation, a situation with no apparent precedent.

This is the system Trump wants, one where he never has to bother clearing senior appointments with Congress. Key administration vacancies currently held by acting leaders include the Department of Homeland Security and the Interior Department (both Cabinet-level), along with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Food and Drug Administration, the Secret Service and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. There is only an acting ambassador to the United Nations, following Nikki Haley’s departure, and the Office of Management and Budget is run by a temporary director — because Mick Mulvaney left that job vacant to serve as Trump’s acting White House chief of staff.

“I like acting. It gives me more flexibility. Do you understand that?” Trump said in January. “I like acting. So we have a few that are acting. We have a great, great Cabinet.”

This should serve as an enormous red flag that the person sitting behind the Resolute desk is incompetent. But this isn't just a failure by the president, although he's primarily accountable for his nominees. Shanahan was confirmed as deputy secretary of defense by the Senate in a 92-7 vote. As the Post noted, none of the senators ever asked him about the alleged domestic violence issues that eventually stymied his confirmation as secretary of defense. (Trump told reporters he first found out about the domestic abuse allegations in Shanahan's past on Monday and defended his administration's handling of the nominee: ""We have a very good vetting process."")

Even though Republicans still control the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has apparently decided his chamber is too busy to take up its other constitutional duties. Senate Republicans reportedly told Trump they don't have time on the calendar or adequate political capital for confirmation hearings to staff Trump’s Cabinet.

“I don’t know what his rationale is, but it’s bound to create more challenges,” said Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the chamber. “They’re not subject to Senate confirmation when they’re in acting, and I think we need some more certainty, more predictability would be good.”

We will once again have an acting secretary of defense, and this one hasn't even been nominated for the position. The vacuum has been filled by war hawks like Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton, both of whom publicly push towards war with Iran. So there may be a method to Trump’s madness after all. Total chaos and no one to answer for it provides the perfect environment for war."
"Pete Buttigieg says ""it's almost certain"" he wouldn't be first gay president",https://www.cbsnews.com,"[""Caitlin O'Kane""]",,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/buttigieg-weve-probably-had-excellent-presidents-who-were-gay/,"2020 presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg could make history as the youngest president in the history of the United States — and the first openly gay one. Buttigieg, however, believes he wouldn't be the only gay president.

Pete Buttigieg Axios on HBO

Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, came out as gay in 2015, before being elected to his second term as mayor. He is now married to junior high school teacher Chasten Glezman, who would become first gentleman if Buttigieg wins the presidency.

In an interview with ""Axios on HBO,"" Buttigieg was asked about critics potentially saying he's too young, too liberal and too gay to be commander-in-chief.

He was asked, ""You are young. You are a liberal. You are gay. How will you respond?""

""I'll respond by explaining where I want to lead this country,"" the candidate replied. ""People will elect the person who will make the best president. And we have had excellent presidents who have been young. We have had excellent presidents who have been liberal. I would imagine we've probably had excellent presidents who were gay — we just didn't know which ones.""

Buttigieg said ""statistically, it's almost certain"" that there has been a gay president before. Of course, none have been openly gay, and almost every president, except for two, have been married to women.

An estimated 4.5 percent of the U.S. population is LGBTQ, a 2018 study by the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law found. So Buttigieg's assumption that at least one out of the nation's 45 presidents was gay is not so far-fetched — he just doesn't know which one.

""My gaydar even doesn't work that well in the present, let alone retroactively,"" he told Axios. ""But one can only assume that's the case."""
Treasury yields fall further after the Fed give hints a rate cut could be coming,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/19/us-treasury-yields-tick-higher-as-investors-await-federal-reserve-meeting.html,"U.S. government debt yields fell Wednesday after the Federal Reserve struck a more dovish tone in its June policy statement and Chair Jerome Powell said that the case for easier monetary policy had strengthened.

Though the central bank maintained the target overnight lending rate, that decision was accompanied by a growing number of officials open to one rate cut by the end of 2019 with eight members in favor. However, the consensus still didn't expect a reduction until 2020 at the earliest.

The policymaking committee of the Fed also dropped the word ""patient"" from its statement, a sign interpreted by some investors as a hint that the central bank hasn't abandoned the idea of a rate cut in 2019. The Fed tweaked its statement to acknowledge that inflation is ""running below"" its 2% objective.

At around 3:17 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to price, was lower at around 2.035%, while the yield on the 2-year slipped to 1.768%, its lowest level since 2017. The 3-month Treasury bill yield ticked lower to 2.195%, keeping a portion of the yield curve inverted.

Speaking to reporters after the central bank meeting, Powell said policymakers are worried about certain economic data and see an improving case for easier policy.

""Overall, our policy discussion focused on the appropriate response to the uncertain environment,"" he said. ""Many participants now see the case for somewhat more accommodative policy has strengthened,"" Powell said.

Softer economic gauges like May's anemic jobs report — which showed that the U.S. economy added just 75,000 positions — and a lackluster consumer pricing print suggested to economists and fixed-income traders earlier this month that the central bank may have to assure markets of its willingness to step in if GDP growth decelerates.

Traders are now pricing in a more than 80% chance of a rate cut in July and 70% probability of another reduction in September, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.

""It was largely what the market was looking for: I don't think they went too far as to spook the market in any way,"" said Tom Garretson, a fixed-income strategist at RBC. ""Seeing that eight [officials] are seeing a rate cut this year was dovish.""

""This is mostly an inflation story,"" he added. ""If you look at GDP forecast for 2020 they're up to 2% from 1.9% ... even if they were worried about tariffs, it didn't show up in their forecast.""

The Fed has in recent months been grappling with a consistent shortfall in inflation relative to its self-imposed 2% target. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, increased 1.6% in the year to April after gaining 1.5% in March.

Treasury inflation-protected securities — bonds whose payouts are indexed to consumer prices — show that price growth expectations have slid in recent months. Inflation is a threat to the value of a bond's fixed coupon and principal payments.

Wednesday's decision from the Federal Open Market Committee came after President Donald Trump's repeated criticism of the Fed and Jerome Powell specifically for raising rates and tightening monetary conditions over the last year. Trump, who sees recent Fed policy as damaging to American markets and undermining his bargaining position in trade talks, has broken with tradition in his frequent and vocal criticism of the central bank.

Asked Tuesday whether he wants to remove Powell as Fed Chair, Trump said ""Let's see what he does."" Trump's comments came after Bloomberg News reported Tuesday morning that the White House had looked into demoting Powell in February.

Trump also said Tuesday he will be having an ""extended meeting"" next week with the Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the G-20 meeting in Japan.

Meanwhile, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said Tuesday that the central bank may need to ease monetary policy in the coming months if inflation doesn't bounce back toward its target.

""In the absence of improvement, such that the sustained return of inflation to our aim is threatened, additional stimulus will be required,"" Draghi said.

"Interior's internal FOIA policy gives political appointees sign-off on document releases, raising concerns",https://www.cnn.com,['Ellie Kaufman'],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/18/politics/interior-foia-process/index.html,"(CNN) The Interior Department has developed a second, undisclosed internal Freedom of Information Act review policy, which requires certain political appointees to sign off on documents before releasing them publicly, according to internal emails and documents reviewed by CNN.

This extra layer of review, established in a draft memo in May 2018 that CNN has viewed, requires the deputy chief of staff, director of communications and the deputy solicitor to be copied on documents that mention politically appointed staff members before they are released in response to a FOIA request, a process critics say is injecting politics into what is supposed to be a nonpolitical process.

Government agencies have internal FOIA offices that handle all FOIA requests. These offices are typically staffed by career officials, not political appointees. Agencies can develop their own internal processes for how they respond to FOIA requests, but the process is supposed to remain nonpartisan.

The emails and documents CNN reviewed are included in a complaint from Earthjustice, representing environmental advocacy groups the Sierra Club and Friends of the Earth, to the Interior Department's inspector general.

In the complaint, the groups ask the IG to investigate the department's practices when responding to FOIA requests, because they are concerned this extra layer of review is slowing the department's responses to the requests, contributing to missed court-mandated deadlines to produce internal documents. Earthjustice is a litigation firm that frequently represents environmental groups.

While the process is laid out in a draft memo, it is not included in the department's ""awareness process,"" which has been published publicly and is dated May 24, 2018. The Interior Department acknowledges only the ""awareness process"" as its official FOIA review policy.

The Interior Department did not initially directly respond when asked about the draft memo with the extra layer of review from certain political appointees and whether it is still used. In response to CNN's questions, Interior Department spokeswoman Molly Block said, ""The official policy that we adhere to is published on our website.""

After this story published, Block denied that there is a second FOIA process and said, ""There is no requirement for certain political appointees to sign off on documents.""

""Once again, the Department does not have an affirmative response requirement from political officials, and has not had such a policy in this Administration,"" Block said in an email after this story published. ""Because there have apparently been misunderstandings about this question, including in prior Administrations, the Awareness Review Process was formalized in writing for the first time by this Administration.""

The ""awareness process,"" published publicly, requires FOIA officers to search all documents for mentions of any political appointees. Then an attorney from the department's Solicitor's Office and any relevant employees are given 72 hours to review the documents before they're released publicly. The policy states that if no one responds after 72 hours, silence is considered an acknowledgment that the document production can move forward.

The department updated the ""awareness process"" on February 28, instructing FOIA personnel to first notify their bureau contact, then make a list of all political appointees included in the document production, then notify a Solicitor's Office attorney. The reviewer and attorney are then given three days to review the documents.

However, internal emails obtained by environmental advocacy groups through FOIA show that a second layer of review and approval by certain political appointees was added along with the awareness process. It just wasn't included in the official memo.

Emails show secret process started in May 2018

The extra layer of review first appears in a draft memo in May 2018 called ""Day in the Life of the OS FOIA Office."" In the memo, it states that after the documents produced in response to a FOIA request are returned from the Solicitor's Office, a FOIA official reviews the documents for any political appointees. Then the political appointees named have ""72-hour awareness to 5 days"" to review the documents.

""Deputy Chief of Staff, Director of Communications, and the Deputy Solicitor are cc'd"" on each group of documents being reviewed by any political appointees as well, the memo states.

While this language was not included in the ""awareness process"" dated May 24, internal emails reviewed by CNN suggest that certain political appointees were copied on documents produced in response to FOIA requests, a sign the process is being followed, and the advocacy groups allege it caused the department to miss or almost miss at least three court-ordered document production deadlines.

An email from Interior FOIA Public Liaison Clarice Julka sent on June 11, 2018, says that ""in addition to the written policy on awareness review, please do the following: For any releases of documents involving the following offices: Comms, OCL, Exec Sec, External Affairs, Secretary, Chief of Staff, Deputy Chiefs of Staff and their assistants, please send the records and the response to DCOS, Downey Magallanes, at least 72 hours prior to release and confirm with her prior to release.""

OCL is the Office of Congressional and Legislative Affairs. Magallanes was the deputy chief of staff to the secretary at the time that the email was sent.

On August 2, 2018, Nicholas Banco, who works in the FOIA office, emailed Magallanes, then-press secretary Heather Swift and a handful of other political appointees, saying, ""Unfortunately, the Department has missed its initial proposed date for production and DOJ is seeking a release as soon as possible. OS is intending to release the attached materials no later than August 6, 2018. Please expedite your review if at all possible.""

The groups allege that Banco was waiting for an affirmation from the political appointees copied on the email before moving forward with document production. An email from acting Associate Solicitor Aaron Moody sent on May 1, 2018, to Magallanes asks her to complete her awareness review before the following day so the department can meet a court-ordered deadline. The groups allege this approval is also the reason these documents were held up.

A separate email from a staffer in the department's FOIA office, Ryan McQuighan, requests ""affirmative response"" from two political appointees copied on the email before he can release documents. The advocacy groups allege that this email shows McQuighan was waiting for their response to move forward with document production. On April 2, 2018, McQuighan writes that""deadline for this FOIA was last Friday, so we need to get affirmative response soon.""

Not illegal, but 'concerning'

FOIA experts say that while on its face this added layer of review by political appointees is not illegal, it raises concerns.

Elizabeth Hempowicz, the director of public policy for the Project on Government Oversight, said that if the political appointee's decisions are ""based on anything other than the law"" -- such as being ""based on political considerations, how it will affect the administration"" -- that could make the implementation of the policy illegal.

""Now, you are involving them in the decision making of what's going out, and that's where there might be some impropriety,"" Hempowicz told CNN.

The documents that show the creation and implementation of the two policies were originally obtained through a series of FOIA requests by the Sierra Club and Friends of the Earth. The groups first made the requests in June 2018, and they received documents from the Interior Department between August 2018 and March 2019. The groups went to court to obtain the documents, according to Earthjustice attorney Yuting Chi.

""They're allowed to have a process. They are allowed to have departmental regulations. What they're not allowed to do is to fail to meet the FOIA deadlines that is statutorily mandated,"" Chi told CNN.

This is not the first time the agency has come under scrutiny for its handling of FOIA requests.

At the end of 2018, the department proposed a rule that would change how the agency responds to FOIA requests. The proposal, which claimed it was designed to ""streamline the FOIA submission process,"" would limit the number of requests individuals or groups could make each month. It would also allow the department to ""not honor a request that requires an unreasonably burdensome search.""

A department spokeswoman said making the process more efficient would ""ensure more equitable and regular access to federal records for all requesters, not just litigious special interest groups.""

During a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing on May 22, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said he was deciding what to do about the proposed FOIA rule after receiving feedback from a bipartisan group of senators and thousands of public comments on the rule itself.

""I'm considering whether we should scrap it, whether we should proceed with it or whether we should significantly modify it,"" Bernhardt said during the hearing.

First on CNN: Controversial political appointee expected to be named Customs and Border Protection press secretary,https://www.cnn.com,['Geneva Sands'],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/18/politics/katharine-gorka-customs-and-border-protection/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Katharine Gorka, a political appointee at the Department of Homeland Security who has stirred controversy for her views on terrorism and her role in the department's efforts to combat violent extremism in the US, is expected to be the new press secretary at Customs and Border Protection.

Acting CBP Commissioner John Sanders told CNN Tuesday that Gorka is expected to take the position and he advocated for her to join the agency.

The move comes as President Donald Trump continues his rhetoric against undocumented immigrants and the increasing number of migrants crossing the southern border and claiming asylum.

Customs and Border Protection is the agency responsible for policing the US borders and facilitating legal trade and travel. It is also the frontline agency dealing with the surge of migrants at the southern border. If Gorka steps into this new role, she will be taking on the public face of the agency at the center of the President's attention, which has been struggling with capacity and resource issues.

The Department of Homeland Security has also seen a major turnover in senior staff in the wake of Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen's forced departure in April. Several CBP officials joined Kevin McAleenan at DHS headquarters when he was named acting Homeland Security secretary.

In response to a request for comment on her new post, Gorka told CNN Tuesday, ""I am honored for this opportunity to serve at CBP.""

Gorka is married to Sebastian Gorka, the former deputy assistant to Trump, who was an outspoken and combative defender of the President's national security agenda, known for his dire warnings of Islamic terrorism while writing for Breitbart.

Sebastian Gorka left the White House in August 2017, in the wake of chief White House strategist Steve Bannon's forced departure.

Both Gorkas wrote for Breitbart, where Bannon served as an executive before and after his time at the White House.

In a 2014, Breitbart story, Katharine Gorka, under the name Katie Gorka, wrote that ""Presidents Bush and Obama both publicly declared Islam to be a religion of peace, which has struck a sour chord for many. ""

""To date, American and Western leaders have preemptively shut down any debate within Islam by declaring that Islam is the religion of peace and that terrorism has nothing to do with Islam,"" she wrote

In another 2014 article, she wrote that the Obama administration ""narrowly defined the enemy as only the most violent jihadists: first Al Qaeda and now ISIS.""

""This inaccurate assessment of the enemy has its roots in left-wing theories about social movements,"" she wrote in part.

Gorka has supporters within the administration and department and was recommended by various people for a DHS policy job. ""She was very good at her job and is very intelligent,"" said the senior official about her time at DHS.

Gorka, who has been with the Trump administration since its beginning, was under consideration to lead the new DHS terrorism prevention office, but was not offered the position, according to two sources. An administration official said DHS did not want her past controversies to be a distraction from the work of the department.

While at DHS, she worked in the policy office on what is known as ""countering violent extremism"" issues, according to the official. Countering violent extremism efforts have historically been associated with preventing individuals from radicalizing and joining or carrying out attacks on behalf of Islamic terror groups, but some activity has been focused on thwarting threats from domestic terror movements, like white nationalist extremists.

In August 2017, the Huffington Post reported that Gorka and other aides worked to eliminate a DHS grant for Life After Hate, which would have been used to expand its outreach and intervention services for former white supremacists and others in the ""criminal underground."" Earlier that summer, DHS, under the leadership of then-DHS Secretary John Kelly, cut some organizations out of grant money to counter violent extremism -- including nearly a dozen that the Obama administration considered worthy of receiving the funds.

A DHS official also previously told the Huffington Post that the department, and Gorka, ""has a productive relationship with (Life After Hate) and has recently met and participated in events with its new leadership.""

A DHS spokesperson told CNN, ""Katie has been a valuable member of the DHS team, helping to advance the department's mission of preventing targeted violence and countering terrorism, regardless of ideology. We look forward to her continued service with the department in her new position at CBP as we work to secure the border and enforce our nation's immigration laws.""

In March, the legal watchdog group Democracy Forward sued the department for records detailing Gorka's role as a senior adviser at DHS, after it was unsuccessful with a Freedom of Information Act request.

""The public deserves to know what Katharine Gorka is doing at DHS, but the Trump administration isn't saying,"" said Democracy Forward spokeswoman Charisma Troiano at the time. ""We're suing to find out whether her extreme and biased views are driving Homeland Security resources away from real threats.""

Troiano said that the organization has yet to receive records and the lawsuit is ongoing.

Earlier this year, American Oversight also requested records from the department for Gorka ""to shed light on DHS counterterrorism efforts.""

""Katharine Gorka, an advisor in DHS's policy office has a long history of working with far-right national security groups, and her writings have been described as anti-Muslim in sentiment,"" wrote Executive Director Austin Evers in a letter to DHS in January.

It is unclear if the press secretary role has been finalized or when Gorka will begin at CBP. The agency's last press secretary left in March to join the communications team at the Environmental Protection Agency."
Opinion | A New Trump Battleground: Defining Human Rights,https://www.nytimes.com,['Carol Giacomo'],06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/17/opinion/editorials/trump-human-rights-natural-law.html,"After the horrors of World War II, the United States led in adopting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, recognizing the “inherent dignity” and “equal and inalienable rights” of all people to life and liberty. For three-quarters of a century it has stood for the protection of human rights by the rule of law.

Now, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is establishing a Commission on Unalienable Rights to “provide fresh thinking about human rights discourse where such discourse has departed from our nation’s founding principles of natural law and natural rights,” according to a notice in the Federal Register.

Fresh thinking isn’t necessarily a bad thing. But tampering with a legacy built over decades raises serious questions, especially when the State Department’s human rights bureau and Congress have so far been excluded from the process.

One concern is the reference to “natural law,” which is held to be more powerful than the laws people write, and can suggest a narrower, religious sensibility. When the term natural law has been thrown about, it’s often been by people concerned with what they think is unnatural — homosexuality, transgender rights, reproductive choice and sexual equality."
Dems want to nuke DOJ policy barring presidential prosecutions,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Alex Pappas', 'Alex Pappas Is A Politics Reporter At Foxnews.Com.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dems-want-to-nuke-doj-policy-barring-presidential-prosecutions,"Special Counsel Robert Mueller said last month that charging President Trump with a crime “was not an option we could consider” because of the Justice Department policy barring the prosecution of sitting presidents.

Democrats are now talking about finding a way to change that.

“Congress should make it clear that presidents can be indicted for criminal activity, including obstruction of justice,"" Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate, recently proposed.

WARREN PROPOSES LAW SAYING A PRESIDENT CAN BE INDICTED

And other congressional Democrats have since said they are considering whether the DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel 1973 memorandum against charging a sitting president should be revoked -- though no legislation has been introduced just yet.

“It's fair to say that one of the options we should consider is revisiting that Department of Justice rule so you don't have a rogue and lawless president immunized from criminal prosecution,” New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, told The Hill.

Another lawmaker, Virginia Rep. Gerry Connolly, a member of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, suggested that a measure revoking the policy could be included in some sort of spending package or authorization bill.

“I guarantee you it will be a topic of discussion,” Connolly told The Hill.

While Mueller in his report said his investigation found no evidence of a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election, the special counsel declined to issue a conclusion in the report about whether Trump obstructed justice through his comments and actions related to the investigation. The president repeatedly referred to the probe as a ""witch hunt"" and allegedly sought to have Mueller removed -- but he never did, and Trump has recently disputed that he even sought the special counsel's ouster.

“Charging the president with a crime was not an option we could consider,” Mueller said during his public statement last month, adding that “it would be unfair to accuse someone of a crime when there could be no court resolution of the charge.”

After the release of the Mueller report, Attorney General Bill Barr said he determined no crime had been committed by the president, but Democrats have argued Trump would have been charged with obstruction had he not been president. Republicans, meanwhile, have countered that Trump could not have been charged with obstruction since Mueller determined there was no underlying crime of conspiring with the Russians.

TRUMP CLAIMS 'OBAMA HAD TO KNOW ABOUT' EFFORTS TO UNDERMINE PRESIDENCY

The fresh chatter about upending the DOJ guidance amounts to the latest Democratic bid to reexamine federal policy toward alleged wrongdoing of sitting presidents.

Last month, House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and other Democrats introduced the “No President Is Above the Law Act.” The sponsors said in a news release at the time that it would pause the statute of limitations for any federal offense committed by a sitting president and “ensure that presidents can be held accountable for criminal conduct just like every other American and not use the presidency to avoid legal consequences.”

""No person can be permitted to evade accountability for their actions just because they happen to be president,"" Nadler said. ""I have concerns with the Justice Department interpretation that a sitting president cannot be indicted, but if that is the policy, a president who commits a crime before or during their term in office, could exploit this loophole and avoid prosecution just because the statute of limitations has run out. This is unacceptable. The presidency is not a get-out-of-jail-free card.""

Even though Barr said he determined no crime had been committed by the president, several Democratic presidential candidates are now indicating on the campaign trail that they would support a DOJ investigation into whether Trump obstructed justice if they win the White House in 2020.

California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris said last week she believes the only reason Mueller didn’t recommend prosecuting Trump was because of the Justice Department’s policy. In an interview with NPR, Harris said that once out of office, Trump would be subject to charges – and she suggested the Justice Department in a Harris presidency would pursue them.

“I believe that they would have no choice and that they should, yes,” Harris said.

Another 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, said last week that if elected president, he could also support a Justice Department criminal investigation into Trump.

“To the extent that there’s an obstruction case, then yes, DOJ’s got to deal with it,” Buttigieg said in an interview with The Atlantic published Thursday.

Trump, during an interview that aired Sunday night on ABC News, denied being worried about being prosecuted once he leaves office.

“Did nothing wrong,” Trump said. “There was no collusion.”

Interior spending bill holds Trump administration accountable for 2017 promises,https://thehill.com,[],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/449247-interior-spending-bill-holds-trump-administration,"This week, the U.S. House of Representatives will take up its spending bill for the U.S. Department of the Interior for fiscal year 2020. The bill advanced out of the House Appropriations Committee with $13.8 billion budgeted for the agency, including increases in funding for conservation, public lands and wildlife management, but also containing revenue language related to the proposed Arctic National Wildlife Refuge oil and gas leasing program and aimed at protecting American citizens. The House should pass its appropriations bill with this language intact, and if their colleagues in the Senate truly care about not only preserving our public lands but protecting American taxpayers as well, they will do the same.

Two years ago, the widely opposed Trump tax cuts mortgaged the future of seniors and working families in order to hand massive tax breaks to Wall Street, corporations and the wealthiest 1 percent. At the same time, oil industry allies in Congress were able to circumvent normal legislative channels and take advantage of an expedited legislative process to include an Arctic Refuge drilling program in the tax bill. They knew that winning support for such a controversial measure in an above-board process would otherwise have been impossible.

The tax bill also took the unprecedented step of making oil leasing and development one of the official purposes of the Arctic Refuge — no other national wildlife refuge has oil and gas as a statutory purpose — undercutting the integrity of the Arctic Refuge and setting a dangerous precedent for America’s entire National Wildlife Refuge System.

When the unpopular tax bill passed, the Trump administration and its allies defended the equally unpopular Arctic drilling provision by claiming that opening the Arctic Refuge to leasing would generate billions for the U.S. treasury. What the language of the Interior appropriations bill does now is simply require Interior to set a minimum bid capable of generating the revenues promised by the tax bill — the agency can only move forward with a lease sale if it ensures the sale raises at least half of the $1 billion agreed to in the FY2018 budget resolution. By requiring a floor on what companies must pay to lease a piece of the Arctic Refuge’s fragile coastal plain, this provision holds the Trump administration accountable to its own promises.

Let’s be clear that we believe leasing and development should never occur in the Arctic Refuge, and Rep. Betty McCollum Betty Louise McCollumHouse Dems call on Trump to cancel plans to speak at July Fourth celebration House Dems call on Trump to cancel plans to speak at July Fourth celebration Mueller puts ball in Democrats' court MORE (D-Minn.), chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee’s Interior-Environment Subcommittee, summed it up succinctly following committee markup of this year’s Interior bill: ""I oppose opening ANWR, but now that it's in the tax bill, we must ensure the American taxpayer is protected.""

From the very beginning, the stated reason for having a federal oil and gas program in the Arctic Refuge was always to raise revenue for the federal treasury. There was never any real evidence to back up the billion-dollar claim, and in fact many experts at the time pointed out that raising the proposed revenue would depend on the highly unlikely scenario of leasing nearly every acre of the coastal plain at sky-high prices. What is illuminating, however, has been the reaction and artificial offense taken by the architects of the Arctic Refuge leasing program to this Interior bill language.

Following the House markup, Sen. Lisa Murkowski Lisa Ann MurkowskiHillicon Valley: Hacker group targeted electric grid | House Democrats press CBP over facial recognition program | Senators offer bill to protect health data | Groups file FCC complaint over carriers' use of location data Hillicon Valley: Hacker group targeted electric grid | House Democrats press CBP over facial recognition program | Senators offer bill to protect health data | Groups file FCC complaint over carriers' use of location data Klobuchar, Murkowski introduce legislation to protect consumer health data MORE (R-Alaska), the driving force pushing for Arctic Refuge development, was quoted as saying, ""I think what they've set up is something that's designed to kill exploration in ANWR.""

And in a letter to Rep. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.), the chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, the White House Office of Management and Budget wrote:

In addition, section 118 prohibits DOI from using funds to conduct a lease sale in the Coastal Plain (1002 area) of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, unless that sale meets arbitrary national minimum bid criteria. This restriction imposes unnecessary and unrealistic restrictions on leasing in an area that the Congress has already authorized.

Think about that for a second. The driving force behind the leasing program, Lisa Murkowski, admits that requiring minimum bids today to meet revenue she herself defended two years ago would “kill exploration” in the Arctic Refuge. The Trump administration has put in writing that it believes the projections used to sell Congress and the public on allowing oil development were “arbitrary” and “unnecessary and unrealistic.” As a reminder, the ONLY reason an Arctic Refuge leasing program was able to be included in the reconciliation process in the first places was as a billion-dollar offset for tax cuts.

Call it lying to the American public, call it misleading, but whatever you call it, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has been opened to the risk of a massive oil drilling operation based on willful dishonesty. Experts didn’t buy the numbers then, and they still don’t today. And now we know Murkowski and the Trump administration never really believed their own promises either.

"EPA fast tracking chemical reviews amid Trump deregulation push, environmental group reports",https://www.houstonchronicle.com,"['James Osborne', 'Washington Energy Correspondent', 'Follow James On', 'Past Articles This Author', 'Joey Guerra', 'Staff Writer', 'Jerome Solomon', 'Taylor Goldenstein', 'Austin Bureau', 'Aaron Wilson']",06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/EPA-fast-tracking-chemical-reviews-amid-Trump-14015893.php,"WASHINGTON - New chemicals coming into the marketplace are getting fast tracked for approval by the EPA, despite bipartisan reforms in 2016 designed to increase scrutiny over chemicals and reduce public health risks, according to a new report by the Environmental Defense Fund.

Researchers at the advocacy group found over the past year the Environmental Protection Agency was approving 80 percent of the new chemicals that came before it, a rate in line with EPA approval rates before Congress passed the reforms in 2016.

“Political appointees at EPA have taken every opportunity to undermine the 2016 [reforms] and elevate the industry’s interests over public health,” said Richard Denison, lead senior scientist at EDF. “The consequences of these mistakes will be felt by generations to come.”

The controversy comes amid a wider deregulatory push by the Trump administration, which has criticized EPA for holding up industrial expansion that could add jobs and boost the U.S. economy.

The shift described by Environmental Defense Fund. comes as a boon to many Houston-area chemical manufacturers, which have already seen restrictions on chemicals including trichloroethylene, an industrial cleaning agent, and methylene chloride, a paint stripper, rolled back under the Trump administration.

On HoustonChronicle.com: In Washington, politics around oil, climate in flux

The American Chemistry Council, a trade group representing chemical companies, described the Environmental Defense Fund’s report as “false” and an attempt to “undermine the implementation of [the reforms] and disparage the dedicated staff at EPA and the chemical industry.”

“The 2016 amendments to the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) are being effectively and efficiently implemented,” Jon Corley, a spokesman for the trade group, said.

EPA declined to comment.

But concern is mounting in Congress that the Trump administration is going too far to appease chemical manufacturers.

“At almost every turn, the Trump administration has failed to live up to the letter and spirit of the historic bipartisan reform,” said Senator Tom Udall, D-N.M. “EPA leaders - starting with [Administrator] Andrew Wheeler - must change course, commit themselves to protecting the public, and carry out the [reforms] as Congress wrote it.”

In one instance, staff at EPA recommended restricted use for a chemical used in air and laundry fresheners called jeffamine diacrylamide because it’s in a class of chemicals commonly associated with elevated risk of cancer. But that recommendation was overruled and the chemical approved without the recommended restrictions, Denison said.

“We don’t know who made decision,” he said. “We’re lucky we know the original decision because EPA posted it on its website, but in response to this and other incidents, they stopped doing that,”

So far the company that makes the chemical, International Flavors and Fragrances of New York, has not released products containing jeffamine diacrylamide onto the market, Denison said.

House Homeland Security Republicans to introduce slew of cybersecurity bills,https://thehill.com,[],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/448971-house-homeland-security-republicans-to-introduce-slew-of-cybersecurity,"Republicans on the House Homeland Security Committee are gearing up to introduce a bevy of bills aimed at enhancing the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) cybersecurity capabilities.

The bills are the first glimpse into the new ""American Security Agenda"" that committee Republicans plan to pursue this Congress.

Rogers will say that the goal of the agenda is to “take a hard look at the Department’s missions and act to ensure that DHS is prepared to tackle the emerging threats to our homeland,” including threats to social media, satellites and theft of intellectual property.

Republican members of the committee plan to introduce seven pieces of legislation in the coming weeks, with several specifically focused on cybersecurity.

Three other bills set to be introduced by GOP Homeland Security committee members will include one to help TSA identify emerging threats to the transportation system, and others on reforming DHS’s structure and management.

Rogers will note in his speech that “these seven bills are just the start,” and that “we are working on other bills to address emerging threats that we hope to introduce soon as part of our agenda.”

A Homeland Security Committee aide told The Hill in a phone call that while timing for the formal reintroduction of these bills has not been set, some will be reintroduced “this week."" The aide emphasized that “we are not going to drop everything tomorrow,” and that the overall agenda outlined by Rogers will be “built out in the next 16 months.”

The aide said that Rogers and Thompson appear to be in agreement on most of the cybersecurity issues, noting that both congressmen are “very interested in making sure that DHS keeps up with nation states and hackers and making sure that our cyber infrastructure is secure.”

The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee has also been consulted on the issues Rogers will outline, the aide confirmed to The Hill, noting that the chairmen and ranking members of both committees have met to discuss the agenda.

The aide said that both Rogers and Katko engage with DHS on a weekly basis, and that the committee’s job is “to make sure they [DHS] can do their job correctly.”

“Instead of changing the deck chairs on a sinking ship, we want to make sure that this a department that is fully engaged and prepared for the 21st century,” the aide said."

In our opinion: The Department of Agriculture is moving workers to Kansas City.

Continuing this trend, the administration announced last week that economists and scientists at the Department of Agriculture will be relocated to Kansas City. This is another move that makes great sense, considering that bureaucracy’s effect on farmers concentrated in the heartland.

The good sense seemed lost on angry employees of the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, however. Many of them stood and turned their backs on Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue as he made the announcement last Thursday.

Frankly, they need to get over it. Those affected by federal decisions have little need for bureaucrats who want to cling to the power structure in Washington.

"" Those affected by federal decisions have little need for bureaucrats who want to cling to the power structure in Washington. ""

CNN cited concerns by employees who don’t want to be separated from the government they serve. That is a perfect example of the problem. They are supposed to serve the people, not the government.

That said, we sympathize with workers who would need to uproot their families, sell houses, leave friends and move to an entirely different part of the country. Such moves are not easy. Millions of people each year face decisions whether to go where their employer wants them to go or to find other work that would allow them to stay. These can be difficult choices, and we acknowledge that, unlike the BLM, where many workers already reside in various states, these agencies operate mainly in Washington. However, we have no doubt that Department of Agriculture employees will weather these changes as well as have others in various industries.

Critics worry about the loss of institutional knowledge if these agencies need to hire new people. This may be a valid concern, but it should be weighed against the possible gains of having fresh eyes with fresh ideas looking at old problems. Stagnation, entrenchment and an attitude of entitlement are bigger concerns in bureaucracies.

These agencies are supposed to produce nonpartisan reports and analyses. That should be as easy to do in Kansas City as it is in Washington, where politics permeate every crevice.

Administrations will shift from conservative to liberal and back again through the years. But having these agencies close to the people they serve will add a new level of accountability.

Besides all this, the move makes great economic sense. The department estimates a savings of $300 million over 15 years. Kansas City has more modest living costs and lower salaries than does Washington.

In addition, the move will be a boon to the Kansas City economy, adding many good-paying jobs.

Perhaps only a Washington bureaucrat could find fault with such a move. Utahns, meanwhile, should hope they soon can host the headquarters of the BLM. Spreading the federal government among the people is a capital idea."

The state is leading a quiet revolt.

Despite having the highest poverty rate in the United States, Mississippi has the nation’s lowest rate of homelessness. But instead of heralding Mississippi’s success and imploring other states to follow its lead, the Department of Justice is taking formal legal action against the state’s highly effective method of delivering mental-health services.

Back in 2016, DOJ filed a formal complaint against the state, alleging that its approach to mental health “has resulted in [the] repeated, prolonged, and unnecessary institutionalization [of the mentally ill] in state-run psychiatric hospitals, and placed them at serious risk of such institutionalization, in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.” The complaint and ensuing legal challenges brought both sides before U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves early this month, and the judge rejected the state’s motion to dismiss the case. The case raises a series of questions about the limits of federal oversight and the jurisdictional authority of states and localities.

Mississippi is one of the few states in the country to retain a state mental-hospital network as an integral part of its mental-health system. While every state has public or private mental institutions, most have relegated their hospitals to ancillary roles, available only to treat a small handful of hard cases and forensic patients. As a result, the most seriously mentally ill, who often require institutional services, have been forced into inappropriate placements in the community. Many end up homeless, incarcerated, or as frequent patients in already-crowded emergency rooms. Mississippi has stood firm in its provision of a robust network of inpatient services for the mentally ill, much to the dismay of the Department of Justice. DOJ is apparently unsatisfied with the carnage deinstitutionalization has wrought on communities across the country and is attempting to force Mississippi to alter its approach to treating its most vulnerable citizens.

DOJ’s complaint letter accuses Mississippi of violating the terms of the landmark 1999 Supreme Court case Olmstead vs. L.C., which held that the state of Georgia had violated the Americans with Disabilities Act in its refusal to offer community-based services to two mentally ill complainants for whom the state’s experts deemed such a transfer clinically appropriate. In Mississippi, the DOJ isn’t bringing forth an analogous case; the complaint is not filed on behalf of a specific aggrieved party, but is instead directed at the entire statewide treatment apparatus for its alleged failure to protect “the rights of adults with mental illness to receive services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs.” DOJ is attempting to force Mississippi to restructure its entire mental-health system.

The original Olmstead decision, authored by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, was far more balanced than DOJ portends. The decision compelled states to offer individuals with mental disabilities access to community-based services, subject to three substantial qualifications.

First, the transfer of individuals from “institutions” to less structured environments must be formally approved by the state’s medical professionals, who are required to “have determined that community placement is appropriate” for the affected individual. Ginsburg drew explicit boundaries around the scope of the community mandate, quoting the American Psychiatric Association:

“Some individuals, whether mentally retarded or mentally ill, are not prepared at particular times — perhaps in the short run, perhaps in the long run — for the risks and exposure of the less protective environment of community settings”; for these persons, “institutional settings are needed and must remain available.”

Ginsburg also made clear that “nothing in the ADA or its implementing regulations condones termination of institutional settings for persons unable to handle or benefit from community settings.”

This last clause — “unable to handle or benefit from community settings” — has been occasionally inverted to assert that no one needs institutional services. Deena Fox, an attorney in DOJ’s Civil Rights Division, has not explicitly called for Mississippi to cease all institutional services, but she has promised that “evidence at trial will make clear that individuals with serious mental illness can be appropriately served in the community.” Some individuals with severe mental illness can be served in the community, of course, to different degrees and at different times. But the objection of the DOJ is principally much deeper than that.

Attorney Bill Choslovsky, who has fought similarly obstreperous Olmstead-based litigation in the state of Illinois, calls the logical terminus of DOJ’s argument a “leeches” hypothesis. Just as leeches are viewed as an intrinsically inappropriate medical device — it would be malpractice to use leeches to treat any conceivable disease — the DOJ is trying to impose its view that institutionalization is medically inappropriate per se by asserting medical authority that it doesn’t have. The analogy is wrong on the merits: According to Dr. E. Fuller Torrey in his book American Psychosis, 15 psychiatric experts were empaneled in 2008 to examine the minimum number of public psychiatric beds necessary to deal with those who inevitably fall through the cracks of the community system. This includes beds necessary for both the acutely ill (those suffering temporary suicidal or homicidal impulses, psychotic breaks, or other aggravated psychiatric phenomena) and the small but significant number of profoundly ill individuals who, in Olmstead’s phrasing, are not prepared “for the risks and exposure of the less protective environment of community settings” in the long run. The panel arrived at between 40–60 public psychiatric beds per 100,000 population, presuming adequate outpatient services.

The second qualifier that Olmstead made to its community-services mandate maintains that “the transfer from institutional care to a less restrictive setting” must not be “opposed by the affected individual.” Olmstead imparts no duty for patients to forgo services they are currently receiving, even if they are qualified to be in a less intensive care environment.

Finally — and this is the qualification most pertinent to Mississippi’s affirmative defense — the majority opinion insisted that for a community placement to occur, it must be “reasonably accommodated, taking into account the resources available to the State and the needs of others with mental disabilities.” This begets the “fundamental alteration” defense, which traces itself back to the original language of the ADA (emphasis mine):

A public entity shall make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.

Mississippi’s attorneys insist that the Department of Justice is demanding adherence to what amounts to a limitless and arbitrary standard. Mississippi already has community-based mental health services, though proportionately fewer than its peers. Every other state retains some degree of institutional services, and many of them have avoided DOJ litigation. The DOJ, then, is taking issue with the proportion of individuals who receive institutional services, which raises the question: How much is enough? In the absence of a specific claimant who can demonstrate harm under the Olmstead guidelines, how many hospitals must Mississippi close to meet the undefined and interminable demands of DOJ? And how does this not amount to a “fundamental alteration” of the balance of services that the state already provides?

Because of the nature of public finance and the budgetary strictures of state government, the state is making the laudable decision to orient their system towards treating the seriously mentally ill who require hospitalization; Mississippi has precisely nothing to apologize for.

Clarence Thomas’s dissent in Olmstead highlighted the imprecision with which the majority used the word “discrimination” to describe Georgia’s decision to treat patients in “an institutional setting after they became eligible for community placement.” He presciently noted that “by adopting such a broad view of discrimination, the majority drains the term of any meaning other than as a proxy for decisions disapproved of by this Court.” But even Ginsburg acknowledged an appellate court’s ruling that “the State’s duty to provide integrated services ‘is not absolute.’” States are allowed by Olmstead to preserve institutional settings necessary for the most severely ill, and the cost of preserving those settings may, in the fiscally limited world of state government, preclude those with less severe impairments from receiving commensurate services.

In his concurring opinion, Justice Kennedy warned that “it would be a tragic event . . . were the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 . . . to be interpreted so that States had some incentive, for fear of litigation, to drive those in need of medical care and treatment out of appropriate care and into settings with too little assistance and supervision.” This is precisely what the DOJ is doing. Mississippi is not a straggler to be dragged across deinstitutionalization’s finish line; the state is a necessary rebuke to policies that have relegated the severely mentally ill to lives of squalor and neglect on our nation’s streets and in our prisons."
Housing authorities raise concerns about Trump plan to evict undocumented immigrants,https://thehill.com,[],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/regulation/other/449065-housing-authorities-raise-concerns-about-plans-to-evict-undocumented,"Landlords and local housing authorities are pushing back on a Trump administration plan to evict undocumented immigrants from subsidized housing, according to The New York Times.

The proposal from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) would ban households with one or more undocumented member from living in such housing, but housing administrators and landlords say it would put the onus of immigration enforcement on them.

Under the proposal, released in April, they would have to evict up to 108,000 people receiving benefits, most of whom, they say, are some of their most reliable tenants when it comes to paying rent on time.

“The housing authority would bear the brunt of the expense of having to completely evict and go through the court action of having to evict these families,” Sylvia Blanco, the chief operating officer at the Housing Authority of the City of Austin, Texas, told the Times.

“We would be on the hook for having to pay for that,” she added.

The plan would also require public housing administrators to verify the immigration status of every resident every year, they told the Times, as well as issue eviction notices and potentially go through court battles with individual families, according to the Times.

In Austin, legal fees and staff expenses would cost about $1,000 per eviction, Blanco told the newspaper.

In Los Angeles, where at least 30 percent of public housing occupants are households that could be caught in the crosshairs of the policy, the enforcement cost would be nearly $10 million.

“You can imagine, if you’re forcing the eviction of nearly one-third of these very large public housing sites, the impact that has on households as well as the broader community,” Doug Guthrie, the president and chief executive of the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles, told the Times.

Undocumented immigrants currently live with numerous families receiving housing subsidies, but the assistance is generally pro-rated according to how many members of the family are eligible, according to the Times.

“Most of our members are saying that’s a process that works,” Tim Kaiser, the executive director of the Public Housing Authorities Directors Association, told the newspaper.

"‘Human capital crisis’ at EPA, retirement for 40% of staff",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/human-capital-crisis-at-epa-retirement-for-40-of-staff,"The Environmental Protection Agency is bleeding workers.

“I do have a concern absolutely. Forty percent of our workforce is eligible to retire over the next five years. While I don’t expect them all to retire in the next five years, I expect them to be gone in the next 10 years,” said Administrator Andrew Wheeler.

“I consider it a human capital crisis,” he added.

The issue is one being felt throughout government and business as baby boomers retire and younger workers come and go with much more regularity.

Wheeler, for example, said the EPA has always budgeted for workers to stay for decades. “We have a history at the agency of hiring people out of school and expecting them to stay 30, 40 years. We have 10 employees who have been here 49 years,” he said in an interview.

But that’s not happening anymore.

And, he added, government rules make it hard to start looking for a new employee before a retiring worker leaves the building. “You lose that institutional knowledge because they aren’t there to train their replacement.""

The White House, he said, is trying to give agencies more flexibility in hiring. But Wheeler said he is also taking charge, noting that he helped in the interviewing process of new EPA human resources director.

“Administrators don’t typically interview at that level,” he said, but added, “I want to meet who we’re going to hire before we hire them because on Day One I’m going to hit them with a dozen things and I want to make sure that they don’t get scared off.”"
Moving USDA research agencies is part of Trump’s war on science and statistics,https://www.washingtonpost.com,['Editorial Board'],06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/moving-usda-research-agencies-is-part-of-trumps-war-on-science-and-statistics/2019/06/17/51c85328-9134-11e9-aadb-74e6b2b46f6a_story.html,"IN ITS war on science and statistics, the Trump administration has a habit of sidelining inconvenient information. Last week, it was at it again.

On Thursday, the Agriculture Department announced a decision to relocate two of its research agencies, the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, from Washington to the Kansas City region. The Economic Research Service, which investigates the economics of food, farming, natural resources and rural America, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which was established as part of the Food, Conservation and Energy Act of 2008, play a key role in providing the data essential for honest policy-making.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue initially declared an intention to move these sub-agencies 10 months ago but didn’t specify a location then. The USDA now says the move would put the agencies closer to the agricultural heartland while saving money both for taxpayers and for employees, because Washington is an expensive city. While the rationale may seem plausible , in reality the implications are worrying.

In theory, there’s no reason such agencies couldn’t function well in Kansas City or elsewhere. After all, as with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta, this would hardly be the first time a government agency operates from beyond Washington. But the way this operation has been managed, with insufficient warning and explanation, suggests an intention by the administration to encourage qualified analysts to leave government and stifle independent and objective research.

If carried out, the move will disrupt ongoing scientific research and displace several hundred federal employees with valuable experience. Since the abrupt announcement last August, many of the agencies’ top economists and scientists have quit.

The investigations carried out by these agencies have long underpinned decisions by Congress and by American farmers, much as research from the Bureau of Labor Statistics underpins decisions in others parts of the economy. And much of the information produced by the Economic Research Service has indeed been inconvenient for the administration, as it has illustrated the ills wrought by President Trump’s trade wars and how small farmers were helped only marginally by the 2017 Republican tax overhaul.

Democratic members of the House and Senate have introduced the Agriculture Research Integrity Act, which would bar the move. They are right to do so, but it would be best if the USDA took the hint and retreated from this abrupt and ill-considered relocation. The better way to get sunnier data would be to develop better policies."

"State Department cuts new funds to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, pending immigration fixes",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/el-salvador-guatemala-honduras-funds-state-department-immigration-fixes,"The State Department announced Monday it will cut new foreign aid to the ""Northern Triangle"" countries -- Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador -- unless their governments take ""concrete action"" to stem the flow of migrants towards the United States.

The aggressive move came less than two weeks after the Trump administration reached a last-minute deal with Mexico, which called for the country's deployment of more troops to its own southern border and tighter asylum protocols. The U.S. and Mexico reached the accord shortly before the White House was set to impose a series of escalating tariffs on its southern neighbor.

President Trump previously pushed in March to cut $615 million in aid to the Northern Triangle, noting that the nations have been home to some of the migrant caravans that have marched through Mexico to the U.S. border to claim asylum, in some cases fraudulently.

On further review, the State Department said the administration has decided to continue to provide $432 million for anti-gang, education, and health initiatives. U.S. officials said the review looked at roughly 700 projects funded with fiscal 2017 money by the United States in the three countries and concluded that a significant number were too far advanced to end them.

MEXICO VOWS TO HELP CENTRAL AMERICAN MIGRANTS AMID CRACKDOWN

However, the latest plans showed roughly $370 million from the fiscal year 2018 budget will no longer be spent on the Northern Triangle and approximately $185 million in funding from the 2017 budget will be withheld, at least for now.

A State Department official told Fox News a re-evaluation would be concluded no later than April 2020.

""We will not provide new funds for programs in those countries until we are satisfied that the Northern Triangle governments are taking concrete actions to reduce the number of migrants coming to the U.S. border,"" State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said. ""This is consistent with the president’s direction and with the recognition that it is critical that there be sufficient political will in these countries to address the problem at its source.""

She added, ""Working with Congress, we will reprogram those funds to other priorities as appropriate.""

Ortagus noted that ""previously awarded grants and contracts will continue with current funding.""

Many Democrats called the decision callous and unproductive.

""As feared, a presidential tantrum will limit our nation’s ability to actually help address the challenges forcing people to flee to the U.S.,"" Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., tweeted.

The Northern Triangle's immigration policies have long rankled the Trump administration. Last December, the U.S. pledged more than $10 billion in aid to Central America and Mexico to help keep migrants put. Later that month, Trump tweeted: ""...Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are doing nothing for the United States but taking our money.

""Word is that a new Caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it,"" Trump added. ""We will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries -- taking advantage of U.S. for years!""

The State Department in March then notified Congress that it would look to suspend 2017 and 2018 payments to the trio of nations.

Meanwhile, Mexico has offered refuge to migrants with credible fears as thousands remain in the country while they await court dates for asylum petitions in the U.S. The understaffed and underfunded Mexican refugee commission has faced a backlog of cases.

But, in recent months, police and immigration have stepped up enforcement in southern Mexico, setting up highway checkpoints, raiding a caravan of mostly Central American migrants and trying to keep people off the northbound train known as ""the beast.""

At the same time, Mexicans have grown increasingly intolerant of the large numbers of migrants passing through their country in an attempt to reach the United States.

A June poll in Mexican newspaper El Universal showed that Mexicans are less receptive to allowing undocumented migrants to come in, or to stay on permanently as refugees, than they were in October, when caravans with thousands of Central American migrants were winding their way north.

(WTVD) -- On Monday, U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos formally opened an investigation into the Duke-UNC Consortium for Middle East Studies which applied a federal grant to host a conference on Gaza tainted by accusations of anti-Semitism. In a letter obtained by the ABC11 I-Team , Secretary DeVos said she is ""troubled"" by the concerns raised by Rep. George Holding (R-North Carolina) who first requested an investigation earlier this spring ""In order for the department to learn more about this matter, I have directed the Office of Postsecondary Education to examine the use of funds under this program to determine if the Consortium violated the terms and conditions of its grant.""The Duke-UNC Consortium hosted the ""Conflict Over Gaza"" in March at UNC-Chapel Hill, and it was an event sponsored by more than two dozen university departments, plus the Rotary Club of Raleigh and other local organizations.A video taken by filmmaker Ami Horowitz captured an anti-Semitic song being performed by a Palestinian rapper - and met with applause.Many thought the conference would provide diverse perspectives on the conflict in the Middle East, but rapper Tamer Nafar tells the audience: ""Let's try it together.

Advocates ask Justice Department to investigate Euclid police over controversial use-of-force incidents,https://www.cleveland.com,"['Evan Macdonald', 'Emacdonald Cleveland.Com']",06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.cleveland.com/crime/2019/06/advocates-ask-justice-department-to-investigate-euclid-police-over-controversial-use-of-force-incidents.html,"EUCLID, Ohio – A legal advocacy group sent a letter to the U.S. Justice Department on Tuesday requesting an investigation into the Euclid Police Department over a series of controversies, including an officer’s 2017 beating of a motorist that made national headlines.

The Legal Advocacy and Writ Resources Foundation says in the letter that the request is due to a “pattern of excessive and deadly force, police brutality, and intimidation” that deprives citizens of their rights. The letter lists at least seven events since 2016 that the LAWRS Foundation describes as excessive uses of force by police officers.

The six-page letter is signed by LAWRS Foundation President Cassandra McDonald and addressed to Steven Rosenbaum, the chief of the special litigation section of the Justice Department’s Office of Civil Rights.

The Justice Department could not immediately be reached for comment about the letter late Tuesday afternoon.

McDonald said she has been considering the request for a Justice Department investigation for roughly three years, and sent the letter Tuesday morning. She acknowledged the Justice Department may decline to investigate Euclid police department, but said she is hoping the letter will help spur reform efforts.

“I’m not hostile toward [Euclid’s] mayor. I’m not hostile toward the [city] council or anyone there. My problem is this has been going on for too long,” she said in a phone interview with cleveland.com.

The city of Euclid and its police department released a joint statement Tuesday afternoon, saying they “welcome full review and will cooperate fully with any investigation.”

Mayor Kirsten Holzheimer Gail’s office did not respond to a request for additional comment. A Euclid police spokesman said the department would not have any further comment beyond the joint statement.

The Euclid Police Department has been at the center of several high-profile controversies in recent years, several of which are listed in the LAWRS Foundation’s letter.

Among those is Euclid patrolman Michael Amiott’s violent arrest of Richard L. Hubbard during an August 2017 traffic stop. Video of the arrest showed Amiott knee Hubbard, tackle him to the ground and punch him in the face and body several times.

The video went viral online, and the city of Euclid fired Amiott in the wake of the incident. But an arbitrator overturned the firing last year and ordered the city to give Amiott’s job back.

Euclid has hired a special prosecutor to review the case and determine whether Amiott should face misdemeanor charges. Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Michael O’Malley’s office, which declined to charge Amiott with a felony, is also working with U.S. Attorney Justin Herdman’s office to decide whether to pursue federal charges against Amiott.

Hubbard also filed a civil lawsuit against the city of Euclid and its police department, which is pending in federal court.

Also listed in the letter is Euclid officer Matthew Rhodes’ fatal shooting of Luke O. Stewart during a March 2017 incident. Rhodes and his partner found Stewart asleep in a parked car, and Rhodes jumped into the car when Stewart tried to drive away.

Rhodes shot Stewart several times, saying he feared for his life because he felt Stewart may crash. A Cuyahoga County grand jury subsequently declined to bring criminal charges against Rhodes.

A federal judge also determined the shooting was justified when he ruled in Euclid’s favor in a civil lawsuit filed by Stewart’s family. But the judge chastised the Euclid Police Department for its training protocol, saying it exhibited a lackadaisical attitude about use-of-force training.

McDonald said Tuesday that she believes an investigation could lead to changes within the Euclid police department. Among the changes she’s seeking are the formation of a commission, including citizens and government officials, that has subpoena power to conduct its own investigations into controversial incidents.

“It just had to be done,” she said about the letter she sent the Justice Department. “I don’t know what the outcome is going to be, but I think it will put them on further alert.”

The request represents a likely uphill climb since the Trump Administration all but abandoned the Obama-era U.S. Department of Justice Department’s focus on civil-rights issues at local police departments. The city of Cleveland’s police department entered into a federal agreement with the Justice Department in 2015 that mandated reforms throughout the department.

Cook County Homeland Security Command Van Moved Amid Complaints,https://patch.com,[],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://patch.com/illinois/evanston/cook-county-homeland-security-command-van-moved-amid-complaints,"EVANSTON, IL — A Cook County command van was moved away from a street festival Saturday in Evanston after the presence of the large Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management vehicle at the Custer Street Fair prompted protests from residents.

The logo for the county emergency management agency, DHSEM, bears some similarity to that of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, commonly called ICE. Some residents complained that instead of increasing the sense of safety among fair attendees, the vehicle needlessly intimidated community members.

In social media posts, Evanston's police and fire departments announced they were working with the city's Office of Emergency Management and the Cook County homeland security department to provide security for the Custer Fair, including the command van and proactive barricades.

""This van is no way affiliated with ICE — Immigration and Customs Enforcement,"" police pointed out.

The mobile command center was subsequently replaced by a city-operated dump truck. Residents said it was relocated to a car dealership parking lot following complaints by neighbors.

Mayor Steve Hagerty responded with a message of support for the van.



""Public safety and being a welcoming city are not mutually exclusive. The City's priority is keeping people safe at the Custer Street Fair, not monitoring people for ICE,"" Hagerty responded on social media. ""I appreciate Cook County providing this Command Center.""



In October 2017, the mayor signed an updated ""Welcoming City Ordinance"" that protects people in the country illegally from being held by federal immigration authorities without a warrant signed by a federal judge. Hagerty has also operated an emergency management consulting company for the past 18 years.

""Should anything go wrong (e.g., weather, man made event, etc.), having a command center nearby is helpful for the emergency response. The Center can also be used proactively to monitor the weather at that specific location. The vehicle is not used in any way as part of immigration enforcement,"" Hagerty said, in an emailed response to concerned residents.

The mayor noted the command center had appeared in Evanston at previous occasions and said city officials would look to give the public the opportunity to check it out during a non-event in the future to see how it helps emergency responders.

""Nonetheless, we understand the size, location, and presence of this vehicle at Custer Street alarmed some people, particularly given the national focus on immigration,"" Hagerty said. ""To address these concerns, show more sensitivity towards our immigrant neighbors, and ensure strong economic activity for our vendors and businesses, in the future we will not use this type of vehicle as a barricade but instead, when we have it, place it nearby in a less public and prominent location.""



Over the past 18 months, the Unified Command Post, or UCP, has been used 41 times for events and festivals across 29 different municipalities in the past 18 months, according to information from county officials provided by Fire Chief Brian Scott. He said the post provides assistance monitoring weather and emergency medical services needs, as well as functioning as a unified emergency management center should something go seriously wrong.

""The mobile unified command center is an $830,000 asset with six on-board computer work stations and state of the art mobile communications suite that helps ensure interoperability. It also includes thermal imaging, a weather monitoring and incident management tools to assist fire and police officers,"" Scott said. Out of respect for some of the concerns raised by residents, he said, it was relocated Sunday to a block north of the fair.

""Given our most recent experience at the 2019 [Custer Street Fair], we will make sure to consider and be sensitive to the concerns raised by the immigrant community and their supporters,"" Scott said. ""Future steps could include pre-education opportunities for the entire Evanston community to see and visit the UCP to learn more about the vehicle as well as strategically placing the vehicle at future events in a less prominent location while still being able to utilize the UCP's full capability.""



(Evanston Fire Department)

Several residents commented in response that people left or did not attend the fair due to the presence of the Cook County vehicle, which could have been mistaken for one operated by federal immigration enforcement authorities.



""I am very disappointed the city decided to bring this command truck without thinking of the [trauma] it is putting our immigrant families through,"" one Evanston resident said. ""We have many resources in Evanston. Our city officials need to think of the decisions it makes if they expect our immigrant community to trust them.""

""My family won't be attending the fair because we feel unwelcome,"" said a Chicago resident. ""This is NOT normal and this is NOT ok. Don't try to normalize it with this lame post. This is totally tone deaf and damaging to the relationship the police force has with the community. Do better.""

Though dozens of commentators were critical of the presence of the vehicle, several people suggested those outraged by its presence were overreacting.



""Does anybody remember Nice France,"" 8th Ward Ald. Ann Rainey asked, a reference to a 2016 vehicular attack on a large outdoor Bastille Day celebration. She said the trailer had been misinterpreted. ""It was used at [Northwestern University's Dillo Day] without comment. Evanston is a wonderful caring City, and I know of no one who lives in fear here. I believe 99% of the population would back me up on that statement.""

""Stop being such a bunch of cry babies and get on with your lives and grow up,"" said a retired Evanston police officer. ""The van not going to hurt you, it's there for your protection. If you don't want to attend, then don't.""

President Donald Trump announced Monday night in a social media post that ICE would ""begin the process of removing the millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States. They will be removed as fast as they come in.""

“We ask the Environmental Protection Agency to act with urgency,” Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-Garden City) said at the Town of Hempstead's water department. “This situation requires increased technical support and financial support” for water providers.

Rice was joined by Reps. Peter King (R-Seaford), Lee Zeldin (R-Shirley) and Thomas Suozzi (D-Glen Cove); Nassau County Executive Laura Curran; Hempstead Supervisor Laura Gillen; environmental advocates and water providers.

The bipartisan turnout “shows this is a full-court press,” King said.

New York State has been developing drinking water standards for 1,4 dioxane; and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), which is found in firefighting foams, and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), which is used in manufacturing stain- and water-resistant materials.

Earlier this month, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo told Newsday it was a “matter of weeks” before the state Department of Health released its recommended drinking water standards. That would trigger a monthslong public comment period before the standard becomes enforceable.

Local water providers face massive cleanup costs to remove 1,4-dioxane, PFOS and PFOA, which scientists have linked to negative health effects, including cancer, and have been detected in drinking water.

Long Island water providers have estimated it will cost $1.5 billion to remove the three emerging contaminants.

An analysis last month of federal data by the New York Public Interest Group found that Long Island’s drinking water had the most emerging contaminants in New York State.

Ty Fuller, chairman of the Long Island Water Conference, said the federal testing requirement didn't include communities served by smaller water providers such as upstate Hoosick Falls, which has been dealing with PFAS contamination in its drinking water.

“It’s not the most contaminated, it’s the most tested,” said Fuller, who is also Suffolk County Water Authority's director of strategic initiatives and lead hydrogeologist of Long Island's drinking water. “A lack of testing does not mean a lack of contamination.”

Elizabeth Moran, environmental policy director for the New York Public Interest Research Group, said, “The simple truth is Long Island’s sole source aquifer is susceptible to contamination because of a lot of development and industrial legacy.”

Adrienne Esposito, executive director of Citizens Campaign for the Environment, said, “We’re not just testing more here. We’re finding more here.”

The EPA has said it's studying the health effects of PFAS to determine a national drinking water standard.

EPA spokesman Elías Rodríguez said in a statement, ""EPA appreciates the congressional delegation’s interest and commitment to the community. EPA shares that commitment to protect public health and the environment and we are working to develop a response to the members.""

Zeldin criticized the EPA for not yet responding to a letter from the delegation sent June 7, asking for the agency to provide greater assistance to Long Island water providers. A federal standard would help Long Island authorities when dealing with federal agencies like the Department of Defense on issues like cleanup around military sites, he said.

Moran said the standards recommended in December by a panel of experts convened by Cuomo are not as stringent as the latest science suggests is necessary to protect public health."
Arizona Trump fans fired up about president's re-election launch,https://www.azcentral.com,"['Jeannette Hinkle', 'Arizona Republic', 'Published P.M.

Donna Messinger says she’s been to every rally President Donald Trump has held in Arizona.

""And I’m always first in line,"" she said.

Messinger, 66, couldn’t attend the president’s 2020 re-election launch on Tuesday in Orlando, but she was an early arrival to the “MAGA Meet Up” hosted by campaign group Trump Victory and the Arizona Republican Party at the state GOP headquarters in Phoenix.

“This is his coming out party,” said Messinger, who wore a fuschia pink Women for Trump shirt and matching lipstick. “It’s huge. I wanted to be with like minds. I wanted to celebrate and scream and yell and have people standing with me and behind me to promote President Trump’s re-election.”

About 130 people attended the watch party, according to a count taken by Arizona Republican Party officials. Attendees, many wearing red Make America Great Again hats, crowded a room decorated with multiple cardboard cutouts of first lady Melania Trump and of the president giving two thumbs up.

Before Trump took the stage, Kelli Ward, the Arizona Republican Party chairwoman, welcomed the crowd.

“I look forward to working with and for all of you to win big in 2020, not just President Trump, but Republicans all the way down the ballot,” Ward said. “We are going to hold our Legislature and expand our Republican majority.”

Though Messinger said the country’s economic strength under Trump has impressed her, it’s his efforts to improve border security and deport the country’s undocumented people that have earned her continued support.

“I want to continue with the immigration issues,” Messinger said. “It's paramount now. It's gotten way out of hand. It's an important issue across America. They're coming in with more issues than we could ever have dreamed of, then they’re being shipped out across America.”

Arizona, where Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton by about 3½ percentage points in the 2016 election, is considered a key battleground state in the 2020 election.

Sharon Flint, 51, recently decided to join the battle, and she’ll be fighting for Trump. A Facebook post making fun of the president posted by her brother prompted her to ride her bicycle to the Arizona Republican Party headquarters a few weeks ago, she said.

“I was like, ‘What can I do to help?'” Flint said, holding a small American flag in her hand.

Flint and others faced the front of the room where three television screens showed Trump take the stage in Orlando. The crowd cheered for minutes when Vice President Mike Pence introduced Trump and the first lady, and as the president took the stage, they broke out into a chant of “Trump! Trump! Trump!”

Ronna McDaniel, the Republican National Committee chairwoman, said Trump has kept his promises and ""is delivering for all Americans.""

""As a result, we are seeing unprecedented engagement from every day Americans who want to be a part of this movement,"" she said in a written statement. ""Just this week, we are training and activating thousands of new volunteers to add to our grassroots army. We are ready to re-elect President Trump and continue to Make America Great Again.""

Other Arizona watch parties had been scheduled for Phoenix's Ahwatukee area; Mesa; Sun City; Kingman; and Tucson.

I'm Ellen Mitchell, and here's your nightly guide to the latest developments at the Pentagon, on Capitol Hill and beyond. CLICK HERE to subscribe to the newsletter.

Trump said in a pair of tweets that Shanahan wanted to ""devote more time to his family."" The messages were posted shortly after the publication of multiple media reports describing past domestic violence incidents involving Shanahan's family.

""Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, who has done a wonderful job, has decided not to go forward with his confirmation process so that he can devote more time to his family,"" Trump tweeted.

Shanahan said in a statement that going forward with the confirmation process ""would force my three children to relive a traumatic chapter in our family's life and reopen wounds we have worked years to heal.""

""I would welcome the opportunity to be secretary of Defense, but not at the expense of being a good father,"" he said.

Who will replace him: The president said he would name Mark Esper, who currently serves as secretary of the Army, as the new acting Defense chief. Trump did not say if Esper would be nominated for the permanent role. Esper, who was confirmed by the Senate 89-6 in the fall of 2017, is a former infantry officer and previously served as a top executive at the defense contractor Raytheon.

Bad timing: The decision leaves the Pentagon without a permanent leader at a time of rising tensions with Iran, which the Trump administration has accused of attacking oil tankers in the Persian Gulf. The administration on Monday ordered another 1,000 troops to the Middle East.

What caused the decision: Trump's announcement Tuesday came just over an hour after USA Today reported that Shanahan's FBI background check was being held up by an alleged 2010 domestic fight with his now-ex wife.

The White House first announced in May that Trump intended to nominate Shanahan as Defense secretary. But his nomination was never officially sent to the Senate. As more and more time passed, questions began to swirl about whether Trump was souring on Shanahan.

But after rumors circulated under the radar for weeks, reports began to come out publicly this week that the process was being marred by the alleged domestic incident.

The specifics: As reported by USA Today, police reports and court filings showed that an August 2010 fight between Shanahan and his now ex-wife escalated into a physical clash. The wife, Kimberley Jordinson, reportedly told police he punched her in the stomach, while he told police she was the aggressor and punched him ""10 or 20 times.""

She was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, but prosecutors later dropped the charges citing a lack of evidence.

The Washington Post on Tuesday also detailed a 2011 incident in which Shanahan's son hit Jordinson with a baseball bat and left Jordinson unconscious in a pool of blood.

""Bad things can happen to good families ... and this is a tragedy, really,"" Shanahan told the Post in an interview published shortly after Trump's tweets. Dredging up the episode publicly, Shanahan said, ""will ruin my son's life.""

Capitol Hill shocked: Shanahan's abrupt withdrawal left senators fuming and the Defense Department rudderless at a time of rising tensions with Iran.

It raises questions anew about how much longer the Pentagon will go without a confirmed leader at a time of turmoil with Iran many lawmakers fear could turn to war.

The announcement left senators angry they had been left in the dark about many of the details from Shanahan's past even though he had already gone through a confirmation process to be deputy Defense secretary.

""I feel that there was possibly a deliberate concealment here,"" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. ""I think there ought to be an investigation by the IG in the Department of Defense. ... There ought to be a complete investigation of that whole process. ... This is potentially a violation of criminal law.""

Jack Reed John (Jack) Francis ReedOvernight Defense: Shanahan exit shocks Washington | Pentagon left rudderless | Lawmakers want answers on Mideast troop deployment | Senate could vote on Saudi arms deal this week | Pompeo says Trump doesn't want war with Iran Shanahan drama shocks Capitol Hill, leaving Pentagon rudderless Shanahan drama shocks Capitol Hill, leaving Pentagon rudderless MORE (D-R.I.), the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said he was aware during Shanahan's deputy secretary confirmation of a ""contentious divorce,"" but that many of Tuesday's reported details were new.

""The more we know, the better off we are,"" Reed said when asked if the committee should have known the rest.

GOP caught off guard: Republican senators quickly backed Shanahan's decision to withdraw in the wake of multiple reports describing past domestic violence incidents involving his family, with some voicing surprise at the allegations.

GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin GrahamOvernight Defense: Shanahan exit shocks Washington | Pentagon left rudderless | Lawmakers want answers on Mideast troop deployment | Senate could vote on Saudi arms deal this week | Pompeo says Trump doesn't want war with Iran Shanahan drama shocks Capitol Hill, leaving Pentagon rudderless Shanahan drama shocks Capitol Hill, leaving Pentagon rudderless MORE (S.C.), a top ally of President Trump, called the move Tuesday a ""smart decision,"" adding that he hadn't heard about the domestic violence allegations ""in detail"" but had heard ""rumors about them.""

""It probably was a smart decision given the issues before the White House. ... I really appreciate what Shanahan has done,"" Graham told reporters. ""Now we have got to find a replacement.""

Sen. Jim Inhofe James (Jim) Mountain InhofeShanahan drama shocks Capitol Hill, leaving Pentagon rudderless GOP senators caught off guard by Shanahan withdrawal Trump says Shanahan out as Defense secretary nominee MORE (R-Okla.), the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said he was in the dark about the fact that Trump and Shanahan were discussing pulling the nomination, and had told reporters only minutes before that the Defense secretary pick was safe despite reports of trouble.

""I was responding not more than two hours ago that no there's no problem ... then three minutes after that I got a call from the president,"" Inhofe said.

SENATORS DEMAND TRUMP EXPLAIN DECISION TO DEPLOY TROOPS: A bipartisan group of senators called on President Trump to explain his decision to deploy troops to the Middle East and warning that Congress hasn't authorized military action against Iran.

Sens. Tim Kaine Timothy (Tim) Michael KaineOvernight Defense: Shanahan exit shocks Washington | Pentagon left rudderless | Lawmakers want answers on Mideast troop deployment | Senate could vote on Saudi arms deal this week | Pompeo says Trump doesn't want war with Iran Senators demand Trump explain decision to deploy troops amid Iran tensions Senators demand Trump explain decision to deploy troops amid Iran tensions MORE (D-Va.) and Mike Lee Michael (Mike) Shumway LeeOvernight Defense: Shanahan exit shocks Washington | Pentagon left rudderless | Lawmakers want answers on Mideast troop deployment | Senate could vote on Saudi arms deal this week | Pompeo says Trump doesn't want war with Iran Senators demand Trump explain decision to deploy troops amid Iran tensions Senators demand Trump explain decision to deploy troops amid Iran tensions MORE (R-Utah) spearheaded the letter, which was also signed by Sens.

""We remain concerned that increasingly escalatory actions by both sides will lead to an unnecessary conflict. Given that growing risk, we want to reiterate that, as of this date, Congress has not authorized war with Iran and no current statutory authority allows the U.S. to conduct hostilities against the Government of Iran,"" the senators wrote.

They added that they ""expect"" the Trump administration would come to Congress for a military authorization before they deploy forces ""into hostilities or areas where hostilities with Iran are imminent"" and stick to ""legitimate principles of self-defense"" absent congressional authorization.

Background: The letter to Trump comes after acting Defense Secretary announced on Monday night that the administration will send an additional 1,000 troops to the Middle East for defensive purposes.

U.S.-Iran tensions are running high after Tehran's nuclear agency announced it will soon exceed the amount of low-enriched uranium it is allowed to stockpile unless Europe intervenes, and in the wake of an attack on oil tankers near the strategic chokepoint of the Straight of Hormuz, which the Trump administration blames on Tehran.

More briefings: Senators are getting a new round of briefings from the administration, including a top State Department official meeting with Senate Republicans during a closed-door lunch on Tuesday.

The letter to Trump comes as the Senate is expected to start debating the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) later this week.

Pompeo made the statement while speaking to reporters after a closed-door meeting at the U.S. Central Command (Centcom) headquarters in Florida.

""We are there to deter aggression. President Trump does not want war,"" Pompeo said Tuesday, according to videos posted of his remarks. ""We will continue to communicate that message while doing the things that are necessary to protect American interests in the region.""

He also said there were issues with Iran of beyond the attacks on two oil tankers that he has blamed on Tehran, saying there have been other recent attacks, some of which were thwarted, in recent weeks.

""We shouldn't focus on just those two attacks. Since the beginning of May, there are now over a half-dozen different instances of Iranian attacks in the region,"" he said.

SENATE TO VOTE ON BLOCKING TRUMP'S SAUDI ARMS SALE AS SOON AS THIS WEEK: Senators are paving the way to block Trump's arms deal with Saudi Arabia as soon as this week.

Senate leadership and supporters of blocking the arms sale are in negotiations aimed at getting a deal on how and when the resolutions of disapproval will be brought to the Senate floor.

Without an agreement each resolution is subjected to up to 10 hours of debate, which would eat up the Senate's schedule.

How they plan to do it: Senators are using a provision of the Arms Export Control Act to block the 22 sales by only a simple majority after Trump last month invoked an emergency provision within the law to push through the roughly $8 billion sale without congressional approval. With at least four Republicans expected to join all 47 Democrats in supporting the resolutions of disapproval, the Senate is expected to have the votes to block the arms sale and force Trump to issue a veto.

""Everybody would like to get to a UC,"" said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), referring to a unanimous consent agreement that would set a streamlined process for the Senate's floor votes.

Murphy said they were aiming to hold votes this week even with a mammoth defense bill and a slate of nominations already on the schedule.

Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) started the clock on one of the 22 resolutions of disapproval on the Senate floor Tuesday. Lawmakers have a 30-day window to take action, giving them until they leave for the July 4 recess.

DEFENSE BILL AMENDMENTS CONTINUE: Every year hundreds of amendments are filed on the Senate version of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), while only a few, if any, are actually voted on.

The Hill's Jordain Carney is pouring over the amendments to highlight the most interesting.

Among them is an amendment to prevent unauthorized military operations against Iran.

""No funds may be used to conduct hostilities against the government of Iran, against the armed forces of Iran or in the territory of Iran except pursuant to an act or a joint resolution of Congress specifically authorizing such hostilities,"" the amendment reads.

Understanding the State Department’s updated travel advisories,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Hannah Sampson', 'Reporter Focusing On Travel News', 'Hannah Sampson Is A Staff Writer At The Washington Post For The Way', 'Where She Reports On Travel News.']",06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2019/06/17/travel-advisories-can-be-confusing-heres-how-navigate-them/,"A traveler looking for global guidance from the U.S. State Department could be forgiven for being a bit confused. Official advisories — 209 of them — from the department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs cover countries and areas in every nook of the planet, and one even warns of a blanket worldwide caution.

All destinations are ranked from levels 1 to 4, and places as disparate as Italy, China, Antarctica and the Dominican Republic are among the 58 countries that share a designation of Level 2, which means “exercise increased caution” — but for a host of reasons. The warnings range from possible terrorist attacks, in Italy, to arbitrary enforcement of local laws, in China, to “extreme and unpredictable weather,” in Antarctica. The Dominican Republic advisory warns of “violent crime,” which predated a sudden influx of American deaths in the country.

[7 questions about the unexplained tourist deaths in the Dominican Republic, answered]

More than half of the advisories are at Level 1, the lowest, which tells travelers to exercise “normal precautions.” But even the countries with the lowest warning level aren’t in the clear. More than two dozen Level 1 destinations are home to regions marked with their own, higher warnings, some that even get the most severe “do not travel” label. Heading to Panama or Peru? No problem, except for the parts with big problems.

So how should travelers heed the warnings meant to help them stay safe abroad? In short, the fine print — even for the most idyllic-seeming getaway spot — is important. On first glance, for example, the Barbados advisory might suggest there’s nothing to worry about, because it sits at the lowest level. But expanding to read the entire advisory on the island nation reveals that the United States warns to avoid certain areas or activities, including two businesses that run “pirate ship” cruises at night.

[Where in the world shouldn’t you go?]

Matt Bradley, regional security director of the Americas for International SOS, a firm that provides health and security services to travelers, said the difficulty of rating an entire country is that different parts carry disproportionate levels of risk.

“The nuance of this system allows them to say, ‘While the overall country is Level 1, there are specific destinations that are Level 2 or Level 3,’"" he says.

Michelle Bernier-Toth, the State Department’s managing director for the Office of Overseas Citizens Services, said the department makes its rulings based on information from embassies and consulates, security experts, local governments and other sources. And even in a destination that is considered low-risk overall, if there are specific zones that are off-limits or restricted for employees of the U.S. government, that information must be passed along to the public.

“We really want to be as accurate as we can so people can make an informed decision,” she says.

Because situations can change quickly, the State Department urges travelers to sign up for the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program to receive alerts about a destination and to provide ways for the U.S. Embassy to reach them in case of an emergency. Through the program, anyone can choose one or more countries and enter their dates of travel, and the department will email updates with alerts and advisories. Those messages also appear on Twitter at @TravelGov and on the Department of State’s Consular Affairs Facebook page.



(U.S. Department of State)

Each advisory at Level 2 or higher includes specific risks such as crime, terror, civil unrest, natural disaster, health concerns and, as of April, kidnapping. The State Department’s site often spells out specific geographic areas of concern and also offers tips for dealing with those risks, links to more country information and warnings about what the U.S. government cannot do in an emergency.

The bureau also includes details for people traveling internationally under various circumstances: those going on a cruise, leaving the country with pets, going to high-risk areas or embarking on a pilgrimage. There are also recommendations for people in specific groups — the LGBTQ community, travelers with disabilities — who could find themselves vulnerable on the road.

Other countries issue their own advisories for international travel, but, Bradley said, it’s not necessary for a traveler to check several countries’ warnings. They should, however, be sure to pay attention to the advice of the country where they are a citizen.

“Check the site of your citizenship because that is the one written specifically for you,” he says. “The risks won’t change, but the citizenship-specific advice could change, and that could be confusing.” The United States, for example, warns citizens not to travel to Iran — a country with which the U.S. government does not have diplomatic or consular relations — whereas Canada urges its citizens merely to use a high degree of caution.

If all that sounds hard to follow, consider that the system actually got an overhaul last year that made it easier to decipher. Under the old version, low-risk countries didn’t have any kind of advice. Only those destinations with concerns were singled out with travel warnings or alerts — and the difference wasn’t necessarily obvious.

[State Department updates travel advisories to make them more understandable]

“Frankly, I personally was tired of explaining the difference between a travel warning and a travel alert even to some of my colleagues,” Bernier-Toth said in a briefing about the new changes last year.

She told The Washington Post recently that the new system treats countries consistently, uses plain language, puts the risk indicators front and center, and makes information on how to deal with threats much more clear. The department still puts out short-term alerts about security, weather or other issues, even if they don’t change an overall advisory.

“We made the change because we found that the old system of travel warnings and travel alerts was not readily understood by people,” she says, “and we wanted to make our travel advisories — now that we have [one] for every country — clearer, more concise, more actionable and more accessible to people.""

The US Treasury is calling for mandatory financial literacy courses for college students,https://www.cnbc.com,['Shawn M. Carter'],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/19/us-treasury-calls-for-mandatory-financial-education-for-students.html,"The U.S. Department of the Treasury released a new report on behalf of the Financial Literacy and Education Commission that recommends mandatory financial literacy courses for college students.

With the cost of college rising faster than incomes and a staggering 44 million Americans owing more than $1.5 trillion in student loans, there has been growing concern that students and their families are taking on debt without truly understanding the long-term impact.

﻿Indeed, there is a lot of research exploring this national problem: Nine out of 10 parents and students failed a 2018 quiz about student loan debt. Meanwhile, MarketWatch reported that half of college students taking an AIG survey on personal finance basics got two or fewer questions correct. And in a recent survey from the Brookings Institution, less than 30% of student respondents could correctly answer three questions on inflation, interest and risk diversification.

""Helping students and their families avoid the pitfalls associated with financing higher education, and empowering them to make optimal financial choices, should be a priority of all institutions of higher education,"" the report reads. ﻿"
DHS data breach should be taken seriously,https://www.bostonherald.com,"['Boston Herald Editorial Staff', 'Dhs Data Breach Should Be Taken Seriously - Svpn']",06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.bostonherald.com/2019/06/17/dhs-data-breach-should-be-taken-seriously/,"Security technology is on the verge of changing the world. In what particular way it does that may be decided by our ability to keep data secure and out of the hands of cyberattackers.

There have been some recent stumbles on the part of government agencies. Earlier this year, the Homeland Security Department announced that FEMA had released the personal information of 2.3 million hurricane and wildfire survivors to a contractor. That information, in the wrong hands, could certainly be used for large-scale identity fraud.

This week, Customs and Border Protection issued a statement explaining that biometric information — photos of faces and license plates — had been exposed in a cyber attack. The information was sitting on a contractor’s server at the time.

A Customs spokesman indicated that the images involved fewer than 100,000 people, according to The Associated Press, but that number is not small and lives could be terribly affected.

Kade Crockford, director of the Technology for Liberty Program at the ACLU of Massachusetts, said the breach underscores the need for both federal and state moratoriums on government use of the technology.

“Once your face is leaked in a data breach like this, it can be weaponized against you for the rest of your life,” Crockford said. “If the attackers can mock up a fake image of you based on these leaked data, they can impersonate you and potentially break into your private accounts. If your password is hacked in a data breach, you can change it. But you can’t change your face.”

Sen. Ed Markey has called on DHS to halt the expansion of its biometric program until there were safeguards in place. Likewise, so has Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah).

Until the Department of Homeland Security can adequately prove that they can secure the personal information of Americans, the expansion of the biometric program should be halted."
Justice Settles With More Broadcasters Over Spot Ad Info Exchanges,https://www.broadcastingcable.com,['John Eggerton'],06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/justice-settles-with-more-broadcasters-over-spot-ad-info-exchanges,"The Justice Department has reached settlements with CBS, Cox, Scripps, Fox and Tegna in its ongoing investigation of the broadcast TV ad market and the exchange of competitively sensitive information.

That agreement settles a suit by Justice, which had alleged the broadcasters, and in the case of Cox its Cox Reps ad rep firms, illegally shared information that harmed the spot ad market.

“The Antitrust Division’s efforts to protect competition in the television broadcast industry continue with today’s settlements that will stop the unlawful exchange of competitively sensitive information among rival broadcasters and their sales rep firms,” said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim who heads up the antitrust division. “Vigorous competition among broadcast stations allows American businesses across the country to obtain competitive advertising rates. The unlawful sharing of information reduced that competition and thereby harmed businesses that rely on competitive rates to best serve their customers.”

Delrahim warned last fall that “agreements between competitors to exchange competitively sensitive information can violate the antitrust laws and lead to a civil enforcement action even if the conduct does not amount to the type of hard-core cartel conduct that the Antitrust Division prosecutes criminally.”

In essence the new settlement was an add-on to the one it had previously struck in U.S. v. Sinclair Et Al. (the et al. being Raycom, Tribune, Meredith, Griffin, Dreamcatcher, and Nexstar).

As with the previous settlement, there was no fine imposed.

Justice alleged that all of the broadcasters had agreed to exchange revenue pacing information, and also engaged in the exchange of other forms of non-public sales information in certain metropolitan areas. It alleged that the Cox Rep firms ""facilitated and participated in this exchange of pacing information by its broadcast-station clients that operated in the same metropolitan areas.""

Pacing compares the ads booked for a specific time period to the previous time period and ""indicates how each station is performing versus the rest of the market and provides insight into each station’s remaining spot advertising for the period,"" Justice said, helping the stations to know when their competitor might raise or lower spot ad prices.

""As a result, the information exchanges harmed the competitive price-setting process in markets for the sale of spot advertisements,"" Justice said Tuesday.

Justice commended all of the broadcasters for cooperating with the antitrust division to strike the settlement, with a special shout-out to Fox for its aid.

The settlement prevents the broadcasters from sharing that info, and Cox Reps has to erect firewalls in markets where it represents multiple stations. They must also adopt ""rigorous"" antitrust compliance and reporting regimes--whistleblower protection, compliance officers, newspaper announcements of settlement.

The terms of the settlement conditions are seven years and will apply to the stations even when and if they are sold to new owners, who must acknowledge that they inherit the terms of that settlement.

The investigation is not over, and the broadcasters have agreed to help with that ongoing review, suggesting more group broadcasters could be added to the list.

The investigation stemmed from Justice's review of the ultimately aborted Sinclair-Tribune deal.

DOJ's concerns about Sinclair's control of inventory in markets where it wanted to own two stations was one of the reasons Sinclair restructured its merger agreement, according to a source familiar with the DOJ review of that deal."
"One-Quarter Of U.S. Soybean Crop Remains Unplanted, USDA Says",https://www.agriculture.com,[],06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.agriculture.com/news/crops/one-third-of-us-soybean-crop-remains-unplanted-usda-says,"DES MOINES, Iowa — The U.S. soybean is slightly more than three-fourths planted, while the corn crop is emerging nearly 20% slower than its five-year average.



Corn

In its Crop Progress Report Monday, the USDA pegged U.S. corn planting at 92% complete, behind the 100% five-year average.

The planting rate is equal to what the trade had expected. This leaves about 7.0 million acres left to be planted.

As of Sunday, Ohio farmers had 68% of that state’s corn crop planted vs. a 100% five-year average. South Dakota farmers have 78% of their corn seeded, behind a 100% five-year average.

Also, 79% of the U.S. corn has emerged vs. a 97% five-year average.

In its report, the USDA pegged the corn crop as in 59% good/excellent condition, equal to a week ago.

Soybeans

In its report, the USDA pegged the U.S. soybean planting completion rate at 77% vs. a 93% five-year average. This leaves about 18.0 million acres of soybeans left to be planted.

Indiana and Illinois are the two major soybean-producing states well behind in planting completion with 64% and 70% respectively.

Also, 55% of the U.S. soybean crop has emerged vs. 84% five-year average.

Wheat

The USDA pegged the U.S. winter wheat harvest at 8% complete vs. a 20% five-year average."
EPA will allow use of pesticide harmful to bees,https://thehill.com,[],06-17-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/448970-epa-will-allow-use-of-pesticide-harmful-to-bees,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said Monday it will allow states to use a pesticide that is harmful to bees.

The agency made an emergency exception for 11 states to use sulfoxaflor on cotton and sorghum crops.

“The only emergency here is the Trump EPA’s reckless approval of this dangerous bee-killing pesticide,” Lori Ann Burd, environmental health director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement. “It’s sickening that even amid the current insect apocalypse, the EPA’s priority is protecting pesticide industry profits.”

A study published in Nature last year found sulfoxaflor inhibited bumblebee reproduction.

According to the Center for Biological Diversity, the emergency declaration has been used for four consecutive years in most of the states.

Sulfoxaflor’s use was temporarily barred after a lawsuit from beekeepers in 2015, but the EPA in 2016 changed its instructions for how to use the pesticide in a way designed to reduce the impact on bees. Cotton and sorghum were not included in the directive.

The EPA’s Office of Inspector General wrote in a report last year that the agency did not have processes in place to determine how its emergency measures impact human and environmental health.

An EPA spokesperson said the emergency exemption was granted with public safety in mind, as well as the needs of farmers.

""This decision is based in part on information from the states demonstrating an urgent need and a lack of available alternatives to address the pest pressures within their states. Mitigation measures will be put in place to minimize exposure and reduce the potential for unreasonable risks to the environment. The approvals include advisory guidance for protecting bees, and users must also follow all existing EPA guidance for pollinator protection,"" an EPA spokesperson said."
Government agency to investigate Interior Department’s moves on Grand Staircase monument,https://www.stgeorgeutah.com,[],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.stgeorgeutah.com/news/archive/2019/06/18/apc-government-agency-to-investigate-interior-departments-moves-on-grand-staircase-monument/,"Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, date unspecified | Photo courtesy of Bureau of Land Management, St. George News

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — A government watchdog will investigate whether the U.S. Interior Department broke the law by making plans to open lands cut from a Utah national monument by President Donald Trump to leasing for oil, gas and coal development, a pair of Democratic Congress members said Monday.

The Government Accountability Office’s investigation into whether the Interior violated the appropriations law by using funds to assess potential resource extraction in the lands cut from the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument is the latest chapter in a long-running saga over the sprawling monument created in 1996 on lands home to scenic cliffs, canyons, dinosaur fossils and coal reserves.

Trump reduced the monument by nearly half in 2017 following a contentious review by former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke of monuments around the country.

Trump ordered the review based on arguments by him and others that a law signed by President Theodore Roosevelt allowing presidents to declare monuments had been improperly used to protect wide expanses of lands instead of places with particular historical or archaeological value.

The GAO investigation comes after U.S. Sen. Tom Udall of New Mexico and U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum of Minnesota, both Democrats, requested the investigation in May. They argue that a section of the appropriations law on the books since 2002 states that no taxpayer money can be used to do pre-leasing studies on lands in monuments that were created by Jan. 20, 2001.

Last year, the Interior made public proposals for managing Grand Staircase, saying its preference for one of the sites would be the “least restrictive to energy and mining development.” That plan also would allow commercial timber harvesting to keep forests healthy.

The public comment period closed on the proposals and the Bureau of Land Management’s website says it intends to finalize the plans later this year.

Interior Department Press Secretary Molly Block said in a statement the agency will provide “factual information” to the GAO and is “confident” the probe will determine the Interior “acted appropriately and within the law.”

GAO spokesman Charles Young confirmed the inquiry. He said it’s too early to know how long the probe into the legal question will take.

Trump in 2017 also downsized the Bears Ears National Monument in Utah, but that won’t be part of the GAO’s inquiry because it was created in 2016 by President Barack Obama.

Environmental, tribal, paleontological and outdoor recreation organizations have separate lawsuits pending to restore the full sizes of the monuments, arguing presidents don’t have the legal authority to undo or change monuments created by predecessors.

Udall and McCollum announced the GAO investigation in a joint news release. Udall is the ranking member of the Senate’s Appropriations Subcommittees on the Interior, Environment and Related Agencies. McCollum is chair of the same committee in the House.

Udall called on the Interior to halt work on proposed management plans until the GAO makes its determination on the legal question.

“National monuments like Grand Staircase-Escalante protect some of our most spectacular wilderness areas and breathtaking lands, and it is imperative that the Department manage them in accordance with the laws passed by Congress,” Udall said in the news release.
