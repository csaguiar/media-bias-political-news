House Democratic leaders sparred internally on Monday over whether to begin an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her allies rejecting the call to move forward for now, according to multiple sources.

Reps. David Cicilline of Rhode Island, Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Joe Neguse of Colorado — all members of Democratic leadership — pushed to begin impeachment proceedings during a leadership meeting in Pelosi's office, said the sources. Pelosi and Reps. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico, Hakeem Jeffries of New York and Cheri Bustos of Illinois — some of her key allies — rejected their calls, saying Democrats' message is being drowned out by the fight over possibly impeaching Trump.

Raskin — a former law professor — said he wasn't advocating impeaching Trump but suggested that opening an impeachment inquiry would strengthen their legal position while allowing Democrats to move forward with their legislative agenda.

Pelosi dismissed this argument, asking Raskin whether he wanted to shut down the other five committees working on Trump investigations in favor of the Judiciary Committee.

“You want to tell Elijah Cummings to go home?” Pelosi quipped, referring to the chairman of the Oversight and Reform Committee.

And in a Democratic Steering and Policy Committee meeting, Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee stood up and demanded Trump's impeachment. Pelosi then countered, ""This is not about politics, it's about what's best for the American people,"" said a member who attended the meeting.

While Pelosi and her top Democrats argue that a majority of House Democrats don't want to impeach Trump, she is under growing pressure from some of her most hard-line members to move more forcefully against the president.

Several members and aides said an impeachment inquiry resolution could be introduced in the House Judiciary Committee in the next several days, spurring more Democratic debate over how to respond to Trump.

During the Steering and Policy Committee meeting, Cohen said President Bill Clinton faced impeachment proceedings “over sex” while Trump is “raping the country,” according to two sources in the room. Cohen later confirmed his remarks.

Pelosi pushed back on Cohen during the meeting and his assertion that she was simply afraid impeachment would cost her the House majority.

“This isn’t about politics at all. It’s about patriotism. It’s about the strength we need to have to see things through,” Pelosi said, according to an aide in the room.

The speaker mentioned that Democrats have not exhausted all options to hold the administration accountable, including levying fines via a process known as inherent contempt.

Pelosi also tried to calm restive rank-and-file members by pointing to the legal victory Democrats won Monday against Trump, who tried to block his accounting firm from turning over his financial documents after Democrats issued a subpoena.

“What we said when we started is that these [investigations] will yield information to us. Today, we won our first case,” Pelosi said. “We’ve been in this thing for almost five months and now we’re getting some results.“

The latest Democratic battle over impeachment began after the White House formally declared that former White House counsel Don McGahn — a key figure in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation — would not attend a Tuesday hearing before the Judiciary Committee.

The White House decision to block McGahn's appearance infuriated some Democrats, who said it was the last straw following Trump's refusal to honor other Democratic subpoenas.

Cicilline said he supports an impeachment inquiry if McGahn doesn't show on Tuesday.

""I think if this pattern by the president continues, where he's going to impede and prevent and undermine our ability to gather evidence to do our job, we're going to be left with no choice,"" Cicilline said about initiating an impeachment inquiry. The Rhode Island Democrat insisted that simply beginning an inquiry doesn't mean that there will be a formal vote to impeach Trump.

""It's a means where we can collect that information ... We need to have the ability to gather the evidence,"" Cicilline added.

Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.), another member of the Judiciary Committee, is also in favor of an impeachment inquiry if McGahn doesn't appear.

""If McGahn doesn't show tomorrow, I think we're at an inflection point,"" Lieu said. ""If we can't get information, I think we have to start proceeding down this path.""

Pelosi, however, countered that Democats ""have invested this much time. I don’t know why we would say McGahn, that’s it.”

Jeffries — chairman of the Democratic Caucus who also sits on Judiciary — rejected any move toward impeachment.

""We did not run on impeachment, we did not run on collusion ... so logic suggests that we should carry forward with the agenda that we communicated to the American people,"" Jeffries said.

Judiciary Committee Democrats met late Monday night to decide how to handle their response to McGahn's nonappearance. The panel decided to move ahead with Tuesday's session, and will likely hold a contempt vote next month against McGahn.

Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) said Trump and the White House ""intimidated"" McGhan into not appearing before his panel.

“The president’s continuing lawless conduct is making it harder and harder to rule out impeachment or any other enforcement mechanism,"" Nadler said.

Trump and White House officials have blocked Democrats' attempts to obtain the president's taxes and a record of his personal finances; an unredacted version of the Mueller report, as well as testimony from Mueller directly; more information on Russian interference in the 2016 election; and internal documents on Trump's immigration and environmental policies, among other issues.

The Trump administration has refused to honor the Democratic subpoenas, with Attorney General William Barr failing to even show up for a House Judiciary Committee hearing on the Mueller report. The Judiciary Committee then voted to hold Barr in contempt.

Democrats won a legal victory on Monday when a federal judge ruled against Trump's attempt to prevent the House Oversight and Reform Committee from obtaining Trump's financial records from his accounting firm. Trump's lawyers had argued that the committee was not entitled to the records and would immediately appeal.

Yet impeaching Trump, or even beginning an impeachment inquiry against Trump, is a huge risk for Democrats. Pelosi and her allies complain the anti-Trump fervor is overwhelming Democratic messaging on their agenda, and claim that most of the rank and file is against the move.

Democratic leaders also fear that impeaching Trump in the House, only to see him acquitted by the Senate, would strengthen his hand in 2020.

But there is a growing chorus of pro-impeachment Democrats, and they're being egged on by outside groups that argue Trump needs to be removed from office.

Pelosi, though, insists Democrats are all on the same page, despite Monday's drama.

""There's no divide,"" Pelosi said as she exited the Capitol. ""We're fine."""

An office in the West Wing, plus guaranteed weekends off for family time. And an assurance of being made secretary of homeland security by November.

Those were among a list of 10 conditions that Kris Kobach, the former Kansas secretary of state, has given to the White House if he is to become the administration’s “immigration czar,” a job President Trump has been looking to create to coordinate immigration policy across government agencies. The list was described by three people familiar with it.

Mr. Kobach, who once served as an adviser to the hard-line immigration Sheriff Joe Arpaio and helped write an Arizona law requiring local officials to verify the citizenship of anyone they had “reasonable suspicion” to believe was an unauthorized immigrant, said he would need to be the main television spokesman for the Trump administration on immigration policy. And he said he wanted a guarantee that cabinet secretaries whose portfolios relate to immigration would defer to him, with the president mediating disputes if need be.

The list was submitted by Mr. Kobach in recent weeks as he discussed his interest in the job. Other conditions included having a staff of seven reporting to him, “walk in” privileges to the Oval Office, a security detail if deemed necessary and the title of assistant to the president."
Judge upholds Dem subpoena for Trump financial records,https://www.politico.com,"['Andrew Desiderio', 'Kyle Cheney', 'Natasha Bertrand', 'Darren Samuelsohn']",05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/20/judge-upholds-dem-subpoena-for-trump-financial-records-1335370,"Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) issued the subpoena last month. | Alex Wong/Getty Images Congress Judge upholds Dem subpoena for Trump financial records The judge, Amit Mehta, ruled that Congress can investigate the president without beginning formal impeachment proceedings.

A federal judge on Monday upheld a congressional subpoena seeking President Donald Trump’s financial records from an accounting firm, arguing that Congress is well within its rights to investigate potential illegal behavior by a president — even without launching a formal impeachment inquiry.

U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta’s ruling delivers a striking blow to the president’s efforts to resist Democratic investigations, and is certain to give Democrats further legal basis to investigate Trump, his finances, and his presidential campaign.

Story Continued Below

In addition to upholding the House Oversight and Reform Committee’s subpoena to accounting firm Mazars USA for eight years of Trump’s financial records, Mehta took the extra step of denying the president’s request for a stay pending appeal.

Jay Sekulow, one of the president’s personal attorneys, said: “We will be filing a timely notice of appeal to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.”

Speaking with reporters at the White House on Monday, Trump called Mehta’s ruling “ridiculous” and “totally wrong.” He also noted that Mehta was appointed by President Barack Obama.

Mehta's decision is a sweeping repudiation of Trump's claim to be largely immune from congressional scrutiny, particularly in matters of potential legal violations. Mehta's opinion emphasizes that lawmakers have the authority to investigate Trump’s conduct from both before and after he took office.

The ruling represents the first time the federal judiciary has weighed in on the ongoing oversight battle between Trump and House Democrats. Mehta’s ruling is likely to provide a blueprint for other judges who are set to make their own rulings on Trump’s vow to defy all congressional subpoenas.

In a 41-page opinion issued Monday, Mehta systematically dismantled the Trump legal team’s arguments against the validity of the subpoena — and he pushed back on claims from congressional Republicans that the House Judiciary Committee must formally launch an impeachment inquiry before issuing such subpoenas.

“It is simply not fathomable that a Constitution that grants Congress the power to remove a president for reasons including criminal behavior would deny Congress the power to investigate him for unlawful conduct — past or present — even without formally opening an impeachment inquiry,"" Mehta wrote.

Mehta noted that Congress had twice investigated alleged illegal activity by presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. “Congress plainly views itself as having sweeping authority to investigate illegal conduct of a president, before and after taking office,” Mehta wrote. “This court is not prepared to roll back the tide of history.”

The president filed suit last month to block the subpoena, arguing that it amounted to an improper and overtly political abuse of congressional authority.

Mehta eviscerated that argument, too, emphasizing that a judge’s analysis of a congressional investigation “must be highly deferential to the legislative branch.”

“Thus, it is not the court’s role to decipher whether Congress’s true purpose in pursuing an investigation is to aid legislation or something more sinister such as exacting political retribution,” Mehta wrote, adding that there are “fundamental” problems with Trump’s legal arguments.

Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) issued the subpoena to Mazars last month as part of the panel’s investigation into whether Trump committed financial crimes before he became president.

In particular, the committee has sought to corroborate specific claims made by Trump’s former personal attorney and fixer Michael Cohen. Earlier this year, Cohen turned over documents to the panel which purport to show that Trump artificially inflated and deflated the values of his assets to suit his personal financial benefit.

For example, Cohen told lawmakers that Trump submitted false financial statements to Deutsche Bank in 2014 as he was seeking a loan to buy the Buffalo Bills NFL team.

""The court recognized the basic, but crucial fact that Congress has authority to conduct investigations as part of our core function under the Constitution,"" Cummings said in a statement.

Mehta emphasized that even though the committee never adopted a formal resolution outlining the purpose of its investigation, many other factors would deem the probe legitimate. Mehta pointed to Cummings’ reliance on federal ethics law in letters outlining the purpose of his investigation, and noted that legislation could conceivably be connected to the results of that probe. The judge also noted that Congress has unique constitutional power to oversee potential “emoluments,” or improper foreign payments, steered toward the president.

“Surely, incident to Congress’s authority to consent to the president’s receipt of emoluments is the power to investigate the president’s compliance with the Clause,” Mehta argued.

Congress is also allowed to investigate presidential conflicts of interest and a president's conduct “before and during his term,” Mehta ruled, pushing back on an argument from Republicans that Congress shouldn’t be investigating Trump’s conduct that pre-dates his political career.

That Mehta ruled in favor of House Democrats wasn’t entirely unexpected. Last week, he heard arguments from Trump attorney William Consovoy and House General Counsel Douglas Letter last week, during which the judge cast serious doubt on Consovoy’s legal arguments.

Consovoy contended that Congress has no legitimate authority to investigate whether the president violated the law, because such probes are handled by “law enforcement” entities and aren’t tied to a specific legislative remedy.

But Mehta pushed back strongly on Consovoy during the hearing, stating those types of investigations are “strictly” within Congress’ purview. He also said Congress has the authority to investigate conflicts of interest — for example, whether a president has a “financial interest in a particular piece of legislation that was being considered.”

In addition to the Mazars suit, Trump has asked a federal court to invalidate the House Intelligence and Financial Services committees’ subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and Capital One. Those subpoenas also seek Trump’s personal and business financial records, as part of a joint investigation centering on whether Trump is compromised, financially or otherwise, by foreign actors.

Trump and his GOP allies have argued that the Democrats’ probes are illegitimate and amount to an abuse of power.

AG Barr: 'I felt the rules were being changed to hurt Trump',https://www.foxnews.com,['Samuel Chamberlain'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/william-barr-rules-change-hurt-trump,"Attorney General William Barr said that his handling of the Mueller report and its aftermath is rooted in a desire to defend the power of the executive branch rather than personal support for President Trump.

""I felt the rules were being changed to hurt Trump, and I thought it was damaging for the presidency over the long haul,"" Barr told The Wall Street Journal in El Salvador in an interview published Monday, where he traveled last week to boost support for Trump's policies toward the violent street gang MS-13.

""At every grave juncture the presidency has done what it is supposed to do, which is to provide leadership and direction,"" Barr added. ""If you destroy the presidency and make it an errand boy for Congress, we’re going to be a much weaker and more divided nation.""

Democrats have accused Barr and Trump of trying to stonewall and obstruct Congress' oversight duties a charge that was repeated Monday after Trump directed former White House Counsel Don McGahn to defy a congressional subpoena to testify before the House Judiciary Committee. That committee voted earlier this month to hold Barr in contempt after he defied a subpoena for an unredacted version of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report into Russian activities during the 2016 presidential campaign.

BARR TEASES PELOSI, ASKS IF SHE BROUGHT HER HANDCUFFS AT DC EVENT

In an interview with Fox News' Bill Hemmer last week, Barr described that vote as ""part of the usual ... political circus that's being played out. It doesn't surprise me.""

Barr has taken the opprobrium in stride, going so far as to approach House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., at a Capitol Hill event last week and ask her if she had brought her handcuffs.

Barr told Fox News last week that he had ordered an investigation into the origins of the Russia probe because many of the answers he had gotten were ""inadequate.""

BARR VOWS TO UNCOVER 'EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED' WITH RUSSIA PROBE

""People have to find out what the government was doing during that period,"" he told ""America's Newsroom"" host Bill Hemmer. ""If we're worried about foreign influence, for the very same reason we should be worried about whether government officials abused their power and put their thumb on the scale. I'm not saying that happened but its something we have to look at.""

Barr specifically expressed a desire to focus on developments between Election Day in 2016 and Trump's inauguration in 2017, saying “some very strange developments” took place in that time.

""I think there's a misconception out there that we know a lot about what happened,” he said. “The fact of the matter is Bob Mueller did not look at the government's activities. He was looking at whether or not the Trump campaign had conspired with the Russians. But he was not going back and looking at the counterintelligence program. And we have a number of investigations underway that touch upon it.""

According to Gaetz, R-Fla., secret unreleased transcripts involving former Trump aide George Papadopoulos reveal that he denied there was an illegal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia and that intelligence officials did not present that information to the FISA court.

TRUMP PRODS NADLER, SCHIFF to PROBE 'CROOKED HILLARY' AND 'PHONY' RUSSIA INVESTIGATION

""I believe we are days if not weeks aways for the most in compelling evidence in the biggest political scandal in American history,"" Gaetz said on ""Hannity"" Monday.

""There was western intelligence sent to spy on Papadopoulos and there's a recording and transcript of the conversation. And there, Papadopoulos denies any illegal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia. So, they had evidence presumably that was against Papadopoulos and for him. What they will wont be able to defend is that they never presented that evidence to the FISA court.""

Former congressman Trey Gowdy made mention of such transcripts during an appearance on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures,” suggesting it is likely the FBI would have transcripts of discussions between informants and Papadopoulos and calling them game-changing if made public.

Gaetz said that this information is what Attorney General William Barr spoke about last week with Fox News' Bill Hemmer.

""This is what Attorney General Barr means when he talks about them putting their thumb on the scale. The government has an obligation before a secret court with no defense attorney to present all of the exculpatory evidence that they are provided, all of the exculpatory evidence,"" Gaetz said.

Gaetz argued why the evidence is so important.

"McGahn confirms he will skip House hearing, as DOJ asserts 'immunity' and Nadler fumes",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-mcgahn-house-hearing,"President Trump has directed former White House Counsel Don McGahn to skip a House Judiciary Committee hearing scheduled for Tuesday, citing a Justice Department opinion that he cannot be compelled to testify about his official duties -- and, through his legal team, McGahn confirmed Monday evening that he won't appear.

The development prompted an obstinate response late Monday from House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y.: “We are having the hearing tomorrow and we’re expecting Mr. McGahn to show pursuant to the subpoena.""

Earlier this month, House Democrats opted to question an empty chair -- and a bucket of fried chicken -- when Attorney General Bill Barr failed to appear, citing Democrats' unusual demands.

In a letter to Nadler, McGahn attorney William Burck said his client won't show up. Burck said current White House Counsel Pat Cipollone had communicated that Trump had instructed McGahn not to testify, and that Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel Steven Engel had said McGahn was immune from testifying.

""Mr. McGahn understands from your prior correspondence that the Committee would vote to hold him in contempt should he not appear tomorrow and the House of Representatives may follow suit,"" Burck wrote to Nadler. ""While we disagree with the Committee’s position and hope it will instead seek an accommodation with the White House, Mr. McGahn also must honor his ethical and legal obligations as a former senior lawyer and senior advisor to the President. In short, it is our view that the Committee’s dispute is not with Mr. McGahn but with the White House.""

Burck added: ""Mr. McGahn remains obligated to maintain the status quo and respect the President’s instruction. In the event an accommodation is agreed between the Committee and the White House, Mr. McGahn will of course comply with that accommodation.""

In a statement released Monday afternoon, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders blasted Democrats for continuing to pursue Trump investigations, saying they want a ""wasteful and unnecessary do-over"" in the wake of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe -- and describing the subpoena for McGahn as part of that.

""The House Judiciary Committee has issued a subpoena to try and force Mr. McGahn to testify again. The Department of Justice has provided a legal opinion stating that, based on long-standing, bipartisan, and Constitutional precedent, the former Counsel to the President cannot be forced to give such testimony, and Mr. McGahn has been directed to act accordingly,"" Sanders said. ""This action has been taken in order to ensure that future Presidents can effectively execute the responsibilities of the Office of the Presidency.""

The related DOJ memo said McGahn, like other senior advisers to a president, has ""immunity"" from being compelled to testify about his official duties.

""This immunity applies to the former White House Counsel. Accordingly, Mr. McGahn is not legally required to appear and testify about matters related to his official duties as Counsel to the President,"" the memo said.

The New York Times first reported that the president would likely direct McGahn to skip the hearing.

HOUSE JUDICIARY CHAIRMAN SUBPOENAS EX-WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL DON MCGAHN

The committee announced the hearing last week, but it was unclear whether McGahn would appear due to the ongoing battle between congressional Democrats and the White House over his testimony.

Earlier this month, Sanders said she did not “anticipate” that a hearing would take place. “We consider this to be a case closed and we’re moving forward to do the work of the American people,” Sanders said on ABC News’ “The Investigation” podcast.

The committee, led by Nadler, subpoenaed McGahn on April 22, days after the release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report, which featured McGahn prominently in its section related to the obstruction of justice inquiry. This included a claim that McGahn disobeyed Trump’s call to have him seek Mueller’s removal.

“On June 17, 2017, the president called [White House Counsel Don] McGahn at home and directed him to call the Acting Attorney General and say that the Special Counsel had conflicts of interest and must be removed. McGahn did not carry out the direction, however, deciding that he would resign rather than trigger what he regarded as a potential Saturday Night Massacre,” the report stated, referencing the Watergate scandal.

The report also revealed that when the media reported on the president’s request, the president directed White House officials “to tell McGahn to dispute the story and create a record stating he had not been ordered to have the special counsel removed.” He did not.

The House committee's subpoena, coming amid a fight over access to the unredacted Mueller report, called for McGahn to appear before the panel to testify and provide documents related to the Mueller investigation.

But earlier this month, Cipollone first notified the committee that McGahn would not be allowed to comply with the subpoena, saying requests for documents and materials must go to the White House.

“The White House provided these records to Mr. McGahn in connection with its cooperation with the Special Counsel’s investigation and with the clear understanding that the records remain subject to the control of the White House for all purposes,” Cipollone wrote. “The White House records remain legally protected from disclosure under longstanding constitutional principles, because they implicate significant Executive Branch confidentiality interests and executive privilege.”

HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SCHEDULES HEARING FOR DON MCGAHN, DESPITE WHITE HOUSE MOVE TO BLOCK SUBPOENA

He added: “Because Mr. McGahn does not have the legal right to disclose these documents to third parties, I would ask the Committee to direct any request for such records to the White House, the appropriate legal custodian.”

Cipollone wrote that acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney “has directed Mr. McGahn not to produce these White House records,” adding that the Justice Department concurs with their legal position.

But Nadler has stressed the importance of McGahn’s testimony, saying it would “help shed further light on the president’s attacks on the rule of law, and his attempts to cover up those actions by lying to the American people and requesting others to do the same.”

Trump, though, said he never told McGahn to fire Mueller, and tweeted last month that if he “wanted to fire Mueller, I didn’t need McGahn to do it, I could have done it myself.""

The battle over McGahn's testimony is just one front in the clash between the White House and congressional Democrats.

Earlier this month, the committee voted to hold Barr in contempt for defying a subpoena for Mueller's full and unredacted report, as well as underlying evidence and documents used in the investigation.

Trump, prior to the vote, asserted executive privilege over the materials in a bid to protect them from being turned over to the committee. The full House has yet to take a final vote on whether to hold Barr in contempt of Congress.

The drones are a ""potential risk to an organization's information,"" the alert from DHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency states. The products ""contain components that can compromise your data and share your information on a server accessed beyond the company itself.""

The report does not name any specific manufacturers, but nearly 80% of the drones used in the US and Canada come from DJI, which is headquartered in Shenzhen, China, according to one industry analysis. US local law enforcement organizations and infrastructure operators have grown to rely on drones in recent years.

E.P.A. Plans to Get Thousands of Deaths Off the Books by Changing Its Math,https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/20/climate/epa-air-pollution-deaths.html,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.

WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency plans to change the way it calculates the health risks of air pollution, a shift that would make it easier to roll back a key climate change rule because it would result in far fewer predicted deaths from pollution, according to five people with knowledge of the agency’s plans.

The E.P.A. had originally forecast that eliminating the Obama-era rule, the Clean Power Plan, and replacing it with a new measure would have resulted in an additional 1,400 premature deaths per year. The new analytical model would significantly reduce that number and would most likely be used by the Trump administration to defend further rollbacks of air pollution rules if it is formally adopted.

The proposed shift is the latest example of the Trump administration downgrading the estimates of environmental harm from pollution in regulations. In this case, the proposed methodology would assume there is little or no health benefit to making the air any cleaner than what the law requires. Many experts said that approach was not scientifically sound and that, in the real world, there are no safe levels of the fine particulate pollution associated with the burning of fossil fuels.

Fine particulate matter — the tiny, deadly particles that can penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream — is linked to heart attacks, strokes and respiratory disease."

Society in recent years has embraced what used to be considered profanity. Even The New York Times, the so-called Gray Lady with all the news that’s fit to print, found it fit to print the B.S. word just 14 times in the many years before Mr. Trump’s inauguration, according to a Nexis search, but has used it 26 times since — not all in stories covering the president.

Other presidents, of course, have engaged in common language and found a connection to everyday people. Harry S. Truman was told to “give ’em hell, Harry,” to which he famously replied: “I don’t give them hell. I just tell the truth about them and they think it’s hell.” But in general, it used to be something of a mini-scandal when a president was caught cursing in public.

During a campaign event in 2000, George W. Bush was heard over a live microphone talking with his running mate, Dick Cheney, calling a Times reporter he did not particularly like a “major-league asshole.” In 2004, as vice president, Mr. Cheney told a senator on the Senate floor to “go fuck yourself.” His successor, Joseph R. Biden Jr., was overheard in 2010 using a variation of that profanity to tell Barack Obama what a big deal passage of health care legislation was.

Never has any president pushed the boundaries of language as far as Mr. Trump. He had a foul mouth long before politics, of course, but he seemed to try, however fitfully, to clean it up for a while when he set his sights on the White House. Still, he could not resist at times. At one rally during his 2016 campaign, he quoted a supporter calling a Republican rival, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a “pussy.”

Once taking office, he tried, at least, to keep it private, but he was uninhibited when the cameras were not on. After the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, was appointed, he told aides, “I’m fucked.” Speaking with lawmakers, he called African nations “shithole countries.”

Yet Mr. Trump feigned shock in January when the newly elected Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan said she and her fellow House Democrats were “going to impeach the motherfucker.” The president told reporters that “she dishonored herself” by “using language like that in front of her son and whoever else was there.”

Mick Mulvaney, the White House chief of staff, acknowledged a certain raw quality in Mr. Trump’s discourse but dismissed its significance. “The president does use coarse language in private a lot with us,” he told Jake Tapper on CNN after Ms. Tlaib’s comment. “Many people do.” But, he added, “I think there’s more important things as to who’s coarsening the language.”"

Google may just have killed Huawei's bid to become the world's top smartphone brand,https://www.cnn.com,"['Sherisse Pham', 'Cnn Business']",05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/20/tech/huawei-google-android/index.html,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) Google is restricting Huawei's access to its Android operating system and apps after the Trump administration blacklisted the Chinese tech firm.

The move is a huge blow to Huawei, whose goal is to be the top smartphone brand by the end of 2020.

Last week, the Trump administration barred American companies from selling to Huaweiwithout a US government license in a significant escalation of the trade war with China.

""We are complying with the order and reviewing the implications,"" a Google spokesperson said on Monday. Huawei, the world's No. 2 smartphone seller, relies on a suite ofservices for its devices, including the Android system and the Google Play app store.

The Silicon Valley giant is suspending much of that access, according to multiple reports , after Washington placed Huawei on a list of foreign firms deemed to undermine American national security or foreign policy interests.Listed companies are barred from receiving components and software unless the trade is licensed.

Existing Huawei phones unaffected

Huawei will only be able to use the public version of Android and will not be able to access apps and services from Google. The news was first reported by Reuters.

Google said consumers who already own Huawei smartphones will be largely unaffected for now.

""Google Play and the security protections from Google Play Protect will continue to function on existing Huawei devices,"" the spokesperson added, without providing further details.

The ban threatens Huawei's supply chain and could delay the rollout of 5G services around the world . But the most immediate headache for Huawei is what the decision means for future smartphone sales.

Tencent's TCEHY Baidu BIDU Most of Google's most popular products — like Gmail, YouTube and Google Maps — are banned in China, where Huawei offers domestic alternatives likeWeChat andMaps.

But the company is hugely dependent on countries other than China. Roughly half its smartphone sales last year were made outside China, according to research firms Canalys and IDC.

Huawei said it is ""examining the implications from the US actions for consumers,"" adding that it will continue to provide ""security updates and after sales services"" for all existing smartphones and tablets, including its Honor budget brand.

China's response: 'Wait and see'

The Chinese tech company said it has spent at least three years working on its own operating system.

""Huawei has been building an alternative operating system just in case it is needed,"" said Huawei spokesperson Glenn Schloss. ""We would like to be able to continue operating in the Microsoft and Google ecosystems,"" he added.

Microsoft MSFT Huawei licenses Microsoft's operating system for its laptops and tablets.did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Beijing has repeatedly criticized the US-led campaign against Huawei, and called the addition of the company to the trade blacklist a political move.

""China supports Chinese companies defending their legitimate rights according to laws,"" Lu Kang, a spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a press briefing on Monday.

""In terms of what measures either Chinese companies or Chinese government would take, please wait and see,"" he said.

Killing Huawei outside China?

Samsung SSNLF Being cut off from the Google ecosystem would be a huge blow to Huawei's ambitions to overtakeas the world's biggest smartphone maker.

The consumer business — which includes smartphones, laptops, tablets and wearable devices like smart watches — was the biggest contributor to Huawei's earnings last year. The division made nearly 349 billion yuan ($50 billion) in 2018, accounting for more than 45% of revenue.

For the millions of users outside of China, being cut off from Google's apps and services ""kills the attractiveness of a Huawei phone,"" said IDC analyst Bryan Ma.

""It kills the usability of a Huawei phone outside of China, thus rendering them dead in the water,"" he added.

Theoretically, Huawei can try to win over consumers with its competitive hardware and innovation, and then convince them to download Google apps after they buy a Huawei phone, said Nicole Peng, an analyst with Canalys.

But evidence shows that ""after sales installation is very challenging for users, unless they know what they're doing,"" said Peng.

Moreover, when customers start finding out that Huawei can't get Google's ecosystem on their phones, ""it will affect trust, they will question if anything is wrong with the device,"" she added.

Even if customers were able to independently download Google apps on Huawei phones, the phones may still not have access to so-called Google Mobile Services.

Many third party apps, like ride hailing and food delivery platforms, rely on services like Google Maps. Most of those apps may no longer be supported on Huawei devices, said IDC's Ma.

Without that access, ""the Huawei phone is a brick,"" he said."
EPA to ‘Massage Death Projections’ to Make Trump’s Coal Plan Look Less Deadly: Report,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Jamie Ross'],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/epa-plans-to-massage-death-projections-to-make-trumps-coal-rule-look-less-deadly-report,"If your projections make a policy look dangerous, there’s two options—change the policy, or change the projections. The Environmental Protection Agency is reportedly planning to do the latter by adopting a new method for projecting the future health risks of air pollution. The new method has not been been peer-reviewed and is not scientifically sound, The New York Times reports, citing five people said to have knowledge of the plan. The change would drastically lower an estimate made last year by the Trump administration that as many as 1,400 more people could die prematurely each year under a proposed new rule on emissions from coal plants. Lowering the projections would make it much easier to defend the new regulation, known as the Affordable Clean Energy rule. “Particulate matter is extremely harmful and it leads to a large number of premature deaths,” said Richard L. Revesz, an expert in environmental law at New York University. He called the expected change a “monumental departure” from the approach used over the past several decades."
DOJ reveals name of ex-US attorney accused of sexual misconduct after BuzzFeed lawsuit,https://thehill.com,[],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/444620-doj-reveals-name-of-ex-us-attorney-accused-of-sexual-misconduct-after,"The Justice Department has revealed the name of a former U.S. attorney accused of misconduct after BuzzFeed News successfully sued for disclosure of his identity.

The Justice Department announced in May 2017 that the since-retired attorney had an affair with a subordinate, created a hostile work environment and possibly violated department policy on sexual harassment. A federal judge ruled in March that public interest superseded government officials’ right to privacy, forcing the Justice Department to disclose last week the attorney in question was Stephen Wigginton, who served as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Illinois from 2010 to 2015. Wigginton was also charged with driving under the influence and causing a car crash in 2017.

In the March ruling, U.S. District Judge Vernon Broderick ruled the Justice Department omitted key details in arguing Wigginton’s case only involved an “improper consensual relationship.”

“Instead, the improper relationship was so open and obvious that it caused employees within the Office to feel powerless, embarrassed, and distracted, and resulted in a work environment that some described as unbearable and hostile,” Broderick wrote. “In addition to work environment issues, the conduct had an impact on the operations of the Office since it resulted in disparate treatment regarding bonuses and disciplinary actions, and led some to avoid the U.S. Attorney and Supervisory AUSA at all costs.”

“Following the OIG’s investigation into this matter, the Department took appropriate steps to assess and address the issues outlined in the OIG’s report,” a Justice Department spokesperson told BuzzFeed. “The department has complete confidence in the new leadership and overall professionalism of the [US attorney’s office] in the Southern District of Illinois.”

The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Hill."
"Acting DHS secretary says migrants won't be sent to Florida, sanctuary cities",https://www.inforum.com,['Washington Post'],,,,https://www.inforum.com/news/nation/1339806-Acting-DHS-secretary-says-migrants-wont-be-sent-to-Florida-sanctuary-cities,"Acting homeland security secretary Kevin McAleenan acknowledged Sunday that the Trump administration had considered sending migrants from Texas to Florida but ultimately decided not to because it wouldn't have been ""an effective use of resources.""

The statement by McAleenan follows an outcry from Florida officials late last week in response to the administration's plans.

""We looked at it from a planning perspective: What's prudent here?"" McAleenan said in an interview on CBS News' ""Face the Nation."" ""We do have stations in Florida. We have stations on the northern border. They're very small stations. They have a few agents that are busy patrolling their areas. There wasn't going to be an effective use of resources. But yeah, we had to look at all options.""

McAleenan said John Sanders, the acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, made the decision to reverse course on Saturday. Sanders issued a statement on Saturday night indicating that CBP has ""no plans to transport people in our custody to northern or coastal border facilities,"" including Florida.

The debate comes as the United States is facing a record-high number of migrant families crossing into the country along the southern border. The influx has strained U.S. Border Patrol resources so far beyond capacity that the crisis is spilling into the country's interior.

listen live watch live

Border Patrol authorities say they have apprehended an average of 4,500 people each day along the southwest border, and the number of people in CBP custody recently surpassed 17,500.

Late last week, local officials in Florida's Broward and Palm Beach counties sounded the alarm after the Trump administration told them it planned to send about 1,000 asylum seekers a month to those counties from the El Paso area. Neither county has sanctuary status limiting cooperation with immigration authorities, but both are heavily Democratic.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, R, an ally of President Donald Trump, also spoke out against sending migrants to the state.

""President @realDonaldTrump and I spoke yesterday and confirmed that he did not approve, nor would approve, sending immigrants who illegally cross the border, to Florida. It is not going to happen,"" DeSantis said in a tweet Sunday morning.

The White House twice floated a plan to send migrants to sanctuary cities and states - in November and in February - in retaliation against the president's political opponents. Both times, administration officials rejected the idea. Even so, Trump has falsely claimed on the campaign trail that migrants are being sent to sanctuary jurisdictions and even said that it was his own ""sick idea"" to do so.

In his statement Saturday night, Sanders blamed ""inaccurate reports in the press"" for misinformation about CBP's plans. Asked to clarify, McAleenan said Sunday that Sanders was referring to reports that flights had already taken off for Florida.

McAleenan also said that Trump's suggestion that the administration is sending migrants to sanctuary cities was incorrect.

""Our transportation is based on operational necessity, capacity to process safely. That's what we're doing,"" McAleenan said. Some migrants have already been moved from Texas to San Diego, which has a ""high-capacity Border Patrol sector,"" he added.

The Washington Post reported Saturday that McAleenan had said he might leave his post unless he was given more control over his agency amid an attempted shakeup by senior Trump adviser Stephen Miller. One Trump aide likened the internal tensions to an ""immigration knife fight.""

McAleenan on Sunday disputed that he had threatened to leave over the issue.

""I did not threaten to quit, no,"" he said, adding: ""I'm going to work on solving this problem as long as I have that opportunity. No question.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Jacquelyn Martin/AP Jacquelyn Martin/AP

A couple of federal agencies you probably haven't heard of keep track of what farmers grow, what Americans eat and how the country's entire food system operates. And the Trump administration wants them out of Washington, D.C.

Last summer, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) would relocate somewhere that's closer to farmers and public universities doing agricultural research. But critics, including many scientists, balked, saying the agencies won't be as effective.

ERS collects and crunches numbers on everything from how much corn syrup Americans consume to how tariffs affect farmers, while NIFA funds research that does things like closely track climate change.

USDA has yet to announce a new home for the agencies, but recently narrowed the list to three: the greater Kansas City metro area, the Research Triangle Park area near Raleigh, N.C., and various sites in Indiana — Vice President Mike Pence's home state.

Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran recalled when he heard of Perdue's proposal.

""My first thought was Kansas City would be the perfect place,"" said the Republican, who, along with other Missouri and Kansas members of Congress, supports the move.

""Not every job in government needs to be in Washington D.C."" Moran said, noting that about 9 out of 10 USDA employees already work outside of Washington.

He added that ERS and NIFA would boost budding research clusters like the Kansas City area's animal health corridor and give bright kids from the region a chance to stay put and still pursue a research career. The move would also fall in line with the Trump administration's cost-cutting measures. Moran said office rent and the cost of living is cheaper away from the coasts.

Skepticism about what is driving the move

But many in the research community said efficiency isn't driving the move. It's hostility toward science.

""I think that moving the agencies out of D.C. is going to significantly dilute their effectiveness as well as their relevance,"" says Ricardo Salvador, who is the Director of the Food and Environment Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

The agency's effectiveness already is under attack, according to a former ERS employee who was granted anonymity due to fear of losing his current position.

""Efforts by the secretary ... have just destroyed morale,"" the ex-ERS employee said.

He said he enjoyed working at the agency until about a year and a half ago, when researchers began to fear tackling politically sensitive topics. Then, Purdue pushed to take the agency out from under nonpartisan oversight and place it under his control.

Finally, the ex-employee said, the surprise announcement to move most of ERS and NIFA out of Washington triggered a cascade of resignations, including his own.

""I think it's had its intended effect. People have left, morale is low. The agency will take a long time to recover from the damage that's been inflicted,"" the former employee said.

Employees remaining at ERS and NIFA are fighting back. ERS researchers recently voted to join the American Federation of Government Employees, and NIFA employees plan to take a vote, too. The union will negotiate to give ERS and NIFA employees longer to decide if they want to move, and is backing legislation that would withhold funds USDA would need to make the move.

The Trump administration wanted staff reductions years ago. And all three Trump budgets, none of which have been accepted by Congress, have proposed deep cuts to the agencies.

Salvador argued that's because objective research often clashes with political ideology. ERS studies, for instance, concluded that the 2017 tax cuts championed by the administration would most benefit the richest farmers, and that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which Trump wants to cut, is good for the economy.

""So the secretary is clearly dealing with inconvenient facts by going to the source and eliminating them,"" Salvador said.

Sen. Jerry Moran said he believes the research agencies can be relocated and well supported, and he's played a key role in fighting off earlier efforts to cut funding for agricultural research.

Moran said farmers, ranchers and policymakers can't make sound decisions without reliable USDA data.

But that's exactly the problem critics have with the proposal to move ERS and NIFA: They say the USDA hasn't produced data that support the move."

The Washington Post reported Saturday that McAleenan grew angry after Miller tried to dictate hiring at the agency and a ""power struggle"" followed.

McAleenan was asked Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation” if he had threatened to leave. “No,” he responded, saying he planned to lead the department for as long as he had the opportunity.

But he refused to discuss whether he had fought with Miller, who is known as an immigration hardliner.

“Look, I'm not going to talk about rumors or any alleged internal conversations,” McAleenan said.

President Trump appointed McAleenan to lead Homeland Security temporarily after Kirstjen Nielsen was ousted as secretary last month at Miller’s urging. Other top officials, including acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Ron Vitiello, have been removed at Miller’s insistence.

Nielsen and Vitiello had challenged Miller’s proposal to conduct mass arrests in 10 cities of migrant parents and children eligible for deportation."

Contributing columnist

The Office of Legal Counsel offered more cause for concern last week that politics is playing an undue role at the Justice Department. The office, which is charged with providing the executive branch neutral legal advice, issued an opinion that the Food and Drug Administration has no authority to regulate drugs used in lethal injection.

The OLC opinion was clearly designed to break through the legal logjam that has prevented states from using lethal injection drugs in executions — and it uses Evel Kneivel-style logical leaps to get there.

Lethal injections, such as the three-drug cocktail sodium thiopental, have become the primary method of execution in the United States. Of the 292 executions in the last 10 years, 289 have employed such chemicals.

U.S. drug manufacturers, not wanting their products to be associated with executions, stopped making thiopental 10 years ago, forcing states to acquire the killing drugs overseas. This move has generated legal trouble, however, as the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) prohibits misbranded drugs from entering interstate commerce, including any drug not manufactured in an establishment registered with the FDA. The statute also prohibits the use of an unapproved new drug that the FDA has not blessed as safe and effective for its proposed use.

Based on these legal provisions, a group of convicts on death row sued the FDA in 2011 and gained an injunction requiring the administration to prevent the entry of foreign-manufactured thiopental on the grounds that it was unapproved and misbranded. It also had to tell state correctional departments that the use of the drug was prohibited by law under threat of civil and criminal penalties.

That injunction remains in effect today. Among other things, it has put the FDA and death-penalty states such as Texas at loggerheads.

The Office of Legal Counsel’s opinion, authored by its well-respected head lawyer, Assistant Attorney General Steven A. Engel, attempts to take the FDA’s foot off the throat of death-penalty states. Engel points to FDA v. Brown & Williamson, a 2000 case in which the Supreme Court found that the FDA lacks regulatory authority over tobacco products as “drugs” or “devices” (Congress later granted the agency power to regulate them directly), to argue that the FDA similarly cannot regulate sodium thiopental’s use in executions. The supposition is that when used for executions, the substance is intended to kill the prisoner, so by definition the drug is not “safe” or “effective.”

But this reasoning is tendentious. Nowhere in Brown & Williamson did the court suggest that the law inherently did not cover tobacco products; rather, the court held that, lacking any safer effective use, the FDA could only regulate the products by banning them, which Congress expressly forbade. Congress has not, however, forbidden the FDA from banning the use of sodium thiopental in executions.

The OLC opinion tries to get around this problem by lumping sodium thiopental in with other means of executions — electric chairs, gallows or firing squads — that “are intended to affect the function or structure of the body,” which is one of the definitions of a “drug.” Thus, Engel argues, the FDA would have to ban all means of execution, whereas “the Constitution and laws of the United States presuppose the continued availability of capital punishment.”

This is a massive logical leap. Among other problems, it assumes that there cannot be a “safe and effective” drug in executions, but the whole point of lethal injection is to provide a safe and effective form of execution — not, of course, to extend life but to promote a humane and predictable death rather than the ghoulish lottery of untested, potentially painful drugs.

Moreover, all the opinions in the litigation that resulted in the 2011 injunction, as well as previous opinions in the Supreme Court, concluded that the FDA’s jurisdiction over drugs extends to sodium thiopental. Even Texas expressly conceded it in the injunction litigation. The OLC opinion also sidesteps the immense implications of its reasoning for the FDA’s regulation of drugs for physician-assisted suicide, animal euthanasia or recreation.

So why would OLC issue such a strained opinion? First clue: The heading of the opinion makes clear that it was ordered up by the attorney general, which is relatively rare. And a footnote states that OLC “considered” the views of the FDA. Reading between the lines, it’s a decent bet that OLC rejected the FDA’s arguments.

Apart from disarming the FDA, the opinion removes the threat of civil and even criminal liability under the FDCA for state officials who buy and use the foreign-manufactured drugs.

Finally, the OLC opinion could potentially serve as the basis for a motion to dissolve or amend the 2011 injunction. Death penalty states could argue to the court that the FDA’s jurisdiction is a threshold issue not previously considered, and the opinion here, being an official statement of the executive branch, would carry more weight than a simple argument in a brief.

None of this would be so worrisome if the opinion represented the sort of nonpartisan legal interpretation that the OLC is charged with providing. But the opinion, not least because of its dubious legal analysis, bears the distinct scent of a preferred political solution. Given the concern that the Justice Department has become a political tool for the administration, it’s yet another worrisome indication that the norms of our institutions are eroding.

Experts call out Trump's EPA for redefining environmental standards to allow for more air pollution,https://www.salon.com,[],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.salon.com/2019/05/20/experts-call-out-trumps-epa-for-redefining-environmental-standards-to-allow-for-more-air-pollution/,"President Donald Trump is planning on making it easier for air polluters to conceal the lives lost due to their actions — and a top climatologist and geophysicist is calling for him to be held accountable.

The Trump administration has instructed the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to use a new method for projecting the future health risks of air pollution, which would significantly reduce last year's estimate that up to 1,400 additional premature deaths will occur every year due to a proposed new rule on coal plant emissions, according to The New York Times. The plan is controversial, in part, because experts claim it has not been peer-reviewed and is not scientifically sound, breaking precedent in terms of how the EPA attempts to handle environmental regulations.

Its immediate effect, however, would be to make it easier for the Trump administration to implement its Affordable Clean Energy rule. In spite of its name, exists to reduce the environmental safeguards established by President Barack Obama's original Clean Power Plan, which it replaced.

""This is a logical next step in the effort by Trump and the polluting interests that dictate his environmental policies to dismantle the environmental protections of the past half century put in place by past both Republican and Democratic presidents,"" Michael E. Mann, a distinguished professor of atmospheric science at Penn State University, told Salon by email.

""Let me be blunt: Trump is choosing to kill people in order to increase the profits of the polluting interests to which he is beholden,"" Mann added. ""I cannot think of a more craven act than this, and we’re talking about a president who is known for craven acts. There is a reason I warned back in October 2016 that Trump is a threat to the planet.""

When asked if he believes the scientific community has a responsibility to break out of its usual apolitical stance in order to speak out against Trump's positions, Mann argued emphatically that this is indeed the case.

""I’ve been advocating that for years, but better late than never,"" Mann explained. ""The short answer is: Yes, our planet is under attack by polluting interests and the politicians doing their bidding. The stakes couldn’t be greater. We scientists cannot stand on the sidelines. We must be on the frontlines, doing everything we can to inform the public discourse concerning policy-relevant science.""

""Elections to have consequences. If a tiny fraction of voters who sat out the last presidential election under the misguided notion that there was no difference between the two candidates had voted, we wouldn’t be in the predicament we are now in,"" he continued. ""That having been said, there are many ways we can influence policy. We must use our voice. Speak out, encourage others to do so and provide support for our children, who are now literally marching in the streets because they recognize what the stakes are. We must find our voice and use it, we must demand that policymakers represent our interests rather than the polluting interests and we must vote out those who won’t.""

Kevin Trenberth, a distinguished senior scientist in the climate analysis section of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, echoed these thoughts, telling Salon by email that ""there are a number of responsible businesses that clean-up after their activities, but it is often easy for others to undercut them by dumping their waste and pollution into the environment at a cost to all. A key role of government is to ensure that this does not happen, with rules and regulations to protect the innocent, including many animals and ecosystems. The current U.S. administration has abdicated its responsibility. Instead we all ultimately pay a much higher price in many ways. Let's Make America Clean Again!""

Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Department of Global Ecology was more blunt, telling Salon by email that ""it is one thing for the Trump administration to decide that more people should be killed from particulate air pollution, because their lives are worth less than the money to be made from loosened regulations. It is another thing entirely to enter an Orwellian world, in which we pretend that the loosening of regulations will not result in more people dying. Trump complains about fake news, but then to justify his policies, his minions create fake science and then use it to create real policy."""
Steven Mnuchin Refuses to Comply With Subpoena for Trump’s Tax Returns,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Alan Rappeport', 'Nicholas Fandos']",05-17-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/us/politics/mnuchin-trump-tax-returns-subpoena.html,"“For the same reasons, we are unable to provide the requested information in response to the committee’s subpoena,” Mr. Mnuchin said.

Mr. Mnuchin was widely expected to ignore the subpoena, as Mr. Trump has vowed to fight all subpoenas from House Democrats. The Treasury secretary has warned that allowing House Democrats to retrieve the president’s tax returns would open the door to lawmakers from both parties politicizing the Internal Revenue Service in the future.

At a Senate hearing this week, Mr. Mnuchin said that House Democrats were trying to “weaponize” the I.R.S. He said that he had not yet decided how he would respond to the subpoena, but that “you can guess which way we are leaning.” He said that the judiciary, as the third branch of government, would most likely need to settle the dispute between Congress and the executive branch, signaling the potential for a protracted court fight.

House Democrats have been weighing how to respond to the Trump administration’s defiance of congressional subpoenas. On Friday, Mr. Neal made clear his preference for avoiding retaliatory threats, to the disappointment of several of his more liberal colleagues.

Mr. Neal told reporters that he saw little value in trying to hold Mr. Mnuchin or Charles P. Rettig, the I.R.S. commissioner, in contempt of Congress. Instead, he said, he would go straight to the courts to try to enforce his subpoena, potentially as soon as next week. The case could take months or years to resolve."
DHS Urges Cybersecurity Staff to ‘Deploy’ to Border Instead,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Betsy-Woodruff Sam-Brodey', 'Betsy Woodruff', 'Sam Brodey']",05-17-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/department-of-homeland-security-urges-cybersecurity-staff-to-deploy-to-border-instead,"The Department of Homeland Security’s cybersecurity agency—which also works to protect schools and places of worship—is urging staffers tasked with handling cyber threats to set their day jobs aside and go on mini-deployments to the U.S.-Mexico border after an earlier request from headquarters failed to recruit enough officials, according to an email obtained by The Daily Beast.

The effort to send more employees to the border comes amid concerns that the agency’s focus on the influx of migrants at the border is siphoning off DHS officials who should be handling other threats—especially to elections. DHS’s other components, including its intelligence arm, have also been asked to send volunteers to the border. It is unclear if those components have found enough volunteers to satisfy headquarters.

On Friday, the deputy director of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) sent out an email asking employees to consider a “short-term deployment to the southern border,” ranging from 30 to 45 days, due to the “ongoing surge of migrants.”

“It is never easy to ask colleagues to take on extra challenges, but as DHS employees, serving the needs of the homeland is the cornerstone of what we do,” wrote Matthew Travis, CISA deputy director, to agency employees.

“If it is in your capacity to deploy, please give serious thought to volunteering,” he added.

Earlier this spring, top officials asked employees from all DHS entities to go volunteer at the border, according to a DHS official. The email went out because CISA is still working to send as many people as DHS headquarters has asked for, the official added. In other words, not enough CISA employees want to step away from their cybersecurity work to focus on border security—at least, not yet.

“As we have consistently said, the Department is considering all options to address the humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border,” said Tyler Houlton, DHS acting assistant secretary for public affairs, in a statement.

“We will continue to work with our workforce to find dynamic solutions and funding to address this very serious problem. As part of this effort, it is our responsibility to explore fiscal mechanisms that will ensure the safety and welfare of both our workforce and the migrant population, which is also reflected in the supplemental request submitted to Congress.”

Among the officials who were asked on Friday to assist the federal government at the border are those tasked with protecting the U.S. government’s cyber infrastructure — including election systems considered vulnerable in the run-up to 2020.

DHS also said the deployments will not hamper the department’s other work.

“DHS is fully capable of deploying more resources to address the crisis at our southern border while simultaneously maintaining our operational capabilities throughout the Department in order to carry out our mission to protect the American people,” said Houlton.

DHS has been urging its personnel who do not work for Customs and Border Patrol or Immigration and Customs Enforcement to volunteer at the border because they say those agencies need additional assistance due to the flow of migrants from the south. Roughly 400 employees of the Transportation Security Administration, for example, are expected to arrive at the border soon.

But DHS has not offered many details on what specific responsibilities these employees will handle. With many migrants traveling in large groups and often with young children, agents are spending much of their time attending to children, DHS officials have said.

The Border Patrol chief, Carla Provost, told the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 8 that some agents are serving primarily as “child care professionals, medical caregivers, bus drivers and food service workers.”

Apprehensions of migrants at the southern border have reached a 13-year high. In the last two months, Border Patrol apprehended over 200,000 migrants; the total for April—109,000—is the highest number for a single month since 2007.

Trump administration officials are saying they do not have enough resources to handle the influx, and have requested an additional $4.5 billion for their operations from Congress. Democrats on Capitol Hill have signaled a willingness to fund humanitarian assistance at the border, but have scuttled other uses of funding, like increasing beds in ICE detention facilities."
CFPB Chief Says Education Department Is Blocking Student Loan Oversight,https://www.npr.org,['Chris Arnold'],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/16/723568597/cfpb-chief-says-education-department-is-blocking-student-loan-oversight,"CFPB Chief Says Education Department Is Blocking Student Loan Oversight

Enlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP

The director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau says the Trump administration's Education Department is getting in the way of efforts to police the student loan industry. The revelation, in a letter obtained by NPR, comes at the same time that lawsuits allege that widespread wrongdoing by student loan companies is costing some borrowers thousands of dollars.

CFPB Director Kathy Kraninger explained the problem in an April letter responding to questions from Sen. Elizabeth Warren and other lawmakers about whether the federal regulator had ""abandoned its supervision and enforcement activities"" related to more than $1 trillion in student loans.

A central issue is that companies that manage student loans, known as student loan servicers, are refusing to share information that the CFPB says it needs to perform proper oversight.

""Since December 2017,"" Kraninger wrote in the letter, ""student loan servicers have declined to produce information requested by the Bureau for supervisory examinations"" related to federal student loans.

She said servicers are not sharing the information because the Department of Education has issued guidance telling them not to do so, citing ""privacy"" concerns. Kraninger also said that information from student loan servicers is ""necessary for supervisory examinations.""

The letter is a carefully worded response to senators' questions. But Kraninger, a Trump administration appointee, is in essence saying that the CFPB is trying to do its job protecting student borrowers and supervising loan servicing companies, but the Education Department is getting in the way.

""It's actually quite remarkable,"" says Seth Frotman, executive director of the nonprofit Student Borrower Protection Center. ""The head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is telling the world that the secretary of education has put in place a series of policies that are obstructing federal law enforcement officials from standing up for the millions of Americans with student debt.""

Frotman used to be the CFPB's student loan ombudsman but quit last summer over frustrations with the Trump administration. In a scathing resignation letter last August, he said the Trump administration was ""turning its back on student borrowers"" and preventing him from doing his job.

Now Kraninger, the administration's hand-picked director for the bureau, is pointing the finger, albeit in a less dramatic way, at the Education Department for hindering efforts to protect student borrowers.

In response to Kraninger's letter, Elizabeth Warren, Sherrod Brown, and three other Democratic senators called the revelations ""disturbing"" in a round of letters they fired off this week to loan servicing companies.

The lawmakers say in their letters that since Kraninger says the CFPB has attempted to get documents it needs for supervision and been rebuffed by the servicers, that ""reveals that the Department under Secretary DeVos, has removed the most potent weapon from the CFPB's arsenal to fight illegal behavior and mistreatment of borrowers by student loan servicers, and that federal student loan servicers, who are paid by the federal government, are ignoring federal regulators' requests for information.""

The senators' letters add that no ""guidance"" from the Department of Education ""can absolve servicers of their legal responsibility to comply with state and federal consumer protection law.""

Student borrowers getting hurt

When Jessica Saint-Paul heard about a program called Public Service Loan Forgiveness, she was ecstatic. For borrowers who work in qualifying public service jobs — such as police officers, government workers, people who work at nonprofit organizations — the program promises that if they make loan payments for 10 years, the remainder of their student debt will be forgiven. Saint-Paul had about $80,000 in student loans and she wasn't making much money working for a nonprofit that provides services to foster children.

""I was just like, 'Oh, this is perfect,' "" Saint-Paul says. So she called the company that was servicing her student loans and says she was told she was all set — after 10 years, she should be eligible to get her loans forgiven. That was nine years ago.

Saint-Paul said she called back over the years, including once when she changed nonprofit jobs in 2014, to say, ""just making sure I'm on track."" She says she was told, "" 'OK, no problem.' The conversation was quick; they were so kind.""

The call center workers might have been friendly, but Saint-Paul says she was getting bad information. She says she found that out just last year at a conference she attended. There was an information session on loan forgiveness, and she was told she was in the wrong kind of loan and wrong payment plan so she couldn't qualify. She says many other people were finding out the same thing alongside her at the conference.

""It was like a support group almost it turned into because people were like, 'No, that can't be true,' "" Saint-Paul says. ""I went on my phone, people were on their laptops checking what kind of loan they were in. We were all sitting there just frantic.""

Saint-Paul says that if nine years ago her loan servicer had just told her to convert to the right loan and payment plan, everything would have been OK. Instead, she says she feels as though someone stole tens of thousands of dollars from her.

""I just cannot believe this happened to me,"" she says. ""That's like criminal, it's not right.""

Many people agree that it's not right — regulators and advocacy groups are filing a growing number of lawsuits against loan servicing companies alleging mishandling of the loan forgiveness program. Saint-Paul is a plaintiff in one of them.

Many of the consumer complaints and lawsuits involve allegations that servicing companies gave borrowers bad information or advice that resulted in them thinking they were getting credit toward loan forgiveness, when in fact they were in the wrong loan or payment plan.

The Education Department revealed late last year that about 99% of borrowers who thought they had reached that 10-year milestone and applied for forgiveness were rejected. More than 1 million people are actively pursuing loan forgiveness under the program and hoping to qualify.

That's why Democratic lawmakers say they want to make sure that perhaps the most powerful watchdog — the CFPB — is on top of all this.

Fears that the watchdog has been asleep

Since 2011, the CFPB has monitored loan servicers, lenders and complaints from student borrowers and brought enforcement actions when it discovered wrongdoing. For example, the CFPB in 2015 returned $480 million to allegedly defrauded students of Corinthian Colleges.

In 2017, the CFPB brought a lawsuit against one of the nation's largest student loan servicers, Navient. The bureau said Navient ""created obstacles to repayment by providing bad information, processing payments incorrectly, and failing to act when borrowers complained. Through shortcuts and deception, the company also illegally cheated many struggling borrowers out of their rights to lower repayments, which caused them to pay much more than they had to for their loans."" That lawsuit is ongoing.

Navient disputes the allegations in the CFPB lawsuit and other suits brought by state regulators. ""The allegations made in the claims are unfounded, and we are vigorously defending our record in court,"" a Navient spokesman says.

But since Richard Cordray, the bureau's Obama-era director, stepped down in November 2017, consumer advocates have been worried that the Trump-appointed interim director, Mick Mulvaney, and now the permanent director, Kraninger, have backed away from protecting student borrowers.

But in her letter, Kraninger said the consumer protection bureau takes that job seriously.

""As with all industries subject to the Bureau's supervisory or enforcement authority, the Bureau will continue to monitor those subject to its authority — in this case, student lenders and student loan servicers — to ensure they are complying with the law,"" she wrote.

At the same time, Kraninger also explained that the Education Department has created obstacles that are getting in the way of the CFPB doing its job. In addition to the guidance to student loan servicers that is impeding oversight efforts, back in 2017, the Trump administration's Education Department ended information sharing agreements that it had with the CFPB. In her letter, Kraninger said an information-sharing agreement (called a Memorandum of Understanding) is required under law and it is ""a priority"" for the bureau to get a new one in place.

Some advocates say the CFPB should do more than acknowledge such problems in a letter to lawmakers. Frotman, of the Student Borrower Protection Center, says the bureau has broad powers to compel student loan servicing companies to turn over the information it needs about student loans and student borrowers.

""I think just identifying this fact is of little solace to student loan borrowers who desperately need the help of a consumer financial watchdog that is supposed to be independent,"" Frotman says. He says he'd like to see Kraninger more directly demand that the Education Department change its guidance to loan servicers and tell them to cooperate with regulators. The CFPB could also take loan servicers to court to get the information it needs., Frotman says.

In a statement to NPR, the CFPB said: ""The Bureau continues to supervise the student loan market, as well as taking action against those who fail to comply with the law."" And the bureau says it is confident it can resolve the issues to achieve its mission of protecting borrowers.

But for its part the Education Department appears to be defending its stance — that loan servicers not hand over information to the CFPB. The department says in a statement that it takes privacy seriously along with the need to ""protect customers' personal data."" It says requests for information about student loan borrowers should be made to the department.

State regulators also say Education Department impeding oversight

Last month, 21 state attorneys general sent Education Secretary Betsy DeVos a letter calling on her to ""reverse the limitations"" the department has placed on student loan servicing companies sharing information with state law enforcement agencies.

The attorneys general said ""student loan information is vital to our efforts to protect consumers from illegal, unfair, abusive, or deceptive practices by actors in the higher education industry, in which the Department historically has been an important partner. However, the Department's policy reversal impedes states' ability to enforce the law and shields unprincipled industry actors from regulatory enforcement, harming student loan borrowers nationwide.""

The industry group the Student Loan Servicing Alliance told NPR in a statement, ""As contractors of the Department of Education which owns its federal student loan data, federal servicers must follow federal law and ED guidance on disclosure and data sharing.""

Why not just share the information?

It's not clear why the department is blocking state and federal regulators from getting information from servicers to do oversight presumably aimed at protecting the rights of student borrowers.

Jason Delisle, a fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, says there may be a turf war going on here. Even if a particular student loan program has problems, Delisle says the department may feel, ""this is our program and we're designing it the way we want to design it and we're running it the way we want to run it."" And Delisle says if there are problems the department may feel it can sort them out by itself.

Frotman says that's not the issue. He says the Education Department may not like having regulators looking into alleged wrongdoing within the companies managing its loan programs, but ""this isn't about reasonable disagreements, it is about following the law versus obstructing law enforcement."""
New DOJ Investigation Has Haunted FBI for Months,https://www.realclearpolitics.com,[],05-18-2019,2019,5,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/05/18/new_doj_investigation_has_haunted_fbi_for_months.html,"John Durham, the prosecutor tapped by Attorney General William Barr to investigate how Trump-Russia allegations emerged and spread within federal law enforcement, has already been looking into whether the FBI’s former top lawyer, James Baker, illegally leaked to reporters.

In fact, the U.S. attorney from Connecticut appears to have begun that work more than seven months ago, to judge from an underreported transcript of an October congressional interview with Baker. The Baker interview, at which Durham was not present, suggests that the prosecutor nevertheless has some people very worried.

Baker testified about the Trump-Russia affair on Oct. 3 before the House Judiciary Committee and the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.

In that session, the former FBI general counsel admitted that versions and variations of Christopher Steele’s dossier were being turned in to the bureau from the strangest of places. Baker said he had even heard about it from David Corn, Washington bureau chief of left-leaning Mother Jones, who wrote one of the first pieces on the dossier, in October 2016. But in one of those company-town connections that happen frequently in Washington, Baker said he was not just a contact or source for Corn; they were also old pals.

“Tell me about your relationship with David Corn,” said Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan.

“David is a friend of mine,” Baker said.

“Tell me about that. A close friend? Long-time friend?”

“Long-time friend.”

Jordan asked, “When did you first meet Mr. Corn?”

“I don't specifically remember,” Baker testified. “A long time ago, though.”

“Years ago? “

“Years and years and years ago, yeah,” Baker allowed. “Our kids carpooled together. We carpooled with them when our kids were little.”

So one of the most divisive scandals in Washington history was facilitated by an unexpected friendship, an odd couple brought together by a shared interest in getting their kids dropped off at school.

The congressman from Ohio wanted to know more about the Baker-Corn relationship: “Prior to the election of – Presidential election of 2016,” Jordan asked, “how many times did you talk with David Corn in the weeks and months prior to election day?”

“I don't remember,” Baker said, providing an answer that suggests it was more than a few.

“Is it fair to say you did” talk with Corn, Jordan asked?

“Yes, I did, but I just don't remember how many [times].”

“So did you talk to Mr. Corn about anything that the FBI was working on,” Jordan asked, “specifically the now infamous Steele dossier?”

Suddenly, Baker’s lawyer, Dan Levin, jumped in: “One second,” he said before he and his client had a conversation off the record.

When the microphones were back on, Levin declared he would “not let [Baker] answer these questions right now. You may or may not know, he's been the subject of a leak investigation which is still – a criminal leak investigation that's still active at the Justice Department.” And so Levin concluded, “I’m sorry. I'm cutting off any discussion about conversations with reporters.”

North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows wanted to make clear what Baker’s lawyer was claiming: “You're saying he's under criminal investigation? That's why you're not letting him answer?”

“Yes.”

Levin and the lawmakers sparred a bit over whether Baker was invoking his Fifth Amendment rights, and the congressmen finally got around to asking who was leading this criminal probe:

“There is an ongoing investigation by whom?” Jordan said.

“The Justice Department,” Levin responded.

“I mean, is the inspector general looking at this or is this—”

“No,” said Levin, “it's Mr. John Durham, a prosecutor.”

The specter of Durham haunts the rest of the interview. Baker can’t talk about what he told his old friend David Corn in their conversations about the dossier because it would put Baker in legal jeopardy.

Time and again, when Baker was asked questions about reporters – even hypothetical questions about FBI policy regarding contacts with the press, Levin said, “I'm not going to allow him to answer that question” or “I am not going let him answer any questions about leaks.”

“I don't want him talking about conversations he's had with reporters because I don't know what the questions are and I don't know what the answers are right now,” Levin said. “Given that there is an ongoing investigation of him for leaks which the Department has not closed, I'm not comfortable letting him answer questions.” Durham’s inquiry was serious enough to limit significantly what Baker was willing to talk about with lawmakers.

That Baker’s lawyer advised him not to talk about leaks is, of course, not proof that Baker leaked. ""Baker's lawyer was obviously being prudent and saying his client could not talk about anything related to any leaks of any kind,"" David Corn tells RealClearInvestigations. Corn emphasizes that the ""Durham inquiry did not involve Russia or the Steele memos; it had nothing to do with me or my limited interaction with Baker.""

And one former federal official who said he has been interviewed by Durham in connection with the Baker probe, Robert Litt, has written that the inquiry has nothing to do with the Steele dossier.

Contacted by RealClearInvestigations, Levin said, “Mr. Baker did not make an unauthorized disclosure of classified information and we are confident the investigation will conclude that.”

Interior published four months' worth of Bernhardt’s schedules to its website on Thursday, a day after he appeared before the House Natural Resources Committee.

While some entries released by the agency list the names of attendees at meetings, others only describe him as having a scheduled ""external meeting."" ADVERTISEMENT

One House Democrat called the Trump Cabinet member's schedules a ""fake calendar.""

Huffman, a member of the Natural Resources Committee, added, “This fake calendar only has details if something is politically useful - e.g. 'meeting w/ youth group.' How dumb does he think we are?”

Interior, when asked to respond to criticism of the entries, sent a letter from March 26 addressed to House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) explaining how the office maintains Bernhardt’s calendar.

Bernhardt’s calendars have been an ongoing source of criticism for the department. House Democrats have raised questions over whether the department’s use of Google Docs to maintain his calendar complies with recordkeeping laws.

Interior has offered conflicting information about how Bernhardt’s schedule is maintained, but in April acknowledged that some meetings with industry representatives were intentionally left off his calendar.

Aaron Weiss, deputy director at The Center for Western Priorities, a public lands advocacy group, argued that “it’s not an accident that they waited until the day after his hearing” to share the calendars.

“They’re playing a shell game with Bernhardt’s calendar to still have to avoid saying publicly what he’s working on and who he’s meeting with,” he said.

In San Diego on Friday, 100 migrants arrived for processing. It came one day after two south Florida counties were upset with a plan that would bring thousands of migrants there.

""We cannot accommodate in Florida just dumping unlawful migrants into our state,"" said Gov. Ron DeSantis. ""I think it'll tax our resources, the schools, healthcare, law enforcement, state agencies.""

CBS News reached out to the Department of Homeland Security and the White House, but neither has responded.

Florida officials have been told to expect two plane loads of migrants each week, up to 1,000 people a month, split between Palm Beach and Broward counties. Both are Democratic strongholds. The migrants do not face criminal charges but would likely be released into the community awaiting immigration hearings.

CBS News reporting found that 80% of the beds at the nation's largest detention center for immigrant families in Dilley, Texas were empty last month. But Brian Hastings, chief of law enforcement operations for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said they're overwhelmed.

""The crisis at hand is causing us to look at multiple different locations where we have capacity to process, to fly these individuals to, simply so we can process them into the system,"" Hastings said.

Florida has no designated shelters or government funding for food and security. Officials there have been told to expect migrants in about two weeks."
Lawmaker demands answers after a WW II veteran died from a head injury in a VA nursing home,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Donovan Slack', 'Published A.M. Et May']",05-17-2019,2019,5,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/05/17/veterans-affairs-nursing-home-death-lawmaker-wants-answers/3693551002/,"CLOSE Surveillance video captured the deadly blow to the head of 91-year-old James “Milt” Ferguson Sr. Specialists say it could have been prevented. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – Rep. Cindy Axne, D-Iowa, is demanding answers from the Department of Veterans Affairs about the death of a World War II veteran from a head injury at the VA nursing home in Des Moines, Iowa.

Axne wants to know why James “Milt” Ferguson Sr., a legally blind 91-year-old with dementia, wasn’t monitored more closely and what policies are in place to prevent a similar injury or death.

“No veterans or their family member should have to worry they will experience what Mr. Ferguson and his family experienced,” Axne wrote in a letter to the VA Thursday.

Her concern follows a USA TODAY investigation that chronicled Ferguson’s case and what specialists say was a concerning series of decisions by VA staff, before and after his deadly injury.

Ferguson was removed from one-on-one supervision, and he wandered into other residents' rooms repeatedly, medical records show. When he rolled his wheelchair into one room unsupervised Dec. 20, 2018, his son said VA staff told him the resident of the room flipped Ferguson backwards out of his wheelchair. He landed on his head, causing a massive brain bleed.

Nursing staff didn't report the incident for 40 minutes, according to the records and surveillance video. They didn't take him to the emergency room for more than two hours and he wasn't transferred to a trauma hospital until five hours after the fall. He died from the injury two days later.

In her letter to VA headquarters in Washington, Axne asked about resident supervision policies, and reporting and response procedures for accidents, including head injuries.

“The timeline of events raises concerns regarding patient monitoring and injury reporting procedures,” she wrote. “Our veterans deserve the highest standard of care, and they need to know that VA standards, policies and procedures are being met.”

VA national spokesman Curt Cashour said agency officials ""will respond to the representative directly."" He referred to an earlier statement from Des Moines VA spokesman Timothy Hippen that said a policy review after the “untimely death” concluded “all staff acted properly.""

In response to inquiries from USA TODAY, Hippen and Cashour have declined to say what policies are in place to prevent such traumatic injuries at the VA nursing home in Des Moines or elsewhere. More than 40,000 veterans rely on care each year at the VA’s 134 nursing home across the country.

Axne said in an interview Thursday that she had spoken with Ferguson’s son, and he “obviously still has questions and believes internal policies weren’t adequate.” She asked VA for responses to her questions within 30 days.

“I want to know how this happened so that we can make sure that it never happens again,” Axne said.

Ferguson was admitted to the acute psychiatry ward at the VA Medical Center in Des Moines in November after his dementia worsened. He had been in a private nursing home but became aggressive and wandered into other residents’ rooms. VA healthcare providers adjusted his medications and placed him on one-on-one observation with an aide to prevent him from straying into other rooms.

But on Dec. 11, 2018, staff removed the strict observation even though he was still determined to be a danger to himself and others, the medical records show.

He was transferred to the VA nursing home on the medical center’s campus the next day. Ferguson continued to enter other residents’ rooms repeatedly, but records show staff did not reinstate strict observation.

After the head injury at 3:49 p.m. Dec. 20, Ferguson wasn’t taken to the emergency room until about 6:30 p.m., and he wasn’t transferred to a trauma hospital until 8:55 p.m.

Hippen, the Des Moines VA spokesman, has declined to answer detailed questions about what happened. He said that in general, ""caring for nursing home residents involves balancing patients’ independence with the need for supervision, as appropriate.""

Ferguson’s son Jim said Thursday that he is grateful for Axne’s help in getting more answers about his father’s care.

“Now that I have had time to sit back and seen everything and thought about everything, I think, it’s horrible,” he said. “I hope they make changes.”

Treasury Official Hired to Fix Fannie and Freddie Is Leaving,https://www.nytimes.com,['Emily Flitter'],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/16/business/craig-phillips-treasury-fannie-mae-freddie-mac.html,"Investors snapped up Fannie’s and Freddie’s shares in anticipation. One of the big bettors was the hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, run by William A. Ackman, which first took a position in the shares in 2013. The fund held 116 million Fannie shares at the end of March, according to securities filings compiled by FactSet, a data provider. That position would currently be worth more than $300 million.

Shares of both Fannie and Freddie have more than doubled this year, although they are still far below their pre-crisis levels.

But overhauling Fannie and Freddie has proved to be a complicated and politically thorny endeavor. The Obama administration tried and failed. Congress is deeply divided on the issue, which has the potential to affect the lives and finances of tens of millions of Americans.

Trump administration officials have been trying to jump-start the overhaul efforts this year, but with limited results.

Mr. Phillips and other Treasury officials have been meeting with the biggest American banks to determine how best to raise capital for Fannie and Freddie — a prerequisite to releasing them from government control — as well as how the housing finance system might be restructured, according to two people who participated in the meetings.

Mark Calabria, the recently confirmed head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie and Freddie, said in a speech this week that he had the power to release the companies back into the private sector. But, he said, Congress would need to act to make such a plan viable by empowering the agency to better regulate the privatized companies.

Mr. Phillips is not the only confidant of Mr. Mnuchin on his way out.

US ATTORNEY JOHN DURHAM HAS BEEN REVIEWING ORIGINS OF RUSSIA PROBE 'FOR WEEKS:' SOURCE

On Monday, multiple outlets reported that Barr had appointed U.S. Attorney John Durham to examine the origins of the Russia investigation

A person familiar with the process told Fox News Tuesday that Durham has been working on his review “for weeks,” to probe ""all intelligence collection activities"" related to the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election.

The Russia investigation and Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report continue to be debated by Republicans and Democrats since its release last month.

In an interview that aired on Fox News Thursday, Barr explained that he is trying to get to the bottom of whether or not “government officials abused their power and put their thumb on the scale” during the early stages of the Russia probe.

Another Rule Trump Could Break: Primary Challengers Doom Incumbent Presidents,https://www.npr.org,['Jessica Taylor'],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/16/722230017/another-rule-trump-could-break-primary-challengers-doom-incumbent-presidents,"Another Rule Trump Could Break: Primary Challengers Doom Incumbent Presidents

Enlarge this image toggle caption Scott Eisen/Getty Images Scott Eisen/Getty Images

An incumbent president with a middling approval rating and mounting controversies is usually an easy draw for primary challengers.

Look to Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush. All three presidents survived intraparty battles, but those primary fights left their reelection campaigns so hobbled — exposing longstanding weaknesses with their bases — that each went on to lose out on four more years in the White House.

But even if a viable GOP challenger to President Trump does emerge, it's unlikely he or she could make much headway or have a lasting impact on the president's chances in November. That's because Trump's firm grasp on the Republican Party could help him emerge not only victorious, but relatively unscathed by a primary challenge.

Political polarization is higher than ever, according to Princeton University professor of history and public affairs Julian Zelizer. And the slice of the electorate that likes Trump isn't budging, no matter what the president may say or do. Meanwhile, those who don't like him are resolute in their disdain, leaving a smaller block of persuadable voters than there were in previous elections.

""Trump has essentially remade the Republican Party in his image,"" said Zelizer. ""So many people aren't going to believe anything that the Mueller report says, and they take whatever Trump says as gospel. That just to me is another stumbling block that you probably didn't have in a post-Watergate era.""

In 1976, President Gerald Ford was already in a debilitated position. The Republican was an incumbent that had never been elected president (or even vice president) and was uniquely challenged in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal, President Richard Nixon's resignation and his own subsequent controversial pardon of Nixon. So it's not surprising former California Gov. Ronald Reagan mounted a near-upset bid against him.

During the primaries, momentum swung back and forth between the two GOP candidates. The first ballot of voting at the 1976 Republican National Convention was razor-thin: 1,187 delegates for Ford and 1,070 for Reagan, just a 117 vote difference. But Ford did narrowly clear the 1,130 delegates needed to secure the nomination. Such a fractious ending would prove prescient months later as he lost to former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter, netting 240 electoral votes to the Democrat's 297.

Four years later amid a sagging economy and the hostage crisis in Iran, Carter himself would be hamstrung as he sought a second term. Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy, whose brothers had both sought the presidency, saw an opening. But despite strong numbers at the outset of the primary, Kennedy would peter out as his personal scandals surfaced and Carter simply out-organized him. Their fight would continue through 1980 Democratic convention though, where Kennedy, having finished with just over a third of the primary votes, admitted he couldn't win.

The famous not-really-a-concession speech Kennedy gave at the New York City convention laid out his own idealistic vision rather than trying to boost Carter.

""For me, a few hours ago, this campaign came to an end,"" the political scion told the crowd. ""For all those whose cares have been our concern, the work goes on. The cause endures. The hope still lives. And the dream shall never die.""

As a result, it was Kennedy who got the raucous applause and seemed like the hero of the 1980 DNC, not the incumbent president who had actually won the nomination. Facing a renewed Reagan in the general election, Carter was walloped, winning just 49 electoral votes to the Republican's 489.

Perhaps it's President George H.W. Bush's re-election battle that best foreshadowed the era of Trump. The former vice president and CIA director saw sky high approval numbers in the aftermath of the Gulf War. But the economy would slow, giving conservative commentator Pat Buchanan a divide he could exploit by waging a bid based on fighting the ""culture wars.""

Buchanan would falter and end up taking less than a quarter of the primary vote away from Bush, and billionaire Ross Perot running as an independent in the general election also deeply harmed the incumbent's chances. But there was an anti-establishment vein within the GOP Buchanan may have helped awaken. It might have taken decades to fully manifest, but many saw Trump as the eventual embodiment of what Buchanan helped to shape.

History doesn't always repeat itself

Trump seems to have a stronghold on his party that no candidate can shake. As Barbara Perry, director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia's Miller Center put it, Trump has simply proven, time and time again, ""that all previous rules do not apply.""

""When we look back at the lessons of history, they may repeat themselves, but they haven't so far,"" Perry said. ""He may get a challenge by either a strong gadfly or a strong personality or a strong presence in the party,"" just as Ronald Reagan was to Ford in 1976 and Ted Kennedy was to Carter in 1980. ""But I don't see that person on the horizon.""

There are some possible challengers emerging to Trump, but Perry is right that less than nine months before the nominating process begins, no Republican has stood out as a formidable alternative.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld is the only major announced candidate so far after running for vice president on the Libertarian Party ticket in 2016 along with former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson. But Weld certainly doesn't seem to have the heft of past White House challengers that could irrevocably damage a sitting president.

Some of the potential heavyweights who are still mulling bids include former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who also sought the GOP nomination last time, and popular centrist Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who's already made some early state moves.

Frequent Trump agitators like former Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake and former Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker were also floated early on. Flake has since ruled out a 2020 run, but the recently retired Corker still sounds open, saying recently that Trump ""purposely seeks to divide"" the American people and someone should challenge him.

""Philosophically, you could look at it and say that it would be a good thing for our country should that occur,"" Corker said during the TIME 100 Summit last month. ""If you had a real primary, where you had someone that was really being listened to, and of substance, things that we were talking about — and I could go through a list of them — they would actually be debated in a real way.""

There might once have been other names on that list — prominent 2016 doubters like South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham or former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. Despite their blistering criticism almost four years ago toward the polarizing reality TV show host and businessman, they too have come around and been loyal allies of Trump in the case of Graham, or a onetime part of his administration, with Haley serving as UN ambassador until last year.

The president's poll numbers reflect the waning influence of the once vocal critics may have had within the party — winning over converts, even if he may have polarized more independent voters.

The most recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey shows a staggering 90 percent of Republicans approve of the job Trump has done, leaving little room for a challenger to grab a foothold. And for now, there's no GOP option who seems like they could truly compete with Trump, given the unprecedented way he has tried to centralize the Republican National Committee around his re-election bid and ward off a primary challenge.

Tribalism is a force that Corker also lamented, saying at the TIME event that Trump ""has an unusually visceral contact with the Republican base as it's made up today... That's in some ways where the electorate is today, where it has become very tribal in nature."""

Up Next × SHARE COPY LINK For hundreds of thousands of years, wild ocean salmon have been coming to the Pacific Northwest. Now, their existence is under threat, along with the communities they support.

Manke Lumber has agreed to settle allegations it violated the Clean Water Act at its Tacoma Tideflats facility, the Environmental Protection Agency said Monday.

Manke will pay a $320,000 penalty and build a treatment system to fix water quality violations, the EPA said.

The company will also invest in a project that will designate 38 acres of undeveloped land for conservation and recreation in Mason County. That includes 1,500 feet of Goldsborough Creek, 580 feet of a tributary and a 20-acre riparian corridor.





The project will provide good salmon-spawning habitat and will keep pollution away from the creek, the EPA said.

“Wastewater from lumber yards typically contains high pH, wood debris, oils and high levels of solids,” the EPA said in a press release about the settlement. “When these solids settle, they can form sediment deposits that destroy plant life and spawning grounds of fish.”

The News Tribune left a message Monday seeking comment from Manke’s attorney.

A complaint the EPA filed about two years ago in U.S. District Court in Tacoma alleged that Manke violated the Clean Water Act by sending polluted water into the Hylebos Waterway, without a proper permit.

The stormwater and wastewater at the facility comes into contact with sawdust, chemicals and metals, the agency found.

The EPA’s complaint asked the court to fine Manke more than $50,000 a day for some violations.

The agency didn’t say what that would have added up to.

“This settlement means less stormwater pollution and more salmon habitat for Puget Sound,” EPA Regional Administrator Chris Hladick said in the news release. “By upgrading and improving their stormwater controls and restoring habitat, Manke is investing in the future. Reducing stormwater pollution furthers our work to protect and restore Puget Sound.”

The public will have 30 days to comment on the agreement at justice.gov/enrd/consent-decrees, once it’s filed in federal court.

In addition to Tacoma, Manke has offices in Sumner and Shelton. Its 400 Pierce County workers made it the county’s 52nd-largest employer in 2016, according to the Economic Development Board for Tacoma-Pierce County."

The Trump administration is trying to persuade DHS cybersecurity experts to go on 'short-term deployments' to the US-Mexico border despite election interference concerns,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Katie Warren'],05-18-2019,2019,5,https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-administration-trying-send-cybersecurity-experts-to-mexico-border-2019-5,"The Trump administration is trying to persuade cybersecurity staffers from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to go on ""short-term deployments"" to the US-Mexico border because of the ""ongoing surge of migrants,"" according to an email obtained by The Daily Beast.

In an email to employees on Friday, the deputy director of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) urged staffers to think about volunteering for a ""short-term deployment to the southern border,"" due to the ""ongoing surge of migrants,"" The Daily Beast reported. These deployments would last between 30 and 45 days.

This comes after an earlier request for volunteers failed to garner enough volunteers.

""It is never easy to ask colleagues to take on extra challenges, but as DHS employees, serving the needs of the homeland is the cornerstone of what we do,"" Matthew Travis, CISA deputy director, wrote to DHS employees. ""If it is in your capacity to deploy, please give serious thought to volunteering.""

The request for volunteers comes at a time when cybersecurity — particularly election interference — is a top concern.

Former Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano Kevin Reilly/Business Insider

In a recent interview with INSIDER's politics editor Anthony Fisher, former DHS secretary Janet Napolitano said cybersecurity is one of the three key issues today for homeland security, along with climate change and mass gun violence.

Napolitano cited evidence that Russia interfered in the 2016 US presidential election.

""If a foreign country, an adversary, is directly interfering in our elections, that's a homeland security issue,"" she told INSIDER.

Napolitano said that today, we're in a stage with cybersecurity ""where there are red flags all over the place, where infiltration's and hacks are being detected. Some by state actors, some by nonstate actors.""

Potential election interference by Russia is an ongoing concern, according to the FBI, whose director last month called it a ""significant counterintelligence threat.""

In the DHS, cybersecurity has taken a backseat to border security.

In April, President Trump named Kevin McAleenan, a top immigration officer, to the position of Acting Homeland Security Secretary. As the Customs and Border Protection Commissioner, McAleenan was a key player in Trump's controversial separation of immigrant families at the southern border.

And during a recent subcommittee hearing on the DHS's FY2020 budget proposal, cybersecurity issues were only briefly addressed and ""quickly overshadowed by sharp questions about immigration and border protection policy,"" according to federal technology news site MeriTalk.

DHS staffers are not the only ones who will be taken off their daily duties to assist at the southern border. Hundreds of Transportation Security Administration (TSA) employees will be sent to the border this summer, not to perform immigration duties at ports of entry, but to help in areas like meal distribution, legal support, transportation, and personal property management, as Business Insider's Mark Matousek previously reported."

The news of Phillips’ pending departure was first reported by the New York Times, which reported Thursday that Phillips told Treasury department employees that he plans to leave the government next month.

According to the New York Times report, Phillips said he is planning to return to the private sector on Wall Street, but does not have a job lined up yet.

Phillips joined the administration in 2017, signing on as Mnuchin’s top housing advisor after leaving BlackRock. At Blackrock, Phillips served as head of financial markets advisory and client solutions.

According to Phillips’ BlackRock bio, he joined the company in 2008. Previously, Phillips served as a managing director of Morgan Stanley from 1994 to 2006. While at Morgan Stanley, he worked in the company’s Fixed Income division, and was responsible for oversight of its global Securitized Products Group.

The New York Times describes Phillips as a “veteran Wall Street mortgage trader,” and it was believed that his mortgage-related experience would help the administration pursue GSE reform.

While at the Treasury, Phillips represented the administration on housing matters, speaking on multiple occasions about the administration’s plans for housing finance reform.

Last year, for example, Phillips told the crowd at the Mortgage Bankers Association 2018 Annual Conference in Washington, D.C., that the Trump administration is working to end the conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie.

“The administration advocates ending the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and returning them to private ownership,” Phillips said last year. “Their charters should be removed from statute and their operations should be overseen by the primary regulator that has the authority to approve additional guarantors to introduce competition into the secondary mortgage market.”

Phillips added that the administration is hoping to see “more level playing field” between the private sector and government-backed enterprises like Fannie and Freddie.

But now, despite the presence of a Trump administration appointee now leading the Federal Housing Finance Agency (one who’s talked openly about plans for GSE reform), Phillips is said to be leaving.

“Craig Phillips has served the Treasury Department since the beginning of this administration and has been incredibly effective in his role as counselor to Secretary Mnuchin,” Treasury Department spokesperson Devin O’Malley told the New York Times. “In addition to managing the extensive domestic finance portfolio, Craig led the department’s efforts that produced significant financial regulatory reform.”"
China's Huawei restricted from using U.S. suppliers,https://www.reuters.com,"['David Shepardson', 'Min Read']",05-17-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-huawei-tech-commerce/us-commerce-department-publishes-huawei-export-blacklist-order-idUSKCN1SM2MG,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Thursday officially added China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd to a trade blacklist, immediately enacting restrictions that will make it extremely difficult for the telecom giant to do business with U.S. companies.

The logo of Huawei is seen at the high profile startups and high tech leaders gathering, Viva Tech,in Paris, France May 16, 2019. REUTERS/Charles Platiau

The Commerce Department issued a rule, promised on Wednesday, putting Huawei and 68 affiliates in more than two dozen countries on its so-called Entity List, a move that bans the company from buying parts and components from American firms without U.S. government approval.

Obtaining such approval will not be easy. The U.S. government will review license applications under a “policy of presumption of denial,” according to a posting on the Federal Register.

The order takes effect immediately, a Commerce Department spokesman said, although it will not be formally published in the Federal Register until Tuesday.

Huawei, the world’s largest telecommunications equipment maker, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The action comes as the world’s two largest economies ratchet up tariffs in a battle over what U.S. officials call China’s unfair trade practices.

In a one-two punch, the order came a day after President Donald Trump signed an executive order declaring a national emergency and barring U.S. companies from using telecommunications equipment made by firms posing a national security risk.

The United States believes Huawei’s smartphones and network equipment could be used by China to spy on Americans, allegations the company has repeatedly denied.

The Commerce Department first gave notice on Wednesday that it was adding Huawei to the list.

Huawei has been “involved in activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States,” the order says.

As an example, the order cites a criminal case pending against the company in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, over allegations Huawei violated U.S. sanctions against Iran. Huawei has pleaded not guilty in the case.

It notes that the indictment also accuses Huawei of “deceptive and obstructive acts.”

Members of Congress and administration officials said the move would make it difficult for Huawei to sell many products because of its dependence on U.S. suppliers.

COLLATERAL DAMAGE?

Washington lawyer Douglas Jacobson, a trade expert, said there would be collateral impact on the U.S. companies that sell to Huawei.

“While the intent is to punish Huawei, ultimately U.S. companies are also being penalized,” Jacobson said.

Analysts cut price targets on several microchip companies, including Xilinx Inc. Shares of Xilinx closed down 7.3 percent, while those of rival chipmaker Qualcomm Inc fell 4 percent.

Given the order, the likelihood that Commerce will grant licenses to allow sales is negligible, Jacobson said.

Still, history shows the government could offer reprieves. In 2016, Huawei’s smaller rival ZTE Corp was added to the entity list over allegations it organized an elaborate scheme to hide its re-export of U.S. items to sanctioned countries.

U.S. companies were prohibited from selling parts and components to ZTE for about two weeks, before the Commerce Department issued a series of temporary general licenses that allowed the company to continue to do business with U.S. suppliers until it agreed to a plea deal a year later.

The saga of ZTE did not end there. In April 2018, the Commerce Department slapped a ban on American companies selling components to ZTE after accusing it of breaking an agreement, leading ZTE to cease major operations until it struck a new deal last summer."

Design and construction of a grid storage “launchpad” at the Pacific Northwest National Lab that would allow teams to test and evaluate new advanced storage technologies

Yes, but: The DOE’s energy storage initiatives do not address other challenges to implementation, including obstructive or unclear state policies.

The outcomes of evolving proceedings in the wake of FERC Order 841 — which requires wholesale power markets to develop rules that allow energy storage resources to participate — could affect the program's success. Some regional transmission organizations are already asking for extensions to FERC compliance deadlines for crafting storage policies.

Watch to watch: The DOE is requesting $5 million to build the launchpad, an expenditure it will partially offset with a $2.5 million reduction in research spending elsewhere.

While these numbers are rounding errors in the context of DOE’s $2.3 billion request for energy innovation and independence programs, the case for this swap will still need to be made to Congress.

Why do women military vets avoid using VA benefits?,https://medicalxpress.com,"['Elizabeth Evans', 'University Of Massachusetts Amherst']",,,,https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-05-women-military-vets-va-benefits.html,"UMass Amherst epidemiology researcher in the School of Public Health and Health Sciences. Credit: UMass Amherst

Many women military veterans turn to the Veterans Administration (VA) for health care and social services only as a ""last resort"" or ""safety net,"" typically for an emergency or catastrophic health event, or when private health insurance is unaffordable.

While most previous research has looked at women vets who use VA services, University of Massachusetts Amherst epidemiology researcher Elizabeth Evans, along with researchers from the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System and UCLA's Geffen School of Medicine, focused on women vets who sought all or some of their health care outside the VA context. They wanted to find out why women chose non-VA providers and what can be done to address barriers to care.

""Health care is a great perk for veterans, but women vets are intentionally choosing not to use their VA benefits,"" says Evans, whose interest in the issue began when she was an advanced postdoctoral research fellow with the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs in Los Angeles in 2016.

In a paper published in the Journal of Humanistic Psychology, the researchers identified themes and described factors affecting women vets' use, or lack of use, of VA-provided health care. The study concludes, ""Findings can inform improvements to VA health care design and delivery, thereby bolstering aspects of VA care that women veterans value, while reducing health care utilization barriers.""

Between 2013 and 2015, researchers conducted in-person interviews with 22 women veterans, age 29 to 57, in Los Angeles who had received some health care not provided by the VA. Factors that deterred women veterans from using VA services included:

Poor connections to VA services during and after military service and bureaucratic hurdles that prevent women vets from receiving care;

Limited knowledge and inaccurate beliefs among women about eligibility for VA services;

VA environments triggering women's memories of combat experiences, military sexual assault and other negative military experiences; and

Perceptions of VA settings as unsafe, ill-equipped to address addiction and insensitive to the needs and preferences of women, including too little capacity for preventive and holistic care.

While the VA in recent years has made efforts to address underuse of benefits by women, a 2015 profile of women veterans by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs found that fewer than one in three women vets used VA health care.

Some vets interviewed said they were uncomfortable returning to a military-like setting for health care, especially if they had experiences of trauma, such as a sexual assault, while serving. Women disliked being treated in contexts that felt more like a military base than a health care setting, the use of military-specific language by health care professionals, and some health care providers' emphasis on military-style structure during the delivery of services. ""There are small and big things that could be changed to make it a more welcoming environment for women veterans,"" Evans says.

Some women vets described the VA health care settings as understaffed, male-dominated and inexperienced with treating women vets, especially those with combat-related trauma.

On the other hand, some women vets also identified qualities and characteristics of VA settings that were healing and appreciated, including peer social support and proactive caregivers who focus on whole health and well-being, as well as social service needs, and follow up to ensure patients get the care they need.

Evans says the VA is working to remake their health care delivery system to attract more women vets. ""We can make the VA women veterans' first choice for health care,"" she says, ""but changes are needed. Our study findings point to a few places to start.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Pete Marovich/Getty Images Pete Marovich/Getty Images

Scott Pruitt, the former head of the Environmental Protection Agency, and his staff spent roughly $124,000 in excessive travel costs during a ten-month period, according to a new report from EPA's internal watchdog.

Pruitt, who resigned from EPA almost a year ago amidst a litany of ethics allegations, and his personal security detail flew in first or business class ""without sufficient justification and, initially without appropriate approval authority,"" the report says.

The EPA's Office of the Inspector General recommended that the agency consider recovering the estimated $123,942 in excessive costs.

In a statement, the EPA says it believes that it complied with federal travel regulations, ""making cost recovery inappropriate.""

The audit reviewed 40 trips, including six canceled ones, that Pruitt planned or took in 2017. Nearly half of those trips stopped in, or were to, Tulsa, Okla., where Pruitt maintained a personal residence while he was the nation's top environmental steward. The report found ""missing detailed support"" for some of those trips.

The travel during that ten-month period cost taxpayers almost $1 million.

Pruitt's 24-hour security detail ate up most of that money. In a previous audit, EPA's inspector general found that the agency spent twice as much protecting Pruitt as it did his predecessor.

The EPA and Pruitt, who now works as a consultant for coal companies, said those protections were necessary because of personal threats against the former-administrator.

During his 16-month stint as head of the EPA, Pruitt's security costs, travel and other actions drew criticism from his predecessors, Democrats, environmental groups and even some Republican lawmakers.

The EPA's inspector general says the office received numerous congressional requests and hotline complaints about Pruitt's travel. The new report came as a result of those.

In addition to first-class travel, the audit found that lodging expenses exceeded per diem limits during some of Pruitt's travel as well. There was also inaccurate or incomplete reports for international travel.

Pruitt is not the first member of the Trump administration to be questioned about his travel on the taxpayer dime.

Tom Price, the former head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, broke federal rules on using chartered and military planes for government travel. Price resigned amidst controversy over that, as President Trump complained that he ""didn't like the optics"" of using taxpayer-funded charter flights.

A report by the Interior Department's inspector general found that former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke violated the agency's travel policy by having his wife travel with him in government vehicles.

The EPA's watchdog says that actions are needed to strengthen controls over travel at the agency to ""prevent fraud, waste and abuse."""
"Education Department hinders policing of student loans, consumer agency says",https://www.politico.com,['Michael Stratford'],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/16/student-loans-education-department-1447485,"Kathy Kraninger, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau director, made the disclosure in a letter to Democratic senators released on Thursday. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo education Education Department hinders policing of student loans, consumer agency says

The head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau says the Education Department is impeding access to information that regulators need to oversee the nation’s largest student loan servicing companies.

Kathy Kraninger, the CFPB director, made the disclosure in a letter to Democratic senators released on Thursday by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who has accused the bureau of abandoning its responsibility to police companies that collect payments from student loan borrowers.

Kraninger said that “student loan servicers have declined to produce information requested by the Bureau for supervisory examinations” related to federal student loans, based on a December 2017 directive from the Education Department. The department is headed by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.

The CFPB “has pursued options that would have permitted it to obtain” the information it needs to supervise student loan servicers, Kraninger said in the letter, but she didn’t say whether those options had been successful. The letter was first reported by NPR.

Warren, a 2020 presidential candidate, as well as Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and other Senate Democrats called Kraninger’s disclosure “disturbing news” in a letter to student loan servicers.

The senators said the Education Department had “removed a key weapon from CFPB's arsenal to fight illegal behavior and mistreatment of borrowers by student loan servicers.” They also expressed concern that “federal student loan servicers, who are paid by the federal government, are ignoring federal regulators' request for information.”

The CFPB has the authority to supervise large student loan servicing companies, regardless of whether they collect private student loans or federal student loans. That has long created tension between the Education Department and the CFPB over student loans.

The Education Department policy cited by Kraninger, first reported by POLITICO last year, orders federal student loan servicers to refuse requests for information from third parties like state attorneys general or the CFPB. The policy says those requests must instead be funneled through Education Department officials in order to comply with federal privacy laws.

The policy has been at the center of ongoing disputes between DeVos and state attorneys general seeking to investigate or take legal action against student loan servicers. DeVos has argued that her agency provides adequate oversight over the companies, rejecting efforts by state regulators to police the industry.

Liz Hill, an Education Department spokesperson, said in a statement that the agency “cooperates fully with federal law enforcement officials on matters related to the federal student aid programs.”

Hill said the policy prohibiting student loan servicers from responding directly to information requests by the CFPB or other regulators is about protecting the privacy of loan borrowers. Such requests for information “should be made to the Department, where they will be evaluated for compliance with the Privacy Act,” she said.

The Education Department has previously refused to say how many of those information requests it receives — and whether or not it has granted them. Senate appropriators last year directed the department to publicly disclose those decisions, but the department has declined to do so.

Court records reviewed by POLITICO last year showed that the Education Department had also turned down requests for student loan records made directly by state attorneys general.

The department last year also refused a request for information by the CFPB for information about Navient in connection with CFPB's massive lawsuit against the student loan servicer.

The CFPB said at the time that the Education Department was refusing to give permission for Navient to turn over a trove of documents relating to how the company collects and manages the payments of federal student loan borrowers.

A federal judge ultimately sided with the CFPB in the dispute. He ruled that Navient “cannot assert that the records may ultimately belong to the Department of Education or use the Privacy Act to shield the requested borrower documents” from the CFPB’s requests.

"US non-essential personnel ordered to leave Iraq Embassy, consulate",https://www.foxnews.com,['Brie Stimson'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/state-department-orders-all-non-essential-personnel-to-leave-iraq,"The State Department has ordered all non-emergency personnel at the U.S. Embassy and consulate in Iraq to leave the country amid rising tensions between the U.S. and Iran.

The announcement was made in a security alert on its website early Wednesday morning. The alert also said that normal visa services would be temporarily suspended.

This comes amid a standoff between the U.S. and Iran, which has recently threatened to pull out of the nuclear deal and resume higher uranium enrichment if no new deal is put in place.

The move coincided with Germany's decision on Tuesday to suspend training of Iraqi soldiers due to tensions in the region, though the government indicated no specific threats to its own troops.

German Defense Ministry spokesman Jens Flosdorff says that Germany is “orienting itself toward our partner countries, which have taken this step.”

The country currently has about 160 German soldiers in Iraq as part of the fight against ISIS, about 60 of them at a base north of Baghdad where Iraqi forces are being trained.

IRANIAN PRESIDENTIAL AIDE SAYS TRUMP WILL 'GET A WAR' FOR LISTENING TO 'THE MUSTACHE' JOHN BOLTON

Trump warned Iran on Monday afternoon that it will “suffer greatly” if the country does “anything” in the form of an attack, a remark that came in the wake of revelations that U.S. military experts suggested “Iran or its proxies” damaged four commercial ships off the coast of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Sunday.

This also came just days before the regime warned it easily could destroy a naval fleet sent by the United States in order to ward off a potential threat to U.S. commercial interests.

“Their billion[-dollar] fleet can be destroyed with one missile,” Ayatollah Tabatabai-Nejad said, according to Reuters.

“If they attempt any move, they will ... [face] dozens of missiles because at that time [government] officials won't be in charge to act cautiously, but instead things will be in the hands of our beloved leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,” he warned.

GEN. JACK KEANE SAYS REPORT TRUMP HAS UPDATED PLANS TO SEND 100,000 TROOPS TO IRAN IS 'DISTORTION OF WHAT REALLY HAPPENS'

Last week, U.S. officials said urgent ""credible threats"" from Iran against Americans were detected and the embassy advised against all travel to the region, citing “heightened tensions.”

The president denied Tuesday the reports that the administration was planning to send more than 100,000 troops to the region in the wake of the war with Iran, but adding, “Would I do that? Absolutely ... If we did that, we’d send a hell of a lot more troops than that.”

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo backed the president's claim, saying ""We fundamentally do not seek war with Iran, we’re looking for the regime to simply stop conducting assassination campaigns throughout Europe,” he said Tuesday in the seaside resort of Sochi, Russia.

Iran's Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also downplayed the escalation. Iran's state TV quoted Khamenei on Tuesday as calling negotiations with the U.S. ""poison"" and saying: ""This is not a military confrontation, because no war is going to happen.""

Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters, said: ""Neither we, nor they are seeking war, they know that it is not to their benefit.""

Iranian state media reported Wednesday however that Khamenei followed up these remarks by saying it wouldn't be difficult for the Islamic Republic to enrich uranium to weapons-grade levels amid rising tensions with the U.S., state media reported Wednesday.
