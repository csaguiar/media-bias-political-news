Here's why members of the House GOP keep abandoning ship,https://www.cnn.com,"['Analysis Chris Cillizza', 'Cnn Editor-At-Large']",08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/26/politics/sean-duffy-republican-retirements/index.html,"(CNN) On Monday, Wisconsin Rep. Sean Duffy became the twelfth House Republican to announce he would not seek reelection in 2020, a telling indication of the struggles within the minority party in the House as it grapples with a decided lack of legislative power and the electoral uncertainties created by President Donald Trump.

Although the 2020 election is still more than 14 months away, there are already four times as many Republicans leaving the House as there are Democrats. As interesting, only two of the 12 Republicans who have announced they are either retiring at the end of their terms or, in Duffy's case, resigning before their terms end, are leaving to run for higher office. The other 10 are simply walking away from politics entirely -- at least for the next two years.

Duffy, in announcing his decision via Facebook, cited personal reasons for why he is leaving Congress now.

""Recently, we've learned that our baby, due in late October, will need even more love, time, and attention due to complications, including a heart condition,"" wrote Duffy . ""With much prayer, I have decided that this is the right time for me to take a break from public service in order to be the support my wife, baby and family need right now.""

Which makes all the sense in the world.

But it's also worth noting that Duffy, who is in his fourth term representing the sprawling northern Wisconsin 7th district, had been regarded since his election in 2010 as a rising star within the party who had managed to build close relationships with both former House Speaker Paul Ryan and tne President. He has been courted as a potential Senate candidate in 2018 (he declined to run) and was seen as a potential Senate candidate if Sen. Ron Johnson retires in 2022. (While a 2022 statewide race could be on the table for Duffy, it's hard to argue he's better off stepping away from politics for several years prior to such a bid.)

Duffy's decision also doesn't come in a vacuum.

It's easy -- but overly facile -- to lump all of the Republican retirement decisions into a single explanation. Like the rest of us, members of Congress make decisions about their futures for all sorts of reasons -- and very rarely for one reason alone. But when you look across the landscape of the GOP retirements to date, a few obvious observations can be made about what it's like being a House Republican in Donald Trump's Washington -- and why there has been this spate of retirements.

1) Being in the House minority sucks

Take Duffy. He was elected in the 2010 election, part of the class that helped Republicans take back the House majority. He spent his first six years in office not just as a member of the majority party in the House but also someone who had the ear of the speaker. The 2018 election handed power back to Democrats and Ryan retired. Which is a pretty big blow for someone like Duffy.

Ask any member of Congress who has spent time in the House majority and the minority the difference between the two and they will tell you is is the size of the Grand Canyon. As a member of the House minority, you are almost totally powerless to proactively move any sort of legislation; your wins, such as they are, are focused on gumming up the procedural working of the House -- moves that the average American has zero idea you are even doing.

There's a reason that following the Republican takeover of the House in 1994 and the Democratic takeover of the House in 2006, two dozen members of the newly minted minority party retired in each of the following elections.

2) Trump's hostile takeover of the GOP matters

When Rep. Will Hurd (Texas) was elected to his border district in 2014, the idea of Trump being elected to anything -- much less being the President and head of the GOP -- was the stuff of dismissed reality TV series. Hurd won his seat by casting himself as a George W. Bush Republican (he served in the CIA for the entirety of Bush's eight years in office), someone who focused less on party than shared values. He won a considerable percentage of the Hispanic vote in his race, a necessity in a seat that is almost 70% Latino. And he focused on burnishing his bipartisan credentials while in office -- most notably by driving from Texas to Washington, DC, with Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke

Then along came Trump, casting Mexico as sending rapists and criminals to the United States and pledging to build a wall along the southern border. That take on what it meant (and means) to be a Republican ran directly counter to Hurd's vision. And as Trump has made clear on many occasions, he doesn't like when GOP elected officials disagree with his vision for the party -- and he is willing to punish those who step out of line.

Given those options, retirement starts to look a lot more appealing to someone like Hurd.

3) Electoral (and demographic) reality sinks in

Of the dozen Republican retirements, only one seat -- Hurd's -- is seen as a pure ""toss up"" based on presidential performance figures from the Cook Political Report , a non-partisan handicapping site. But in several other places, the changing demographics of the districts coupled with voter distaste for Trump makes for a potentially toxic political brew. In Georgia's 7th district, a suburban Atlanta seat, Rep. Rob Woodall (R) won by 20 points in 2016. Two years later, he eked by with a margin of just over 400 votes. In Texas' 22nd district, which encompasses major parts of the Houston suburbs, Rep. Pete Olson (R) won by 19 points in 2016. That margin shrunk to less than 5 points in the 2018 midterms.

If you are Woodall or Olson, what sounds better: Retiring after a few terms or losing a hugely expensive, negative and time-consuming re-election race? Right.

Again, no two House retirements are exactly the same -- and all of them are influenced by personal factors. But when this many House Republicans in these districts announce this early that they aren't running again (and they aren't running for any higher office) it's a telling indicator of the fact that all is not well for congressional GOPers."

BIARRITZ, France — The divisions were laid bare on the first day, when President Donald Trump insisted to U.S. allies at an opening dinner for the G-7 summit that Russia belongs back in the elite group of leading nations and then bluntly informed his French counterpart they do not see eye-to-eye on Iran.

But by the end of Day Three, Trump was having a kumbaya moment in public. “There’s been no fights or arguments. No anything. There’s been great unity here. The papers haven’t reported how great it’s been,” he told reporters at his midday meeting Monday with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Story Continued Below

That was the pattern Trump followed for most of his three-day visit to southwestern France, where only the coastal winds rivaled the breakneck pace of vague and vacillating statements on pressing issues including North Korea, Iran, the environment and trade. The president at times sought to placate allies with assurances that he would work with them to broker trade deals or find areas of compromise despite firmly established differences.

It was typical Trump on display on the world stage, refusing to be boxed in by anyone on anything. The president’s meandering statements and conflicting remarks left aides and allies alike guessing at his intended course of action — and his critics reviving questions about his fitness for office.

“Sorry, it’s the way I negotiate,” Trump shot back at a reporter during Monday’s press conference when questioned about whether there’s an actual strategy behind his constant back-and-forth on his positions regarding trade with China.

“It has done very well for me over the years,” Trump said. “It’s doing even better for the country.”

The G-7 followed a week in which the president flip-flopped positions — often within a day — on China tariffs, gun restrictions, purchasing Greenland, tax cuts to fight a potential recession and more. The uncertainty flowing from the president triggered tremors in markets and questions from politicians and business executives about where the president seemed to be taking the world’s largest economy.

Earlier in the day, Trump had showered Chinese President Xi Jinping with praise, calling him “a great leader” and declaring that he and Beijing were ready — and eager — to return to the negotiating table. But less than 24 hours prior, Trump aides were forced to do damage control after he publicly suggested he may be having second thoughts on his tariff war China.

He only meant that he regretted “not raising the tariffs higher,” White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham later said.

From China and Iran to climate change and North Korea’s weapons testing, Trump spent the summit dancing between positions that endeared himself to his fellow leaders and positions that faithfully represented his “America First” approach — leaving observers to wonder whether he was keeping his options open, or simply making decisions on the fly without advance planning.

Never was the dithering more evident than during Trump’s interactions with French President Emmanuel Macron. The host of this year’s summit has positioned himself as a champion of multilateralism, offering a sharp contrast to Trump’s economic nationalism and scorn for global coordination.

In a move that angered some White House officials, Macron swept Trump off to lunch within an hour of his arrival in Biarritz, telling reporters before the pair was left to dine alone that their agenda for the weekend included topics like climate change, gender equality and the raging Amazon wildfires.

Administration officials, who complained that the president was cornered by his French counterpart, were caught off guard when Trump tweeted afterward that his lunch with Macron was “the best meeting we have had yet.”

“Progress being made!” he wrote.

But two days later, Trump skipped a working session on climate change — an issue some of his advisers had described as too “niche” for the G-7, a group whose original mission was to address pressing economic concerns. And when the president was asked hours later to share his views on climate change, his response couldn’t have put more daylight between him and Macron.

“I feel that the United States has tremendous wealth, the wealth is under its feet … I’m not going to lose that wealth on dreams, on windmills, which, frankly, aren’t working too well,” Trump said.

In a similar fashion, Trump told Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe he understood his concerns about North Korea’s latest short-term missile launches. “I’m not happy about it,” Trump said, sitting next to Abe in a bilateral meeting on Sunday.

The next day, however, when he and Macron fielded questions from French and American reporters, Trump returned to his flattery of the North Korean leader, who he’s met twice. ”Kim Jong Un, who I’ve gotten to know extremely well … he is a man with a country that has tremendous potential,” Trump said.

He continued, “I think that North Korea has tremendous economic potential and I think that Kim Jong Un sees that he would be the leader and I think he sees the tremendous potential that it’s got.”

Even with the looming threat of a potential reversal, sometimes Trump’s charm offensive worked.

“On the digital tax, we have reached a deal to get beyond the difficulties we had between us,” Macron said Monday, referring to a revenue-based tax on tech giants that had infuriated administration officials.

And later Monday evening, French officials released a joint declaration on trade, Iran, Ukraine, Libya and Hong Kong — a document that seemed out of the question at the beginning of the summit, when French and U.S. officials offered conflicting accounts of why Macron had scrapped the joint communiqué that usually accompanies these gatherings.

“The G-7 organized in Biarritz by France was able to successfully reach agreements on several points,” read a translated version of the declaration.

Trump will face another test on the foreign stage within the next week, when he travels to Warsaw, Poland, to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the start of World War II.

Some of the G-7 leaders who were in Biarritz — heads of state whom the president irritated and complimented, often simultaneously — are also expected at the events, increasing the risk that Trump could perhaps undo some of the “progress” he so frequently touted while in France."
Opinion | My Final Break With the Trump State Department,https://www.nytimes.com,['Bethany Milton'],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/26/opinion/trump-state-department.html,"When President Trump allowed a crowd to chant “Send her back!” about a sitting member of Congress — espousing an ideology in which naturalized American citizens, at least those who don’t fit a certain profile, are held to different and dangerous standards — he wasn’t thinking about me. He’s rarely thinking about me, the white American-born daughter of two American-born citizens.

But he is often thinking and talking about at least some of the tens of thousands of people I’ve helped immigrate to the United States — legally and permissibly — over my 11 years as a consular officer in the Foreign Service. From 2014 to 2016, I oversaw immigrant visa processing at the U.S. Consulate General in Mumbai, India. Every day, my team and I saw dozens of families destined to move to the United States as green card holders: older parents going to spend their final years surrounded by grandchildren, spouses matched up through online matrimonial sites, parents with kids in tow who had been waiting patiently since the early 1990s for their chance to join a sibling.

I also oversaw immigrant visa operations in Kigali, Rwanda, from 2018 to 2019, helping Rwandans and Congolese reunite with family members in the United States. Their stories often had a darker tone: marriages brokered in refugee camps, siblings separated by war, children born of rape. But the one thing that united almost every visa applicant I ever saw was the belief that life was going to be better in America. What a rude surprise, then, for them to face elected national leadership that targets them in such gruesome ways.

When a diplomat joins the State Department, she sits through two presentations toward the end of her weekslong orientation class. One is an afternoon session about the State Department’s storied dissent channel, which lets employees speak out internally about foreign policy decisions free from the fear of retaliation. How to use it, when to use it, what it means. The other is a much shorter presentation, one that lasts all of 15 seconds: “The day you can no longer publicly support your administration’s policies is the day you need to resign.”"
Justice Department to seek death penalty against Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect,https://www.cnn.com,['Amir Vera'],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/26/us/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-death-sentence/index.html,"(CNN) The Justice Department is planning to seek the death penalty against the suspected shooter in the Pittsburgh Tree of Life Synagogue massacre.

Robert Bowers

Federal prosecutors will seek the death penalty on charges that include obstruction of free exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death, use and discharge of a firearm to commit murder and possession of a firearm during a violent crime.

Prosecutors say their intent to seek the death penalty is justified because Bowers' anti-Semitic views played a role in the shooting, the shooting was intentional and he showed no remorse, according to a federal notice to seek the death penalty.

Bowers has been indicted on 63 federal charges, including hate crime charges, according to a superseding indictment issued in January 2019. Of the 63 charges, 22 counts carry the death penalty, a Justice Department news release in January said."
Ex-White House Aide Rob Porter Is Subpoenaed in House Impeachment Inquiry,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Julie Hirschfeld Davis', 'Maggie Haberman']",08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/26/us/politics/rob-porter-judiciary-subpoena.html,"The White House is all but certain to try to keep Mr. Porter, a former aide in the Senate and to a federal judge, from complying with the order to appear on Capitol Hill, just as it has stonewalled previous attempts by the House to secure information from other top aides to Mr. Trump. This month, the Judiciary Committee sued to enforce its subpoena of Mr. McGahn, calling him “the most important witness, other than the president, to key events” at the center of the Mueller investigation and saying his testimony was essential to the panel’s impeachment inquiry. The case is pending.

If he did speak publicly, Mr. Porter could likely provide a rich account of Mr. Trump’s conduct. His job as staff secretary, which included controlling every piece of official paper the president saw, entailed near-constant presence around Mr. Trump. He kept notes of his time at the White House, which the Mueller team referenced in footnotes of its report.

And unlike other witnesses that the Judiciary panel has sought to compel to testify, such as Hope Hicks, the former White House communications director, and Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump’s first campaign manager, Mr. Porter was not an unquestioning Trump loyalist. He sometimes moved to prevent the president from taking actions that he considered ill-advised or poorly considered, and made it his business to try to impose some order on a freewheeling West Wing led by a president who shunned policy deliberation and spoke openly with his staff about his whims."

The State Department on Monday announced the political scientist Peter Berkowitz as the head of policy planning, a post that puts him in charge of long-term strategic thinking for the department.

Berkowitz, who was already working in the Office of Policy Planning, will replace his former boss, Kiron Skinner, who was dismissed earlier this month over concerns about her management style.

The announcement came in an internal email to select State Department officials on Monday morning, according to one of those officials.

Berkowitz, who has taught both constitutional law and political philosophy, came to the State Department from Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. He is the author of four books on subjects ranging from conservatism and progressivism to the ethics of Nietzsche.

Under former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the Department of Policy Planning — which has historically operated as the State Department’s internal think tank — played a key role in the day-to-day management of the department.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who works closely with a team of special envoys, has returned it to its traditional role of churning out papers and proposals on long-range strategic issues.

Lisa Page could save Andrew McCabe from DOJ criminal charges,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/lisa-page-could-save-andrew-mccabe-from-doj-criminal-charges,"Former FBI lawyer Lisa Page could hinder a criminal case against former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe if the Justice Department decides to bring charges against him.

Federal prosecutors are close to making a final decision on whether to indict McCabe, who is accused of lying to federal agents, the New York Times reported Monday.

McCabe’s lawyers met with Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, who will help make the call on whether to prosecute, and U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia Jessie Liu in two separate meetings last week. This signals McCabe’s lawyers could be making a last-ditch effort to convince the top law enforcement officials not to prosecute the case.

If they were to bring charges against McCabe, prosecutors would have to prove he knowingly and intentionally lied to investigators when he told them on two occasions that he did not remember authorizing Page to speak to a Wall Street Journal reporter. McCabe corrected himself at a later time.

Page, who worked as a special counsel to McCabe, told a grand jury in Washington, D.C., that McCabe was authorized in his position as deputy director to give information to the media and had no motive to lie. Page resigned from the bureau last year after it was discovered she had exchanged anti-Trump text messages with former FBI agent Peter Strzok, with whom she had an affair.

Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired McCabe in March 2018, less than two days before he was set to retire. This followed Michael Horowitz, DOJ’s inspector general, releasing a report in February 2018 detailing instances where McCabe “lacked candor” with then-FBI Director James Comey and investigators and concluded McCabe greenlit disclosures to the media of sensitive information on an FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation “to make himself look good.”

McCabe's lawyers called the inspector general's report ""deeply flawed.""

Comey has said he did not give McCabe permission to leak, and when Sessions fired McCabe he stated the deputy director “made an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor — including under oath — on multiple occasions.”

McCabe, who was hired by CNN last week, sued in August, accusing Trump of forcing his subordinates at the Justice Department to participate in an “unconstitutional plan and scheme” to have him fired, and is demanding back pay, his full pension, and for his record to be expunged. Trump has accused McCabe, who authorized the investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, of being involved in an ""illegal and treasonous"" plot against him.

Neither DOJ nor McCabe’s attorney immediately responded to the Washington Examiner’s requests for comment.

The investigation into McCabe has been lengthy — so long, in fact, the Times reported the term expired for grand jury hearing evidence. It began last year after Horowitz referred his findings to the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington for possible criminal charges. Frustrated with the prolonged process, DOJ prosecutor Kamil Shields left the case and joined a private practice. Another assistant U.S. attorney, David Kent, is also no longer on the case.

McCabe is also likely still being scrutinized in Horowitz’s inquiry into allegations of abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The surveillance warrant applications targeting Trump associate Carter Page required the approval of top members of the FBI and DOJ, and McCabe was involved in the FISA approval process.

Horowitz’s report is expected to be released to the public in late September or early October."
Treasury yields steady as investors await updates in US-China trade battle,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/26/treasury-yields-fall-investors-flee-risk-trade-war.html,"Treasury yields held steady Monday despite the rate on the benchmark 2-year note rising above that of the 10-year, triggering again a recession indicator that has dogged financial markets in recent weeks.

At around 1:13 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was trading at 1.533%, below the 2-year's rate of 1.545%, inverting the U.S. Treasury curve further. Such an inversion of the 2-10 yields is viewed by fixed income traders as a recession prognosticator, but trying to forecast exactly when GDP growth contracts is harder to project.

Inversions of that part of the curve have predated every recession over the past 50 years and the last five 2-10 inversions have all led to recessions. Still, even when it does predict a recession, yield curve inversion is, on average, 22 months early, according to Credit Suisse.

An uptick in U.S.-China trade tensions also helped aggravate recession anxieties.

Beijing on Friday announced new tariffs on $75 billion of U.S. goods on Friday in response to the Trump administration's impending tariffs, set to take effect in waves starting Sept. 1. That retaliation prompted Trump to tweet Friday morning that U.S. companies were ""ordered"" to immediately look for alternatives to China.

The U.S. president also lashed out at China President Xi Jinping and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who delivered a speech on Friday in which he said the global economic outlook ""has been deteriorating"" and highlighted the trade war as a major source of business uncertainty.

Trump said after the market closed that he would raise existing duties on $250 billion in Chinese products to 30% from 25%, and that new tariffs on a further $300 billion of Chinese goods, due to take effect on September 1, will now rise from 10% to 15%.

Monday's moves also came after a host of Fed leaders spoke to CNBC from their annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

Though Powell didn't repeat his now-infamous July 31 comments that the Fed's recent rate cut was merely a ""midcycle adjustment,"" he did not promise additional easing as some investors had hoped. He also focused on the impact the trade war is having on the business outlook.

Regarding the Fed's dual mandate of full employment and price stability, Powell said the ""economy is close to both goals. Our challenge now is to do what monetary policy can do to sustain the expansion so that the benefits of the strong jobs market extend to more of those still left behind, and so that inflation is centered firmly around 2%."""

Trump made the comment at a news conference at the Group of 7 summit in Biarritz, France. While answering a question about Iran, the president took a detour to discuss the country’s real estate potential, then pivoted to North Korea.

“I also say that, by the way, with respect to North Korea, Kim Jong Un — who I’ve gotten to know extremely well; the first lady had gotten to know Kim Jong Un, and I think she’d agree with me — he is a man with a country that has tremendous potential,” Trump said.

White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham issued a statement soon after noting that the first lady has never met Kim.

“President Trump confides in his wife on many issues including the detailed elements of his strong relationship with Chairman Kim — and while the First Lady hasn’t met him, the President feels like she’s gotten to know him too,” Grisham said.

The president first met with Kim in Singapore in June 2018. At the time, Trump said that even though the first lady wanted to accompany him, she was under doctors’ orders not to fly because of a medical procedure she’d had the previous month.

“Can’t fly for one month, the doctors say,” the president said. “She had a big operation. That was close to a four-hour operation.”

Earlier this year, Trump and Kim held their second summit in Hanoi. The first lady was also not present for that meeting, which was abruptly cut short amid disagreements on the trade-offs between the United States providing relief from sanctions and North Korea’s steps to dismantle its nuclear weapons program.

In June, Trump and Kim met for the third time, at the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea. While the president’s daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, accompanied him on the visit and also briefly crossed into North Korea, the first lady was not present.

The President Spent the G-7 Summit Retweeting Conspiracy Theories,https://slate.com,['Ben Mathis-Lilley'],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/08/trump-g7-china-twitter.html,"Donald Trump at the G-7 summit in Biarritz, France, on Sunday. Jeff J. Mitchell—Pool/Getty Images

Over the weekend and on Monday, President Donald Trump was in France for the G-7 summit, at which he was supposed to be doing things such as keeping the world economy from crashing and going to meetings about subjects like climate change.

Mostly, though, the president appeared to be self-soothing online. In one four-hour stretch on Sunday, Trump did nine consecutive reposts of tweets from the right-wing group Judicial Watch, in reverse chronological order, as if he were working his way through the feed to make himself feel better. The topics he shared included a conspiracy theory about Rep. Ilhan Omar’s personal life and various paranoid claims about the deep state, one of which featured a video involving, yes, Hillary Clinton’s emails.

What about summit business? On the economic front, Trump told reporters that his aides had been in touch with representatives of the Chinese government about working out a trade deal after the market-assaulting Friday tweet meltdown in which he’d spontaneously announced new tariffs and demanded that U.S. companies stop doing business in the country. According to the Associated Press, the president specifically said that his trade negotiation team had conducted two “very good calls” with the Chinese on Sunday. China, however, had a different take:

* Says China will protect itself on trade if U.S. persists with current approach — Melissa Cheok (@mkcheok) August 26, 2019

So that’s going well. As for climate change, Trump not only missed the meeting but didn’t even know he had missed it. The Guardian:

Trump was later asked by reporters covering a meeting with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, whether he had attended the climate session. He replied: “We’re having it in a little while.” He did not appear to hear when a reporter told him it had just taken place.

On the ball. Good.

Meanwhile, his Twitter feed testifies to what the president has been paying attention to in France. The Judicial Watch fixation was part of a Sunday/Monday spree—again, while he was supposed to be at a series of huge meetings—during which he posted or retweeted others’ posts 46 times. Some of these were pro forma PR messages that were probably put up by his staff, but others were vintage The President Is Mad at the Television material, like this zombie complaint about how well the press treated Clinton in 2016, this denial of the very plausible Axios report that he wants to drop a nuclear bomb on a hurricane, and this Obviously Fabricated Anecdote:

The question I was asked most today by fellow World Leaders, who think the USA is doing so well and is stronger than ever before, happens to be, “Mr. President, why does the American media hate your Country so much? Why are they rooting for it to fail?” — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 25, 2019

Yeah, that sounds like something Shinzo Abe would say."
Justice Department takes controversial stand on transgender case at Supreme Court,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,['Ap Photo J. Scott Applewhite'],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/justice-department-takes-controversial-stand-on-transgender-case-at-supreme-court,"In one of the most important cases the Supreme Court will hear this fall, the Department of Justice has taken a stand, along with a number of influential people and organizations. All of them take specific, strong stances on the definition of sex and gender identity, which center around the questions both the LGBT activists, conservatives, and legal experts have been asking for some time: What is sex, who defines it, and what legal protections does it have?

In a brief filed with the Supreme Court, the Department of Justice said they believe transgender discrimination is not prohibited by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in October to address the issue. The ACLU will argue on behalf of the transgender woman and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s position, claiming the employee was fired because of her gender identity. R.G & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes maintains that the employee was fired after he transitioned from male to female because he did not wear sex-specific clothing, which is a company policy.

This particular brief is significant because the DOJ represents the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, but their brief shows they will depart from the commission’s position that gender identity should be a protected category until Title VII’s sex discrimination clause. In the brief, the DOJ argues that Congress didn’t include transgender people and gender identity when Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act was originally passed, and Congress has not passed any efforts to add gender identity to the statute. “Under this Court’s precedent, proving discrimination because of sex under Title VII requires showing that an employer treated members of one sex less favorably than similarly situated members of the other sex,” the Justice Department said in its brief.

The DOJ’s brief isn’t the only noteworthy opinion on the case. Paul McHugh is the University Distinguished Service professor of Psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and he filed an amicus brief “not to discuss statutory construction but to critically evaluate, on the basis of his clinical and scientific expertise” in support of the concept that gender identity and sex are not the same thing, which basically supports the funeral home's case. The brief reads that he “seeks to discuss the frequently heard claims about gender identity, which sometimes masquerade as science but are really ideological pronouncements not supported by scientific evidence.”

Just last week a brief was filed by a group of people who appear to have all undergone gender reassignment surgeries or transitioned to some degree, and warn others about the dangers of transitioning through hormone replacement or surgeries. In their brief, they too tackle the subject of gender identity, sex, and transitioning, rather than law. Both amicus briefs provide an insightful look into the world of those who treat or who have identified as a different gender from a cultural, rather than a legal, perspective.

This case will be to gender identity what Obergefell v. Hodges was to same-sex marriage. It will be interesting to see who else steps in to add a perspective to this controversial legal case.

According to the Melania Trump Style Instagram account, Trump sported Calvin Klein once again for an outing with the other wives of G7 members on Sunday. She arrived at a traditional dance performance at the Villa Arnaga in Cambo-les-Bains during a visit on traditional Basque culture wearing a white midi dress paired with large black sunglasses, white Christian Louboutin ballet flats and a matching white Hermès bag.

Department of Energy Announces $21.4 Million for Quantum Information Science Research,https://www.energy.gov,[],,,,https://www.energy.gov/articles/department-energy-announces-214-million-quantum-information-science-research,"WASHINGTON, D.C.—Today, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced $21.4 million in funding for research in Quantum Information Science (QIS) related to both particle physics and fusion energy sciences.

“QIS holds great promise for tackling challenging questions in a wide range of disciplines,” said Under Secretary for Science Paul Dabbar. “This research will open up important new avenues of investigation in areas like artificial intelligence while helping keep American science on the cutting edge of the growing field of QIS.”

Funding of $12 million will be provided for 21 projects of two to three years’ duration in particle physics. Efforts will range from the development of highly sensitive quantum sensors for the detection of rare particles, to the use of quantum computing to analyze particle physics data, to quantum simulation experiments connecting the cosmos to quantum systems.

Funding of $9.4 million will be provided for six projects of up to three years in duration in fusion energy sciences. Research will examine the application of quantum computing to fusion and plasma science, the use of plasma science techniques for quantum sensing, and the quantum behavior of matter under high-energy-density conditions, among other topics.

Fiscal Year 2019 funding for the two initiatives totals $18.4 million, with out-year funding for the three-year particle physics projects contingent on congressional appropriations.

Projects were selected by competitive peer review under two separate Funding Opportunity Announcements (and corresponding announcements for DOE laboratories) sponsored respectively by the Office of High Energy Physics and the Office of Fusion Energy Sciences with the Department’s Office of Science.

A list of particle physics projects can be found here and fusion energy sciences projects here, both under the heading “What’s New.”

There's no need to focus on anonymously-sourced stories about Trump when he says bonkers stuff out in the open,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/theres-no-need-to-focus-on-anonymously-sourced-stories-about-trump-when-he-says-bonkers-stuff-out-in-the-open,"This past weekend followed a familiar pattern of stories about President Trump based on anonymous sources that get joked about and debated, then eventually denied.

In the most recent case, Axios, citing a number of officials anonymously, reported that Trump repeatedly inquired about the possibility of blasting hurricanes with nuclear weapons to stop them before they hit the shore. The story also quoted unnamed White House officials as defending Trump for having the right objective, downplaying any reason for panic. The reported idea has obviously not come into fruition.

On Monday morning, Trump tweeted, ""The story by Axios that President Trump wanted to blow up large hurricanes with nuclear weapons prior to reaching shore is ridiculous. I never said this. Just more FAKE NEWS!""

Let me say at the outset, I don't question that Axios reporters Jonathan Swan and Margaret Talev were told Trump said such things. Also, there is some room between Trump's denial and the story — i.e., he could have asked about the possibility without actually affirmatively wanting to do it.

The problem with assessing stories such as this is that at this point, we know there are many people within the administration who do not agree with Trump — indeed, who see it as their duty to protect the country from him by reining him in. At the same time, people in position to be cited as high-ranking officials know that based on his statements and behavior in public, people will believe just about any story about Trump, and that there is an insatiable appetite for such stories. So the threshold for selling an outlandish story is much lower than the typical president.

But here's the thing. To me, there's no reason to get so worked about anonymously sourced stories at this point when there's so much that Trump says and does in full public view that's lamentable or absolutely bonkers.

Just last week, Trump vented about the disloyalty of Democratic voting American Jews, canceled a meeting with the leader of Denmark over the sale of Greenland, escalated his trade war with China on Twitter, called his own appointment to lead the Fed an ""enemy"" on par with the ruler of communist China, and then joked about the resulting stock market crash.

So critics and defenders have plenty of stuff to argue about without even debating the validity of the anonymously-sourced stuff."

Separately, meeting German chancellor Angela Merkel, the US president claimed there was “great unity” on how to deal with the Iran crisis. Ms Merkel, however, said there was a long way to go on the issue, which has created considerable headache as tensions have flared between Tehran and Washington.

The snubs came just before Mr Trump attended a joint press conference with French president Emmanuel Macron, where the two leaders claimed to have found unity on many issues — from Iranian nuclear enrichment, to trade.

Later, after Mr Macron left the stage, the American president stuck around for a few questions, where he lavished praise on Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un, and at one point called himself an ""environmentalist"".

Mr Trump has also denied at the summit in France that he had suggested firing nuclear weapons at hurricanes — as was reported by Axios — and suggested his own Miami golf club for next year’s G7. He also claimed China had “called” to ask for trade talks – before a top Chinese official said he was unaware of any call.

Elsewhere, the 2020 Democratic primary field saw some heat, with a new poll showing Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Joe Biden all in a statistical dead heat among national voters.

The poll marked a potentially dramatic fall for Mr Biden from the top of the race, and came after Ms Warren attracted a massive crowd in Seattle — one that has received plenty of media attention for its striking visuals.

Also, Mr Trump's own party's primary field has gotten a bit tighter, with the long-shot entry of former congressman Joe Walsh, a one-time Trump supporter who claims the president has simply gotten too cozy with Russia."
Trump's North Korea point man gets a look for No. 2 State Dept. job,https://www.politico.com,"['Daniel Lippman', 'Eliana Johnson']",08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/26/biegun-north-korea-state-dept-1475896,"Special Envoy for North Korea Steve Biegun is being seriously considered to replace deputy secretary of state John Sullivan. | Jeon Heon-Kyun/Getty Images foreign policy Trump's North Korea point man gets a look for No. 2 State Dept. job Taking the deputy secretary position would leave the president without a dedicated envoy to Kim Jong Un.

Steve Biegun, President Trump’s special representative for North Korea, is being seriously considered for the No. 2 job at the State Department, according to two senior administration officials with knowledge of the matter.

The post looks like it’s going to open up soon because the current deputy secretary of state John Sullivan, who met with Trump in the Oval Office last week, is likely to get nominated in the coming weeks to be the U.S. ambassador to Russia, replacing Jon Huntsman, who leaves his post in early October.

Story Continued Below

While it’s early in the selection process for the job, multiple officials said that Biegun, a former auto executive who has been the point man on working-level negotiations with the North Korean regime, is a strong candidate.

Biegun, whose background before the North Korean job was in Russia policy, had also been considered to replace Huntsman and has talked to Trump about being an ambassador. He also reportedly turned down the Russia job.

“It’s good to have someone who is already in the system,” said a senior administration official. “They understand how the process goes. They already have a security clearance.” The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

“The whole building is vying for the job,” according to another senior administration official. One of the contenders could include Brian Bulatao, the undersecretary of state for management, who was chief operating officer of the CIA when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was CIA director, according to a former senior State Department official. Bulatao didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

It could take a while for Sullivan to get confirmed if and when he’s officially selected, since confirming judicial nominees is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s priority, which leads to occasional delays for executive branch nominees. Russia also is likely to take at least two months to approve the U.S. picking Sullivan, a diplomatic protocol known as “agrément.”

Trump has resisted acknowledging that his talks with Kim Jong Un have made little headway, and has sought a third summit with the North Korean leader.

He told reporters at the G7 in France on Monday that Kim “is a man with a country that has tremendous potential.” He had said that he was “not happy” about North Korea’s recent missile tests, which his own national security adviser has said violate U.N. Security Council resolutions.

There has also been some rather public daylight between Biegun and Trump on the progress the U.S. has made in negotiating with North Korea. While Trump bragged last year that there wasn’t a nuclear threat from North Korea anymore, Biegun said earlier this year at Stanford that “it is fair to say we have more work ahead of us than behind us.”

With few signs of any coming breakthroughs with North Korea, Biegun has recently shown signs of wanting to leave his current job. He’s been telling associates he was eager to move on from the envoy post and felt it was a thankless job, according to three people familiar with his comments.

In his job as Trump’s North Korea envoy, Biegun has had difficulty getting meetings with top North Korean officials to advance U.S. goals of denuclearization.

“Not having the North Koreans meet with you and the North Koreans only want to meet with the president is pretty frustrating,” said one Republican foreign policy hand who knows Biegun. “And negotiating with the North Koreans is hopeless. They just want to meet at the presidential level so there’s no real meetings at his level.”

It’s not clear whether Biegun would actually take the deputy job if Trump offers it. He has also told people that he is tired of serving in government and is eager to return to the private sector.

The State Department, meanwhile, is fending off twin challenges: a president whose sudden pronouncements can rewrite policy in mere seconds; and a budget that is constantly under the threat of severe cuts under Trump.

“How are you supposed to come to work and to be a serious professional when you don’t know what’s coming tomorrow?” said another Republican involved in foreign policy in Washington. “Even Pompeo doesn’t know the crazy thing Trump is going to say the next day and it’s really hard to engage with people in the White House” who don’t know what Trump is going to do either.

Weighing against this chaos factor: If Biegun is picked for the deputy job, there’s a possibility he could eventually become the acting secretary of state should Pompeo leave to run for a Senate seat in his home state of Kansas.

Biegun served as executive secretary of the National Security Council in the Bush administration and also had a brief stint as foreign policy adviser to Sarah Palin when she was John McCain’s vice presidential nominee.

Before joining the Trump administration, he worked as the vice president of international governmental affairs at Ford. After H.R. McMaster left as Trump’s national security adviser, Biegun was considered for that job before John Bolton was picked.

Traditionally, the deputy secretary of state position is tasked with managing the State Department’s 69,000 employees, but also usually carves out select foreign policy portfolios of his or her own.

Sullivan, for instance, has focused on a few key issues, including implementing the sanctions against Russia, leading the administration’s diplomatic response to the gas attacks and barrel bombings in Syria, and guiding the Trump team’s efforts to stabilize South Sudan.

Trump told reporters last week that Sullivan “could very well be” picked as the ambassador to Russia and that Pompeo “likes him very much.”

As for Biegun’s suitability for the job, “It’s a really tough and challenging role but I think Steve would be really excellent at it, just because of his work ethic, his style, his intelligence,” another former senior State Department official said. “I’ve always found Steve to be fair.”

Biegun didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

His departure would leave the North Korea envoy role empty -- but Trump has shown few signs of leaning on Biegun in any event.

On Monday, the president said that his wife, First Lady Melania Trump, has also gotten to know Kim Jong Un. That left Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, to quickly clarify Trump’s comments.

“President Trump confides in his wife on many issues including the detailed elements of his strong relationship with Chairman Kim,” she said in a statement. “And while the first lady hasn’t met him, the president feels like she’s gotten to know him too.”

Mark Sanford Attending South Carolina GOP Rally Starring Vice President Mike Pence,https://www.fitsnews.com,[],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.fitsnews.com/2019/08/26/mark-sanford-attending-south-carolina-gop-rally-starring-vice-president-mike-pence/,"Former South Carolina governor Mark Sanford’s recent appearance at a statewide Republican event in Columbia, S.C. did not go over well. At all.

According to our sources, Sanford was treated like a man with bubonic plague when he showed up to the 2019 SCGOP Silver Elephant banquet earlier this month … which is not at all surprising in light of recent developments.

First, there was Sanford’s refusal to endorse the Republican nominee in a closely contested congressional race last fall – which cost him much of the remaining support he had within the state party.

Did Sanford’s decision also cost S.C. first congressional district nominee Katie Arrington her shot against Democrat Joe Cunningham? Yes … it did. In fact, we are told the former governor/ congressman may have done more than just “stay out” of this race.

Stay tuned for more on that …

In the meantime, the “Luv Gov” will take a break from visits to early-voting Iowa and New Hampshire to attend U.S. congressman Jeff Duncan’s upcoming Faith and Freedom Barbecue event this week. Duncan’s event is being headlined by U.S. vice president Mike Pence, who has found himself squarely in the crosshairs of another former South Carolina governor – Nikki Haley.

While the Pence-Haley drama will likely dominate discussion when Republicans descend upon Anderson, S.C. for Duncan’s gathering – Sanford could find himself starring in a cringeworthy sideshow.

Why is he even attending this event? Good question …

(Click to view)

(Via: Jeff Duncan for Congress)

Our guess is Duncan (above) is unlikely to even acknowledge his presence … and that he won’t be the only one adopting such a dismissive posture, either.

As we noted in our original assessment of Sanford’s presidential aspirations, they are “Quixotic, at best.” And in South Carolina – where Sanford spent eight years as governor and eleven years as a congressman – they are utterly nonexistent given the monolithic backing U.S. president Donald Trump is currently receiving in the Palmetto State.

While we have argued Trump should take Sanford (and other GOP contenders) seriously – especially if the American economy slips into recession this year – that does not mean he should take Sanford seriously in South Carolina.

Even if the economy (and Trump’s GOP support) were to completely implode over the next six months, there is still no scenario in which Mark Sanford will ever be a competitive presidential candidate in the Palmetto State.

South Carolinians’ familiarity with Sanford will continue to breed all sorts of contempt … especially when he shows up to events like Duncan’s barbecue.

Our advice to Sanford? Stay in New Hampshire … he has a much better chance of challenging Trump there than he does in his home state.

The Trump administration is making changes to the agency that operates the nation's immigration court system, a move immediately denounced by the immigration judges' union as a power grab.

The agency is called the Executive Office for Immigration Review and it is an arm of the Justice Department. Under the interim rule announced Friday, the agency's director will have the power to issue appellate decisions in immigration cases that have not been decided within an allotted timeframe. It also creates a new office of policy within EOIR to implement the administration's immigration policies.

The head of the immigration judges' union accused the administration of trying to strip power away from judges and turn the immigration court system into a law enforcement agency.

""In an unprecedented attempt at agency overreach to dismantle the Immigration Court, the Department of Justice, Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) today published a new interim rule, effective next Monday, which takes steps to dismantle the Immigration Court system,"" Judge Ashley Tabaddor, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, said in a statement. ""DOJ's action ends any transparency and assurance of independent decision making over individual cases.""

The new rule, first reported by The Associated Press, comes after the administration announced an effort to decertify the immigration judges' union. The judges, 440 in total, are employees of the Justice Department and not part of the independent judiciary. The Trump administration has also imposed quotas on judges in an effort to speed up deportations and reduce the backlog of more than 900,000 cases pending in immigration courts.

Tabaddor said the administration is trying to concentrate its power over immigration proceedings.

""The new rule is a wolf in sheep's clothing,"" Tabaddor said. ""While couched in bureaucratic language, the impact of this regulation is to substitute the policy directives of a single political appointee over the legal analysis of non-political, independent adjudicators.""

The EOIR did not respond to a call for comment.

Earlier this week, the EOIR sent the immigration judges a newsletter containing a blog post from VDare, an anti-immigration website, which included an anti-Semitic reference, according to Tabaddor. After she protested, Justice Department officials said some information included with the newsletter had been compiled by a third-party contractor and should not have been distributed.

""The Department of Justice condemns anti-Semitism in the strongest terms,"" Kathryn Mattingly, a spokeswoman for EOIR told BuzzFeed."

We often know what we’re going to do when we wake up: We’ll hit our alarm clock, get ready to go to work, and at the end of the day we come home exhausted and get ready for the next day.

Et Aug.']",08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/08/26/migrant-families-19-states-sue-over-dhs-plan-indefinite-detention/2124483001/,"CLOSE The plan would stop child separation but allow undocumented kids to be detained indefinitely with their families while their cases are pending. USA TODAY

Nineteen states filed a federal lawsuit Monday opposing the Trump administration’s new regulations for indefinitely detaining immigrant families.

California Attorney General Xavier Becerra and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey led the effort by arguing that prolonged detention would cause irreparable harm to children and the communities that accept them after release from federal custody.

“This new Trump rule callously puts at risk the safety and well-being of children,” Becerra said in a statement. “No child deserves to be left in conditions inappropriate and harmful for their age.”

Federal authorities anticipated legal challenges to the proposal, which could take effect in 60 days if a federal judge approves. Kevin McAleenan, acting secretary of Homeland Security, said Wednesday in announcing the rule that it is intended to keep families together while processing their asylum claims efficiently.

“No child should be a pawn in a scheme to manipulate our immigration system,"" he said.

The regulatory proposal deals with the 1997 agreement reached in a class-action lawsuit known as the Flores settlement. The agreement calls for undocumented children who arrived unaccompanied to be released as expeditiously as possible for the child’s welfare. It includes a 20-day cap on the detentions.

A 2015 court decision expanded the policy to cover families, which administration officials said encouraged families to cross the border illegally under the prospect of a short detention.

U.S. District Court Judge Dolly Gee, who oversees the Flores settlement, would have to approve of the proposed Trump administration regulation before it replaces the Flores settlement.

ICE officials maintain that their detention facilities for families meet high standards for providing shelter, food, recreation and education. ICE has three facilities that have a total of about 3,000 beds for families, including two in Texas – the Karnes County Residential Center in Karnes City and the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley – and the Family Residential Center in Berks County, Pennsylvania.

Migrant families averaged about 50 days in detention while awaiting decisions in their cases before the 20-day cap was applied to them a few years ago, McAleenan said.

But conditions at short-term detention facilities have been contentious as a record influx of migrants strained the system. Migrants and lawyers have complained about inadequate health care, food and water, as well as unsanitary and unsafe conditions.

Other states participating in the lawsuit are: Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington and the District of Columbia.

“With this rule, the Trump administration is paving the way for ICE to imprison innocent children for indefinite periods of time and is attempting to take away the ability of states to stop them,” Healey of Massachusetts said in a statement. “This most recent attack on immigrant children is cruel, immoral, and illegal and we’re suing to stop it.”

US Department of Interior meets with tribes in Bethel to hear public safety concerns,https://www.adn.com,[],08-25-2019,2019,8,https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2019/08/25/us-department-of-interior-meets-with-tribes-in-bethel-to-hear-public-safety-concerns/,"Representatives from the U.S. Department of the Interior visited Bethel on Wednesday to hear from tribal representatives about the public safety issues unique to the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. The visit comes in the wake of Attorney General William Barr’s tour of the region for similar reasons.

For DOI Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs Tara Sweeney, the visit to Bethel was a bit of a homecoming.

“At Kilbuck, Mrs. Han was my fifth grade teacher,” Sweeney said.

Sweeney is the first Alaska Native to be confirmed to her position. Growing up in Bethel and Utqiagvik, she says that she saw the problems with public safety in rural Alaskan communities firsthand.

“The issues that we are discussing today are prevalent in every Alaska Native village. Every family has been impacted by domestic violence, sexual assault, violent crimes,” Sweeney said. “So yes, this is personal.”

Sweeney says that the Bureau of Indian Affairs has heard about these issues for years. Now, DOI Chief of Staff Kate MacGregor says that the bureau has the support it needs to take action.

“The president earlier this year declared May 5 as national missing and murdered Native American Awareness Day,” MacGregor said. “So this is something that has been raised in profile.”

MacGregor said that it was important to note that several members of the White House were in attendance at the listening session. Charles Addington, Director of the BIA’s Office of Justice Services, thinks that funding will be available. The next step is figuring out where the BIA can get the biggest bang for its buck.

“Trying to figure out where do we already have things in place that we can just start enhancing,” Addington said. “Low-hanging fruit that we can start making a difference right away.”

The Association of Village Council Presidents had called for the listening session. Forty-seven of the 56 federally recognized tribes in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta sent representatives. AVCP Director of Communications Azara Mohammadi described some of their suggestions.

“There was a lot about restorative justice, there was a lot about resources for victims, and infrastructure came up again and again. Public safety infrastructure,"" she said.

She said that people in the Lower 48 take holding cells and office space for granted, but in many villages that infrastructure is either falling apart or doesn’t exist.

“I mean, if you just don’t have the physical space for it, it’s very difficult,” Mohammadi said.

Tribal representatives asked for more funding for VPSOs and tribal courts. Another request was for changing the funding process itself. AVCP Director of Tribal Justice Rick Garcia says that there are problems when villages have to apply for competitive grants every year.

“What competitive funding does, it puts neighbors against neighbors, it puts families against families,” Garcia said.

Garcia is hopeful. The listening session came just a few months after U.S. Attorney General William Barr visited Bethel to talk about public safety. Garcia said that this meeting struck a different tone.

“I think this session was much different than Attorney General Barr’s,” Garcia said. “In that they really did come with the intention of listening and getting recommendations directly from our tribal leadership and delegates.”

DOI Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs Tara Sweeney said that improving public safety in this region will require creativity and should be developed in partnership with the people who know the issues best."

The Environmental Protection Agency has failed to set proper regulations on smog and must improve its air quality standards ruled a federal appeals court last week.

In a case fought between Murray Energy Corporation, a massive coal company, and Earthjustice, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reviewed massive amounts of scientific evidence to determine if the EPA’s current air quality standards were sufficient.

The court ruled that current air quality standards for the ozone are too weak to protect the environment and do not meet basic federal requirements for protecting human health.

Although the case is a great win, unfortunately the court only fully recognized the scientific evidence of air pollution on forests and other natural landscapes.

“We are disappointed that the court failed to recognize the overwhelming scientific evidence showing ozone’s potential to cause premature death, difficulty breathing, wheezing and coughing, and asthma attacks at levels previously considered safe,” Harold P. Wimmer, CEO of the American Lung Association, said in a statement. “Such evidence demands that EPA adopt stronger, more protective standards, not backslide on the progress being made toward cleaning up the air we breathe.”

The case was important in highlighting how effective strong scientific evidence can be when arguing during a trial.

“As President Trump’s EPA considers weakening science-based protections, that fact should give the agency pause as it goes out of its way to either dismantle science advisory boards, or fire independent scientists and replace them with fossil fuel lobbyists,” said Senator Tom Carper, a member of the Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee, in a statement.

Murray Energy also attempted to argue that the EPA should consider costs incurred by industry groups and corporations when they are forced to comply with new and updated regulations. The court rejected this argument, stating “The plain text of the [Clean Air] Act unambiguously bars cost considerations.”

Seth Johnson, the attorney who worked the case on behalf of Earthjustice was positive about its outcome. The EPA “must go back and fix its mistakes so cherished natural spaces like national parks can thrive,” he said after the ruling."

Georgia governor on trade war with China: ‘Trust the president’,https://www.ajc.com,['Greg Bluestein'],,,,https://www.ajc.com/blog/politics/georgia-governor-trade-war-with-china-trust-the-president/ifYrsLAJixIdkYlPtNB5LN/,"Gov. Brian Kemp had just begun a question-and-answer session with eight Asian-American business owners in Gwinnett County when Tim Le, a real estate investor, asked a question on many of their minds: With threats of a trade war looming, how does the U.S. economy keep growing?

Le and the other executives had spent the first 30 minutes lavishing praise on President Donald Trump and Kemp’s administration, praising the $1.5 trillion package of tax cuts that Congress adopted in 2017 and the governor’s promise to slash regulations.

But with Trump’s ongoing tit-for-tat trade war with China and the constant threat of new tariffs, Le and others wanted to know whether Kemp believed the American economy can withstand new threats of trade turbulation.

The governor said the tariffs have had a scattershot impact on Georgia businesses – some are hurting, other owners told him they are “exhausted” by all the new business. His message: He said he’s hopeful “that a lot of what’s gone on recently is posturing” and that the trade war is easing.

“We have to continue to trust the president, Sen. Perdue, Secretary Perdue – the whole team he’s got working on that,” said Kemp, of Sen. David Perdue and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, two Georgians who supported his campaign.

“China has taken advantage of us for a long time – really, the rest of the world. I’m no expert on trade, but I think we’ve probably waited too long to fight this battle. And people who are getting hurt from it even understand that.”

The event at a Peachtree Corners office park was part of a national series of Republican roundtables to highlight Trump’s economic agenda. But in Georgia it also had a different goal: To boost Asian-American support for Republicans in the 7th District, a competitive territory that stretches across parts of Gwinnett. .

Each of the eight business owners pledged to support Trump’s business agenda and work to encourage voters in the Asian-American community to vote next year.

“Thanks to President Trump’s tax cuts and less regulations, we have more money in our pockets and we’re able to hire more employees. We’re doing great,” Lonnie Vo, the owner of an auto repair shop, said to Kemp.

The sunny economic messaging contrasts with signs of fiscal turmoil ahead. Kemp has ordered 4% budget cuts this year and 6% next year, saying the slash is needed so he can pay for some of his top priorities, including another teacher pay raise.

Democrats have blasted his decision, sharpening their critiques after the Department of Community Health said it might have to lay off workers to meet the edict.

“I look forward to hearing why these cuts are necessary in a growing state with a lean budget and $2.55 billion in rainy day funds,” said Democratic state Rep. Sam Park.

Pressed on that question, Kemp criticized “political posturing” surrounding his orders to cut spending.

“They would be complaining if I took money out of the rainy day fund and kept the budget where it is,” he said. “We’re asking people to make government smaller and more efficient, and I believe you can do that without hurting services and programs.”

"Department of Energy Releases Annual Wind Market Reports, Finding Robust Wind Power Installations and Falling Prices",https://www.energy.gov,[],,,,https://www.energy.gov/articles/department-energy-releases-annual-wind-market-reports-finding-robust-wind-power,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has released annual market reports documenting data and trends in wind installations, technologies, costs, prices, and performance through the end of 2018 for three sectors: utility-scale land-based, offshore, and distributed wind.

“Onshore wind energy installation continues to grow across the country, and this Administration has proven that we can pursue renewable energy advancements and deployment, particularly wind energy resources, which are predicted to surpass other sources of renewable power generation this year,” said Under Secretary of Energy Mark W. Menezes. “And with over 25 gigawatts in the development pipeline, U.S. offshore wind is poised to be a significant part of our comprehensive energy portfolio in the coming years.”

The utility-scale land-based wind sector had another strong year with 7,588 megawatts (MW) installed during 2018, accompanied by record low costs and prices. The U.S. distributed wind sector now stands at 1,127 MW from over 83,000 wind turbines across all 50 states. And the U.S. offshore wind industry has a pipeline of 25,824 MW in various stages of development.

The 2018 Wind Technologies Market Report, prepared by DOE’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, found the following:

The U.S. wind industry installed 7,588 MW of capacity last year, bringing total utility-scale wind capacity to over 96 gigawatts (GW).

Wind industry employment is at an all-time high, supporting 114,000 jobs.

In total, 41 states operated utility-scale wind projects. Texas leads the nation with nearly 25 GW of wind capacity, while California, Iowa, Kansas, and Oklahoma have more than 5 GW.

Wind energy provides 6.5% of the nation’s electricity, more than 10% of total generation in 14 states, and more than 30% in Iowa, Kansas, and Oklahoma.

The trend of installing wind turbines that are larger and more powerful continued in 2018. Read more about these size and performance trends.

The price of wind energy being sold in long-term contracts is at an all-time low. Wind power purchase agreement (PPA) prices are below 2 cents per kilowatt-hour, driven by a combination of higher capacity factors, declining turbine prices and operating costs, low interest rates, and the production tax credit.

The 2018 Distributed Wind Market Report, prepared by DOE’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, highlights the following:

Distributed wind power is used at or near where it is generated, as opposed to wind power from wholesale generation, where power is sent to consumers via transmission lines and substations.

Employed by households, schools, farms, industrial facilities, and municipalities, distributed wind doesn’t only refer to small-scale turbines; it includes any size turbine or array of turbines that generates power for local or on-site use.

U.S. wind turbines in distributed applications reached a cumulative installed capacity of 1,127 MW in 2018. This capacity comes from over 83,000 turbines installed across all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam.

The trend of using larger wind turbines in distributed applications continued in 2018. The average capacity of large-scale turbines installed in distributed applications in 2018 was 2.1 MW—almost double the capacity of turbines used in 2003.

Commercial and industrial distributed wind projects increased in 2018, representing 29% of total project capacity. Distributed wind for utility customers remained the most prevalent use, representing 47% of capacity in 2018. Read more about the customers of U.S. distributed wind.

Of small wind turbines (nameplate capacity up to 100 kilowatts) deployed in the United States, very small turbines—less than 1 kW— are contributing an increasingly larger percentage of both the total number of turbines (99%) and capacity (47%) of small wind projects. These systems are often used for battery charging and are sometimes integrated with solar PV panels to power remote infrastructure.

The 2018 Offshore Wind Technologies Market Report, prepared by DOE’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory, found the following:

The U.S. offshore wind project development pipeline grew to a potential generating capacity of 25,824 MW across 13 states, including the Block Island Wind Farm commissioned in 2016.

Projects totaling 21,225 MW have exclusive site control, meaning the developer has a lease or other contract to develop the site. Most of these projects are on the Eastern seaboard, with one in the Great Lakes.

California and Hawaii have several early-stage floating offshore wind projects in the planning phase.

The Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) auctions for three lease areas off the coast of Massachusetts brought in winning bids of $135 million—more than three times the value of previous BOEM auctions—indicating strong interest and confidence in the U.S. offshore wind market.

Offtake prices for the first commercial-scale U.S. offshore wind project—Vineyard Wind off the coast of Massachusetts—came in lower than expected at $65–$75 per megawatt-hour.

Technology trends toward larger turbines continued, with offshore turbines installed globally in 2018 averaging 5.5 MW, and turbines with capacities of 10­–12 MW coming to market in the next couple years. Read more about offshore trends.

"Pro Farmer National Corn, Soybean Yield Estimate Below USDA Forecast",https://www.agweb.com,[],,,,https://www.agweb.com/article/pro-farmer-national-corn-soybean-yield-estimate-below-usda-forecast,"Corn: 13.358 billion bu.; Average yield of 163.3 bu. per acre

Corn +/- 1% = 13.492 billion bu. to 13.224 billion bu.; 164.9 bu. to 161.7 bu. per acre

Soybeans: 3.497 billion bu.; Average yield of 46.1 bu. per acre

Soybeans +/- 2% = 3.567 billion bu. to 3.427 billion bu.; 47.0 bu. to 45.2 bu. per acre

The national estimates above reflect Pro Farmer’s view on production and yields. They take into account data gathered during Crop Tour and other factors, such as crop maturity, acreage adjustments we’ve made, historical differences in Tour data versus USDA’s final yields, areas outside those sampled on Crop Tour, etc. That’s why the state yield numbers below differ from the Crop Tour figures.

Thousands of farmers, agribusiness executives and national and local media attended a series of meetings across the Midwest this week as part of the annual Pro Farmer Midwest Crop Tour. The Crop Tour focused on crop conditions going into the final stretch of the 2019 growing season.

Pro Farmer, a division of Farm Journal, shared its much-anticipated production estimates for the 2019 U.S. corn and soybean crops after analyzing information from the 27th annual tour and other sources.

The Pro Farmer Midwest Crop Tour unveiled the stresses the corn and soybean crops faced following an excessively wet spring and record-slow planting pace this year. Scouts on Crop Tour sampled around 3,000 fields across the Corn Belt in seven of the nation’s most important corn and soybean states.

Pro Farmer estimates the 2019 U.S. corn crop at 13.358 billion bushels, based on an average yield of 163.3 bu. per acre. That compares to USDA’s Aug. 1 estimate of 169.5 bu. per acre. For soybeans, the Pro Farmer production estimate is 3.497 billion bushels, with a national average yield of 46.1 bu. per acre, down from the 48.5 bu. per acre USDA estimated in August.

“Ear counts were lower than last year in all of the Crop Tour states as a result of the rough spring conditions,” said Brian Grete, Pro Farmer editor. “We also found a corn crop that was, in many cases, multiple weeks behind in maturity due to the record-slow planting.”

Jeff Wilson, Pro Farmer’s senior market analyst, said, “Soybean pod counts in a 3-foot by 3-foot square were down sharply across the

EPA ordered to set stronger smog standards,https://thehill.com,[],08-23-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/458608-epa-ordered-to-set-stronger-smog-standards,"A federal appeals court has ruled in a case battling Obama-era pollution regulations that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must set stronger regulations on smog in order to protect the environment.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found that while the EPA's current air quality standards for ozone are too weak to protect the environment, the standards do meet federal requirements when it comes to protecting human health.

Seth Johnson, an attorney who argued the case on behalf of Earthjustice, said the case gets to the heart of the Clean Air Act’s requirement that the EPA protect forests and natural landscapes from the ozone damage that can inhibit their growth.

The EPA “must go back and fix its mistakes so cherished natural spaces like national parks can thrive,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT

But advocates warned that a win for park was not necessarily a win for people.

“We are disappointed that the court failed to recognize the overwhelming scientific evidence showing ozone’s potential to cause premature death, difficulty breathing, wheezing and coughing, and asthma attacks at levels previously considered safe,” Harold P. Wimmer, national president and CEO of the American Lung Association, said in a statement. “Such evidence demands that EPA adopt stronger, more protective standards, not backslide on the progress being made toward cleaning up the air we breathe.”

While ozone helps create a protective layer in the stratosphere to protect the earth from the sun’s ultraviolet light, when at ground-level, the gas can contribute to asthma attacks and other respiratory issues.

The suit was initially brought by Murray Energy Corporation, one of the largest coal companies in the U.S.

Environmentalists and Democrats alike said the suit showed the importance of scientific evidence at trial.

Johnson said data from the EPA helped it make its case in portions of the suit, while a lack of scientific data hindered it in other areas of the case.

The court also rejected the argument from industry groups that the EPA should consider costs incurred by industry groups as they try to comply with regulations.

Re “G7 Fostered Cooperation. And Then Came Trump” (news article, Aug. 25):

If any more evidence were needed of the degree to which the Trump administration is disconnected from reality, Larry Kudlow, the financial cheerleader-in-chief, provided it when he opined: “ The Group of 7 is in danger of completely losing its way. If Mr. Trump isn’t allowed to make the case for growth at the Group of 7, no other leader will.”

Mr. Trump, who has probably never heard of Smoot or Hawley, is single-handedly responsible for jeopardizing the world economy with his punitive tariffs. He doesn’t understand even the basics of how tariffs work and apparently doesn’t care about the damage he is inflicting on farmers, retailers, American manufacturers and consumers.

Who, Mr. Kudlow, is the one losing his way?

To the Editor:

Efforts to curb trade with China will not slow down, cut or stop Chinese production of exports to the United States. As a former customs import specialist, I monitored and verified shipments of articles into the United States.

The Chinese, when faced with quotas and prohibitive tariffs, would simply pay other countries to allow the Chinese-made articles to be shipped through these other countries, labeled products of those countries. The restrictions did not reduce production or exports from China to the United States then and they will not do so now."
Weill Foundation announces public-private partnership with Dept. of Energy on artificial intelligence,https://www.cnbc.com,['Riya Bhattacharjee'],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/26/weill-foundation-announces-public-private-partnership-with-dept-of-energy-on-artificial-intelligence.html,"The Department of Energy and the Weill Foundation on Monday signed a memorandum of understanding for a new public-private partnership which will use the agency's artificial intelligence capabilities for biomedical research.

Former Citigroup CEO Sandy Weill and Energy Secretary Rick Perry told CNBC's ""Closing Bell "" in an exclusive interview that the partnership aims to improve the diagnosis of brain diseases and neurological disorders, which would result in more effective treatment.

""As one looks at science and the development of new science, especially AI and computing, you really need to have partners to make things work."" Weill said. ""It's too expensive for anybody to try to do it by themselves.""

The partnership between the federal government and the Weill Foundation, involves Lawrence Livermore, Lawrence Berkeley and Argonne National laboratories, and was announced during a roundtable on DOE-fueled artificial intelligence at Lawrence Livermore Lab in Livermore, California.

The Department of Energy is currently home to the fastest supercomputers in the world.

The partnership aims to have new computers ready by 2022 that would run 15 time faster than current speeds.

""It will really break the logjam, especially as it related to neurodegenerative diseases,"" Weill said. ""And with everybody doing better, with the cancer research and with cardiovascular research, people are going to live longer. And we are all going to get these neurodegenerative diseases over time. And what we are working on is to prevent that because it would just be too costly.""

Perry said in the next 18 to 24 months, the department will have computers coming on board that will be between 50 to 100 times faster than today's computers. ""The improvement in health care, particularly in brain science, is going to be monumental, it's going to be world changing,"" Perry said.

Weill added it was important for the U.S. to beat China in this field.

When asked about current U.S.-China trade relations, Weill said it was important for the United States and China to figure out a way to get along with each other. ""With the two countries partnering for the future, I think we will end up with a better world, a safer world."""
Justice Department inspector general reportedly completes FISA abuse investigation,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-23-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice-department-inspector-general-reportedly-completes-fisa-abuse-investigation,"Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz has reportedly completed his investigation into alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuses by the Justice Department and FBI.

The Hill's John Solomon made the announcement Thursday evening on Fox News.

""What I can report tonight, Sean, is that the IG has completed his work on the FISA abuse report. It's expected to be transmitted as early as next week to Attorney General William Barr and that will begin a process of declassification,"" the investigative reporter told host Sean Hannity.

""I think we are still on track for that timeline, I've been saying on your show: mid-September to early October seems the most likely release point,"" Solomon said. ""It's going to be a tough report,"" he added.

The timeline for Horowitz's investigation, which began in March 2018, has repeatedly shifted over the past few months because of various developments.

Horowitz's team is examining the FISA application and three renewals beginning in October 2016 to surveil former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. The applications relied heavily on the unverified dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele, who was hired by opposition research firm Fusion GPS and funded by Democrats.

Republicans have argued the dossier's Democratic benefactors, which included Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign and the Democratic National Committee, and its author's anti-Trump bias were left out of the FISA applications, and they have demanded accountability. Democrats countered that the FBI acted appropriately, saying the Justice Department and the FBI met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis for probable cause.

Meanwhile, Barr's ""investigation into the investigators"" is underway, and the attorney general has said he is working very closely with Horowitz. The inspector general can recommend prosecutions, and U.S. Attorney John Durham, whom Barr tasked to lead the review of the origins of the Russia investigation, has the ability to convene a grand jury and subpoena people outside the government.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, has promised a ""deep dive"" into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation after Horowitz completes his work. Over the past few days, the South Carolina Republican has said he expects Horowitz's findings to be ""damning and ugly"" for the DOJ. Graham also said he plans to meet with Barr this week to ""talk to him about how best to tell the story"" and predicted that after his report is released Horowitz will deliver ""chilling testimony"" in front of his panel."

""It would help our financial decision immensely,"" Darwin wrote to EPA Chief of staff Ryan Jackson in the email. ""If not out of the question, I would be happy to forward her resume and references (which I would suggest you check - everyone loves her almost as much as I do).""

The former Arizona state official’s wife Veronica Darwin was later hired to be a senior adviser to the administrator for Land and Emergency Management.

Pruitt later came under fire for using his position at EPA to try to get jobs for close acquaintances, including a clerking internship for his daughter at the White House and a job for his wife opening up a Chick-fil-A franchise.

Wheeler in his email Friday said Henry Darwin will be stepping down from his role and will once again take the title of assistant deputy administrator at EPA. In the role he will “concentrate on the deployment of EPA’s Lean Management System (ELMS)” which he will do from Arizona.

“Given the amount of time he already spends traveling to the regional offices to deploy ELMS, his relocation to Phoenix should not impact his ability to help us become even more effective in carrying out our very important mission. In addition, Henry will be here at headquarters on a regular basis,” Wheeler wrote.

Wheeler announced Veronica Darwin left the agency on Aug. 9.

“While at EPA, Veronica managed implementation of the Superfund Task Force recommendations, and led other Administrator priorities like children’s health, and the development of the action plan for lead. These key initiatives will remain Administrator priorities, however Veronica’s leadership will be greatly missed,” wrote Wheeler.

When contacted, EPA did not provide details about the nature of the departures. An EPA spokesperson later hailed Veronica Darwin's 18 years of professional experience.

""Veronica Darwin has spent more than 18 years working extensively on environmental waste issues that included roles as a compliance officer at EPA’s Region 9 office (7 years) and as deputy division director for the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality’s Waste Divisions Program (total of 8 years),"" EPA spokesman Michael Abboud said.

""To only refer to her as Henry’s wife does a disservice to Veronica, but the incredible work she has done her whole career.""

Trump claims he has 'absolute right' to order US companies out of China under 1977 law,https://www.cnn.com,['Veronica Stracqualursi'],08-24-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/24/politics/trump-china-trade-war-emergency-economic-powers-act/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump claimed he has the ""absolute right"" to ""order"" US companies to stop doing business with China that would involve using his broad executive authority in a new and unprecedented way under a 1977 law.

On Friday, China unveiled a new round of retaliatory tariffs on about $75 billion worth of US goods, the latest escalation in an on-going trade war that's putting a strain on the world's two largest economies. In response, Trump wrote on Twitter later Friday: ""Our great American companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China including bringing ...your companies HOME and making your products in the USA.""

When leaving the White House for the G7 summit in France, Trump told reporters, ""I have the absolute right to do that, but we'll see how it goes."" He later explained that he was referring to the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), and in a Friday tweet wrote: ""For all of the Fake News Reporters that don't have a clue as to what the law is relative to Presidential powers, China, etc., try looking at the Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977. Case closed!""

Trump's latest comments again raise questions as to how far the President's authority goes under the IEEPA . In May, Trump threatened to slap Mexico with punitive tariffs unless it slowed the passage of migrants from Central America to the US. The IEEPA, according to the Congressional Research Service, has never been invoked to impose tariffs, and Trump ultimately drew back at the last minute.

The IEEPA, passed in the wake of Watergate and Vietnam, gives Trump ""broad authority to regulate a variety of economic transactions following a declaration of national emergency,"" according to an analysis by the CRS.

Those presidential powers can be used ""to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat....to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States.""

Under the IEEPA, the President has to consult with Congress before invoking his authority and, after declaring a national emergency, send a report to Congress explaining why.

This authority has been used frequently; there have been 54 national emergencies, 29 of which are ongoing. In the first use of the IEEPA, during the Iran hostage crisis in 1979, President Jimmy Carter imposed trade sanctions against Iran, freezing Iranian assets in the US, according to CRS.

Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas and a CNN legal analyst, told CNN in May that what Trump wanted to do under the law with Mexico may have been within the authority given to the White House by Congress -- though it might not have been what Congress ever intended.

""The idea behind these authorities is that the President is better situated to make those kinds of determinations than Congress, especially when they're time-sensitive,"" Vladeck told CNN at the time. ""So I think the President's conduct may well be within the letter of the law here. But, as with the National Emergencies Act, I very much doubt this kind of exercise of the authority conferred by the statute is what Congress had in mind.""

On Saturday, Vladeck again weighed in, tweeting: ""One of the enduring phenomena of the Trump era is going to be the list of statutes that give far too much power to the President, but that many didn't used to worry about—assuming there'd be political safeguards. Today's entrant: The International Emergency Economic Powers Act.""

Under the law, though, Congress can end an emergency with a joint resolution.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, who has mounted a longshot bid against Trump for the 2020 Republican presidential nomination, called it ""outrageous"" that a US President would tell US companies how to conduct business."
Can Trump Actually Buy Greenland?

U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed an interest in buying Greenland, the world’s biggest island and a self-ruling territory of Denmark. While the seriousness of his intentions is unclear -- and the response from the other side of the imagined transaction was a sturdy “no” -- the proposal raises questions as to whether such a transaction is even feasible.

1. Why would Trump want to buy Greenland?

A real estate baron before his turn to politics, Trump has a history of analyzing geopolitical issues through the lens of a property developer. During his 2018 meeting with Kim Jong Un, for example, Trump spoke of the potential he sees for beach hotels and condos in North Korea. Plus, as Trump surely knows, other U.S. presidents have made their mark in history for such grand ideas.

2. Why is Greenland interesting for the U.S.?

Besides being bigger than Mexico and Saudi Arabia, Greenland has abundant resources and a strategic location near the warming Arctic. Located in the northern Atlantic Ocean between Europe and America, the island has long been a nexus of tensions among the U.S., Russia, Canada, Denmark and Norway. It’s already home to a strategic U.S. air base and radar station. In 1968, a B-52 bomber carrying nuclear weapons crashed near the Thule base in northwestern Greenland, causing radioactive contamination. More recently, Denmark stopped China from gaining a foothold on its territory by agreeing to co-fund the construction of two new airports.

3. Is the idea totally outlandish?

Until a century ago, these kinds of transactions were not unusual: The U.S. bought the territory of Louisiana from France for $15 million in 1803, and Andrew Johnson is remembered as the president who oversaw the acquisition of Alaska from Russia in 1867. There’s even a precedent involving Denmark. The government in Copenhagen sold what are now known as the U.S. Virgin Islands in 1917. There are in fact plenty of other islands for sale, but they tend to be smaller and located in warmer climates. But as the BBC points out, Joseph Blocher of the Duke University School of Law wrote in 2012 that the “market for sovereign territory seems to have dried up” as it does “not seem to be for sale.”

4. How much would Greenland cost to buy?

Since the 830,000 square-mile (2.1 million square-kilometer) island isn’t currently on the market, there are no valuations available. However, for a sense of how much it might fetch, it’s worth noting that its gross domestic product totaled just over $2.7 billion in 2017. The island receives an annual subsidy of about $500 million from Denmark. For perspective, the purchase price of Alaska in 1867, $7.2 million, would translate to just $125 million today -- which most would agree would be quite a bargain.

5. How would Trump go about buying Greenland?

It’s unclear. Adjunct Professor Rasmus Leander Nielsen of Greenland University has told local media that Denmark can’t sell Greenland because its home-rule law of 2009 “clearly states that Greenlanders are their own people.” Trump’s best hope would be for the territory to gain independence and then choose to arrange a sale to the U.S. As it turns out, breaking away from Denmark has been discussed in Greenland, where advocates of independence have touted 2021, the 300th anniversary of colonization, as a possible leave date. One argument in favor of independence is that Greenland should have a closer association with North America, which is much nearer than Denmark.

6. Could Trump do this on his own?

Under the U.S. Constitution, the U.S. Congress would have to approve money for any such purchase. But Trump has shown a willingness to try to go around Congress’s power of the purse. When it refused to appropriate money for more fencing on the U.S.-Mexico border, Trump raided the Pentagon’s budget to find funds for it -- and the Supreme Court backed him up.

7. What might the next step be?

According to the New York Times, skeptical Trump advisers have told him they would investigate the matter further, but only because they’d rather not tell him that the purchase is impossible. Trump would have had an opportunity to discuss the matter personally with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, but the president canceled his planned Sept. 2-3 state visit to Denmark after his Greenland scheme was rebuked.

WV MetroNews Autopsy: Vietnam veteran was not diabetic but died of insulin injection,http://wvmetronews.com,['Brad Mcelhinny'],08-26-2019,2019,8,http://wvmetronews.com/2019/08/26/autopsy-vietnam-veteran-who-was-not-diabetic-died-of-fatal-insulin-injection/,"By Brad McElhinny in News | August 26, 2019 at 11:45AM

CHARLESTON, W.Va. — An autopsy report for a Vietnam veteran who died suspiciously at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center concludes that the man — who was not diabetic — was injected with a fatal amount of insulin.

The autopsy uses clinical language to describe horror.

“This case represents the administration of unprescribed insulin to a non-hyperglycemic, non-diabetic patient in a hospital setting,” the report states.

“Based on the investigative and autopsy findings, the manner of death is homicide.”

Felix McDermott Felix McDermott

The death of 82-year-old retired U.S. Army Sgt. Felix McDermott is drawing attention from the public, as well as West Virginia’s congressional delegation, including senators Shelley Moore Capito and Joe Manchin.

Manchin said he spoke today with leaders with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, as well as leadership at the VA hospital in Clarksburg.

A statement put out by Manchin’s office made reference to a total of 11 suspicious deaths at the VA hospital.

“These crimes shock the conscience and I’m still appalled they were not only committed but that our veterans, who have sacrificed so much for our country, were the victims,” Manchin stated.

McDermott’s family has filed a claim over his death with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.

McDermott’s family was told by VA investigators that nine or ten additional patients of the Louis A. Johnson VA Medical Center had been given fatal injections of insulin, according to the claim.

“We don’t know whether this is just an unbelievably incompetent person, which is hard to believe, or if someone is doing this willfully to people who have served our country,” said Tony O’Dell, a Charleston lawyer who is representing McDermott’s family.

McDermott was a Vietnam veteran who retired after 20 years of U.S. Army Service. He later served as a member of the Pennsylvania National Guard.

He was admitted for treatment at the VA Medical Center in Clarksburg on April 9, 2018 because he had choked on some food and developed aspiration pneumonia.

At first, his health improved.

Then, on April 9, 2018, his condition plummeted. He couldn’t catch his breath. A fingerstick blood glucose test showed that he had critically low blood sugar.

The situation was so critical that his family was called in.

“All of a sudden they’re called in the early morning hours. He’s taken this sudden turn for the worse,” O’Dell said on MetroNews’ “Talkline.

By 9 a.m., McDermott was dead.

“Really, no answers were given to the family at all. They really were just left in the dark. He took a sudden turn. They didn’t know what to think. They were surprised.”

McDermott was buried on April 13, 2018.

The family grieved as time passed. After a few months, the family was asked for permission to exhume McDermott’s body.

The exhumation occurred Oct. 23, 2018, and McDermott’s remains were sent to the Dover Air Force Base for autopsy.

The resulting autopsy report confirmed that McDermott was not diabetic and had no history of oral hypoglycemic use or previous insulin administration. The autopsy report also confirmed there were no hospital orders for the administration of insulin.

Yet, the autopsy identified a subcutaneous insulin injection site on the left side of his abdomen.

The report concluded that McDermott “died of exogenous insulin administration.”

“If the medical examiner’s conclusion is correct,” the family’s claim against the VA states, “Felix Kirk McDermott was murdered while he was in the care and custody of the Louis A. Johnson VA Medical Center despite the VAMC being on notice of previous wrongful injections.”

Wesley Walls, who leads public affairs and community relations services at the medical facility, told MetroNews on Monday the allegations do not involve any current employees.

“Immediately upon discovering these serious allegations, Louis A. Johnson VA Medical Center leadership brought them to the attention of VA’s inspector general while putting safeguards in place to ensure the safety of each and every one of our patients,” he said.

Walls added Manchin’s office was made aware of the allegations on Aug. 7, 2018, as were Capito’s office and the staff of Rep. David McKinley, R-W.Va.

“VA is cooperating fully with the inspector general’s ongoing investigation, and for additional questions we refer you to them,” he concluded.

Joe Manchin Joe Manchin

Manchin, who had spoken today with officials, said the investigation has identified a suspect. Manchin said that person was “removed immediately from any patient care.”

“I did find out – the hospital did everything they could do when they found the person of suspicion,” Manchin said on MetroNews’ “Talkline.” “They have secured and feel confident everything in the world is done for their patients.”

He added, “There has been concern that they’re looking into all the patients that person might have been in contact with.”

Manchin expressed disappointment that the public just learned of the situation even though McDermott’s death was a year ago.

“It’s very upsetting that it has taken this long for us to have gotten any kind of news,” Manchin said.

The claim by McDermott’s family does not conclude whether the insulin injection was negligence or intentional.

O’Dell, the attorney, says the family is experiencing “total betrayal.”

“Put yourself in that position where it’s your father and someone may have purposefully killed that person,” he said.
