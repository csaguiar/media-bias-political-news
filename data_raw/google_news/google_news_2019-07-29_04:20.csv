"Trump ramps up war of words with Elijah Cummings, calls congressman 'racist'",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Talia Kaplan', 'Talia Kaplan Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com. Follow Her On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-elijah-cummings-president-calls-congressman-racist,"President Trump ramped up his feud with House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., on Sunday calling the congressman “racist,” not long after critics had claimed the president's initial tweets about Cummings were racist themselves.

Trump tweeted Sunday afternoon, “If racist Elijah Cummings would focus more of his energy on helping the good people of his district, and Baltimore itself, perhaps progress could be made in fixing the mess that he has helped to create over many years of incompetent leadership.”

He added, “His radical ‘oversight’ is a joke!”

TRUMP THROWS 'SQUAD' FEUD BACK AT PELOSI AFTER 'RACIST' ACCUSATION: 'DEMOCRATS ALWAYS PLAY THE RACE CARD'

The day before, Trump also called out Cummings, calling him a “brutal bully” for how he spoke to border patrol officials. Trump said the congressman’s Baltimore district was in “FAR WORSE” shape than the situation at the southern border.

That rebuke resulted in claims of racism from Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Trump hit back, citing claims of racism against Pelosi from some progressive Democrats.

The president appeared to be referring to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., accusing Pelosi earlier this month of “singling out” women of color. That was after Pelosi dismissed Ocasio-Cortez and her “Squad” -- including Reps. Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley -- as being more influential on social media than in Congress. Trump defended Pelosi at the time.

On Saturday, Pelosi stood by Cummings and the city of Baltimore, where she was born, and rebuked Trump, calling his remarks “racist.”

NANCY PELOSI BACK ELIJAH CUMMINGS, BLASTS TRUMP'S 'RACIST' TWITTER ATTACK

“We all reject racist attacks against [Cummings] and support his steadfast leadership,” Pelosi tweeted Saturday.

Trump responded, “There is nothing racist in stating plainly what most people already know, that Elijah Cummings has done a terrible job for the people of his district, and of Baltimore itself. Dems always play the race card when they are unable to win with facts. Shame!”

Later Sunday, Trump pointed out that “African American unemployment is the lowest (best) in the history of the United States,” under his administration.

Trump went on to say he was “Waiting for Nancy and Elijah to say, ‘Thank you, Mr. President!’”

Cummings did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment.

Among Trump's tweets Saturday, one included a video purportedly showing blight in Baltimore. He asked the congressman, “why don’t you focus on your district!?""

Cummings responded to Trump’s initial criticism, however, writing in a tweet, “Mr. President, I go home to my district daily. Each morning, I wake up, and I go and fight for my neighbors.”

He added, “It is my constitutional duty to conduct oversight of the Executive Branch. But, it is my moral duty to fight for my constituents.”

Et July']",07-28-2019,2019,7,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/07/28/chris-wallace-refutes-mick-mulvaney-meuller-testimony-exoneration-claim/1851843001/,"CLOSE Rep. Nadler asked Robert Mueller to expound upon his ""no"" answer on whether report offer ""total exoneration"" of President Donald Trump. USA TODAY

President Donald Trump and many of congressional Republicans treated former special counsel Robert's Mueller's testimony last week before two House committees as a victory, but for Democrats like Rep, Jerry Nadler the possibility of impeachment proceedings against the president remains very real.

""My personal view is that he richly deserves impeachment,"" Nadler said during an interview with CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. ""He has done many impeachable offenses. He's violated the law six ways from Sunday.""

But the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over impeachment, said his personal view on whether the president should be impeached is not the issue. ""The question is, 'Can we develop enough evidence to put before the American people?'"" he said.

To that end, Nadler said House Democrats and his committee will continue to gather evidence and investigate ""the corruptions of the administration, the abuses of power, what Mueller showed, the possible violations of the Emoluments Clause; all the things that might cause us to recommend articles of impeachment.""

During an interview on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney conceded that the impeachment battle is ""far from over,"" but he said Nadler's was trying to take down the president because he is ""facing a primary from his left in New York.""

""He is falling over himself to become more and more progressive in order to try and keep his job and not lose to the next AOC,"" Mulvaney said, referring to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's upset win over Rep. Joseph Crowley in New York's June 2018 Democratic primary. He said only left-wing Democrats still wanted to pursue the ""bizarre"" course of impeachment.

From impeachment to indictment: 5 repercussions from Robert Mueller's testimony

Mulvaney, like Trump, claimed Mueller's testimony about his investigation into Russian election meddling had cleared the president of any wrongdoing, and falsely said Mueller had testified that he would ""absolutely not"" have indicted Trump if he weren't the president.

""No, that's not what he said,"" said host Chris Wallace.

""He said we didn't because of the OLC, the Office of Legal Counsel guidelines,"" Wallace said, referring to a 2000 Justice Department determination that ""a sitting President is constitutionally immune from indictment and criminal prosecution.""

""I actually just think you're wrong on that,"" Mulvaney said.

""The record will show what it shows. I promise you, you're wrong,"" Wallace replied.

Fact check: Trump falsely claims Mueller exonerated him

During his Wednesday morning appearance before the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., had asked Mueller if he would have indicted Trump were it not for that OLC guideline.

""That is correct,"" Mueller replied.

But at the opening of his afternoon testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, Mueller clarified that he did not think Lieu's assertion was ""the correct way to say it.""

""We did not reach a determination as to whether the president committed a crime,"" Mueller testified.

Mulvaney told Wallace on Wednesday, ""If they had the evidence to indict the president, they would've done it, and they don't because there was no obstruction.""

But Wallace said Mueller testified that his investigation was ""not a witch hunt, not a hoax and the president is not exonerated,"" despite Trump's claims to the contrary.

Mulvaney said it was not the special counsel's job to exonerate the president and that if he failed to prove a crime, Trump is ""innocent until proven guilty.""

This weekend, Trump claimed Muerll's testimony included many ""exonerating things"" and called it ""a disaster for this illegal Democrat inspired Witch Hunt.""

“One of the biggest things to come out of Mueller’s testimony was the fact that when he was asked, was there ANYTHING that impeded your investigation, the answer was a clear, unequivocal, NO.” Misty Marris @FoxNews True, but many other great “exonerating” things came out..... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 28, 2019

....Robert Mueller’s testimony, and the Mueller Report itself, was a disaster for this illegal Democrat inspired Witch Hunt. It is an embarrassment to the USA that they don’t know how to stop. They can’t help themselves, they are totally lost, they are Clowns! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 28, 2019

Nadler felt Mueller's testimony had ""broken the logjam"" and demonstrated that Trump and Attorney General William Barr ""were lying to the American people consistently, saying that the Mueller report found no obstruction, no collusion, and exonerated the president.""

But, like Mulvaney, Nadler was accused of misrepresenting Mueller's words about the OLC ruling. ""State of the Union"" host Jake Tapper cited a statement from Nadler on Friday in which he quoted from Mueller's exchange with Lieu without explaining that the former special counsel later walked his response back.

But Nadler believed Mueller's report very clearly lays out the evidence that Trump obstructed justice and that the OLC ruling was the only reason the president had not been indicted. He said Mueller was being ""careful"" with his words because, ""He thought it unfair to the president to say he was guilty, and was likely guilty of a crime, when the president couldn't defend himself in a trial that wouldn't occur"" because of the OLC guideline.

Fact check: Nadler misrepresents Mueller Mueller testimony

Nadler said Trump could be indicted ""after he leaves office"" or is ""impeached and removed from office, if you can prove those crimes.""

Currently, about 100 House Democrats have expressed support for the opening of impeachment proceedings. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has said more evidence should be gathered before a decision is made.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Sunday on ""Meet the Press"" that he was worried about the ""message of taking an impeachment case to trial"" and then losing that trial in the Republican-controlled Senate, as well as losing the argument with the American public.

Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week"" that Mueller's report laid out ""behavior that was unbecoming of an occupant of the White House"" but did not clearly establish that any criminal act had been committed. He indicated he did not believe the president had obstructed justice because Mueller's ""investigation was not impeded. It was not hindered. And it was not stopped.""

But Hurd agreed that the Trump campaign's willingness to accept help from the Russians and its numerous contacts with Russian officials – as well as the dishonesty about how long the negotiations for a Trump Tower in Moscow continued – were ""a concern.""

The former CIA officer said Mueller made it clear ""this wasn't a one-time event"" and that the ""strategy by the Russian government to undermine trust in our democratic institution"" is ongoing.

Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that he is ""less focused on relitigating 2016"" and ""more focused on trying to make sure our elections are safe in 2020.""

He said the Department of Homeland Security has ""upped its game"" in defending states' voting systems. But he said more needed to be done, calling for states to move to systems with a paper ballot backup and for an increased effort to deal with disinformation campaigns on social media like the one used by the Russians in 2016.

""I don't care whether you're a Trump supporter or a Trump opponent, but all of us across the political spectrum should be concerned when foreign nations try to tip the balance in our democratic process to whatever candidate,"" Warner said.

Trump administration's aim to crack down on food-stamp 'loophole' deepens ideological clash,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Frank Miles', 'Frank Miles Is A Reporter', 'Editor Covering Geopolitics', 'Military', 'Crime', 'Technology', 'Sports For Foxnews.Com. His Email Is Frank.Miles Foxnews.Com.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/food-stamp-program-loophole-crackdown-social-safety-net,"A proposed rule change for the food-stamp program, outlined this past week by the Agriculture Department, has highlighted the ideological clash between President Trump’s attempts to tighten government entitlement programs and efforts in some states to widen the social safety net.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said the proposed rule change was intended to close a “loophole” that states have misused to “effectively bypass important eligibility guidelines.”

Current federal guidelines have forbidden people making more than 130 percent of the poverty level from getting aid through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). However, officials in many states have said the cap was too restrictive, especially in cities with a high cost of living, prompting them to bypass the limits.

At issue is a federal policy allowing people who receive benefits through other government programs, such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) to automatically qualify for SNAP. The practice, called categorical eligibility, was intended partly to reduce duplicative paperwork, and also has allowed states to grant food aid to more people.

Under the Trump administration’s proposed rule change, people in any state would need to be authorized to receive at least $50 a month in TANF benefits for a minimum of six months to qualify automatically for SNAP. Subsidies for childcare, employment and work-related transportation would still count but the proposal would stop states from linking eligibility to the receipt of an informational brochure.

The proposed change also stirred outrage and uncertainty among some of the nation’s 36 million SNAP recipients who stood to be affected.

“I think it’s pretty rotten,” said Lisa Vega, a single mother of two teenage boys in suburban Chicago who applied for food aid last month after she lost her job. Because she received regular support payments from her ex-husband, Vega said her SNAP eligibility likely hinged on the income eligibility exceptions that Trump’s administration has aimed to end.

“A lot of these politicians don’t realize that us Americans out here are living paycheck to paycheck, one crisis away from being homeless,” Vega said. “You’re just going to take this kind of stuff away from us when we need it the most?”

Advocates for the poor have said states’ exceptions to federal guidelines helped people gradually transition off SNAP when they got modest raises at work and have enabled seniors and the disabled to save money without going hungry. Advocates also said the eligibility exceptions have helped people such as Vega whose income may be slightly above the federal threshold but who have little money left over after paying high housing and utility bills.

DE BLASIO CONTINUES FEUD WITH TRUMP, SAYS HE 'WILL NOT BE WELCOME BACK' IN NYC AFTER PRESIDENCY

“I think the Trump administration is trying to make a lot of hay out of how this policy option functions in practice to draw a lot of skepticism about it,” said Nolan Downey, an attorney at the Shriver Center on Poverty Law in Chicago who helped Vega apply for food aid. “But I think if people have an understanding of what the outcome really was meant to be, it’s something that seems a lot less dubious.”

The loopholes came under public scrutiny last year after self-described millionaire Rob Undersander testified before the Minnesota legislature that he and his wife legally received about $6,000 in SNAP aid over 19 months because his considerable assets and Individual Retirement Account withdrawals didn’t count against his eligibility.

Undersander, who said he's a Trump supporter, told The Associated Press this week he had been trying to make a point — not game the system — and praised Trump’s administration for proposing to tighten eligibility standards.

“I think that states just found this loophole, and then I think they’ve been abusing a loophole,” Undersander said.

Opinion | The Real Problem With Trump’s Rallies,https://www.nytimes.com,['Kevin M. Kruse'],07-28-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/28/opinion/trump-george-wallace-rallies-the-squad.html,"By articulating their audiences’ hatred, both men effectively encouraged them to act on it.

Mr. Wallace’s rallies regularly erupted in violence, as his fans often took his words not just seriously but also literally. Mr. Wallace often talked about dragging hippies “by the hair of their head.” At a Detroit rally in 1968, his supporters did just that, dragging leftist protesters out of their seats and through a thicket of metal chairs. As they were roughed up, the candidate signaled his approval from the stage: “You came here for trouble and you got it.”

Mr. Trump’s rallies have likewise been marked by violence unseen in other modern campaigns. At a 2015 rally in Birmingham, Ala., for example, an African-American protester was punched, kicked and choked. Rather than seeking to reduce the violence from his supporters, Mr. Trump rationalized it, saying “maybe he should have been roughed up, because it was absolutely disgusting what he was doing.”

This leads us to the significant difference between Mr. Wallace and Mr. Trump. Mr. Wallace’s targets were, for the most part, presented in the abstract. Though he denounced broad categories of generic enemies — “agitators,” “anarchists” and “communists” — he rarely went after an individual by name.

Mr. Trump, in pointed contrast, has used his rallies to single out specific enemies. During the 2016 campaign, he demonized his political opponents in the primaries and the general election, and also denounced private individuals, from Megyn Kelly, the former Fox News anchor, to the former Miss Universe Alicia Machado and the federal judge Gonzalo Curiel.

At recent rallies, he has targeted four Democratic House members who have criticized him and his administration — Representatives Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley.

Participants at Mr. Trump’s rallies have been moved to attack individuals he’s singled out. For most rally participants, the attacks have been confined to ominous but nevertheless nonviolent chants — from the 2016 cries of “Lock her up!” to the recent refrain of “Send her back!” But a handful have gone further, targeting the individuals named by the president with death threats and even attempts at violence."
John Ratcliffe: AG William Barr will deliver justice to any Obama officials who committed crimes,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-28-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/john-ratcliffe-ag-william-barr-will-deliver-justice-to-any-obama-officials-who-committed-crimes,"A top Republican investigator said accountability is coming for any of those individuals who may have committed crimes during the Trump-Russia investigation.

With the Justice Department conducting a review of that operation, Rep. John Ratcliffe said during a Fox News interview Sunday that he trusts Attorney General William Barr and Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz to provide answers.

And while Ratcliffe said he does not want to prematurely accuse any specific person of a crime — as Democrats have done with President Trump — he stressed that it is clear crimes were committed by people during the Obama administration, including government officials.

“I think the first thing we need to do is make sure we don’t do what the Democrats have done,"" the Texas Republican told host Maria Bartiromo on Sunday Morning Futures. ""They accused Donald Trump of a crime and then they try and reverse engineer a process to justify that accusation. So I’m not going to accuse any specific person of any specific crime, I just want there to be a fair process to get there. What I do know as a former federal prosecutor is that it does appear that there were crimes committed during the Obama administration.”

Ratcliffe, a Texas Republican on the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees who was critical of special counsel Robert Mueller during his testimony in front of those committees last Wednesday, is Trump's pick to replace outgoing Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats. Although many of the GOP lines of questioning last week focused on the origins of the investigation, Mueller largely shut them down, often saying these were issues that were ""outside my purview.""

Ratcliffe explained this is why Barr, who has tasked U.S. Attorney John Durham to lead the so-called investigation of the investigators, must fill in the gaps.

“Now the things that Bob Mueller said he didn’t know about and his team clearly didn’t look at, those are things that would be fair for Bill Barr and the Department of Justice to look at. Because we know that things happened in the Obama administration that haven’t been answered. There’s been no accountability for that yet,"" Ratcliffe said.

“Well, the special counsel told us ... that they didn't do it. And if they didn't do it, the only place we can get the answers is from the Justice Department right now,"" Ratcliffe said. ""The American people want that. Their faith and trust, Maria, has been shaken in our Justice Department, and the only way to get that back is for there to be real accountability with a very fair process. Again, I have supreme confidence in Bill Barr's ability to deliver that. And at the end of the day, wherever the outcome may be, as long as we know that the process was fair, the evaluation was fair, justice will be done. Look, the truth always defends itself.”

Relevant to the Barr-Durham review is Horowitz's inspector general investigation into alleged government surveillance abuses against at least one adviser for Trump's campaign, Carter Page, an American citizen who was never charged with wrongdoing. Barr has said he is working closely with Horowitz, who is expected to wrap up his inquiry this fall, and the Justice Department could take prosecutorial action depending on the findings and recommendations.

Ratcliffe recommended three leads for the ""investigation of the investigators.""

The first related to former national security adviser Michael Flynn. “You talked earlier about Michael Flynn. His phone call with the Russian ambassador was a highly classified NSA intercept. Someone in the Obama administration leaked that call to the Washington Post. That’s a felony,"" he said.

Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions vowed in February 2018 that the Justice Department was investigating that leak, and that he was overseeing the inquiry himself. “I am directing it personally and we’re pursuing it aggressively,” Sessions said at the time.

Ratcliffe suggested investigators also look into conflicting congressional testimony between Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson and Justice Department official Bruce Ohr. Fusion GPS was the opposition research firm behind British ex-spy Christopher Steele's dossier, which was full of unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia and was used extensively by the FBI in Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to justify surveillance of Page. Ohr acted as an unofficial back channel between Steel and the FBI. “Glenn Simpson from Fusion GPS in talking about the Steele dossier, said under oath that he and Bruce Ohr did not meet until after the election. Bruce Ohr said under oath that they met three months before the election. One of them is not telling the truth. We need a process to identify that,"" Ratcliffe said.

The third area of interest, Ratcliffe said, is former FBI Director James Comey's memos on his interactions with Trump before he was fired in May 2017. “Where it all started, Jim Comey. He admitted that he leaked his confidential conversations with the president to a reporter. Did that include classified information? We need a fair processes to find out answers to that,"" Ratcliffe said.

Comey said he leaked one of his memos to a friend to leak to the press in the hope that it “might prompt the appointment of a special counsel.” On May 16, 2017, the first Comey memo was reported for the first time. On May 17, 2017, then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller to serve as special counsel.

“I trust, because Bill Barr has earned my trust already and the trust of the American people, that there'll be a fair process with John Durham and with Michael Horowitz to get answers to that and provide accountability where it really belongs,"" Ratcliffe said."
Acting DHS boss McAleenan praises Supreme Court 'victory' sanctioning use of Pentagon funds for border wall,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Frank Miles', 'Frank Miles Is A Reporter', 'Editor Covering Geopolitics', 'Military', 'Crime', 'Technology', 'Sports For Foxnews.Com. His Email Is Frank.Miles Foxnews.Com.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/kevin-mcaleenan-dhs-supreme-court-victory-pentagon-funds-border-wall,"Kevin McAleenan, the acting Homeland Security secretary, told Fox News on Sunday it's a “big victory” that the Supreme Court cleared the way for the Trump administration to tap billions of dollars in Pentagon funds to build sections of a border wall with Mexico.

“There was a big victory at the Supreme Court to allow the Department of Defense to move forward with that $2.5 billion to really accelerate the progress on the wall, and kind of double what we're doing with the congressionally appropriated funding, which is going well, as you noted up to 54 miles since we talked,” he told Maria Bartiromo on “Sunday Morning Futures.”

The court’s five conservative justices gave the administration the green light on Friday to begin work on four contracts it has awarded using Defense Department money. Lower courts had frozen funding for the projects while a lawsuit over the money proceeded. The court’s four liberal justices wouldn’t have allowed construction to start.

The Supreme Court’s action reversed the decision of a trial court, which initially froze the funds in May, and an appeals court, which kept that freeze in place earlier this month. The freeze had prevented the government from tapping approximately $2.5 billion in Pentagon money to replace existing sections of barrier in Arizona, California and New Mexico with more robust fencing.

The case in which the Supreme Court ruled began after the 35-day partial government shutdown that started in December of last year. The shutdown ended in February after Congress approved approximately $1.4 billion in border wall funding, but the amount was far less than the $5.7 billion Presiden Trump was seeking. The president then declared a national emergency to take cash from other government accounts to use to construct sections of wall.

KIDNAPPED AUSTRIAN TRIATHLETE SWEET-TALKS CAPTOR INTO LETTING HER GO: REPORT

The money Trump identified included $3.6 billion from military construction funds, $2.5 billion in Defense Department money and $600 million from the Treasury Department’s asset forfeiture fund.

The case before the Supreme Court involved just the $2.5 billion in Defense Department funds, which the administration said would be used to build more than 100 miles of fencing.

One project would replace 46 miles of barrier in New Mexico for $789 million. Another would replace 63 miles in Arizona for $646 million. The other two projects in California and Arizona were smaller.

The other funds were not at issue in the case. The Treasury Department funds so far have survived legal challenges, and Customs and Border Protection has earmarked the money for work in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley but has not yet awarded contracts. Transfer of the $3.6 billion in military construction funds was awaiting approval from the defense secretary.

McAleenan told Bartiromo that “building every day down there in the border … that's already providing significant new operational capability, and helping us control some high traffic areas of the border.”

He said that he did believe the situation at the border has been improving by “almost every measure,” but the only way to eradicate the immigration crisis completely would be through congressional action.

The $100 million civil suit, which the Department of Justice filed in the Northern District of California, targets BTC-e for offering services to US residents without abiding by US financial regulations, including declining to register with FinCEN as a Money Services Business, failing to establish anti-money laundering procedures as stipulated under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), and failing to report suspicious activities.

From the complaint:

“At no point in time did BTC-e have any AML policies or procedures, let alone an effective program for detecting and preventing suspicious transactions. To the contrary, BTC-e’s lax policies encouraged persons engaged in criminal activity to use its services, and BTC-e became the virtual currency exchange of choice for criminals looking to launder their illegal proceeds.”

FinCEN had levied $88.6 million in penalties against BTC-e and $12 million in penalties against Vinnik, and the DOJ says that the lawsuit intends to “enforce” those fines.

Papadopoulos wants DOJ to examine $10K given to him by CIA or FBI,https://nypost.com,['July'],07-28-2019,2019,7,https://nypost.com/2019/07/28/papadopoulos-wants-doj-to-examine-10k-given-to-him-by-cia-or-fbi/,"Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos on Sunday said he is returning to Greece to get $10,000 given to him as part of a CIA or FBI setup to entrap him – and he now wants the Department of Justice to examine the cash.

Papadopoulos said he was given the money in Israel during the summer of 2017 from a guy he believes was a spy but turned the moolah over to his attorney for safekeeping in Greece.

“A man named Charles Tawil gave me this money under very suspicious circumstances. A simple Google search about this individual will reveal he was a CIA or State Department asset in South Africa during the ’90s and 2000s. I think around the time when Bob Mueller was the director of the FBI,” he told “Sunday Morning Futures” on Fox News.

Papadopoulos, who served 12 days in federal prison for lying to investigators about contacts with Russian-connected officials during the 2016 campaign, said he has a theory about why he was given the cash.

“The money, I gave it to my attorney in Greece because I felt it was given to me under very suspicious circumstances. And upon coming back to the United States I had about seven or eight FBI agents rummaging through my luggage looking for money,” he told Mario Bartiromo.

He believes it was part of a setup by the FBI or the special counsel Robert Mueller’s office to “bring a [Foreign Agent Registration Act] violation against me.”

He wants Attorney General William Barr and DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz to take a close look at the paper trail.

“Because I still have the bills and I think they are marked,” Papadopoulos said. “These bills that are still in Athens right now must be examined by the investigators because I think they are marked and they’re going to go all the way back to DOJ, under the previous FBI under Comey, and even the Mueller team.”

“If the Mueller team is going around entrapping campaign associates and Trump associates, the way they did to me — I am sure it wasn’t just me they did it to — it’s going to open up a massive can of worms,” he added.

Papadopoulos met with Joseph Misfud, a Maltese professor in London in early 2016 in London.

Misfud told him months before the Wikileaks published Hillary Clinton and Democratic National Committee emails that the Russians had dirt on the Democratic candidates.

Papadopoulos told Australian diplomat John Downer about Misfud’s assertions, and Downer forwarded the information to the FBI."
Trump fumes over border wall as budget deal advances,https://www.politico.com,"['Burgess Everett', 'Melanie Zanona']",07-28-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/28/donald-trump-border-wall-budget-1437590,"President Donald Trump has expressed frustration that border barriers going up haven't gotten adequate media attention. | Alex Wong/Getty Images white house Trump fumes over border wall as budget deal advances A September shutdown showdown is still a possibility, which Republicans are eager to avoid.

President Donald Trump is still fixated on his beloved border wall — complaining about media coverage and insisting to confidants behind closed doors that the replacement wall being funded by Congress is not getting the attention it deserves.

“The media is wrong. The wall is being built,” Trump told Senate Republicans at the White House last week, according to attendees. “400 miles of wall.”

Story Continued Below

And in private meetings at the White House this year, as well as publicly, Trump has voiced frustration with Democrats — and former Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) — for failing to implement his immigration priorities, according to multiple sources familiar with the conversations.

The Senate is on course to pass a sweeping, two-year budget agreement this week that averts the threat of default and avoids blunt spending cuts loathed by both parties.

But separate legislation to fund individual government agencies must still be passed by the end of September, and the bipartisan deal does little to spell out how Congress and the president will handle the issue that fueled the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.

The Supreme Court delivered Trump a major victory on Friday, ruling that his administration can start using $2.5 billion in unspent military funds to construct a wall along the southern border. That could help satisfy Trump if he feels like he can point to progress on a key campaign promise.

But Republicans readily acknowledge they don’t know how the fall funding fight will play out and are reluctant to predict what Trump will do. They don’t know how hard Trump will push for a border wall, not to mention other hot-button immigration provisions. If he won’t compromise with the Democrats who control the House, a shutdown fight could ensue — exactly what GOP leaders are eager to avoid heading into an election year.



“I’m sure there’s going to be a fight over the border wall,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a close Trump ally, who added that he is far more eager to overhaul asylum laws, as Trump has also demanded.

Republicans are still smarting from last winter’s 35-day shutdown after Congress denied Trump $5 billion for the wall, as well as the tough votes they were forced to take on upholding his national emergency declaration and unilateral funding transfer. Unless Trump rescinds his national emergency, Republicans expect to be forced to vote on it again as soon as September.

Given that ugly history, GOP leaders hope they’ve secured enough releases to keep Trump from picking a border wall fight that ends in another shutdown.

For instance, the budget deal preserves the president's power to redirect money from the Defense Department to a wall and included an agreement from Speaker Nancy Pelosi not to include “poison pill” policy provisions that might restrict Trump’s immigration agenda. Now, he's also been given a green light from the Supreme Court to spend excess military personnel funds and other Pentagon money on border wall construction.

There’s also always the possibility of a stopgap spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security that would provide roughly $1.4 billion for improvements to existing border barriers. One senator predicted that stopgap could be applied all the way until November 2020.

Yet Republicans are realistic about the toxic mix of issues facing them ahead of a funding deadline that will approach quickly after Congress returns from its August recess. The Homeland Security spending bill is likely to be the last one written, considering how controversial immigration policy has become. And it’s not just the border wall that could trip up Congress, but also detention beds and ICE funding.

“It’s going to be challenging, no doubt. We’re just going to work hard to get the president’s priorities,” said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), who leads the DHS spending committee. “We’re always going to be fighting over the wall and ICE beds, all the way until the election, even if we can settle it in our minds.”

Though the budget agreement is being widely sold as taking a shutdown off the table in September, few are willing to predict that it will stop another round of brinkmanship on the border. Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), a close Trump ally, said the president has not been boasting about the transfer authority he maintains, suggesting he’s still unsatisfied.

“It seems like the border wall is moving along so slowly even with money, much less without it,” Cramer said.

Continuing current funding for DHS would still give Trump wall money, albeit money for specific sections of fencing that have already been funded. Several lawmakers noted privately that, given those limitations, such a stopgap bill could annoy the president.

Democrats say they are pleased with their negotiating position heading into the fall since it preserves the status quo, even though the budget agreement maintains the president’s transfer authority, which he could try to use as a back door to slip billions into his border wall.

“I would like to see the current authority restricted,” said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.). “Of course, I’m concerned about it. But what I’m saying is: We’re not in any worse shape because of this agreement.”

Republicans are actively touting the preservation of the president’s border wall transfer authority as a huge concession by Democrats. They say that even though Democrats have the House, they won’t be able to stop the president from moving around money.

“It’s a win for the White House,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas).

GOP lawmakers also said Trump has been trying to brainstorm new ways to notch progress on one of his signature campaign issues as he heads into 2020.

“I can tell you, when we were able to last talk as a group with him, he was very frustrated,” said Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), a member of the House Freedom Caucus. “But he is always upbeat about new ideas. ‘How can I do this? How can we construct this?’”

Many Republicans are trying to redirect the president to other immigration fights, even if they are just as unwinnable as one over the wall.

Republicans have been pushing to scuttle the Flores settlement, a 1997 decision that allows the release of children after 20 days in federal custody. But asylum reforms are unlikely after bipartisan talks fell apart just days ago.

“We need money for the border wall, but more than anything else we need to change our laws because everybody coming here is trying to get caught,” said Graham. “My focus now is not the wall, it’s asylum.”

Even the Republicans who egged on Trump to shut down the government last year are now suggesting Republicans should prioritize dealing with the migrant influx and be satisfied with the border wall status quo.

“There’s still the $4 [billion] or $5 billion to construct border wall initiatives with reprogramming. And I know it was an issue with this budget deal to make sure that [Democrats] couldn’t stop that,” said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), one of Trump’s closest confidants and the head of the hard-line Freedom Caucus.

There’s a widespread belief within the GOP after the last shutdown that cooler heads will prevail both this fall and next.

Trump has shown ideological flexibility when it comes to increasing spending and cutting deals with Democrats to avoid a fight over the debt limit. And he’s signaled that he understands any budgetary chaos could hurt his reelection campaign.

But until the government is actually funded past September, few are willing to declare victory just yet.

“You’re asking me to predict what Donald Trump will do?” asked Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a frequent Trump antagonist. “I think we will hear about the wall again.”"
T-Mobile and Sprint merger approved by Justice Department,https://www.theverge.com,['Jul'],07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/26/6646158/t-mobile-sprint-merger-justice-department-approves-26-billion-fcc,"The United States Justice Department has approved the $26 billion merger deal between T-Mobile and Sprint. After over a year in regulatory limbo, the merger received the green light from the last federal agency to hold out, with the Federal Communications Commission already signaling that it will approve the deal.

The Justice Department finally approved the deal after Dish reached an agreement with the carriers to acquire Boost Mobile, Virgin Mobile, Sprint’s prepaid business, and “certain” spectrum assets. This will position Dish as the replacement fourth major US carrier that will be lost once T-Mobile and Sprint merge. The two companies will be required to provide at least 20,000 cell sites and hundreds of retail locations to Dish, and the satellite TV provider will also get unfettered access to T-Mobile’s network for seven years as it works to build out a mobile network of its own using the newly acquired assets and spectrum that Dish has held on to for years. Dish has publicly remained silent on its plans throughout this entire process, but that is likely to change starting today.

“We are expanding output significantly”

“With this merger and accompanying divestiture, we are expanding output significantly by ensuring that large amount of currently unused or underused spectrum are made available to American consumers in the form of high quality 5G networks,” Makan Delrahim, assistant attorney general of the DOJ’s antitrust division, said.

T-Mobile and Sprint announced their intention to merge last April, claiming that their combined assets would make them a more viable competitor to AT&T and Verizon. The companies said they would be able to lower prices for consumers and more quickly deploy next-generation 5G networks across the country, which are arguments that have faced harsh criticism from consumer advocates and some experts.

Both the FCC and the Justice Department are required to approve the deal before it can move forward. The deal is likely to be approved by the FCC, although the official vote has yet to take place. In May, FCC chairman Ajit Pai announced that he would be voting to approve the deal after the companies made new promises to provide greater wireless and broadband access to rural areas.

“In light of the significant commitments made by T-Mobile and Sprint as well as the facts in the record to date, I believe that this transaction is in the public interest and intend to recommend to my colleagues that the FCC approve it,” Pai said. “This is a unique opportunity to speed up the deployment of 5G throughout the United States and bring much faster mobile broadband to rural Americans. We should seize this opportunity.”

T-Mobile and Dish will also be required to support e-sim technology to make switching carriers easier in hopes of spurring competition.

“This is a unique opportunity to speed up the deployment of 5G”

Shortly after Pai’s comments, the other two Republican commissioners voiced support for the deal as well, despite never seeing any documents related to the new promises. At a congressional hearing last month, commissioners Brendan Carr and Mike O’Rielly confirmed that they had yet to see the specifics of the agreement.

T-Mobile’s connections to the Trump administration have come under heightened scrutiny as the deal has progressed. In March, The Washington Post reported that the company had spent over $195,000 at the Trump Hotel in Washington, DC while lobbying for the merger.

Congress has held a number of hearings on the proposed merger, with many top Democrats (and even presidential candidates) criticizing it for shrinking the US’s major wireless carrier pool down from four to three providers. Lawmakers like Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Cory Booker (D-NJ) all signed letters to Pai and Delrahim, citing threats to market competition that could harm the US’s ability to lead in 5G.

“The best way to achieve the goal of high-quality, affordable, nationwide 5G is through competitive markets,” the senators wrote. “This merger moves us further away from the sort of competition we need to accomplish this aim. It will lead to excessive consolidation and undermine innovation.”

T-Mobile and Sprint’s main counterargument to those concerns was a proposed deal selling off Boost Mobile and a portion of their combined wireless spectrum. Dish will acquire the assets, a move that could supercharge the network into replacing the two companies as the fourth major carrier. Charter and Altice were also reportedly bidding for the spectrum, but Dish became the winner for both the spectrum and the additional assets.

T-Mobile has sought to merge with other major carriers in the past. In 2011, AT&T said that it would purchase T-Mobile for $39 billion, but a few months after the announcement, the DOJ nixed the deal. In 2012, T-Mobile reached an agreement with MetroPCS to take over the smaller company. The Sprint acquisition is now the company’s largest successful purchase.

The merger has one more hurdle to cross before the companies get the all-clear to finalize. Last month, over a dozen state attorneys general filed a multistate lawsuit to block the deal, headed by New York Attorney General Letitia James and California AG Xavier Becerra. “When it comes to corporate power, bigger isn’t always better,” James said. “The T-Mobile and Sprint merger would not only cause irreparable harm to mobile subscribers nationwide by cutting access to affordable, reliable wireless service for millions of Americans.”

In today’s announcement from the Justice Department, five states have agreed to settle including Nebraska, Kansas, Ohio, Oklahoma, and South Dakota. New York and California are still pushing the lawsuit opposing the deal.

“We intend to be prepared to go to trial to fight for a fair, competitive, and equitable marketplace for consumers nationwide,” Becerra said.

Now that the DOJ has approved the deal, T-Mobile and Sprint can move ahead. But if the states’ suit wins out in the end, the whole deal will have to be unwound."
New timeline emerges for DOJ inspector general report on FISA abuse,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-27-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/new-timeline-emerges-for-doj-inspector-general-report-on-fisa-abuse,"A new timeline has emerged in recent days for Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigation into alleged surveillance abuses by the DOJ and the FBI.

Whereas Attorney General William Barr predicted earlier this year that the watchdog's investigation would be finished by May or early June, now lawmakers are pointing to the early fall.

Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, told Maria Bartiromo on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures that he “expects that report later this fall.”

His colleague John Ratcliffe, who has spoken to Horowitz, gave a more specific target. The Texas congressman told Fox News' Bret Baier on Wednesday, ""I think that we will get the IG's report probably sometime right after Labor Day."" Labor Day is Sept. 2.

Further solidifying the prediction was a RealClearInvestigations report about former FBI Director James Comey having an inside man at the White House, feeding the bureau information about President Trump and his aides in 2017. That report also set a release date sometime in September.

The delay in Horowitz's work was reportedly due to his team's two-day meeting with Steele in person in London in early June, during President Trump’s state visit to the United Kingdom. Investigators found Steele's information credible enough to warrant extending their investigation.

Horowitz launched an investigation in March 2018 into whether the FBI and the Justice Department filing of four Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications and renewals beginning in October 2016 to surveil former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page was an abuse of the FISA process. The applications relied heavily upon the unverified dossier compiled by Steele, who was hired by Fusion GPS. The opposition research firm was hired by Marc Elias of the Perkins Coie law firm at the behest of the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. Steele's Democratic benefactors were not revealed to the FISA Court.

Meanwhile Barr's ""investigation into the investigators"" is underway, and the attorney general has said he is working very closely with Horowitz. The inspector general can recommend prosecutions, and U.S. Attorney John Durham, whom Barr tasked to lead the review, has the ability to convene a grand jury and subpoena people outside of the government. Beyond that, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, has promised a ""deep dive"" into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation after Horowitz completes his work.

Stay tuned to the Washington Examiner this weekend for closer look at what to expect from Horowitz's report."
Attorney General William Barr orders first federal executions in nearly two decades,https://www.cnbc.com,['Tucker Higgins'],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/25/william-barr-orders-first-federal-executions-in-nearly-two-decades.html,"The federal government will resume executing death row inmates after nearly two decades without doing so, the Department of Justice announced Thursday.

Attorney General William Barr directed the Bureau of Prisons to schedule the executions of five inmates convicted of murder and other crimes. The executions have been scheduled for December 2019 and January 2020.

The department also announced a new execution protocol, replacing the three-drug cocktail previously used in federal executions with the single drug, pentobarbital.

The last federal execution was carried out in 2003. There are 62 individuals on federal death row, according to a tracker maintained by the Death Penalty Information Center.

The Supreme Court outlawed state and federal death penalty laws in the 1972 decision Furman v. Georgia. The ruling invalidated the laws then on the books, but did not outlaw the death penalty under all circumstances, leading states and the federal government to draft new legislation.

The federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988, and expanded by Congress in 1994. No federal executions took place, however, until 2001, according to to the Bureau of Prisons website.

""Congress has expressly authorized the death penalty through legislation adopted by the people's representatives in both houses of Congress and signed by the President,"" Barr said in a statement. ""Under Administrations of both parties, the Department of Justice has sought the death penalty against the worst criminals, including these five murderers, each of whom was convicted by a jury of his peers after a full and fair proceeding."""
Treasury pick Monica Crowley spread Obama smears: 'Can he be both loyal to Islam and loyal to the United States?',https://www.cnn.com,"['Andrew Kaczynski', 'Nathan Mcdermott']",07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/25/politics/kfile-monica-crowley/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump's pick for the top spokeswoman job at the Treasury Department repeatedly spread conspiracy theories that suggested then-President Barack Obama was secretly a Muslim who was sympathetic to America's enemies.

Crowley also endorsed a story claiming Obama was an ""Islamic community organizer"" trying to conform the United States to Sharia law and claimed conspiracy theories about Obama's birth certificate were ""legitimate concerns."" During Obama's presidency, Trump was one of the most prominent voices pushing the so-called birther conspiracy theories questioning Obama's birthplace. When he was seeking the presidency himself and under continual questioning, Trump finally admitted that Obama was born in the US but offered no apologies or explanation for the years he spent sowing doubt about Obama's origins.

Crowley, formerly a syndicated radio host, columnist and Fox News contributor, was originally chosen by Trump in December 2016 to be the senior director of strategic communications for the National Security Council. She withdrew herself from consideration for that position after CNN's KFile team uncovered extensive plagiarism in her book and doctoral thesis.

Crowley did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the Treasury Department also did not respond to a request for comment.

Suggested Obama was a Muslim

Writing on her blog in August 2010 , Crowley blasted Obama for supporting the right to build an Islamic community center and mosque in lower Manhattan. Some conservatives seized on the issue making it a flash-point and objecting to, at times using highly inflammatory rhetoric, building a mosque so close to the site of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

Crowley wrote that Obama had loyalties to Islam and questioned if he could support both Islam and the United States.

""Maybe politics didn't have anything to do with it, but Islam certainly did. And does. Obama was born to a Muslim father, which under Islam automatically made him a Muslim. He says he converted to Christianity as an adult, which under Islam makes him an apostate,"" wrote Crowley. ""He grew up in Indonesia, which is the most populous Muslim nation on earth. His stepfather was also a Muslim. He was steeped in Islam throughout his formative years, so it should come as no surprise that he has loyalties to Islam. During the 2008 campaign, he even slipped and claimed that the United States has '57' states, instead of 50. The number of Muslim states in the Organization of the Islamic Conference is 57.""

""It may not come as a shock that he appears loyal to Islam. The question is: can he be both loyal to Islam and loyal to the United States?"" she added.

Crowley added, ""How could he....support the enemy?""

Called birther conspiracy theories legitimate

Writing in a blog post in April 2011 after the release of Obama's long-form birth certificate, Crowley praised Donald Trump for questioning Obama's citizenship and called concerns about the birth certificate legitimate.

""If the birth certificate were never a big deal, why did No Drama Obama wait nearly 3 years before releasing it? Why endure and stoke all of the drama? To make those raising legitimate concerns about his origins and policies look like kooks? Maybe,"" wrote Crowley.

""For over 2 1/2 years, questions have been raised about Obama's origins and background,"" she added. ""He was never properly vetted by an adoring press corps, so outstanding concerns existed about his birth certificate (the long-form of which he had never released), where he grew up, his family's religious background, his parents' political beliefs, how he got into top schools such as Columbia and Harvard Law, how he paid for his education, what his grades were, etc. The questions were and are legitimate, and yet were never fully answered. In fact, anyone daring to ask them was painted as a fringe moron at best and racist at worst.""

In 2011, Hawaiian officials, at Obama's request, released the long form of his birth certificate. It indicated that he had, indeed, been born in Hawaii. Conspiracy theorists continue to allege the document was a forgery.

Said Obama was on the side of terrorists

Writing a bout the Obama administration in June 2013 , Crowley said it looked the Muslim Brotherhood was dictating American foreign policy.

""The Muslim Brotherhood is a sworn enemy of the United States. In Obama, they have found an ally. What does that say about Obama? I'm sure you can figure that one out,"" she wrote. ""What it says about America's national security is that it looks increasingly like it's being dictated BY that sworn enemy.""

Writing in a January 2009 blog post, Crowley singled out Obama for using his full name at his swearing in (presidents typically are sworn in using their full names) and decisions related to banning the use of torture and closing of the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention center as actions that raised questions about the president's sympathies.

""Barack Obama insisted on being sworn in as president with his full name, Barack Hussein Obama. One of his very first things he did as president was to order the closure of the terrorist detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,"" she wrote, without noting that Obama had campaigned on this issue, the facility had been a top concern for human rights defenders. ""The two things he did along with that was to order a halt to the prosecutions of terrorist suspects there, including the mastermind of the September 11th attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and other top al Qaeda terrorists, like Ramzi Binalshibh. He also issued an order against the use of enhanced interrogation tactics on such terrorists, including waterboarding.

""Now comes word that he is granting his first formal television interview as president to Al-Arabiya,"" she added. ""Tells you where his head is, and possibly, his sympathies. Just sayin'.""

""The administration, with Obama as Islamic community organizer, is not only placating Muslims and, in particular, our Islamic enemies; it is conforming US policy to Islam and Sharia,"" reads the column.

""Obama's actions may, however, actually betray a more nefarious strategy: do as little as politically possible so as to foment chaos across the region, all to the benefit of his seeming policy ""companions"" dedicated to promoting Sharia and Islamic statehood- the Muslim Brotherhood and the Islamic Republic of Iran- while defanging the US's best ally in the region, Israel. Despite public pressure, resist confronting ISIS/ISIL and Bashar Assad in any truly meaningful way and turn his back on the Christian genocide exploding across the region. In addition, flood the US with Muslim immigrants while keeping it bound to foreign oil despite remarkable innovations at home that can render it virtually energy independent."""
DOJ’s tech probe needs to be mindful of corporate harassment,https://nypost.com,"['Jonathon Trugman', 'July']",07-28-2019,2019,7,https://nypost.com/2019/07/28/dojs-tech-probe-needs-to-be-mindful-of-corporate-harassment/,"The Department of Justice last week launched a wide-ranging antitrust review to determine if the largest technology companies are, or have been, stifling competition.

The four that are reported to be most focused on — Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google — account for almost a million high-paying jobs with good benefits, and are massive contributors to this year’s strong projected 2.5 percent-plus GDP growth rate.

Facebook, Google, Amazon and Snap all reported earnings last week. Aside from Amazon’s — affected by a big investment in faster delivery — they were pretty impressive. (Apple reports this week.) So people clearly are using these platforms to conduct commerce and communication.

There are always unintended consequences of big government trying to wrestle with an industry. The DOJ needs to be mindful of that, and not return to the Obama days of excess corporate harassment.

While the privacy issues are real and absolutely need to continue to be addressed, the anticompetitive aspect seems to me rather nonsensical.

Silicon Valley’s growth machine is one of the bright lights of the economy, not only in the US, but globally.

So I like the way the FTC handled the Facebook settlement announced on Wednesday. Facebook agreed to pay a $5 billion penalty due to the privacy issues and the use of people’s data, as happened in the Cambridge Analytica fiasco.

Those who say that’s not enough money don’t get it. It’s not about the money, it’s about the behavior. The FTC, by requiring Zuckerberg’s certification that its newly-agreed-to privacy rules are adhered to, found a great way to truly address any issues going forward without inhibiting growth and innovation.

These companies don’t stifle competition; they finance and foster it!

Let’s not give China or any other advanced economies a technological advantage by hampering our own geniuses and shooting ourselves in the foot."
DOJ’s Russia probe review focusing on 'smoking gun' tapes of meeting with Trump aide: sources,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dojs-russia-probe-review-focusing-on-tapes-of-talks-with-trump-aide-sources,"The Justice Department’s internal review of the Russia investigation is zeroing in on transcripts of recordings made by at least one government source who met with former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos overseas in 2016, specifically looking at why certain ""exculpatory"" material from them was not presented in subsequent applications for surveillance warrants, according to two sources familiar with the review.

The sources also said the review is taking a closer look at the actual start date of the original FBI investigation into potential collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians, as some allege the probe began earlier than thought. Both components are considered key in the review currently being led by Attorney General Bill Barr and U.S. Attorney from Connecticut John Durham -- an effort sure to draw more attention in the coming weeks and months now that Robert Mueller's testimony is in the rearview.

REPUBLICANS CONFRONT MUELLER WITH ALLEGATIONS OF DOUBLE STANDARD IN RUSSIA PROBE

The recordings in question pertain to conversations between government sources and Papadopoulos, which were memorialized in transcripts. One source told Fox News that Barr and Durham are reviewing why the material was left out of applications to surveil another former Trump campaign aide, Carter Page.

“I think it’s the smoking gun,” the source said.

“These recordings have exculpatory evidence,” the other source added. “It is standard tradecraft to record conversations with someone like Papadopoulos—especially when they are overseas and there are no restrictions.”

Prior to the 2016 presidential election, Papadopoulos met with Maltese professor Joseph Mifsud in London, who told him that the Russians had dirt in the form of emails that could damage Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Papadopoulos then told Australian diplomat Alexander Downer of the new information. Downer reported Papadopoulos’ comments to him to the FBI.

A source told Fox News that the ""exculpatory evidence"" included in the transcripts is Papadopoulos denying having any contact with the Russians to obtain the supposed ""dirt"" on Clinton.

But Papadopoulos did not only meet with Mifsud and Downer while overseas. He met with Cambridge professor and longtime FBI informant Stefan Halper and his female associate, who went under the alias Azra Turk. Papadopoulos told Fox News that he saw Turk three times in London: once over drinks, once over dinner and once with Halper. He also told Fox News back in May that he always suspected he was being recorded. Further, he tweeted during the Mueller testimony about ""recordings"" of his meeting with Downer.

It is unclear, at this point, which of these individuals may have recorded conversations with Papadopoulos.

Former Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., now a Fox News contributor, first signaled the existence of transcripts of secretly recorded conversations between FBI informants and Papadopoulos earlier this year.

“If the bureau’s going to send in an informant, the informant’s going to be wired, and if the bureau is monitoring telephone calls, there’s going to be a transcript of that,” Gowdy said in May on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures,” acknowledging he was aware of the files and suggesting they included exculpatory information.

TREY GOWDY: SECRET FBI TRANSCRIPTS FROM RUSSIA PROBE COULD BE 'GAME-CHANGER'

“Some of us have been fortunate enough to know whether or not those transcripts exist. But they haven’t been made public, and I think one, in particular ... has the potential to actually persuade people,"" he continued. “Very little in this Russia probe I’m afraid is going to persuade people who hate Trump or love Trump. But there is some information in these transcripts that has the potential to be a game-changer if it’s ever made public.”

The transcripts are currently classified, according to sources, but under President Trump’s move in May to approve declassification of documents related to the surveillance of his campaign during the 2016 election, Barr will likely have access to those documents in a declassified format.

A source told Fox News that without the declassification order signed by Trump, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats was not going to give anyone access to the files—over concerns for protecting sources and methods. But another source told Fox News in May that Coats, along with CIA Director Gina Haspel and FBI Director Chris Wray, are all working “collaboratively” with Barr and Durham on the review.

Barr and Durham are also trying to pinpoint the actual “start date” of the investigation, according to a source.

It has been widely reported, at this point, that the investigation was officially opened by former FBI senior counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok on July 31, 2016, after Downer shared the information that Papadopoulos was told the Russians had “dirt” on Clinton. But some suggest the probe began before that date.

On Wednesday, House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., challenged former Special Counsel Mueller over when the investigation started.

""The FBI claims the counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign began on July 31, 2016, but in fact, it began before that,"" Nunes said. ""In June 2016, before the investigation was officially opened, Trump campaign associates Carter Page and Stephen Miller were invited to attend a symposium at Cambridge University in July 2016. Your office, however, did not investigate who was responsible for inviting these Trump associates to the symposium.""

Mueller replied: ""Those areas...I'm going to stay away from.""

Meanwhile, Papadopoulos said that in May 2016, he was approached by two U.S. military officials based in the U.S. Embassy in London—Gregory Baker and Terrence Dudley. He told Fox News they were questioning him about his ties in the Middle East and Trump's relationship with Russia.

“Both wanted to ingratiate themselves in campaign via myself,” Papadopoulos tweeted last year.

It is unclear at this point what, if any, involvement Baker and Dudley had in collecting intelligence related to the Trump campaign. Both Baker and Dudley disputed Papadopoulos’ tweet, and reportedly said they reached out to him out of curiosity.

The president, his surrogates and Republicans on Capitol Hill since the start of the Mueller investigation have called for a separate probe into the Russia investigation's beginnings. Barr earlier this year assigned Durham to probe “all intelligence collection activities” related to the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election.

The Barr-Durham review is likely to draw more attention following Mueller’s highly anticipated testimony on Capitol Hill. Republicans sought to focus their questioning on the origins of the Russia investigation under then-Director James Comey's FBI—a topic Mueller repeatedly said was “out of his purview” due to the ongoing investigation being led by the Justice Department. Another review is being conducted by the DOJ inspector general.

“Maybe a better course of action is to figure out how the false accusations started,” Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said Wednesday. “Here’s the good news—that’s exactly what Bill Barr is doing and thank goodness for that.”"
Senators who visited border ask DHS to improve migrant care,https://www.aol.com,"['Aol Staff', 'Leigh Ann Caldwell']",07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.aol.com/article/news/2019/07/26/senators-who-visited-border-ask-dhs-to-improve-migrant-care/23779134/,"WASHINGTON — After visiting migrant detention centers near the southern border, Senate Democrats are requesting that the Department of Homeland Security make immediate changes to its detention centers, citing ""serious concerns"" with conditions.

In a letter signed by 13 Democrats who visited Customs and Border Patrol processing centers near the border last week, the senators list 18 actions the agency should take immediately that they say would ensure humane treatment of migrant children and result in better oversight of the facilities.

CBP processing centers have been scrutinized as migrants, including children, have been held in sub par conditions far longer than the 72-hour limit with reports of abuse and mistreatment.

The senators are asking acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan and acting Commissioner of CBP, Mark Morgan, to respond to their request by Thursday and provide a telephone briefing by Aug. 10 with an update on if the requests are being addressed.

Among the senators' requests: improve the water quality at the McAllen Border Patrol Station; provide schedules to Congress indicating that migrants can make phone calls, eat, take showers and brush their teeth; darken rooms so children can sleep.

The letter notes that the senators want to know if the migrants can report claims of abuse and what type of medical and psychological care the migrants have access to, and if DHW will support additional independent monitoring of facilities.

Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., is the highest ranking member of Congress to visit the border. He and 12 other Democratic senators visited the Border Patrol processing facility in McAllen, as well as processing centers Donna and Ursula, also in Texas.

""The searing accounts about the conditions endured by migrant families are true. We saw overcrowding. We heard migrants tell us that they were unable to brush their teeth, shower, call their families, or access feminine hygiene products,"" Schumer said on the Senate floor earlier this week. ""We saw children in soiled clothing, caged and expressionless — heartbreaking, thousand-mile stares on the faces of toddlers…where smiles and laughter should have been.""

The letter notes that a July inspector general report instructed DHS to ""take immediate steps to alleviate dangerous overcrowding and prolonged detention of children and adults.""

Aaron Hull, head of the Border Patrol's El Paso Sector, will be reassigned to Detroit on Monday, according to documents obtained by NBC News.

SC Navy vets with Agent Orange illnesses almost had benefits. But the VA is delaying them.,https://www.postandcourier.com,"['Thomas Novelly Tnovelly Postandcourier.Com', 'Thomas Novelly', 'Mary Katherine Wildeman Mkwildeman Postandcourier.Com', 'Andrew Brown', 'Abrown Postandcourier.Com', 'Laurent Rebours', 'Book', 'Vincent Yu']",,,,https://www.postandcourier.com/news/sc-navy-vets-with-agent-orange-illnesses-almost-had-benefits/article_1cfb8736-aef4-11e9-a223-1b6d7298f7fa.html,"Tommy Hawkins believes he has consumed the toxic herbicide Agent Orange.

He has been told it likely happened as a young sailor aboard the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk during the Vietnam War when he drank the ship's distilled water. Since leaving the service, the 71-year-old Fort Mill resident has had to keep fighting.

He has been consistently denied government health benefits relating to his exposure to the toxic chemical, and it has been a roller coaster of uncertainty with no end in sight.

Hawkins has been diagnosed with ischemic heart disease, which the federal government says is a condition connected to the chemical that was used during the Vietnam War to clear vegetation in the jungle. He is one of the thousands of ""blue water"" sailors who served aboard aircraft carriers, destroyers and other ships in the territorial seas and were exposed when they made port or came in contact with contaminated water.

The Air Force sprayed at least 11 million gallons of Agent Orange on the Vietnamese countryside between 1962 and 1971, according to the nonprofit Institute of Medicine.

After fighting for years to be recognized as eligible for these benefits — and recently being approved for them — there is yet another roadblock.

Earlier this month, Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie chose to delay the claims for tens of thousands of Navy veterans, despite becoming eligible in June for VA disability compensation related to Agent Orange exposure. He said claims don't need to start being processed until Jan. 1, 2020.

But time isn't a luxury that aging Navy veterans have.

""It's an uphill battle,"" Hawkins said. ""For them, it's a waiting game. We're slowly dying off.""

Fighting back

To fight back, several veterans' advocacy groups filed a joint lawsuit Monday that claimed Wilkie doesn’t have the authority to put a pause on the claims.

""These veterans are dying at a high rate every single day,"" the lawsuit states. ""These veterans deserve the peace of mind and sense of closure that accompanies a granted claim for earned benefits.""

One of the groups who filed the chief lawsuit was the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Association. While the VA estimates that between 420,000 to 560,000 sailors could be considered under the blue water provision, advocacy groups believe the number to be much lower and closer to 90,000. While the VA is worried about a burden on benefits, advocates say the lower figure is more accurate and financially realistic.

Yates, the national executive director of the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans, said there are at least 17 blue water veterans they've identified in South Carolina, but there are likely many more.

“It's ridiculous. We should be qualified, just like anybody else,"" Yates said. “The Secretary doesn’t realize so many of us are dying every day. It’s not fair to us.”

Veteran Stephen Wright was in Charleston Memorial Day weekend reuniting and reminiscing with fellow Navy sailors who served aboard the missile destroyer Preble. But in the months following that reunion, the Augusta resident has been fighting to get a claim related to his prostate cancer, another side-effect of Agent Orange acknowledged by the VA.

“If you were 18 then, you’re roughly 65 now,” Wright said. “A lot of those guys who were there, they’re getting to the point where they're going to get the benefits or they're going to pass on. It's just another delay tactic ... like they say 'delay, deny until they die.' ""

Snatch and defeat

The journey for these benefits looked bright at the beginning of the year.

On Jan. 29, in a 9-2 decision, the federal Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., ruled in favor of Navy veteran Alfred Procopio Jr. in a case against the VA, finding the intent of Congress in the Agent Orange Act of 1991 was to extend benefits to all veterans who had been awarded the Vietnam Service Medal.

In June, it seemed like the fight was almost over. President Donald Trump signed off on the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2019, which granted government benefits to thousands of Vietnam veterans who were previously ineligible.

That same month, the Department of Justice decided not to appeal a court ruling that confirmed their right to disability compensation and other benefits from the VA.

""It was snatch defeat from the jaws of victory,” John Wells, executive director of Military-Veteran Advocacy, said, reversing the well-known phrase ""snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.""

Wilkie interpreted a provision in the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2019 to say he can enforce a stay on a claim until the law goes into effect Jan. 1. The secretary's decision prompted an aggressive response from senators.

Presidential candidate and Sen. Kristen Gillibrand, D-N.Y., wrote a letter, alongside Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., asking the secretary to reconsider his stance.

“This is a disheartening and unnecessary action,” Gillibrand and Daines wrote. “There is nothing left to do besides processing the claims, and we strongly urge the VA to do so as quickly as possible. Delaying these benefits for another six months without specific and valid cause only adds insult to these veterans, many of whom have been waiting for these benefits for seventeen years.”

Eleven other senators — none from South Carolina — signed another letter that requested the VA make decisions on claims for Blue Water Navy veterans “with as much urgency as possible.""

Ken Farnaso, the press secretary for Sen. Tim Scott, said his office has been in contact with the VA.

""Based on staff level conversations, the Veterans Dept. says that the stay is place so they can have additional time to develop policies supporting the law, hire and train additional staff to comply with the law, and gather and digitize records from the Naval History and Heritage Command in order to support faster claims decisions,"" Farnaso said in an email.

In a response to Military-Veteran Advocacy, Wilkie ""determined that issuing the stay was in the best interests of Veterans and VA adjudication system as a whole. ... We are working to ensure that we have the proper resources in place to meet the needs of our Blue Water Navy Veteran community and minimize the impact of the Act on all Veterans filing for disability compensation.""

But veterans like Hawkins just hope it won't be too late.

""Hang in there; try to live through it,"" Hawkins said. ""Make sure you can grab your benefits if you can."""

Only three federal executions have taken place since 1988, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. All five of the death-row inmates named in Thursday's release were convicted for the murders of children.

Several states currently have a moratorium on the death penalty or have suspended the practice due to recent past wrongful convictions brought to light by groups such as the Innocence Project, which have secured the release of a number of death-row inmates in recent years. The total number of executions has declined over the last decade, in part, due to concerns that capital punishment disproportionately affects African Americans.

The death penalty has been abolished in about 70 percent of countries, including many democratic, industrialized nations similar to the U.S."

US Department of Justice Accuses Crypto Exec of $7 Million Fraud Scheme,https://cointelegraph.com,"['Max Boddy', 'Masao Akimoto']",07-25-2019,2019,7,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-department-of-justice-accuses-crypto-exec-of-7-million-fraud-scheme,"Federal authorities in the state of New York have unsealed fraud charges against the principal of a purported cryptocurrency escrow company Volantis in the amount of over $7 million.

According to an announcement by the Department of Justice (DoJ), the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) unsealed a filing with the allegations on July 25. The defendant, Volantis principal Jon Barry Thompson, was also arrested on the same day.

Thompson allegedly made false representations about Volantis’ purported Bitcoin transaction service in order to fraudulently secure over $7 million from two different companies. In the filing, the complainants say that Thompson offered a service for low-risk crypto settlements by acting as a mutual custodian for two transacting parties.

Defendant allegedly used firm as a front for theft

However, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman claims that Thompson used this service as a front to steal the “custodied” money:

“Jon Thompson induced investors to engage in cryptocurrency transactions through his company, Volantis Market Making, by touting a transaction structure that would eliminate any risk of loss during the purchase. As his clients soon realized, however, Thompson’s representations were false, and these cryptocurrency investors ultimately lost all of the money they had entrusted with him because of his lies.”

The FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge, William F. Sweeney Jr., further specified that he believes Thompson used confusing jargon to exploit companies less familiar with the crypto space:

“Using phrases and terminology that the victim companies didn't understand, he allegedly preyed on their ignorance of the emerging cryptocurrency. Our job at the FBI is to investigate fraud and follow the money wherever it leads.”

The filing itself was signed on July 18, and contains the specifics of the fraud charges. According to the filing, the defendant is being charged with two counts of commodities fraud as well as two counts of wire fraud.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the DoJ indicted an individual on July 24 for failing to register himself or his company with the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury. The defendant, William Green, allegedly ran a fiat-to-Bitcoin (BTC) conversion service on “Destination Bitcoin” out of New Jersey without registering as a money transmission business."

The full House vote came after the House Oversight and Reform Committee subpoenaed the Commerce and Justice departments earlier this year for documents relating to since-abandoned efforts to put a citizenship question on the 2020 census.

The Trump administration's efforts to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census were long challenged by Democrats and advocacy groups, who argued that the question's addition would lead to an undercount of the population, particularly for immigrant and minority communities.

The matter was challenged in several federal courts, and the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 last month that the question couldn’t be added to the census under the administration's rationale that it would help to enforce the Voting Rights Act, reasoning the high court called ""contrived.""

While Trump initially signaled that he would still try to get the question on next year’s census, he ultimately gave up the effort. He instead announced an executive order directing federal agencies to provide information on citizenship to the Commerce Department."

Visual: Tami A. Heilemann/U.S. Department of the Interior

Two new ethics probes were opened this week — one at the U.S. Department of the Interior and one at the Environmental Protection Agency — following contentions that the two agencies most influential in setting the country’s environmental agenda may be working to limit public access to policy documents, and that a member of EPA leadership may have acted in the interest of private sector lobbyists.

The Interior Department probe, carried out by the agency’s internal audit unit, seeks to determine if a new policy mandating that staff reviewing requests for documents via the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) notify politically appointed officials if they are mentioned in documents slated for release is indeed in violation of the public’s legal right to request government records and merits a formal investigation. A separate bill, aimed at challenging similar FOIA policies at the EPA, was announced in the Senate on the same day with bipartisan support.

The FOIA policy changes come on the heels of the ousting of both agency heads — EPA chief Scott Pruitt in July of last year and the Interior’s Ryan Zinke this January — after records released to the public revealed misconduct on the part of both leaders. Watchdog groups contend that the new FOIA policies are an attempt to shield officials from such scrutiny by allowing them to delay or deny the release of internal documents.

Communicating with New York Times reporters, representatives for both agencies denied this motivation for the policy changes. In an email to The Times, EPA Press Secretary Michael Abboud wrote: “Allegations made that the rule is changing the political appointees role in FOIA are false and irresponsible.”

In the EPA probe, announced on Monday, the agency’s inspector general is looking into the actions of former air quality chief William L. Wehrum, a key legal architect of the Trump administration’s policies easing federal limits on air, water, and coal ash pollution. It’s the third investigation to examine whether Wehrum violated federal rules during his time in office through interactions with his former law firm, Hunton Andrews Kurth, and one of the firm’s clients, the Utility Air Regulatory Group, a now-defunct coal plant lobbying coalition.

In a report sent Sunday to the EPA inspector general and obtained by The Washington Post, Democratic Senators Tom Carper and Sheldon Whitehouse documented allegedly undisclosed meetings between Wehrum and private sector clients. The pair urged EPA officials not to “abandon or decline to pursue work on this matter in the wake of Mr. Wehrum’s departure from the agency.”

The temperature spike is the second major heatwave to hit the continent this summer and scientists warn that this particular weather system will be moving north, where it is expected to further break records in countries from Norway to Finland on its way into the Arctic region. Scientists have also noted that Arctic sea ice is already at record lows for this time of year and that the super-charged temperatures are likely to accelerate that loss. And climate scientists have noted that with this heat wave, July is on track to be hottest month on record around the world. (The New York Times)

• The Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft successfully launched from the edge of the Bay of Bengal on Monday, marking the start of the Indian Space Research Organization’s ambitious second mission to the moon. Chandrayaan-2 is composed of a lander, a rover, and a lunar orbiter, and will be the country’s first attempt to make a “soft” landing on the surface of the Moon (a controlled descent in which the craft lands without sustaining damages). If all goes to plan, the lunar lander — named Vikram — will touch down in early September, and India will join Russia, the U.S., and China as countries to have complete a soft landing on the moon’s surface. The majority of Chandrayaan-2’s scientific instruments were designed in India, and include: X-ray, infrared, and mass spectrometers; stereoscopic and high-resolution cameras; and radar. NASA designed one instrument for the lander: an array of mirrors to reflect laser beams from Earth, used to help to calculate the distance to the Moon. Vikram’s planned landing site is the Moon’s south pole, a previously uncharted region, where it will study soil samples, rocks, and minerals. (Nature)

• Pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. announced a new, longer-lasting drug for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention at the International AIDS Conference in Mexico City this week. Currently, the main preventative strategy for uninfected individuals with a high risk of contracting the virus is to consume a daily pill — a strategy known as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). However, adherence to an oral HIV PrEP regimen can be challenging for some and the pill’s effectiveness is diminished with intermittent use. At the conference, Merck unveiled a slow-release implant of an experimental antiretroviral (ARV) drug, that the company’s tests suggest could safely provide protection against HIV far longer than any ARV currently on the market. The implant is placed under the skin and slowly delivers the drug in a mechanism similar to some implantable contraceptive devices. Merck’s study included only 12 participants, but the researchers reported that there were no safety issues, and the results showed that individuals receiving a high enough dose could be protected against HIV infection for 12 to 16 months.

• The fungus Candida auris, already a deadly and resilient pathogen, may be growing better suited to infecting human bodies, according to a study published this week in the journal mBio. When researchers examined close relatives of C. auris, they found most similar fungi are incapable of tolerating the human body’s typical internal temperature of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. This led them to suspect that C. auris had somehow adapted to thriving in hotter environments, perhaps thanks to temperatures climbing worldwide as a result of a changing climate, though they could not definitively rule out other factors contributing to C. auris’ unusual resilience. While cases of infection are still rare, C. auris is a worrisome threat as it is difficult to detect, crops up among already ill patients in hospitals, and strains of the fungus have proven resistant to one or more classes of the most common antifungal medications.

• As synthetic opioid overdoses continue to rise in the U.S., West Africa is facing its own crisis due to the abuse of tramadol — a widely available painkiller known at high doses to produce a euphoric effect similar to that of heroin. Reportedly taken by refugees in Nigeria to help cope with post-traumatic stress, along with wage workers, and even schoolchildren looking to gain an edge, many tramadol pills are illicitly manufactured in India and China, making it impossible for users to know what they really contain. According to the United Nations (U.N.), seizures of the drug have increased in recent years. Last year, Nigeria alone seized 6.4 billion pills. In nearby Togo, in contrast, smaller raids have led vendors to become even more secretive. Despite its risks, the U.N. in March declined to make tramadol an internationally controlled substance, saying it could make it more difficult to obtain for those who truly need it. (Mosaic)

• And finally: On Tuesday, a diminutive satellite — or CubeSat — operated by the Planetary Society, a nonprofit, unfurled four large mylar sails in an attempt to demonstrate solar sailing as a viable means of space travel. Over the next month, the toaster-sized satellite, named LightSail 2, will harness the momentum of light from the Sun to propel itself into increasingly higher orbits before eventually falling back to Earth’s atmosphere. LightSail 2 isn’t the first spacecraft to attempt to set sail on the solar wind. In 2010, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency launched IKAROS, a solar sail that made it past Venus, but that lacked a steering mechanism and was last heard from in 2015. Four years ago, the Planetary Society launched LightSail 2’s predecessor, LightSail 1, but that craft’s orbit was too low to demonstrate solar sailing. If successful, LightSail 2 will be the first steerable solar sail to orbit Earth. With silvery sails roughly the size of a boxing ring, it may, at times, be visible from Earth with the naked eye, according to the Planetary Society. (Gizmodo)"

Derek Mize and Jonathan Gregg, who married in New York in 2015, had their daughter Simone Mize-Gregg via surrogacy in England in 2018, their lawyer said in a statement. Both fathers are listed on the birth certificate.

When they applied for Simone's US citizenship, the US consulate in London rejected their application, the release said. ""The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) states that children of married U.S. citizens born abroad are U.S. citizens from birth so long as one of their parents has lived in the U.S. at some point, but the State Department routinely denies that right to same-sex couples and their children,"" the statement says.

""The State Department's policy is not only cruel, it is unconstitutional. The government refuses to recognize Jonathan and Derek's marriage and all of Simone's rights as a U.S. citizen,"" Aaron C. Morris, one of the couple's attorneys and executive director of Immigration Equality , said.

A State Department spokesperson declined to comment on the lawsuit, saying it does not comment on pending litigation.

Trump’s DOJ Brings Back Capital Punishment,http://nymag.com,['Adam K. Raymond'],07-25-2019,2019,7,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/07/trumps-doj-brings-back-capital-punishment.html,"The execution chamber in the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana. Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images

After nearly two decades without an execution, the federal government will put five people to death in December and January, the Justice Department announced on Thursday.

The DOJ also announced a change to the execution process. The traditional three-drug cocktail used for lethal injections with be replaced with the single drug pentobarbital. A handful of states have made a similar move after sodium thiopental, one of the three drugs used in the cocktail, became difficult to obtain after foreign manufacturers refused to sell it for use in executions.

In a statement, Attorney General William Barr said, “We owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system.”

The DOJ announcement marks an end to an unofficial moratorium on federal executions. The death penalty is legal in 29 states, which execute around two dozen people each year. But the federal government hasn’t executed anyone since 2003 and has only put three people to death since 1976. The five inmates whose executions have been scheduled for December and January have “exhausted their appellate and post-conviction remedies,” according to the Justice Department. All have been “convicted of murdering, and in some cases torturing and raping, the most vulnerable in our society — children and the elderly.”

While it’s been nearly two decades since a federal inmate was executed, people were still sentenced to death during that time. In the past decade, death sentences were handed down to high-profile inmates such as Dylann Roof and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.

But the number of federal death-penalty cases has increased under President Trump, a vocal fan of capital punishment. In 1989, he placed an ad in four New York City newspapers calling for the execution of the Central Park Five, who were later exonerated.

In 1989, Trump bought this ad to inflame public sentiment against teens known as the Central Park Five, who were later exonerated by DNA evidence.

John Ratcliffe: Mueller could not testify about Obama-Russia question because DOJ is investigating,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/john-ratcliffe-mueller-could-not-testify-about-obama-russia-question-because-doj-is-investigating,"A leading Republican investigator surmised that Robert Mueller was restrained from speaking about whether the Obama administration was influenced by the Russians because of an ongoing Justice Department investigation.

After the former special counsel testified about his Russia investigation Wednesday, Rep. John Ratcliffe told Fox News' Bret Baier that British ex-spy Christopher Steele's dossier was off-limits because U.S. Attorney John Durham and Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz are looking into how it was used by federal agents.

""What we don’t know, what he didn’t answer today was whether or not that’s sweeping and systematic effort influenced the Obama administration,"" the Texas congressman said. ""Did they use a false dossier to surveil an American citizen and thereby influence the election? That was something that Bob Mueller wasn’t willing to address today and I think John Durham and the folks at the Justice Department will be looking into that.""

Baier asked Ratcliffe what his expectation for a timeline regarding Horowitz's investigation on alleged surveillance abuses by the Justice Department and FBI and Durham's inquiry into the origins of the Russia investigation. The congressman, who is on the House Intelligence and Judiciary committees and has spoken to Horowitz, said progress is being made.

""I think that we will get the IG's report probably sometime right after Labor Day. I think John Durham just got started, but I think there’s a lot to look at there. I think there’s a lot that you saw the special counsel wouldn’t answer today because it was in the purview and under the investigation of John Durham as the new special counsel,"" he said.

Labor Day is Sept. 2 this year.

Durham was tasked by Attorney General William Barr, who said he is working closely with Horowitz, to lead a review of the origins of the Russia investigation. Trump also gave Barr “full and complete authority to declassify information” in the Justice Department inquiry.

In his opening statements to the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees on Wednesday, Mueller said he would not speak about the Steele dossier in his testimony, nor about the FBI's opening of the Russia investigation that preceded his appointment, citing his consultation with the Justice Department about restrictions. At one point, Rep. Matt Gaetz grilled Mueller about Steele's dossier, which contained salacious and unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia. He also asked about Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm that hired Steele, but the former FBI director dodged by repeatedly asserting it was beyond his purview.

The FBI says the counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign began July 2016 after Australian diplomat Alexander Downer told the U.S. that Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos claimed the Russians had some sort of incriminating evidence against Hillary Clinton, Trump's 2016 presidential rival. This effort was later wrapped into Mueller's investigation.

In spite of this, Trump and congressional Republicans have cited the dossier as evidence that the genesis of the FBI's original investigation into Russia interference in the 2016 election was possibly based on the compromising material from Steele. They have also raised concerned about how the FBI relied on the dossier to obtain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants to gather information on former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page between October 2016 and June 2017. The dossier was funded by the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign was not revealed to the FISA Court.

Mueller, who was appointed to take over the investigation after the president fired ex-FBI Director James Comey in May 2017, testified that he was not involved in the approval chain for the final FISA renewal."

Illinois EPA cites company for south suburban water woes,https://wgntv.com,"['Ben Bradley', 'Joe Donlon', 'Wgn Investigates']",07-26-2019,2019,7,https://wgntv.com/2019/07/26/illinois-epa-cites-company-for-south-suburban-water-woes/,"Please enable Javascript to watch this video

UNIVERSITY PARK, Ill. — The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency has hit a private water provider with notice of several violations after high lead levels were detected in several south suburbs. Aqua Illinois first notified its customers in University Park, Green Garden and Monee Township about high lead levels on June 14. Nearly six weeks later, 1,500 households remain under a “do not consume” advisory.

Aqua Illinois officials have blamed the spike in lead levels to a change in the chemicals it uses to treat the water. The Illinois EPA now says the company failed to obtain the necessary permits to make those changes, a violation of IEPA rules.

State regulators also fault Aqua Illinois for failing to properly monitor and report water quality test results last year.

""Your supply did not collect the required number of sample results from a certified laboratory,” the IEPA violation notice reads. All required lead and copper samples were not collected for the July-December 2018 monitoring period in University Park, according to the IEPA.

Aqua Illinois denies any alleged violations contributed to the lead problem or the difficulty in solving it. “We don’t believe the issues associated with these notices of violations contributed to or worsened the lead contamination in University Park,” the company wrote in a statement.

University Park mayor Joseph Roudez has previously criticized the private water provider for not providing the community with water quality reports prior to June.

Aqua Illinois revealed Friday that it has suspended four members of its management and professional team while the company examined the details of the IEPA’s findings.

University Park officials say they were led to believe the problem would be resolved within several days, a claim Aqua Illinois disputes. The water crisis in these south suburban communities is now in its second month.

“It could take several months before this is resolved,” Aqua Illinois president Craig Blanchette told WGN’s Joe Donlon.

In the most recent community update posted July 22, Aqua Illinois officials said “water lead test results in University Park have fluctuated, both increasing an decreasing in some areas. It’s not unusual to see this fluctuation, particularly in the first few months of treatment.”

“We acknowledge that while we all would have hoped to see treatment showing progress, it hasn’t had enough time yet,” reads a statement on Aqua Illinois’ website for residents effected by the water problems.

Aqua Illinois officials insist older homes impacted by the high lead levels will see their numbers subside when residents let water run for 2-3 minutes first thing in the morning. They’ve provided residents with filters and bottled water.

Blanchette provided WGN with the following statement:

""Aqua Illinois is committed to operating with complete transparency with the safety of our customers as our top priority. We have been working closely with the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and other regulators since we issued the voluntary do not consume advisory June 14, and immediately launched an internal investigation. To date, we have identified the likely cause of elevated lead levels in a limited number of homes is due to water chemistry interacting with lead solder in the internal plumbing of homes built prior to 1990. (Lead solder was banned by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 1986). As part of our commitment to resolve this situation, we have engaged nationally renowned experts in this field to complement our team’s efforts. Related Story

Hundreds attend emergency meeting on water lead levels in south suburbs Aqua Illinois leadership makes every effort to comply with all federal and state regulations. We recently learned that IEPA has issued several regulatory violations relating to permitting and sampling. Although we continue working to gather the necessary information to gain a more comprehensive understanding of what took place, it is important to note we don’t believe the issues associated with these notices of violations contributed to or worsened the lead contamination in University Park. We want our customers to know that we take these actions very seriously and are actively working with the IEPA on a resolution. Among the matters raised by the IEPA are permitting actions that took place in 2018. Aqua Illinois has since addressed these issues. During the process to change sources from well water to the Kankakee River, we installed a water main and changed treatment locations prior to receiving an IEPA permit. Though the changes were made prior to receiving the permits, the IEPA ultimately did issue the permits. The delay in applying for the permits, though it was eventually approved by the IEPA in 2018, was an oversight on our part. To correct this process, effective immediately, we have updated internal permit management practices to strengthen oversight of our permitting activities. The other issues raised by the IEPA involve the method of selecting sampling locations during the second half of 2018. Based upon our own investigation, we learned, and proactively advised the IEPA, that several homes selected for compliance sampling did not meet the proper criteria due to the age of the homes. We have addressed this issue, adding about 40 pre-1986 sampling locations to the existing sample set, thanks to the cooperation of our customers. This ensures that our lead testing correctly represents the various property types, ages, and plumbing construction in the community. As part of our holistic examination of the matter, Aqua has been and will continue to evaluate changes to processes and personnel to ensure we correct this situation and continue to improve our service for our customers and communities. As part of this process, Aqua has taken immediate action by suspending four members of the Aqua Illinois management and professional team while we thoroughly examine all the details around the IEPA’s findings. As a company, we collectively work each day with integrity, respect and in the pursuit of excellence in all we do, and we are accountable when we fall short of those values. The safety of our system is our top priority. We will continue to work with regulators, our own team and national water experts to restore and maintain safe drinking water for our customers."""

DOJ vows to step up fight against Hezbollah amid Iran tensions,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-vows-to-step-up-fight-against-hezbollah-amid-iran-tensions,"A top Justice Department official made it clear Thursday that combating Hezbollah is a top priority for the department, a move that puts pressure on the terrorist organization's sponsor, Iran.

Principal Deputy Attorney General John Cronan, who leads the department's team that investigates Hezbollah financing and narcoterrorism, laid out the government’s efforts and plans for dismantling and neutralizing the Iranian-backed terrorist group during a conference commemorating the victims of the Hezbollah bombing of a Jewish cultural center in Argentina 25 years ago.

The deadly bombing of the Asociación Mutual Israelita Argentina Jewish cultural center on July 18, 1994 killed 85 people and injured hundreds more, making it the deadliest terrorist attack in Argentina’s history. Argentina designated Hezbollah as a foreign terrorist group to coincide with last week's anniversary, something that the State Department did back in 1997.

""Destroying Hezbollah’s support networks and neutralizing the Hezbollah threat is a top priority for this Department of Justice and will continue to be,” Cronan said, though full details of the operations can't be shared.

“Investigations may be covert, charges may be sealed, defendants may be cooperating, and Hezbollah supporters may be facing non-terrorism crimes as we work to build terrorism charges,” he said.

The department is both combating Hezbollah’s terrorist acts and drying up its funding.

Hezbollah is Iran’s top paramilitary force and is among the crown jewels of its foreign influence efforts, receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in funding from the Iranian regime. Hezbollah, though based in Lebanon, operates across the Middle East and has made inroads around the world as well on behalf of its Iranian benefactors.

Cronan's comments from the come amid rising tensions with Iran and as the United States increases pressure on the ayatollahs. Iran seized and blew up allied ships and tankers in the Straits of Hormuz off the coast of Iran and shot down a U.S. drone over international waters in recent weeks.

The U.S., which pulled out of the controversial Iran nuclear deal in 2018, has been ratcheting up pressure on Iran ever since through increased sanctions and through designating Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist group earlier this year, and it brought down Iranian drones in recent days too.

And as the U.S. has tried to limit Iran’s global operations and has called for Iran to cease its funding of terrorist groups, the department made it clear that it will be playing a major role in neutralizing Iran’s Hezbollah proxies.

Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions created Cronan's team in early 2018 as a coordinated and aggressive response to the “ongoing, sophisticated, and global threat posed by Hezbollah to the United States.” Department prosecutors and investigators will pursuing both non-terrorism and terrorism charges whenever possible, working with a host of federal agencies, and seeking help from foreign allies as well, as they pursue people who provide help to Hezbollah, whether through financial support or the provision of manpower or weaponry, for example.

Samer El Debek and Ali Khourani, for example, were arrested in June 2017 on charges of providing material support to Hezbollah, for which Khourani was found guilty earlier this year. The two were trained by the terrorist organization and then released into the U.S. as sleeper operatives waiting for assignments. Kourani, a years-long Hezbollah operative, trained for possible attacks and conducted surveillance of locations in New York City, such as an FBI federal office building and an Army National Guard facility.

Cronan said that cutting off Hezbollah’s financial support is key, because “money is the lifeblood of any terrorist organization.” He pointed to the recent conviction of multi-billion commodities tycoon Kassim Tajideen, who was sanctioned by the Treasury Department for financing Hezbollah and who pleaded guilty in December to a money laundering scheme in evasion of U.S. sanctions on Iran, agreeing to forfeit $50 million to the U.S. government.

Treasury Department, he said, has wide efforts to dismantle Hezbollah's financial networks, including sanctioning more than 50 Hezbollah-related people and entities since 2017. Among those dozens of now-sanctioned Hezbollah financiers were top Hezbollah figures with deep ties to Iran.

Cronan said the U.S. is working with its international allies to root out Hezbollah operatives and funders elsewhere in the world, an effort he put to the conference audience.

“How can we work even better with our partners across the globe? How can we strengthen the capabilities of those partners? How can we most powerfully combat the Hezbollah threat that we all face?”"

The Justice Department will not bring charges against Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross after the House voted last week to hold them in criminal contempt.

The DOJ had not been expected to pursue charges against Barr, who oversees the department, or Ross.

""The Department of Justice's long-standing position is that we will not prosecute an official for contempt of Congress for declining to provide information subject to a presidential assertion of executive privilege,"" Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen said in a letter to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday.

The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee had authorized subpoenas to the Justice and Commerce departments in April demanding information about the administration's attempt to put a citizenship question on the 2020 census.

Barr and Ross had refused to comply with the subpoenas, after Trump asserted executive privilege over the documents. The refusal to comply prompted the Oversight Committee to vote along party lines to hold the officials in contempt. That vote was sent to the entire Democrat-led House, which voted last month to hold the men in contempt.

After a defeat at the Supreme Court, Trump abandoned his fight to add the citizenship question to the census, opting instead to sign an executive order to collect citizenship information from government agencies.

Rosen contended in the letter that the Justice Department has ""consistently adhered to the position that 'the contempt of Congress statute was not intended to apply and could not constitutionally be applied to an Executive Branch official who asserts the President's claim of executive privilege.'""

He cited multiple examples of the department taking the same stance during the Bush and Obama administrations.

""The Department has determined that the responses by the Attorney General and the Secretary of Commerce to the subpoenas issued by the Committee on Oversight and Reform did not constitute a crime,"" Rosen wrote.

A spokeswoman for the Oversight Committee did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment."

Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee only plan to swear in Mueller as a witness. However, Zebley will be sworn in to testify in front of the House Intelligence Committee, a committee aide told CNN.

Mueller made the last-minute request to have his deputy sworn in for Wednesday's blockbuster hearings before the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees on the Mueller report, in case he needed to help with any questions the special counsel could not fully answer himself, according to a source familiar with the matter.

""Aaron Zebley was the Deputy Special Counsel and had day-to-day oversight of the investigations conducted by the Office. He will accompany Special Counsel Mueller to the Wednesday hearings, as was discussed with the committees more than a week ago,"" said Mueller spokesman Jim Popkin.

Republicans on the House Judiciary committee immediately raised concerns that Democrats were making a major, last-minute change to the hearing to have Zebley to testify alongside the special counsel, less 24 hours before the hearings are scheduled to begin.

Judge Rules Trump’s EPA Flouting Clean Air Act As Denver Ozone Spikes Again,https://www.westword.com,['Chase Woodruff'],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.westword.com/news/judge-rules-trump-epa-flouting-clean-air-act-as-denver-ozone-spikes-again-11422270,"As ozone pollution in the Denver metro area took another turn for the worse this week, a federal judge ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency is violating clean-air laws by delaying a key decision on local air-quality standards.

In a ruling issued Monday, July 22, Judge John Kane of the U.S. District Court in Denver found that EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler has “failed to perform a nondiscretionary duty” by delaying a determination regarding the metro area’s classification under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone pollution. The partial summary judgment came as a result of a lawsuit filed by environmental group WildEarth Guardians against Wheeler and the EPA earlier this year. Court filings show that the agency didn’t object to Kane’s ruling.

“This is the Trump administration’s EPA on full display,” says Jeremy Nichols, WildEarth Guardians’ climate and energy program director. “They just refuse to comply with the law. They’re willing to keep dragging their feet to the point where they get ruled against in court, because they don’t want to comply. They don’t want to have to clamp down.”

The group's lawsuit revolves around a regulatory decision that was due to be made by the EPA earlier this year. For more than a decade now, a nine-county region known as the Denver Metro/North Front Range Nonattainment Area has exceeded federal standards for ozone pollution that were set by the agency in 2008. The state faced a January 2019 deadline to bring the area's air quality into compliance, or be reclassified from ""moderate nonattainment"" to ""serious nonattainment,"" which would require regulators to impose stricter regulations on polluters. The state missed the deadline — air pollution in Denver got worse last year, not better — but the EPA's attainment determination hasn't yet been made.

""This is a simple finding that they need to make,"" says Nichols. ""It's not a complicated action. It's very clear that Colorado failed to meet the 2008 ozone air-quality standards, so this shouldn't be happening. It's a sign of how nuts the Trump administration is, and how they just refuse to take their legal duties seriously. And unfortunately, it's our clean air that suffers.""

The EPA did not respond directly to questions regarding the attainment determination and when it's expected to be made. ""EPA supports the state’s efforts to address ozone issues along the Front Range,"" EPA Region 8 spokesperson Lisa McClain-Vanderpool said in an email. ""The Agency does not comment on ongoing litigation.""

Monday's court ruling came as ozone pollution in Denver began to rise to its highest level of the year so far, reaching an eight-hour Air Quality Index of 133 on Tuesday, July 23. Parts of metro Denver reached one-hour ozone concentrations of 100 parts per billion on Monday and Tuesday, according to state air-quality data — levels that are considered “unhealthy” for all groups on the AQI scale.

High levels of ozone pollution are expected to continue along the Front Range this week. In a forecast issued this morning, officials with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment warned that ""active children and adults, and people with lung disease, such as asthma, should reduce prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion"" in the afternoon and evening, when ozone levels are typically at their daily peak.

Ground-level ozone is a so-called criteria pollutant that can cause a wide variety of negative health effects, from acute symptoms such as coughing and shortness of breath to chronic conditions like asthma and emphysema. It's formed primarily by the interaction between sunlight and ""ozone precursors"" like volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides. In Denver, studies have shown that the two largest sources of ozone-forming pollutants are motor vehicles and oil and gas facilities along the Front Range, both of which can account for up to 40 percent of local ozone production on a given day.

A reclassification to serious nonattainment by the EPA would force CDPHE regulators to subject those emissions sources to a higher degree of scrutiny and regulation. In March, Governor Jared Polis withdrew a state request, made by his predecessor John Hickenlooper, for an extension to meet the federal ozone standards. ""There’s more we can do to protect our air quality and health, and we should do it sooner not later,"" Polis said at the time.

Even if the extension hadn't been withdrawn, it would have expired last week. Nichols and WildEarth Guardians, along with other environmental groups, have launched a campaign to pressure the CDPHE to act now, without waiting for the Trump administration to finally tell state officials what they already know.

""Having the backing of the EPA's finding forces them to [act], but the state shouldn't have to be forced to clean up the air,"" Nichols says. ""They could start to implement more rigorous permitting; they could start to put emissions on track. They could be taking some actions now.""

From the outbreak of the Mexican American war in 1846 to campaigns being waged this very day in multiple countries around the world, New Mexico servicemen and women have bravely defended America’s Constitution and way of life. With that service came a long list of benefits, one of which is the VA home loan guaranty.

In 2018, 1.9 million U.S. vets used the third-most popular benefit. Of that number 5,259 loan guaranties were issued to New Mexico veterans; of which 594 were utilized to purchase, refinance or upgrade a home in Doña Ana County, according to Monica Cabrera, public information officer for the VA’s Phoenix Regional Loan Center in Arizona.

“The objective of the VA Home Loan Guaranty program is to help eligible Veterans, active-duty personnel, surviving spouses, and members of the Reserves and National Guard purchase, retain, and adapt homes in recognition of their service to the nation”, according to the VA website at https://www.benefits.va.gov/REPORTS/abr/docs/2018-loan-guaranty.pdf.

The website also details the Native American Veterans Direct Loan Program, which “helps Native American Veterans or Native American non-Veterans finance the purchase of homes on Federal Trust Lands. VA has entered into memorandums of understanding with 94 participating Native American tribes. During FY 2018, VA closed 18 loans under this program. Since its inception, VA has made 1,073 loans to Native American Veterans.”

The concept behind the program is simple. Veterans who have decent credit and a steady source of income can use their benefit to purchase a home in Doña Ana County with no down payment. The maximum purchase price for a single-family home is $484,350. Key lending criteria include no maximum debt ratio, no minimum credit score and no mortgage insurance, although VA does oblige lenders to make sure the veteran has the ability to repay the loan. Most Las Cruces-area banks, credit unions and mortgage companies offer VA loans.

With the exception of disabled vets and their surviving spouses, the VA charges the veteran a one-time “funding fee” of between 1.25 and 3.03 percent of the loan amount, depending on whether the buyer opts to utilize a down payment. The fee goes into a kitty that’s tapped to repay lenders up to 85% of the loan balance in the event the veteran defaults on the loan. If a property is not sold at the foreclosure sale, the lender is repaid, title reverts to the Veteran’s Administration, and the home is sold as a VA repo.

A side benefit to a VA loan is that it is assumable, which is to say that a qualified buyer can assume the veteran’s loan. Buyers who assume VA loans don’t have to be veterans and are not required to live in the home. Unfortunately for the veteran, his or her eligibility remains tied up in the home until the new borrower pays off the loan. Veterans can retain their eligibility, however, if their loan is assumed by another veteran. Veterans who assume a VA loan and substitute their eligibility for the eligibility of the original borrower frees up the original veteran’s benefit to be used again. The veteran who assumes the loan must occupy the home as their principal residence.

VA loans may add value to a property in the future. Let’s say a veteran decides to sell his home after living in it for five years. And let’s say the home’s value has appreciated by 4 percent each of those years, resulting in equity of around 20 percent. Equity is the difference between the value of a property and what’s owed against it. Let’s also say that mortgage interest rates have risen to 6 percent over the years. Would a buyer with 20 percent down be better off financing his purchase with a new 30-year loan at 6 percent, or by utilizing the 20 percent to assume a VA loan at, say, 3.5 to 4 percent that has 25 years remaining? The answer is obvious. Would the 33 to 42 percent lower interest rate (3.5 to 4 vs. 6) and five-year shorter term (25 vs.30) make the veteran’s home worth more than the theoretical identical home next door? The answer is almost assuredly yes.

A total of 133,402 New Mexico veterans served our country between WWI and December of 2015, according to the NM Department of Workforce Solutions. If you are one of the 142,187 vets currently residing in New Mexico or are on active duty now, this benefit may be worth exploring.
