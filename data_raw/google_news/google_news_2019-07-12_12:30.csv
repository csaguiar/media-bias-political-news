In the book, ""American Carnage,"" Ryan recalled his difficult working relationship with the president. He told Politico's Tim Alberta that Trump ""didn't know anything about the government"" and that he and others ""helped to stop him from making bad decisions.""

“Because, I’m telling you, he didn’t know anything about government . . . I wanted to scold him all the time,"" Ryan reportedly said in the book. “Those of us around him really helped to stop him from making bad decisions. All the time. We helped him make much better decisions, which were contrary to kind of what his knee-jerk reaction was. Now I think he’s making some of these knee-jerk reactions.”

Trump blasted Ryan as a ""failed"" vice presidential candidate with an ""atrocious"" record of as a congressman.

TRUMP 'NOT ON BOARD' WITH JEFF SESSIONS RUNNING FOR ALABAMA SENATE SEAT: REPORT

""Paul Ryan, the failed V.P. candidate & former Speaker of the House, whose record of achievement was atrocious (except during my first two years as President), ultimately became a long running lame duck failure, leaving his Party in the lurch both as a fundraiser & leader..."" Trump tweeted.

Trump went on to claim that when 2012 GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney chose Ryan as a running mate, he told people ""that's the end of this Presidential run.""

""He quit Congress because he didn’t know how to Win,"" the president continued. ""They gave me standing O’s in the Great State of Wisconsin, & booed him off the stage. He promised me the Wall, & failed (happening anyway!)....""

Trump added, ""He had the Majority & blew it away with his poor leadership and bad timing. Never knew how to go after the Dems like they go after us. Couldn’t get him out of Congress fast enough!""

This is a drastic shift in tone from the president when Ryan announced he would not be seeking re-election in April 2018.

""Speaker Paul Ryan is a truly good man, and while he will not be seeking re-election, he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question. We are with you Paul!"" Trump tweeted at the time."
"Trump Says He Will Seek Citizenship Information From Existing Federal Records, Not the Census",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Katie Rogers', 'Adam Liptak', 'Michael Crowley', 'Michael Wines']",07-11-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/us/politics/census-executive-action.html,"[Mr. Barr said a legal path to census citizenship question exists, but he gave no details.]

Stanton Jones, a lawyer with the firm of Arnold & Porter who helped represent opponents of the question in a federal lawsuit in Manhattan, accused the Trump administration of waging a multimillion-dollar court battle that from its inception was a plot to advance Republican political interests.

“The citizenship question was always a cynical ploy to rig American elections for partisan and racially discriminatory reasons,” he said.

Government experts predicted that asking the question would result in many immigrants refusing to participate in the census, leading to an undercount of about 6.5 million people. That could reduce Democratic representation when congressional districts are allocated in 2021 and affect how hundreds of billions of dollars in federal spending are distributed.

In a statement, a Justice Department spokeswoman said the department would “promptly inform the courts” that the government would not seek to include a citizenship question on the census.

The United States has never had a central registry of citizens and noncitizens, and in theory Mr. Trump’s order could result in one. But data sharing is supposed to go only in one direction: from other agencies into the Census Bureau but not back out.

The Census Bureau for decades has relied on data from other agencies to check the accuracy of their head counts. For the purposes of obtaining citizenship data, the Census Bureau could identify American citizens with some precision by mining immigration data from the federal Citizenship and Immigration Services agency, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, and data from programs that require citizenship to participate, such as Social Security numbers and some taxpayer identification numbers. Other citizenship data come from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, which asks a small fraction of the population questions — including on citizenship — every month.

Although noncitizens often falsely respond that they are citizens on the survey, data from other agencies would help weed out those responses. That would provide a reasonably accurate portrayal of citizenship even down to census blocks, the bureau’s smallest population unit, said John Thompson, who ran the bureau from 2013 to 2017."
"Trump apparently knows what Bitcoin is, and he doesn’t like it",https://www.theverge.com,['Jul'],07-11-2019,2019,7,https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/11/20691188/president-donald-trump-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-facebook-libra,"President Donald Trump took some time out of his evening to tweet about cryptocurrencies today, announcing to the world that he is “not a fan” of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies because their “value is highly volatile and based on thin air.”

In a series of tweets, Trump expanded on his thoughts on crypto, saying Facebook’s newly announced Libra virtual currency “will have little standing or dependability,” and that the company should seek a banking charter and be regulated like any other traditional financial institution. Incidentally, that puts Trump on the side of House Democrats, a group of which last week officially asked Facebook to put its Libra plans on hold so it can be properly investigated for risks to the global financial system.

Naturally, Trump ended his crypto fireside chat with some trademark, nationalistic confidence in the United States Dollar. “We have only one real currency in the USA, and it is stronger than ever, both dependable and reliable. It is by far the most dominant currency anywhere in the World, and it will always stay that way. It is called the United States Dollar,” he wrote.

....Similarly, Facebook Libra’s “virtual currency” will have little standing or dependability. If Facebook and other companies want to become a bank, they must seek a new Banking Charter and become subject to all Banking Regulations, just like other Banks, both National... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2019

It’s not clear why Trump chose today of all days to speak out about crypto. The White House spent the afternoon hosting a gathering of disgruntled conservatives invited to come listen to him complain about bias and commiserate in apparent censorship on behalf of platform-owning tech companies. Perhaps there was some talk of Bitcoin and Libra at this meeting.

Whatever the source of Trump’s sudden ire for crypto, one crowd is not particularly happy: the alt-right, which has enough libertarian and more broadly anti-government strains in its movement to align with crypto enthusiasts. (Also, payment processors have begun taking sides in the deplatforming debate, banning sites known to promote white supremacy, violence, and neo Nazism. So that’s also made crypto popular with the online breeding grounds for those movements.)

The official Twitter account for extremist forum Gab, which was banned from using PayPal last October, has been on a tirade since Trump’s tweets went out, complaining of a so-called “Kushner Presidency” influencing Trump’s decision to smear Bitcoin and comparing Gab’s free speech absolutist social network to the popular cryptocurrency, as both are “smeared by the media” and “built to preserve and promote freedom.”

Popular far right commentator Mike Cernovich wrote in a reply to Trump, “This is a major mistake on your part and shows a lack of vision.” Cernovich and others are now seemingly on a quest to reeducate Trump on the benefits of Bitcoin."

President Donald Trump is on a mission to show supporters he’s still the same fighter they elected.

He pushed back against establishment Washington on Thursday with a one-two punch — first by giving conservative bloggers a space to air their grievances about anti-conservative media bias, then by announcing an executive order to collect data about immigrants after the courts blocked him from adding a citizenship question to the census.

Story Continued Below

The actions — like so many other policies and events being organized by the Trump White House — aren’t likely to yield substantive policy changes. But they’re designed to appeal to the president’s conservative base as he heads into a tough reelection fight.

“That’s what the president does better than anyone: He fights,” said longtime Republican operative Ben Marchi, a Trump delegate to the 2016 national convention. “His ability to never say die is one that doesn’t mesh with the Georgetown establishment. They view it as simple-minded and unintelligent, but the reality is that regular Americans appreciate his dogged persistence.”

In 12 hours on Thursday, through speeches and on Twitter, Trump stepped directly onto some of the most volatile fault lines that could rev up his fiercest supporters: immigration, the Pledge of Allegiance, social media bias, unfair trade with China, big banks, Iran, special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian election interference, impeachment and, of course, individual Democratic candidates for president.

It was a one-day sampling of what Trump hopes will give him a winning hand in 2020.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201907/1311/1155968404_6058082603001_6058083404001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

For two and a half years, Trump has railed against Democrats, the media and nearly all of Washington’s established institutions — caring little about perceptions by anyone but supporters who flocked to him in 2016 because they were frustrated by business as usual, people close to Trump say.

In many cases, Trump only achieves incremental steps or none at all — far from what he promised Americans when he was on the campaign trail in 2016. But most supporters still don’t see it as a failure. Instead, they see a man who is doing what he said he would.

Steve Cortes, a Trump ally who served on his Hispanic Advisory Council during the 2016 campaign and is serving on his 2020 reelection committee, described it as part of Trump’s “winning political formula for 2020.”

But a new poll this week backed up what many Republicans have been advising Trump for months: He has a path to reelection if he can stick to a message focused on the strong economy.

Fifty-one percent of those polled said they approve of the way Trump handles the economy — the only major issue area that he has positive numbers in — with 47 percent saying he deserves a large amount of credit for the state of the economy.

Still, Trump continues to veer off track, blasting his critics and talking up some of the nation’s most divisive issues including immigration.

It‘s led some Republicans to worry that Trump spends too much time appealing to his base instead of expanding his supporters through more mainstream policies. They lament that he has lost support of suburban voters in several key electoral states — including Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — that were instrumental to Trump's 2016 Electoral College win but that Republicans lost in the 2018 midterms.

On Thursday, Trump blasted the mainstream media at a White House event with more than 100 people — some of whom have been accused of being extremists who promote hate — leading some critics to accuse him of using the official event for his campaign.

“We’re not going to be silenced,” Trump told the attendees of the social media summit.

Minutes later, he portrayed his immigration executive order as a win, even though it’s almost exactly what Census Bureau officials advised him to do after he lost his fight to put a citizenship question on the census.

""Today, I'm here to say we are not backing down on our effort to determine the citizenship status of the population of the United States,"" Trump said in brief remarks in the Rose Garden. He blasted Democrats for their ""shocking"" behavior, which he said was to try to hide the number of immigrants in the United States illegally.

Trump won the presidency in 2016 after pledging to crack down on illegal immigration, including building a wall on the southern border with Mexico, but many of his most significant proposals have been thwarted by Congress or the courts. In recent months, Trump has continued to try to push through his proposals but has been frustrated by his lack of success.

A former Trump adviser who remains close to the White House said Trump still shows he’s engaged on the issues, including immigration, unlike other politicians of both parties who abandon their goals after they initially fail.

Michael Caputo, a top adviser during Trump’s first campaign, said Trump is trying to use immigration to help Republicans — and himself — succeed in battleground House districts where vulnerable Democrats need to indicate support for law-and-order measures on the border.

Immigration “has preoccupied Washington for two and a half years now,” Caputo said. “It’s moving in his direction. Just look at what the Democrats are saying.”

But veteran Republican strategist Doug Heye said Trump misses regular opportunities to tout the economy — his biggest reelection talking point. “It would behoove him to talk about the economy more,” he said.

Instead of working on broadening his base, Trump is counting on a different strategy altogether — getting his base to turn out, knowing that he has a narrower path to victory than in 2016, Heye said.

In addition to helping his campaign, Thursday's back-to-back events had an added benefit for Trump: They managed to drown out news of his Labor Secretary Alex Acosta ’s controversial involvement as a prosecutor in wealthy sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s plea deal in 2008."
Trump officially issues executive order to tally citizens through the Commerce Department,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-officially-issues-executive-order-to-tally-citizens-through-the-commerce-department,"President Trump officially issued his executive order Thursday, which demands all other departments and agencies provide the Commerce Department with any information related to citizenship.

Trump issued the order after courts ruled against having the citizenship question on the 2020 census. The order was also issued to avoid delaying the census any longer.

""To achieve that goal, I have determined that it is imperative that all executive departments and agencies provide the Department the maximum assistance permissible, consistent with law, in determining the number of citizens and non-citizens in the country, including by providing any access that the Department may request to administrative records that may be useful in accomplishing that objective,"" the executive order states.

All agencies are being ordered to provide the citizenship data to an interagency working group that will be created to process the information.

State information on citizens will also be sent to the Commerce Department.

In the order, Trump outlines which information will be sent by which federal agency:



Department of Homeland Security: National-level file of Lawful Permanent Residents, naturalizations, F1 and M1 nonimmigrant visas, national-level file of customs and border arrival/departure transaction data

Department of State: refugee and asylum visas, national-level passport application data

Social Security Administration: Master beneficiary records

Department of Health and Human Services: CMS Medicaid and CHIP Information System

Trump has instructed the Commerce Department begin planning the administrative processes necessary to add the citizenship question to the census in 2030."
Ocasio-Cortez wants to ax Homeland Security.

Although some activists have urged the government to abolish its immigration enforcement arm, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) came out in favor of eradicating the entire Department of Homeland Security.

The department’s creation after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, significantly threatened American civil liberties, Ocasio-Cortez said Tuesday on the WNYC podcast “the New Yorker Radio Hour.” She said she wanted to get rid of Homeland Security, the formation of which she called an “egregious mistake.”

“People sounded the alarm back then, that these agencies are extrajudicial, that they lack effective oversight, and it is baked into the core foundational structure of these agencies,” she told the New Yorker’s editor, David Remnick.

Conservative political figures immediately castigated the congresswoman’s proposal.

“Moronic, stupid, naive and dumb,” former White House deputy chief of staff Karl Rove said on Fox News.

""Absolute irresponsibility,” Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) told reporters, according to the Washington Examiner.

The usefulness of a Department of Homeland Security, however, wasn’t always taken for granted. President George W. Bush’s administration initially had “zero interest” in creating a new department to protect against terrorism, The Washington Post previously reported. Vice President Richard B. Cheney thought it would needlessly increase the size of government.

“Creating a Cabinet post doesn’t solve the problem,” White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said in March 2002, according to The Post.

Some members of Congress worried the White House was concealing the department’s true cost to avoid alienating Republicans who opposed the growth of government, USA Today reported in 2002. Certain conservative Republicans, meanwhile, said they would not oppose Bush’s proposal but wanted to move slowly, according to the Houston Chronicle.

When the House of Representatives initially voted on the department’s creation the following July, 132 members opposed the move, including 10 Republicans. Congress eventually passed the Homeland Security Act and Bush signed it into law that November, creating the Department of Homeland Security.

Ocasio-Cortez said Wednesday that her proposal was “not that radical,” citing the reluctance of some members of Congress to support the department’s creation less than two decades ago.

“When DHS was 1st formed by Bush 17 years ago, many members of Congress were concerned — incl GOP — that we were setting up a ticking time bomb for civil liberties erosion & abuse of power,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter.

It’s really not that radical.

Like some members of Congress, non-politicians also criticized the new department, which merged 22 federal agencies tasked with securing the country’s borders, protecting its infrastructure and guarding against terrorism.

James Bamford, a journalist and filmmaker who covers intelligence agencies, told CBS News in 2002 that creating Homeland Security was a public relations move that could actually decrease efficiency.

“Instead of moving people together, you should be moving information together,” Bamford told CBS. “You should be taking information and finding better ways to distribute it; faster ways to distribute it among people.”

In a 2003 article in National Review, conservative writer Ramesh Ponnuru criticized Bush’s record as president, noting that Bush had “raised defense spending, given new powers to law enforcement, federalized airport security and created a new cabinet department for homeland security. . . . More people are working for the federal government than at any point since the end of the Cold War.”

[‘I hate this mission,’ says operator of new emergency shelter for migrant children]

Homeland Security was originally staffed by 180,000 employees from the U.S. Customs Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other federal offices. It also encompasses the agencies that oversee immigration, including Customs and Border Protection, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Homeland Security now has a workforce of more than 240,000, making it the government’s third-biggest department, behind Defense and Veterans Affairs.

The Transportation Security Administration, which screens passengers at airports, was absorbed into Homeland Security just a year after it was created in response to 9/11 in November 2001. Conservatives at the time expressed concern that the new agency was unnecessarily bureaucratic and gave too much power to the government.

“Before 9/11, the prevailing conservative/libertarian/Republican opinion of the national-security state — of any government effort to protect Americans at the point of a gun and the touch of a rubber glove — was mistrust,” Slate reported. “The second most common opinion was fear.”

Republicans’ ire for the TSA survived a decade after the agency’s creation. Then-Rep. Paul Broun (R-Ga.) in 2011 said Americans were “no safer today than they were before 9/11,” according to Forbes. The GOP’s 2012 presidential platform called for the privatization of airport security.

Calls to abolish Homeland Security are now made year after year, in publications ranging from policy journals to mainstream news outlets. In a tweet from 2018 shared by Ocasio-Cortez on Thursday, Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.) recalled a time when conservatives viewed Homeland Security as overly bureaucratic.

“Conservatives used to want to abolish DHS — as well as many other departments and agencies that bloat government,” wrote Amash, who announced on the Fourth of July that he was leaving the Republican Party. “If only today’s members of Congress cared as much about defending the Constitution as they do about defending ICE, an agency that’s existed only since 2003.”

President Trump, speaking at the White House on Thursday, announced that he would ""immediately"" issue an executive order to get an accurate count of non-citizens and citizens in the United States -- a measure Trump said would be ""far more accurate"" than relying on a citizenship question in the 2020 census.



The move would make use of ""vast"" federal databases and free up information sharing among all federal agencies concerning who they know is living in the country, Trump said.

""It’s going to take a process of maturing for those freshman members. They will have to learn to be effective legislators,"" he said.

""It shows they have no sensibility to different members from our caucus. Some come from red districts and those are the ones who gave us the majority. We need them all,"" he said.

His comments followed a feud between Pelosi and freshman congresswomen, like Ocasio-Cortez, that involved racially-charged criticism.

Although just 10 miles south of Denver, notoriety has rarely found its way here except on the occasions when the Federal Correctional Institute Englewood’s worn cellblocks have housed the likes of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, former Enron chief executive Jeffrey Skilling and disgraced former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich

Now, the 320-acre compound – distinguished by coils of razor wire and guard tower – is poised to play a leading role in a major criminal justice experiment.

Justice Department officials, including newly-installed Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, have cut a path to this unlikely place in recent days to tout a series of rehabilitation programs that could be key to supporting the early release and re-entry of waves of federal inmates set to be released as part of a criminal justice overhaul approved by Congress last year.

Inside Englewood, a culinary arts program is training aspiring chefs to pump out artisanal breads, pastries and cakes. An architectural drafting operation, manned by inmates, has produced designs for hundreds of chain restaurants and is assisting with a flood prevention project for the Port Authority of New York.

The prison’s signature enterprise, however, may be its most promising. Thirteen inmates are part of a roofing and road paving crew that travels the country more than seven months of the year tending to repairs and new construction at federal government installations scattered from the Great Lakes to New England. The crew members, many of whom have acquired valuable commercial drivers’ licenses while in prison and the skills to operate heavy machinery, have saved the federal government nearly $30 million in labor costs during the past three years, federal authorities said.

""I never thought I would get a chance to do something like this in prison,"" said Littlelee Ragsdale, a 36-year-old Wyoming man who is in the midst of a nine-year term for methamphetamine and heroin distribution. ""This a great opportunity for a real career outside of here. It's not just one of those jobs to get by. Re-entry (to the free world) is now a realistic goal.""

Leaning on the promise of Englewood’s programs and others like them scattered across the Bureau of Prisons system, Attorney General William Barr later this month is expected to unveil a tool that could shave years from the sentences of non-violent offenders like Ragsdale as part of the First Step Act, a sweeping law designed to reduce the federal prison population while easing offenders' transition back to their communities. Congress approved the law last year with support from both parties.

Barr is set to lay out rules on July 19 for evaluating federal inmates that could speed their path toward release. On the same day, a separate provision of the law will prompt the release of an estimated 2,200 offenders based on a re-calculation of the credit they receive for good behavior while in custody.

The new law represents a sea change in criminal justice policy which once advocated for the harshest punishments possible for offenders, including non-violent drug addicts who were swept up in en mass during the crack epidemic of the 1980s and early 1990s. The reversal, largely driven by spiraling prison costs and racial disparities in the enforcement of such punitive measures has garnered support of an unusual political alliance: At the vanguard is Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, and the man he hopes to unseat, President Donald Trump.

""My visit here is an indicator of the fact that we are working very hard on the First Step Act to comply with both the law and what we think Congress and the people who sponsored the bill intended,"" Rosen said in an interview with USA TODAY following a two-hour walking tour of the Englewood campus. ""We're pushing it hard; I'm putting my personal attention on that. The attorney general is, too.""

More than 1,000 freed so far

The vast federal prison system has long been a drag on the government, soaking up more than a quarter of the Justice Department's $28 billion budget.

Even though its prison population has dropped since 2014, with 180,664 inmates, it is still the largest penal system in the United States. The system holds more than seven times as many inmates as it did in 1980, at the start of the nation's drug war and a ""tough-on-crime"" strategy that featured mandatory minimum prison sentences for repeat drug offenses that doomed some inmates to more than two decades behind bars. More than 45% of federal inmates are now serving terms for some type of drug offense, by far the largest offense grouping in the system.

The First Step Act, signed into law by Trump last year, is an attempt to both chip away at the spiraling incarceration costs and better prepare offenders for release by driving down rates of recidivism.

The law gave judges more discretion in sentencing non-violent drug offenders, and eases some of the long mandatory-minimum sentences for convicts with only minor criminal records. It allows the government to more easily release seriously ill inmates and seeks to reconcile extreme sentencing disparities between people who sell crack compared to powdered cocaine. That provision alone has already freed 1,093 inmates and led to shorter sentences for 1,540 others.

Longtime advocates for such criminal justice reforms, who also have often been the fiercest critics of the Justice Department, are encouraged by the recent action but are wary of the challenges confronting full implementation of the law.

""I think they are doing their best to get prepared,"" said Kevin Ring, president of Families Against Mandatory Minimums, which has long highlighted the impact of harsh sentencing policy on families of the incarcerated. ""The real test will be in the implementation of all of the different pieces.""

Ring said more attention and money will be needed to support job training and drug treatment programs. He said his group remains disappointed that several classes of offenders will be excluded from qualifying for increased credits for good behavior that can be earned by participating in rehabilitation programs. Those groups include: inmates convicted of terrorism, human trafficking, sex crimes, weapons-related offenses, some fraud crimes and drug traffickers.

""There is going to be some frustration,"" Ring said, referring to the excluded classes of inmates.

Hugh Hurwtiz, acting director of the federal prison system, also acknowledged that the exclusions represent a looming inmate management test for prison staffers.

""How do you manage inmates who are getting the credits and those who are not? That will be a challenge as we roll this out,"" Hurwitz said.

The roll out also comes at a time when the prison system is grappling with persistent staffing shortages. To make up for a shortage of guards, officials have ordered teachers, nurses, kitchen workers and other staffers to serve as correctional officers.

The practice, known as augmentation, has drawn staff away from rehabilitation programs that officials are now touting. It also has prompted criticism from some members of Congress who regard the practice as potentially dangerous.

Rosen, the deputy attorney general, said provisions of the new law ""will put additional demands"" on prison staffers and he indicated that Justice was reviewing staffing across the BOP. But he believed that current personnel levels were not jeopardizing safety.

""Everyone who is trained to work at a federal prison learns to participate in the security role,"" he said. ""But we're looking at that and plan to do whatever makes sense.""

'I plan to start my own company'

Dressed in a neatly pressed prison uniform, Littlelee Ragsdale looked the part of an inmate eager to turn the page on a troubled life.

Ragsdale, who was convicted of possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine, did not hesitate last week when called on to address Englewood's special guest – the deputy attorney general of the United States – to describe how his experience on the prison's roofing and road paving crew could change his life when his sentence is complete in 2023.

""I have a wife and three girls,"" Ragsdale began, adding that his work as a heavy equipment operator had prepared him to assume a new role of responsibility for a waiting family. ""I plan to start my own company.""

Even with the help of Englewood's program, Ragsdale's path will not be easy.

Ragsdale's brush with law enforcement authorities in 2016 was not a one-time mistake.

The former oil field worker has a criminal record that dates to 2001, including burglary and car theft, according to a Wyoming prosecutor familiar with his current case. Past social media posts and photographs also appear to show a fascination with firearms, including an image in which he posed with array of hand guns and rifles.

""If you want re-integration to be successful, you need to think about re-integration at the point of intake in the prison system, not just at the end,"" said Jeff Mellow, a professor of criminal justice at New York's John Jay College.

""When they are ready to leave, you really want to make sure that the first 90 days go smoothly. If they keep hitting that wall in a search for housing or a job many will eventually give up. You only have to think about people who make New Year's resolutions. How long do they last? To be successful post-release, it's so important to have all the resources in place.""

Thursday marks one year since a divided Senate confirmed Brian Benczkowski to lead the Justice Department's criminal division.

The 51-48 vote reflected Democrats' worry that he'd try to interfere with the investigation into Russia's attack on the 2016 election.

Things didn't work out that way.

Benczkowski promised to consult with career officials about any possible conflicts with the special counsel probe, but he said this week that never became necessary.

""I've kept the promises that I made,"" Benczkowski said. ""I didn't have anything to do with the Mueller investigation. Nothing came across my desk. There was nothing that I had to deal with.""

Instead, Benczkowski has spent the past year advancing the administration's priorities: punishing transnational gangs; cracking down on corrupt doctors and pharmacists who fuel the opioid crisis in Appalachia and beyond; and making the process of investigating companies and business executives more transparent.

United States v. Guzman

It started with what Benczkowski said could be the biggest criminal trial in U.S. history: the effort to bring to justice former Sinaloa cartel leader Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman.

That trial extended nearly three months and coincided with a federal government shutdown, bringing uncertainty to DOJ lawyers about whether their hotel bills would ever be paid.

In the end, prosecutors from the criminal division at Justice worked with their counterparts in U.S. attorney's offices in Brooklyn and Miami to secure conviction of Guzman on all 10 of the drug and conspiracy charges.

Authorities recently asked for forfeiture in the amount of $12,666,181,704. Guzman faces mandatory life imprisonment when he is sentenced in New York City on July 17.

Benczkowski said he plans to be in court to support the team.

DOJ's opioid strike force

Benczkowski expressed concern early in his tenure that DOJ wasn't targeting the region that was hardest hit by the opioid crisis. So the criminal division put together a strike force that spans 10 areas in Appalachia.

He secured approval and funding to send 14 health care fraud prosecutors into the region, culminating in dozens of indictments of doctors, pharmacists and other medical professionals last April.

That team continues to crunch data from health care providers and insurance programs to help uncover fraud. Benczkowski said he anticipates another round of prosecutions in Appalachia before the end of the year.

""We're going to keep going at it until we drive down the addiction rate and we drive down the overdose rate in those districts,"" he said.

The white-collar cases

Benczkowski said his third priority is bringing more ""transparency"" to white-collar crime investigations.

So the Justice Department issued new guidelines for prosecutors about recommending independent monitors to oversee errant corporations. Benczkowski also revamped the way that prosecutors assess whether a company is complying with the Justice Department.

Now, DOJ publishes online the times it declines to bring charges against companies that have behaved appropriately and deserved credit for that.

That sends a message, he said, and it makes his own prosecutors work ""a little bit harder."" Lawyers defending companies can point to those decisions and fashion arguments for their own leniency.

""Certainly it's going to give outside lawyers a little bit more ammunition to advocate with,"" he said, arguing that transparency will make government decisions more just.

Benczkowski's comment may prove controversial with consumer protection and shareholder advocates, as well as critics who argue the Justice Department has abandoned its responsibility to police corporate misconduct.

But the Justice Department said it has charged 211 people with fraud so far this year, about half of whom have pleaded guilty, an increase from last year in the same period. Benczkowski also said financial recoveries from corporate resolutions this year will be ""well north"" of $2 billion, about double the amount in 2018.

Benczkowski said he expects to pick a new chief of the DOJ fraud section, which prosecutes such offenses, by the end of the month.

Robert Zink has been filling the job in an acting role since January and may be in line to get the job on a permanent basis, two sources told NPR.

The ransomware menace

Prosecutors are also in the middle of responding to a wave of ransomware attacks that have victimized small and midsize cities in Florida, Georgia, Maryland and elsewhere.

Benczkowski said criminal groups are becoming sophisticated in how they identify their targets: municipalities big enough to afford to pay ransom, but not so sophisticated they're prepared for these kinds of threats.

Benczkowski said he has a message for those cities:

""Invest in the basic cybersecurity protections for your systems that you need, have redundant offline systems that you can turn to in the event that you're attacked, come to law enforcement early in the process ... so that we can help you get better prepared."""

But it's worth checking the US State Department advisories for each country to learn more about any risks before you get there.

The State Department uses four levels of travel guidance to offer Americans advice, set boundaries, and describe the risks of each country:

Level 1 - Exercise normal precautions

Level 2 - Exercise increased caution

Level 3 - Reconsider travel

Level 4 - Do not travel

About half of Asia is classed as low risk, but there are six countries, including Iran, Iraq, and Yemen that are designated Level 4, mostly due to military conflicts, crime, and terrorism threats.

Here are the travel advisories for every country in Asia, ranked from least to most risky based on the State Department's designation levels."

The bill, H.R. 299, enables homebuyers using a VA loan to borrow above the 2019 limit of $484,350 for most counties, without any down payment.

A VA spokesperson told HousingWire that the loan limit will be lifted for loans that are guaranteed or appraised on or after January 1, 2020, and that guidance for lenders would be coming ahead of this date, published on the VA home loan circular page of its website.

The VA also clarified other changes that will go into effect as a result of the bill.

In addition to alleviating limits for veterans looking to purchase a home, H.R. 299 temporarily increase rates for certain loans by 0.15-0.30%, the VA said.

The slight bump in loan fees is intended to help finance health care costs for veterans who are suffering the effects of Agent Orange exposure as a result of their service.

Additional changes to the VA’s loan guaranty program include the elimination of funding fee differences for borrowers who are veterans versus those who are members of the Reserve.

It also removes the loan limit for the Native American Direct Loan Program, exempts Purple Heart recipients from paying loan fees, and authorizes VA-designated appraisers to rely on third parties for appraisal-related information.

The bill’s passage comes after years of lobbying on behalf of numerous trade groups, including the National Association of Realtors, which teamed with other housing industry trade groups to ensure veterans’ health care benefits would be extended without a significant increase to VA loan fees.

Now that the bill has passed, it is expected to “fast-track” disability compensation for as many as 90,000 affected former service members, according to military.com.

The VA said it does not have any formal projections as to how the changes brought on by the bill will its home loan guaranty program."
Intelligence official resigns after White House blocks his climate change testimony,https://www.pressherald.com,['Email Writer'],07-10-2019,2019,7,https://www.pressherald.com/2019/07/10/intelligence-official-resigns-after-white-house-blocks-his-climate-change-testimony/,"WASHINGTON – A State Department intelligence official who was blocked by the White House from submitting written congressional testimony on climate change last month is resigning from his post.

Rod Schoonover – who worked in the Office of the Geographer and Global Issues’ Bureau of Intelligence and Research – spoke about the security risks the U.S. faces due to climate change before the House Intelligence Committee on June 5. But White House officials would not let him submit the bureau’s written statement that climate impacts could be “possibly catastrophic” after the State Department refused to cut references to federal scientific findings on climate change.

Individuals familiar with the matter, who asked for anonymity in order to speak frankly, said that Schoonover chose to leave voluntarily. But the incident that helped lead to his departure underscores the extent to which climate science has become contested terrain under the current administration.

Andrew Rosenberg, who directs the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said in a phone interview Wednesday that federal experts should be free to provide their expertise with policymakers, even if it is at odds with the views of whoever occupies the Oval Office.

“This isn’t carrying forward your political opinions,” Rosenberg said, “this is bringing the work you’re hired to do in a policy setting.”

President Donald Trump has repeatedly questioned the scientific consensus that human activity is driving recent climate change, and that the planet’s warming poses a major security risk to the United States.

Asked about the matter Wednesday, a State Department official confirmed that Schoonover would step down July 12.

Schoonover, who has served in the federal government for roughly a decade, could not be reached for comment. Before working at the Bureau of Intelligence and Research, he had served as director of environment and natural resources at the National Intelligence Council and as a full professor of chemistry and biochemistry at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo.

Three divisions of the White House, the Office of Legislative Affairs, the Office of Management and Budget and the National Security Council all raised objections to parts of the intelligence bureau’s testimony, according to documents obtained by The Washington Post. Ultimately, the Office of Legislative Affairs made the decision not to submit the document to the House Intelligence Committee.

One of the statements White House officials objected to was the observation, “Absent extensive mitigating factors or events, we see few plausible future scenarios where significant – possibly catastrophic – harm does not arise from the compounded effects of climate change.”

Last month, after the Post reported that the testimony had been suppressed, the panel’s chairman, Adam Schiff, D-Calif., demanded the heads of two federal intelligence agencies provide documents about the incident.

Rosenberg said that even though Schoonover may have left on his own, the controversy surrounding his testimony could intimidate other experts within the federal government’s ranks.

“That’s just a terrible signal to federal professionals broadly, to people in the State Department who don’t know what they can say in their relations with other countries and the Hill,” he said.

Even as the fallout over last month’s climate hearing continues, the White House has decided to shelve one controversial idea: establishing a group to question the federal government’s own findings on climate change. The task force, championed by NSC senior director William Happer, has been under discussion for months but ran into opposition from members of the intelligence and defense community as well as some of Trump’s own scientific appointees.

E&E News first reported Tuesday that the climate science panel had been indefinitely postponed. Two individuals briefed on the matter, who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record, confirmed the delay.

Myron Ebell, who directs the Center for Energy and Environment at the conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute, attributed the decision to a political calculation by Trump’s reelection campaign consultants, saying they effectively told him: “We have polling showing that you need to stress your environmental accomplishments and not start controversial things that will get you bad press, like going after climate science.”

Officials at the National Security Council declined to comment on the status of the aborted climate panel.

Francesco Femia, CEO of the Council on Strategic Risks and co-founder of the Center for Climate and Security, welcomed the decision to nix the task force.

“The very lowest baseline is that the White House should never politicize science or intelligence analysis, so this isn’t anything to celebrate under normal circumstances,” Femia said in an email.

“But it is still good to see this politically-motivated effort fail. The national security, military, intelligence and science communities came out strongly against it, and the result affirms that standing up for the integrity of our democratic system matters, especially since too many of our political leaders won’t.”

Democrats smeared all opposition to Obama as racist; now AOC is playing the race card against Pelosi,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-11-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/democrats-smeared-all-opposition-to-obama-as-racist-now-aoc-is-playing-the-race-card-against-pelosi,"Nancy Pelosi tried to scold the ""Four Horsewomen of the Apocalypse"" this week, and boy, did it escalate quickly.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has responded by accusing the speaker of — what else? — racism. Considering Democrats spent the entire Obama era claiming that all opposition to their agenda constituted racism, it really could not have happened to a nicer party.

Pelosi spoke privately with members of her caucus this week, admonishing specifically those who had been broadcasting House Democrats' family disputes all over social media rather than seeking guidance and resolution from leadership. Unsurprisingly, Pelosi zeroed in on the freshman New York representative, who has yet to let a thought go untweeted, and her progressive colleagues, including Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan.

""So, again, you got a complaint? You come and talk to me about it,"" the speaker reportedly told Democrats. ""But do not tweet about our members and expect us to think that that is just OK.""

This is basic party discipline, but Ocasio-Cortez’s takeaway from this closed-door meeting was not, “be a team player and expect a ruckus if you besmirch your fellow Democrats in public.” Rather, the message that the freshman congresswoman came away with is: Nancy Pelosi is a racist.

“When these comments first started, I kind of thought that she was keeping the progressive flank at more of an arm’s distance in order to protect more moderate members, which I understood,” Ocasio-Cortez told the Washington Post, referring to not just the closed-door meeting but other critical remarks that the speaker has had for herself and the other freshman progressives.

She added, “But the persistent singling out . . . it got to a point where it was just outright disrespectful . . . the explicit singling out of newly elected women of color.”

Uh-oh.

I do not know which is funnier: Ocasio-Cortez falling back on her predictable “woman of color"" card to defend her conduct, or the fact that Pelosi, whose party spent all eight years of the Obama administration using bad faith allegations of racism, has now herself become the target of the same kind of transparently absurd accusations. I guess it was only a matter of time before the Monster turned on Frankenstein.

I would be lying if I said it has not been entertaining to watch the escalation of hostilities between Pelosi and the progressives, including when the speaker said of the Four Horsewomen in a New York Times interview that published Saturday, “All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world. They didn’t have any following. They’re four people and that’s how many votes they got.”

This clearly got under AOC's skin. She responded with a tweet that read: ""That public 'whatever' is called public sentiment. And wielding the power to shift it is how we actually achieve meaningful change in this country.""

That public “whatever” is called public sentiment.



And wielding the power to shift it is how we actually achieve meaningful change in this country. https://t.co/u6JtgwwRsk — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) July 7, 2019

Earlier than that, Pelosi had remarked publicly that Ocasio-Cortez’s electoral victory against incumbent former Rep. Joe Crowley was not that impressive, considering New York’s 14th Congressional District is overwhelmingly liberal.

""[T]hose are districts that are solidly Democratic. This glass of water would win with a D next to its name in those districts,"" the speaker said, motioning to a glass near a table.

John Boehner, who also faced an insurrection led by over-eager, under-prepared, and inexperienced freshman lawmakers when he served as speaker, must be enjoying the spectacle."
EPA employee protests union contract while receiving award from Admin.

Loreen Targos, an EPA employee in Chicago, unfurled a banner on stage next to Wheeler reading, “I care about EPA workers having a fair contract to address public health and climate change. Do you?”

Targos was on stage with the rest of a team being honored for cleaning up refinery waste near Muskegon Lake in Michigan.

released by American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Local 704, based in the Great Lakes region, Targos can be heard asking Wheeler if he supports a fair contract for EPA workers.

EPA employees have been outraged by a recent contract that went into effect Tuesday that remains unsigned by union leaders and scales back union protections.

In an interview with The Hill, Targos said Wheeler did briefly respond to her.

“I did look at him and ask him and ask if he was going to support a fair contract and he said something along the lines of agency talking points of ‘We tried to come to the bargaining table but you guys refused.’”

The fight between the EPA and the union began over how much of the contract was even negotiable. The EPA wanted to renegotiate the entire contract, while the union wanted to renegotiate a narrower slice.

Under the latest contract, union employees would have to give up office space within the EPA offices and union leaders would not be able to use the intranet or agency billboards to communicate with members. It would also limit the amount of time union leaders could spend helping rank-and-file employees with labor disputes and other issues by 75 percent. It also changes how employees can arbitrate their grievances.

Targos said the new contract was “unilaterally imposed.” The AFGE has already filed an unfair labor practice charge against the EPA.

“There was all this pomp and circumstance to highlight the good work of EPA employees,” Targos said. “Why take away the conditions that supported such award-winning work?”

The EPA said it issued the new contract after years of fruitless negotiations.

“Administrator Wheeler was proud to host the National Honor Awards ceremony for the first time in 10 years and recognize the outstanding achievements of more than 700 EPA staff,” a spokesman told The Hill. “This collective bargaining agreement (CBA) expired 12 years ago, the Trump EPA has worked with AFGE for the past two-and-half years to reach a new CBA and EPA is not the party refusing to come to the negotiating table.”

Targos said a security officer stopped her later and asked if she was actually an EPA employee.

“When I said yes he asked if I was really here to receive an award for that team and if I had just snuck on stage, so I said, ‘Yes I was in that group and supposed to get an award with that team,’” she said.

Targos said she was hoping to get more of a response from Wheeler.

“There’s always a part of you that hopes they will be better than what they say about them in the media, and it’s a sad thing to always be disappointed and realize, 'Oh you’re as bad as they say you are.'”"
Ex-State Department employee gets more than three years in prison over Chinese intel ties,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-10-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ex-state-department-employee-gets-more-than-three-years-in-prison-over-chinese-intel-ties,"A former State Department employee was sentenced to 40 months in prison for accepting thousands of dollars worth of gifts from Chinese intelligence agents in exchange for internal government documents.

Candace Marie Claiborne, 63, failed to disclose her repeated contacts with two agents of China’s intelligence service, who gave her cash, international travel and vacations, tuition at a Chinese fashion school, a furnished apartment, and more over five years.

In exchange, Claiborne, who was employed as an office management specialist, gave the agents copies of internal State Department documents on U.S. economic strategies and visits by dignitaries between the two countries, among other topics.

Claiborne then misled FBI and State Department investigators about her contacts with the agents and urged a co-conspirator to dispose of evidence connecting her to the agents.

She will also have three years of supervised release and a fine of $40,000.

“This is not what I had envisioned for my life. … I still don’t know how I lost myself,” Claiborne told U.S. District Court Judge Randolph Moss on Tuesday. ""I lost my job, reputation and the trust of the government. I made a terrible mistake and now I'm paying the price.""

China has seen increasing success in recruiting Americans to pass along government secrets. Since March, at least three other Americans have pleaded guilty or were convicted of espionage or attempted spying on behalf of the Chinese.

“The targeting of U.S. security clearance holders by Chinese intelligence services is a constant threat we face, and today’s sentencing shows that those who betray the trust of the American people will be held accountable for their actions,” John Selleck, the acting assistant director of the FBI’s Washington Field Office, said in a statement Tuesday.

Claiborne, who held a top secret security clearance during her employment, joined the State Department in 1999, serving in posts in China, Sudan, and Iraq until she returned to the U.S. in 2015.

The Chinese agents began paying her in 2011 for information. Prosecutors said Claiborne was aware of the consequences of her agreement with the Chinese agents, but was motivated by the financial rewards.

When renewing her security clearance in 2014, Claiborne “deliberately excluded” her contacts with the Chinese agents, the criminal complaint said. She also omitted the contacts to investigators while she continued to communicate with the agents about additional benefits and tried to hide evidence of their agreement.

The FBI also sent an undercover agent, who posed as a Chinese intelligence officer, to her home in Washington, D.C., and Claiborne invited the undercover agent into her home but never reported the contact to the U.S. government, despite the government’s requirement to do so.

Claiborne was arrested in March 2017. She pleaded guilty in April to one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States."
Justice Department trying to quash Mueller team testimony,https://www.reuters.com,"['David Morgan', 'Min Read']",07-11-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia/justice-department-trying-to-quash-mueller-team-testimony-idUSKCN1U51JJ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department is trying to prevent two former members of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team from testifying behind closed doors in Congress next week, when Mueller will testify before lawmakers, according to people familiar with the matter.

The department is opposing testimony by Aaron Zebley and James Quarles before the Democratic-led Judiciary and Intelligence committees in the House of Representatives, two sources said.

The men were expected to testify on July 17, the same day that Mueller is due as a witness before the two panels.

Democrats said they still expect Zebley and Quarles to appear, arguing that the Justice Department has no authority over the behavior of former employees. But a third source told Reuters that the former Mueller team members were still negotiating with the committees.

“We expect them to appear,” Representative Zoe Lofgren, a Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee, told reporters. “We’ve got two hours with the Judiciary and Mr. Mueller, and two hours for the Intel committee with Mr. Mueller, and then some time afterwards with his staff.”

Justice Department officials had no immediate comment and Zebley and Quarles could not be reached for comment.

The episode is the latest example of Trump administration efforts to stymie congressional investigations by directing current and former officials not to cooperate with investigators who are seeking evidence of corruption, obstruction of justice and abuse of power in the Trump presidency.

Democrats plan to attack the administration’s blocking tactics this month with a federal lawsuit. In preparation for court action, the committee on Wednesday told the White House in a letter that it rejected immunity claims that prompted one former Trump aide to refuse to answer more than 200 questions.

The panel gave White House officials until July 17 to produce a revised list of objections.

House Judiciary Committee Democrats, who are poised to expand their probe of Trump, his family and associates with a slew of new subpoenas, say Mueller’s testimony will focus public attention on some of the more disturbing findings of his two-year investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

In a 448-page report, Mueller said the Trump campaign had numerous contacts with Moscow, though the investigation did not find sufficient evidence to show conspiracy.

He did not conclude that Trump obstructed justice by trying to impede the Russia probe, but also did not exonerate the president of doing so.

The House Judiciary Committee is also investigating alleged hush payments during the 2016 campaign to two women who claimed to have affairs with Trump, including porn star Stormy Daniels.

“The Dems Witch Hunt continues!” Trump said in a tweet on Wednesday. He has regularly denounced the Mueller investigation while also claiming that the probe found “no collusion” with Russia and “no obstruction.”

Judiciary Committee Democrats privately met on Wednesday to discuss details of conducting the Mueller hearing and his aides’ testimony. Lawmakers emerging from the session said arrangement were still in flux.

Mueller, in his first public comments since starting his investigation, said on May 29 that Justice Department policies meant the probe was never going to end with criminal charges against Trump, and indicated it was up to Congress to decide whether he should be impeached.

“If we had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so,” Mueller said."
Interior Dept. says it spent $2.45M in public funds on Trump’s ‘Salute to America’,https://wtop.com,['News Traffic Weather'],07-11-2019,2019,7,https://wtop.com/dc/2019/07/interior-dept-says-it-spent-2-45m-in-public-funds-on-trumps-salute-to-america/,"Interior Secretary David Bernhardt put estimates of department's share of costs for President Donald Trump’s July 4 ""Salute to America"" at $2.45 million.

In a letter to lawmakers on Capitol Hill made public Thursday, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt put estimates of the department’s share of costs for President Donald Trump’s July Fourth “Salute to America” at the Lincoln Memorial at $2.45 million.

Bernhardt called the use of public funds justified, and cited past administrations’ spending for concerts, parades and other celebrations in and around the National Mall.

Interior’s costs included crowd accommodations, such as temporary fencing and portable toilets.

The disclosure confirms what The Washington Post had previously reported: that close to $2.5 million was diverted from the National Park Service, which normally uses the money from entrance and recreation fees to make improvements to U.S. parks.

Arizona Democrat Raul Grijalva, chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, said the public funds were used to “celebrate President Trump.”

There are further concerns from local leaders as well.

In a Tuesday letter to Trump, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the president’s Fourth of July event on the National Mall, as well as protests by others, have left the city’s security fund bankrupt, and that it will be running at a deficit of more than $6 million by the end of September.

She attributed the Emergency Planning and Security Fund (EPSF) numbers to estimates by the District’s Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency and said the total cost for the District is estimated at $1.7 million.

The EPSF covers public safety at events, anti-terror efforts and support for the Secret Service.

Security for the annual “A Capitol Fourth” concert, which was held the same day on the National Mall, was provided by the federal Capitol Police and U.S. Park Police, not D.C. police.

Bowser also said D.C. still hasn’t been reimbursed the $7.3 million extra it spent for Trump’s 2017 inauguration.

“These overages can be attributed to declining reserves, increased demand for heightened security, and a one-time draw down of $7.3 million to cover security costs associated with the 2017 presidential inauguration,” Bowser wrote.

The White House debates that figure.

Reached for comment about Bowser’s letter, the White House said: “We have received the letter and will respond in a timely manner.”

Senators are also seeking to probe the cost of the event, which included military flyovers and tanks on the National Mall.

WTOP has submitted a Freedom of Information Act request with the National Park Service, via the Interior Department, to see a cost breakdown for the event.

A Defense Department spokesperson confirmed Wednesday that the Pentagon spent $1.2 million on the “Salute to America” celebration, which does not factor in the cost of flyovers, since the flyovers are being listed as training flights to “facilitate flying hours, which are imperative to military readiness.”

That puts known cost estimates for “Salute to America” at $5.35 million.

Justice Department probing Deutsche Bank’s dealings with Malaysia’s 1MDB,https://nypost.com,['July'],07-11-2019,2019,7,https://nypost.com/2019/07/11/justice-department-probing-deutsche-banks-dealings-with-malaysias-1mdb/,"The US Justice Department is investigating whether Deutsche Bank violated foreign corruption or anti-money-laundering laws in its work for state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), the Wall Street Journal said on Wednesday.

The news comes after the bank announced plans to scrap its global equities unit, cut some fixed-income operations and slash 18,000 jobs globally in an $8.34 billion restructuring program.

Deutsche Bank’s work for 1MDB included helping to raise $1.2 billion in 2014 as concerns about the fund’s management and financials had begun to circulate, the newspaper said, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.

Prosecutors are mainly looking into the role of Tan Boon-Kee, a colleague of a former Goldman Sachs executive, Tim Leissner, who worked with him on 1MDB-related business, the paper said.

She left Goldman to become Asia-Pacific head of banking for financial institutions clients at Deutsche Bank, where she was involved with further 1MDB dealings, it added.

In an emailed statement, Deutsche Bank said it had fully cooperated with all regulatory and law enforcement agencies that made inquiries about the fund.

“As stated in asset forfeiture complaints filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, 1MDB made ‘material misrepresentations and omissions to Deutsche Bank officials’ in connection with 1MDB’s transactions with the bank,” the bank told Reuters.

“This is consistent with the bank’s own findings in this matter,” it added.

A DoJ civil asset forfeiture complaint repeatedly describes Deutsche Bank as being misled by 1MDB officers, the WSJ said.

Tan left Deutsche Bank last year, after it discovered communications between her and Jho Low, the Malaysian financier whom the Justice Department has described as the central player in the 1MDB scandal, it added.

A representative of insurance company FWD Group, Tan’s current employer, said the company and Tan declined to comment.

The DoJ did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters."
The Energy 202: Agriculture Department pushes back against reports it’s trying to curb climate-related science,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Ben Guarino', 'Reporter Covering The Practice', 'Culture Of Science']",07-11-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/07/11/the-energy-202-agriculture-department-pushes-back-against-reports-it-s-trying-to-curb-climate-related-science/5d266522a7a0a47d87c570c1/,"THE LIGHTBULB

The Agriculture Department’s research leaders appear to be doing damage control after reports that the agency suppressed climate science research and potentially violated its own scientific integrity policies.

The pushback comes after a Politico investigation found the USDA attempted to keep innovative government-funded climate change research from the public eye. And The Washington Post revealed earlier this year the agency required its in-house scientists to label their peer-reviewed studies as “preliminary” — a policy it reversed in May after criticism that such a disclaimer would diminish the impact of the work or prevent its publication.

In an internal letter sent to all research employees on Friday, USDA scientific directors and administrators argued that the department did not undermine climate research — and had not violated its scientific integrity policy.

“USDA has no policy, practice, nor intent to minimize, discredit, de-emphasize or otherwise influence the climate-related science carried out by USDA scientists and agencies,” read the letter signed by deputy undersecretary Scott Hutchins and several top research officials, including acting chief scientist Chavonda Jacobs-Young. Three USDA employees separately confirmed the letter’s authenticity to The Post.

USDA research contributed to more than 500 articles “related to climate science projects” published in scientific journals in 2018, the letter continued.

“Scientific integrity is of paramount importance in USDA, and the USDA scientific integrity policy specifically states that ‘scientific findings and products must not be suppressed or altered for political purposes and must not be subjected to inappropriate influence.’ ”

The USDA did not offer further comment on the letter. “The email sent to REE employees last week is self-explanatory,” USDA spokesman Damon Thompson said in an email to The Post, referring to the agency’s research, education and economics division.

But Politico uncovered that the USDA withheld a news release about a study that found rice loses nutrients when environmental carbon increases.

The communications office also pressured the University of Washington, whose scientists were co-authors of the report, not to publicize the report. “The intent is to try to suppress a message — in this case, the increasing danger of human-caused climate change,” Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann told Politico.

“When this has to be said, it confirms what we all know,” said a senior employee at the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, who spoke to The Washington Post on the condition of anonymity to avoid professional retaliation, of the letter. “If this were true, scientists wouldn’t have had to publish their papers as ‘preliminary data.’ Instead, two USDA science agencies are being exiled to Kansas City.”

The employee was referring to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue’s announcement in June that the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which funds more than a billion dollars each year in agriculture research, and the Economic Research Service, an influential statistical agency, would move out of their Washington offices to Kansas City by the end of September. The decision prompted concerns among current and former USDA employees that the Trump administration was seeking to suppress research through employee attrition and physically moving them far from collaborators.

An analysis by the firm Ernst & Young suggests the move will save $300 million over 15 years. But the Agricultural and Applied Economics Association, a professional association for economists, has disputed those savings, arguing the move may cost taxpayers up to $128 million because the initial analysis does not account for the value of lost research data and overstates the cost of keeping the agencies in the capital.

Employees, worried about uprooted families and hampered careers — the agencies frequently collaborate with other Washington-based employees — have quit in unusually large numbers. A recent survey conducted by the American Federation of Government Employees, the union that represents the two agencies, suggests about seven in 10 employees do not plan to relocate to Kansas City.

“Our staff, with all their years of experience, are leaving for other agencies. We should be focused on this, rather than hastily moving the agency,” Wesley Dean, a NIFA employee and vice president of the local bargaining unit, said in a statement on Wednesday.

— State Dept. official who was barred from submitting climate testimony steps down: Rod Schoonover, the State Department intelligence aide who the White House blocked from submitting written testimony on climate change, is resigning from the agency. Schoonover is leaving voluntarily, The Post’s Juliet Eilperin reports, adding that still, “the incident that led to his departure underscores the extent to which climate science has become contested terrain under the current administration.” The State Department confirmed he will leave his post Friday. The outgoing aide “spoke before the House Intelligence Committee on June 5 about the security risks the United States faces because of climate change. But White House officials would not let him submit the bureau’s written statement that climate impacts could be ‘possibly catastrophic,’ after the State Department refused to cut references to federal scientific findings on climate change.”

— Arrests in Puerto Rico scandal spur concerns about storm aid: The FBI arrested two former top officials who served in the administration of Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló, an incident that pushed Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.), who leads the House panel that oversees the U.S. territory, to call for Rosselló to resign. “The federal indictment says the former officials illegally directed federal funding to politically connected contractors. The arrests come about a month after Congress approved a controversial disaster aid bill that earmarked additional funding for Puerto Rico’s recovery from Hurricane Maria in 2017, which was tied up in part because President Trump called Puerto Rico’s officials 'incompetent or corrupt,'"" The Post’s Jeff Stein reports. He adds ""island’s allies fear the arrests will give Trump greater justification for curtailing badly needed aid to the island.""

— The latest in tensions between Iran and Western powers: Britain says it stopped three Iranian vessels from interfering with one of its tankers in the Strait of Hormuz. In a statement the British government said it was “concerned by this action and continue to urge the Iranian authorities to de-escalate the situation in the region.” “Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps denied Thursday that it was involved in challenging the British tanker, which is operated by the London-based oil and gas company BP, saying in a statement carried by Iranian news outlets that there had been no confrontations with foreign vessels in the past 24 hours,” The Post’s Erin Cunningham reports.

— U.S. accuses Iran of ‘nuclear extortion’: In a statement made during an emergency meeting of the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the United States accused Iran of “nuclear extortion” and said its latest efforts to increase atomic energy activities would “exacerbate” tensions between the United States and Tehran, Cunningham reports. “There is no credible reason for Iran to expand its nuclear program, and there is no way to read this as anything other than a crude and transparent attempt to extort payments from the international community,” the United States said at the meeting. President Trump also threatened Iran with more sanctions in a Wednesday tweet and without evidence charged that Iran has “long been secretly ‘enriching’” uranium in violation of the 2015 nuclear deal.

""No one should take this storm lightly"": The National Hurricane Center is predicting that the season's first hurricane, Barry, will hit the coast of Louisiana on Saturday. “The storm is predicted to be a massive rainmaker, unloading double-digit rainfall totals that will probably trigger serious inland flooding. Assuming it attains hurricane strength, damaging wind gusts are likely near where it comes ashore as well as a dangerous storm surge, which is a rise in water above normally dry land that can inundate homes, roads and businesses,"" The Post's Brian McNoldy and Jason Samenow report. ""Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency on Wednesday, warning residents that '[t]his is going to be a Louisiana event with coastal flooding and heavy rainfall potentially impacting every part of the state. No one should take this storm lightly.'""

— PG&E’s wildfire woes: California’s largest utility was aware for years that hundreds of miles of its power lines could spark wildfires, but according to documents obtained by the Wall Street Journal, PG&E did not act to solve the problem. “The failure last year of a century-old transmission line that sparked a wildfire, killed 85 people and destroyed the town of Paradise wasn’t an aberration, the documents show,” the Wall Street Journal reports. “A year earlier, PG&E executives conceded to a state lawyer that the company needed to process many projects, all at once, to prevent system failures — a problem they said could be likened to a ‘pig in the python.’”

A judge responds: The federal judge overseeing PG&E’s probation related to its safety-related violations is ordering PG&E to response to the Wall Street Journal’s report “on a paragraph-by-paragraph basis.” William Alsup, a U.S. district court judge in Northern California gave the company until the end of the month to submit a “fresh, forthright statement owning up to the true extent of the” report, according to the Journal.

Trump Admin’s ‘Pro-Women’ Human Rights Panel Stacked With Anti-Abortion Figures,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Emily Shugerman', 'Gender Reporter']",07-11-2019,2019,7,https://www.thedailybeast.com/state-department-loads-pro-women-commission-on-unalienable-rights-with-abortion-opponents,"A new Trump administration commission on human rights will be filled with anti-abortion advocates, including a former ambassador to the Holy See who declared that abortion is “related to the coarsening of the social fabric.”

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the creation of the Commission on Unalienable Rights last week in a Wall St. Journal op-ed, in which he claimed the discussion around human rights had become diluted. The new group, he wrote, would “ground our discussion of human rights in America’s founding principles.”

The announcement drew concern from human rights groups like Amnesty International, who worried the commission would seek to limit the scope of human rights domestically and abroad. And while the State Department claims the group will not discuss abortion, the conservative makeup of the commission has reproductive rights advocates on edge.

“Appointing these ideologues to a commission purporting to safeguard human rights will have the opposite effect and will endanger the health and well-being of countless women,” Michelle Kuppersmith, director of reproductive rights group Equity Forward, said in a statement.

“This is a clear extension of the Trump administration’s anti-women, anti-reproductive health campaign, and a blatant attempt to restrict the rights of vulnerable populations around the globe.”

The chair of the 12-person commission, Harvard Professor Mary Ann Glendon, is a former U.S. ambassador to the Holy See who led the Vatican’s delegation to the United Nations Conference on Women in 1995. At the time, she told The New York Times she “could not agree more” with Pope John Paul II, who was known for his traditional Catholic stances on abortion and contraception. She later went on to receive Notre Dame’s Evangelium Vitae Medal for “Heroes Of The Pro-Life Movement.”

‘The whole question about abortion is related to the coarsening of the social fabric,” Glendon told the Times in 1995. “It promotes a certain callousness which has frightening implications for the future.”

Also serving on the commission is F. Cartwright Weiland, a Texas-based attorney who studied under Glendon at Harvard Law. Weiland helped write Supreme Court amicus briefs supporting Texas’s restrictions on abortion providers and served on the Council For Life’s “Role of Rights” education panel.

Commission member Shaykh Hamza Yusuf Hanson, the president of Zaytuna College, published an article last year calling abortion “an assault on a sanctified life,” while fellow member Christopher Olaf Tollefsen co-authored the book Embryo: A Defense of Human Life, which argues against stem-cell research and promotes the idea that life begins at conception.

“There is nothing potential about the life of the fetus, the embryo, or the zygote: it is actually alive,” he wrote in a 2010 journal article. “Nor is there anything potential about the humanity of that life: it is an actual human life.”

Commission member Jacqueline Rivers, a sociology lecturer at Harvard, spoke on a 2017 Harvard Law Students For Life Panel Entitled “Why We Are ProLife: Dignity, Equality, Human Rights,” where she discussed how her pro-life views are rooted in her Christian faith. (The year before, she had delivered a letter to Hillary Clinton from more than 20 black church leaders asking her to address “justice for the unborn.”) In 2016, commission member Paolo Carozza spoke about a pro-life approach to international develeopment on the Notre Dame Right To Life Panel.

A senior administration official did not answer The Daily Beast’s questions about whether any members of the commission support abortion rights. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the commission would be advisory in nature and would not address “policy questions” like abortion rights. Instead, the official said, it would attempt to ground human rights in the founding principles of “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.”

“This is really a commission devoted to principles of inalienable rights,” the official said. “The commission has nothing to do with those kinds of domestic policy debates of the day; it will not discuss them.”

“ The commission is the most pro-women commission in the world, because it doesn't distinguish between men and women. ” — Senior administration official

“The commission is the most pro-women commission in the world, because it doesn't distinguish between men and women,” the official added.

The Trump administration has repeatedly tried to reduce its commitment to reproductive rights internationally, pushing to remove references to “sexual and reproductive health” from U.N. documents and threatening to veto a United Nations Security Council resolution on rape as a weapon of war because it mentioned reproductive health services. The State Department has also removed all data on reproductive rights from its annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices.

In a press release, the Center for Reproductive Rights called the new commission “part of a comprehensive effort by this Administration to erase sexual and reproductive health and rights from global discourse.”

“Contrary to its asserted purpose, there is no need to redefine or develop foundational principles on human rights,” they said. “There is a clear and unequivocal consensus by U.N. human rights treaty bodies and independent experts that reproductive rights are human rights, grounded in the right to life, health, equality, non-discrimination and freedom from cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment, among other rights.”

Amanda Kasling, the Human Rights Watch Acting Co-Director for Women’s Rights, added that interpretations of international law define abortion is a human rights issue. Even a limited discussion of of “inalienable rights,” she said, would have include access to health care—including access to family planning and abortion—as well as prevention of maternal mortality.

“For women to actually be able to fully enjoy and have a fulfillment of their human rights, you have to ensure access to reproductive health care, full stop,” she said."
The accused criminals and miscreants Trump doesn't seem to mind,https://www.cnn.com,['Jill Filipovic'],07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/09/opinions/trump-kraft-epstein-filipovic/index.html,"Jill Filipovic is a journalist based in Washington and author of the book, "" The H-Spot: The Feminist Pursuit of Happiness ."" Follow her on Twitter . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) During a week in which the nation's biggest news story is the arrest of the shady financier and pal of President Trump Jeffrey Epstein on charges of operating a sex trafficking ring in which he abused underage girls, (Epstein has pleaded not guilty ), Trump is sending quite a message.

Let's recall, first, what Trump told New York magazine in 2002 . ""I've known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life.""

Trump, too, enjoys a social life. At the same time Epstein's arrest was dominating headlines, the President invited Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, to a Treasury Department dinner, and sat him in a seat of honor, at the President's own table. Kraft was recently charged with soliciting a woman in connection with prostitution while visiting a Florida massage parlor. Kraft has pleaded not guilty.

Kraft's case is mild compared with what other Trump cronies have done. But with that dinner invitation on that particular night, Trump signaled loud and clear he doesn't mind being around an accused sex criminal.

Trump's labor secretary, Alex Acosta, is in trouble in Florida for his role in helping Epstein avoid accountability -- Acosta, then a prosecutor, gave Epstein a lenient plea deal that was kept secret from his victims. A federal judge found that Acosta and his team broke the law, but that hasn't meant any consequences for Acosta in his current job thus far.

These are just the latest in a string of shady characters -- accused predators, predator-enablers and misogynists -- embraced by the President. The dinner Kraft attended was a formal meeting with the Qatari Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, a 39-year-old leader with two wives who rules over a wealthy nation that is a human rights nightmare . Migrant workers in Qatar are treated like slaves, homosexuality there is punishable by prison or even death, and women are second-class citizens , having fewer rights than men in everything from citizenship to marriage, to child custody, to divorce and physical safety.

White House aide Rob Porter resigned in disgrace after both of his ex-wives came forward to say he abused them ""He threw me down on the bed and punched me in the face,"" one told The Intercept . Porter denied the allegations.

Steve Bannon, who ran Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, faced charges of misdemeanor domestic violence and battery against his wife in 1996. He denied these allegations and the charges were ultimately dismissed. The couple are now divorced. He was later elevated to a seat on Trump's National Security Council.

David Sorensen , a speechwriter and aide to Stephen Miller, was also accused of domestic abuse, including running his then-wife's foot over with a car and burning her with a cigarette, according to the Washington Post. He denies the accusations and was never charged.

Trump loves to brag about his law-and-order bona fides, sounding the alarm about allegedly dangerous immigrants in the United States. But certain men -- like him, a bunch of his friends, and their enablers -- are a category of accused criminals and miscreants he doesn't seem to mind.

Remember that Trump himself stands accused of a long list of sexual misdeeds , from barging into the dressing rooms of teenage beauty contestants to groping a woman on an airplane, to a credible accusation of rape made less than a month ago, to bragging about grabbing women by the genitals.

In this last case, Trump brushed off the countless rebukes by saying it was ""locker room talk,"" before suggesting that the tape might be fake, according to The New York Times

His own ex-wife accused him of raping her (though she later said she didn't mean ""rape"" in a legal sense). He denies all of these things.

And he has a socialized with Epstein in the past, though a lawyer for the Trump Organization denied the two had a social relationship.

The last few years have been a reckoning for powerful but sexually abusive men. Again and again, we ask how they managed to evade justice and do wrong for so long. Jeffrey Epstein is one of them. Another one sits in the Oval Office."
DHS Admits It Doesn't Have to Reject Donations to Migrants,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Sam Brodey', 'Congressional Reporter']",07-11-2019,2019,7,https://www.thedailybeast.com/dhs-admits-it-doesnt-have-to-reject-donations-to-migrants,"Americans have responded to reports of abysmal conditions at federally-run government migrant detention centers—where many, including children, lack access to basic necessities—by sending them donations of supplies like soap, toothbrushes, diapers, and toys.

So far, those donations have been rejected by the Department of Homeland Security, leaving the public and lawmakers alike angry and scratching their heads as to why. But the agency, which runs many of these detention centers, is now acknowledging that there is little legal basis to justify turning down donations from the public to help improve conditions for migrants.

Former DHS officials have contended in the press that it would be against the law for the government to accept donations of supplies for migrants provided by private citizens due to an obscure law called the Antideficiency Act, which bars federal agencies from using anything that has not been paid for through funds appropriated by Congress.

Unless, of course, the agency is DHS, which could take advantage of a massive loophole provided for them to do just that in existing law.

An appropriations bill signed into law in 2004 authorized the Secretary of Homeland Security to “accept, hold, administer, and utilize gifts and bequests… to facilitate the work of the Department of Homeland Security.” There is also an exception for emergencies involving “the safety of human life.”

In response to questions from The Daily Beast, a DHS spokesperson did not say whether or not the Antideficiency Act prohibits the agency from accepting donated supplies for the benefit of migrants currently held in detention.

“CBP must comply with Federal law and relevant DHS policy in order to receive and manage donations,” said the spokesperson, referencing U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the agency that directly manages detention facilities. “At this time we are coordinating among relevant CBP offices, including our Office of Chief Counsel to determine how we can most efficiently accept and manage donations from the public, in compliance with law and policy.”

A House Democratic aide told The Daily Beast that DHS could easily apply this 2004 statute to the current situation, putting the agency on solid legal ground to accept the boxes of hygiene supplies and toys that charities and private citizens have been ferrying to overcrowded, needy facilities in places like Clint, Texas. “The bigger issue, they’ve told us, isn’t the legal issue here, it’s more the logistical issue,” the aide said.

A House Republican aide echoed concerns about logistics and the capacity of the agency, which just obtained an emergency infusion of $4.6 billion from Congress to handle the situation at the border.

“Processing donations takes manpower,” said the aide. “Employees have to inspect donations, launder clothes, etc., at a time when CBP is already stretched thin.” DHS would not comment on its communications with lawmakers.

To this point, lawmakers from both parties and both sides of the Capitol have pressed the department for an explanation of why donations from the public are going unused. “This is something we need to address in hours and days, not weeks and months,” read a letter to DHS Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan, sent on June 3 by Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX) and signed by 13 GOP lawmakers and three Democrats.

That group asked DHS to tell them how they could provide resources to help them better process donations. But a spokesperson for Crenshaw said on Monday that they had not yet received a response to their inquiries.

In another letter to McAleenan, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) also urged DHS to “establish and publicize a process for accepting donations from charitable organizations, faith-based organizations, and NGOs to aid individuals in CBP custody.”

In June, a DHS official told reporters that they might use donations — but argued they weren’t necessary. “We are looking at the possibility of using some of those donations going forward,” said the official, according to CNN. “But those items, it's important to note, are available now.""

“I think they don’t want to create the idea they’re not capable of taking care of this on their own,” said the House Democratic aide."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General William Barr has recused himself from the Justice Department’s investigation into Boeing Co (BA.N) after two 737 MAX airplane crashes killed 346 people, a spokeswoman for Barr said Thursday.

Bloomberg News reported on Thursday that Barr has recused himself because his former law firm is representing Boeing. Reuters and other outlets reported in March that federal prosecutors aided by the FBI were scrutinizing the development of the 737 MAX jetliners. Boeing did not immediately comment."

The amount of uncertainty surrounding this year’s corn and soybean crops was reflected in today’s round of USDA reports. In its monthly Crop Production and World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) reports, USDA made few revisions, acknowledging more information will be shared in next month.

“The report was neutral,” says Joe Vaclavik, founder and president of Standard Grain. “The USDA kind of just kick the can down the road and the number of respects.”

This month, USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) will collect updated information on 2019 acres planted, and if the newly collected data justify any changes, NASS will publish updated acreage estimates in the August Crop Production report.

For corn, USDA kept the national average corn yield at 166.0 bu. per acre. The season-average corn price received by producers is lowered 10 cents to $3.70 per bu.

“USDA left the corn yield number unchanged versus last month, and they used the June 28 Acreage number, which a lot of people—including USDA—believed to be wrong,” Vaclavik says. “They use the June numbers until they know more, and they will not know more until that August report. So, this is kind of a placeholder until then.”

The corn outlook calls for larger production and beginning stocks, greater feed and residual use, lower food, seed, and industrial (FSI) use and increased ending stocks.

For soybeans, USDA did lower the national average yield to 48.5 bu. per acre—down 1 bu. based on delayed planting progress. The 2019/20 season-average price for soybeans is forecast at $8.40 per bu., up 15 cents from last month.

This month’s U.S. soybean supply and use projections for 2019/20 include lower beginning stocks, production, exports and ending stocks.

Vaclavik says the downward revision in corn demand wasn’t surprising, but some cuts were larger than the trade expected. The demand cuts reflected the last few month’s higher corn prices.

“You've got a corn prices that are really $1 better than it would have been had this weather event never happened,” he says. “What sort of impact will these prices have on demand in six months, 10 months or a year out? We really don't know.”

Markets Look Forward

With this round of USDA reports behind us, Vaclavik says the market will key in on two key factors.

“We’re still very much in weather market,” he says. “Weather during the next couple months combined with an August report, those are going to be your two big focuses.”

Most years, Vaclavik says, the weather is easier for the market and trade to analyze.

“You can look at a weather forecast in July and say if it will be a bullish or bearish forecast,” he says. “This year because of the variability both in terms of crop maturity and crop conditions makes it is very, very difficult for traders or anybody to look at a weather forecast or pattern and say this is bullish or bearish.”

Don’t expect the markets to become flippant about the weather forecast.

“We're still very much in the process of price discovery, and we're trying to figure out what the production numbers are going to be, while at the same time trying to figure out what the implications will be on the demand side with these higher prices,” he says.

Stay focused on your marketing plan, Vaclavik suggests.

“I understand that a lot of farmers are probably friendly or bullish the market right now because they understand that that we're in for a light crop,” he says. “Just because the crop is like doesn’t necessarily mean that prices will go higher. You don't want to totally abandon a marketing plan. These are prices that we had hoped and wished for every year for the last five or six years—here they are in corn.”

The best way to be bullish in this market, he says, is to own put options. “Buy your insurance, protect the downside, leave the upside totally open, and have a lot of flexibility.”

Also, be ready for volatility. “We're still in a higher volatility environment, and that's going to continue to we know more,” he says.

23 states now oppose EPA fuel economy freeze,https://www.greencarreports.com,"['Eric C. Evarts', 'Eric C. Evarts - Contributor', 'Bengt Halvorson - Senior Editor']",,,,https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1123951_23-states-now-oppose-epa-fuel-economy-freeze,"The number of states that oppose President Trump's efforts to freeze emissions and fuel economy standards is growing.

In June last year, 16 states and Washington, DC, sued the federal government over the proposal before it was even released.

On Tuesday, governors of 23 states plus Puerto Rico released a joint statement urging the Trump administration to reconsider its proposal to freeze the standards through 2026.

“Strong vehicle standards protect our communities from unnecessary air pollution and fuel costs, and they address the largest source of carbon pollution in the United States,” they said in the letter.

The proposal announced last August by the EPA and NHTSA, called the Safe, Affordable, Fuel-Efficient Vehicles Rule, is a signature part of President Trump's efforts to reverse Obama administration programs to combat climate change.

EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler

Current emissions regulations require cars and trucks to meet steadily rising fuel-economy standards through 2025. The proposed SAFER rule would freeze those increases at 2020 levels through 2025. After a public comment period on the new proposal ended last October, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler told Reuters on Monday that he expects to release a modified final rule later this summer.

Originally, California was joined in the lawsuit by Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington state, as well as DC. Most, though not all of those states follow California's clean air standards, which are tighter than the EPA's. Under a 1970 extension of the Clean Air Act, California is the only state allowed to set tighter standards than the federal government, because its clean air standards predate the EPA. Other states can choose to follow either federal or California standards (including an electric-vehicle mandate), but cannot set their own.

The latest letter adds support from both Democratic and Republican governors of some key electoral swing states, such as Colorado, Nevada, North Carolina, and Wisconsin, plus New Mexico and Montana. Together the governors, who are all part of the U.S. Climate Alliance, represent 52 percent of the U.S. population and 57 percent of the economy.

Automakers, who originally asked President Trump to revisit current Obama-era standards, have also implored the Trump administration not to freeze the standards. They've asked the administration to find a compromise with California to produce a single set of national standards that incorporate annual increases, though smaller ones than those passed under the Obama administration. On Tuesday, the Auto Alliance, a lobbying group representing most major automakers, issued a statement urging states and the federal government to ""find a middle ground that raises standards year over year while aligning with market demand.”

Instead, it looks likely that the question will face a protracted court battle resulting in years of uncertainty over emissions and fuel economy standards—as well as, perhaps, long-term requirements for electric cars."

President Donald Trump's allies have invested a great deal in an ongoing examination of the origins of the Russia investigation that is currently being conducted by the Justice Department's inspector general, Michael Horowitz. The idea is that this internal examination will finally reveal that law enforcement acted corruptly by undertaking surveillance of a Trump campaign adviser as part of its investigation into a foreign attack on our political system.

Trump's attorney general, William Barr, also appears heavily invested in that narrative. He has lent credibility to the idea that law enforcement engaged in ""spying"" on the Trump campaign, thus insinuating that this surveillance was done to derail Trump's candidacy. Barr, too, is examining the genesis of that probe.

But this whole narrative may have taken a new hit.

Reuters reports that lawyers working with the Justice Department inspector general have interviewed former British spy Christopher Steele. He is a longtime target of Trump's allies, who claim the Steele dossier (which alleged collusion and made other lurid claims) improperly served as the foundation for the original Russia-related FBI investigation - primarily via its use to justify an application to surveil former Trump adviser Carter Page.

But as Washington Post fact checker Salvador Rizzo has shown, that whole narrative is wildly exaggerated and largely false in multiple ways.

Trump allies have also used the Steele dossier to undermine the Russia investigation's credibility by claiming that the Hillary Clinton campaign paid for that research and used it to engineer an FBI investigation of Trump's campaign, which is also basically pure nonsense on every level.

Still, the original surveillance application on Page appears to be a critical focus of the Justice Department's inspector general.

But, intriguingly, Reuters reports that one source familiar with the interview of Steele says that the lawyers working with the inspector general found Steele to be surprisingly credible:

""One of the two sources said Horowitz's investigators appear to have found Steele's information sufficiently credible to have to extend the investigation. Its completion date is now unclear.""

The Reuters story doesn't give us enough information to really understand what this means. But Politico's Natasha Bertrand followed up with some good reporting, bringing us additional details from sources familiar with the interview:

""The extensive, two-day interview ... delved into Steele's extensive work on Russian interference efforts globally, his intelligence-collection methods and his findings about Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, who the FBI ultimately surveilled. ...

""The interview was contentious at first, the sources added, but investigators ultimately found Steele's testimony credible and even surprising. The takeaway has irked some U.S. officials interviewed as part of the probe - they argue that it shouldn't have taken a foreign national to convince the inspector general that the FBI acted properly in 2016.

""... the extensive interview with Steele, and the investigators' sense that he offered new and important information, may dampen expectations among the president's allies who've claimed that Steele's sensational dossier was used improperly by the bureau to 'spy' on the campaign.""

What's funny here, in a morbid sort of way, is the idea that this might dissuade Trump's allies even for a second in their quest to use the Steele dossier to undermine the Russia investigation's legitimacy. It will not, of course -- Horowitz's findings will be spun into proof that the entire probe was criminal to its core, no matter what Horowitz actually determines.

Indeed, there's no telling just how far Barr may end up going when it comes to hyping the conclusions of his own internal review in order to achieve that delegitimization.

After all, Barr has already raised serious suspicions in this regard, by releasing a summary that misrepresented the special counsel's findings in multiple, staggeringly dishonest ways.

What's more, Barr has also suggested that Trump's ""witch hunt"" language is reasonable, and has called on us to appreciate how victimized Trump felt by the probe when evaluating his efforts to obstruct it. In other words, Barr is basically trying to legitimize Trump's thoroughly corrupt attacks on Barr's own Justice Department. So when it comes to what Barr might say about the conclusions of his own internal review into law enforcement's conduct, all bets are plainly off.

We still don't know what the inspector general's internal review will turn up, to be sure. But it appears at least possible that it will undermine Trumpworld's alt-narrative that the only real crime was the investigation itself. This wouldn't be surprising, given that so many other promised revelations along those lines ended up crashing and burning.

If so, Barr may nonetheless continue to push that alt-narrative, needless to say, but it might be an even tougher sell with the public."
"Border apprehensions decline 28 percent following US-Mexico partnership, DHS says",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Deputy Commissioner For U.S. Customs', 'Border Protection Robert Perez', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/border-apprehensions-decline-dramatically-following-us-mexico-partnership,"The Department of Homeland Security announced Tuesday that apprehensions at the southwest border plummeted in June after the Mexican government agreed early in the month -- under the threat of punishing U.S. tariffs -- to dramatically step up its own immigration enforcement efforts.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data showed a 28 percent drop in apprehensions from May, when 144,278 individuals were detained. Although some analysts blamed the ""summer heat"" for part of the new decline, the Trump administration noted in a statement that the decline in apprehensions ""outpaces last year’s decline by 11 percent"" in the same period.

The numbers refer to would-be immigrants caught trying to illegally cross the border, and not migrants who approach ports of entry.

The reduction in apprehensions ""accounts for decreases across all demographics, including unaccompanied minors, family units and single adults, as well as decreases in migrants from all Northern Triangle countries, particularly those coming from Guatemala,"" DHS said in a statement.

""Decreasing apprehension numbers will provide greater opportunities for the DHS to address capacity challenges for those in custody and speed the movement of unaccompanied children into Health and Human Services (HHS) care,"" the statement continued.

Law enforcement and administration officials said President Trump's hard push for the deal with Mexico had made all the difference. Deputy Commissioner for U.S. Customs and Border Protection Robert Perez told Fox News' ""America's Newsroom"" on Tuesday that morale among law enforcement at the border had increased.

BORDER PATROL DECLARES 'FULL-BLOWN EMERGENCY,' AS FORMER DHS OFFICIAL SAYS 'DESPERATION' HAS SET IN

""I think it's a combination of a few things,"" Perez said. ""I think it certainly is an unprecedented agreement that we've made with Mexico, that the president was able to secure about a month ago. We are definitely seeing and are encouraged by the steps Mexico has taken.""

Some Republicans, however, were not pleaded with Mexico's efforts. Texas GOP Rep. Dan Crenshaw wrote on Twitter that it was ""unacceptable"" to see the fourth straight month of more than 100,000 border arrests, even though he praised the decrease in monthly apprehensions as a ""good"" sign.

""The President was right to demand more from Mexico,"" Crenshaw wrote. ""Now some actions from Congress would be nice.""

Earlier in June, Mexico committed to deploy thousands of National Guard troops throughout Mexico, including at its northern and southern land borders, as well as to increase actions to dismantle human trafficking operations and take extra steps to coordinate with the American government to share information and ""better protect and secure our common border,"" according to a statement from the State Department.

Trump had taken a tough position toward Mexico just prior to that breakthrough, tweeting, ""If we are unable to make the deal, Mexico will begin paying Tariffs at the 5% [sic] level ...!""

""On June 10th, the United States will impose a 5% [sic] Tariff on all goods coming into our Country from Mexico, until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico, and into our Country, STOP,"" Trump warned on May 30. ""The Tariff will gradually increase until the Illegal Immigration problem is remedied, ... ..at which time the Tariffs will be removed. Details from the White House to follow.""

Shortly after Trump's threat but before the deal was reached, Mexico's financial intelligence agency announced it had frozen the bank accounts of 26 people who it claimed to ""have presumably participated in migrant smuggling and the organization of illegal migrant caravans.""

MEXICO USING X-RAY TECHNOLOGY TO CRACK DOWN ON ILLEGAL MIGRANTS

The agency said it had detected money transfers from central Mexico to six Mexican border cities presumably related to the caravans.

And some 200 Mexican military police, immigration agents and federal police blocked the advance of about 1,000 Central American migrants who were walking north along a highway in the southern part of the country.

""We are definitely seeing and are encouragd by the steps Mexico has taken."" — Deputy Commissioner for U.S. Customs and Border Protection Robert Perez

The group of migrants, including many women and children, set out early from Ciudad Hidalgo at the Mexico-Guatemala border and was headed for Tapachula, the principal city in the region. State and local police accompanied the caravan. The officials blocked the highway near the community of Metapa, about 11 miles from Tapachula.

And this week, it emerged that while the Mexican National Guard deploys to places like Tapachula on the country's southern border and makes changes to its asylum protocol, agents with the country's National Migration Institute (INM) are using a giant X-ray to find migrants being smuggled into the country in trucks.

Mexican officials said they caught more than 200 migrants hidden in trucks the last two days, using X-rays to see the people hidden inside.

The Mexican security ministry also said it found 228 migrants in a routine search of a soft drink transportation truck in one of its southern states on Monday.

Former DOJ Lawyer Says Census Drama Put Attorneys in “Completely Untenable” Position,https://slate.com,['Jeremy Stahl'],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/07/trump-census-william-barr-john-roberts-lawyer-change.html,"Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts on Jan. 20, 2017 in Washington. Joe Raedle/Getty Images

The latest bizarre twist in the Census citizenship question case came on Sunday when the Department of Justice announced that the entire team of lawyers defending the government’s position in ongoing litigation would be replaced. The highly unusual move was confirmed on Monday in a series of court filings. It is likely at the behest of career officials uncomfortable with the government’s position moving forward, according to former DOJ attorneys. The lawyers on the case told the courts last week that the administration would stop trying to add the citizenship question to the census, but were quickly forced to reverse that position after President Donald Trump tweeted that reports of the decision to back down were “fake.” The sudden change in lawyers suggests there is some internal recognition that the government’s latest census stance has become untenable.

Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec announced the change on Sunday, declaring that Attorney General William Barr “is confident that the new team will carry on in the same exemplary fashion [as the previous team] as the cases progress.”

The government has been tight-lipped about the reasons behind the switch. According to multiple former DOJ officials, however, the move would have only come if the attorneys who had been working on the case had profound reservations about the task ahead and asked to be removed.

“It’s an extremely unusual thing for an entire office to take itself off of a case in the middle of a case,” one former DOJ attorney, who worked under this administration, told Slate. “[These are] attorneys with the highest standards of integrity and highest standards of professionalism. I can only imagine they were in the very difficult position of being forced to contradict factual representations they had made previously.”

“That the entire office is being substituted out really indicates […] something strange,” the former attorney, who requested anonymity due to concerns about professional repercussions, added.

Another former DOJ official also speculated to the New York Times that the unusual move was likely because the original legal team was refusing to reverse course.

“There is no reason they would be taken off that case unless they saw what was coming down the road and said, ‘I won’t sign my name to that,’ ” Justin Levitt, a former senior official in the Justice Department under President Barack Obama, told the New York Times on Sunday.

The Times further confirmed that not only would career officials from the DOJ’s federal programs branch—the branch normally responsible for defending administration policies in court—be leaving the case, but a completely new branch would be taking over.

Indeed, it has become clear over the past week that the DOJ would need to argue positions that completely contradict those previously taken in court by the original team. Last month, the Supreme Court remanded the decision about the citizenship question back to the Commerce Department after Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the court’s more liberal wing to determine that the department had unlawfully “contrived” its reason for adding the question to the census. Since the justices essentially ruled the original explanation—that the question was added to aid enforcement of the Voting Rights Act—was a lie, any renewed effort to add the question would require DOJ attorneys to acknowledge their past position had been false and represent that a new one was the true motivation all along.

Faced with this challenge, both the DOJ and Commerce Department seemed to take Roberts’ ruling as their cue to drop the case last week, even representing in court that the 2020 census forms would be printed without the question and no further attempts to add it would go forward. DOJ lawyers reportedly spent the July Fourth holiday scrambling to find a new justification that would pass legal muster following Trump’s comments to the contrary.

The final substantive legal filing from the old legal team came on Friday, when that team argued in court that a renewed equal protection claim was now “moot” because of the Supreme Court’s decision, and thus that discovery should not go forward in a reopened equal protection claim in Maryland. That element of the case was revived late last month after the uncovering of previously secret evidence that the citizenship question had been concocted to offer “a disadvantage to the Democrats” and be “advantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic Whites.” After that evidence was found, Maryland District Judge George Hazel reopened the discrimination claim, and on Friday he ordered renewed discovery on that question to begin immediately and run through Aug. 19.

Administration attorneys had repeatedly insisted in court that they had a firm deadline of July 1 to print the census forms. Now, the new lawyers will apparently have to concede that this deadline was not real. Solicitor General Noel Francisco, for example, had told the Supreme Court that a decision in the case had to be made by the end of June, rejecting claims by opponents of the citizenship question that the form could be finalized as late as Oct. 31 without additional congressional appropriations. As former Office of Legal Counsel attorney Marty Lederman has written, now that the deadline has come and gone, DOJ attorneys will have to go into court and essentially say, oops, just kidding, we can do this without further funds from Congress after all.

“Being in a position now to deny those statements is something that would have been really untenable,” the former DOJ attorney told Slate. “From the point of view of the court hearing the case, they’re going to hear some set of attorneys making some argument that ‘you should ignore everything we’ve been saying for the last year plus,’ and that’s going to be a difficult sell for whoever’s making it.”

The administration apparently thinks it will be easier for a new set of lawyers to argue the new position than the specific attorneys who had previously argued the opposite. “An administration official said the new legal team may find it easier to argue the administration’s new position,” the Associated Press reported on Monday.

Indeed, the former DOJ attorney said, being “in the position of contradicting factual positions they themselves have made to the court for those particular attorneys would just be a completely untenable position for them to be in.”"

REUTERS/Mary F. Calvert

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury on Thursday denied a published report that Secretary Stephen Mnuchin had urged any company to apply for exemptions to the U.S. Commerce Department’s Huawei blacklisting.

Earlier this week, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the U.S. government will issue licenses to companies seeking to sell goods to Huawei where there is no threat to national security. President Donald Trump announced last month that American companies would be allowed to sell products to Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, the world’s largest telecommunications equipment maker."
'We've got to stick up for ourselves': Obama's Pentagon chief agrees with Trump on Huawei blacklist,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-10-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/weve-got-to-stick-up-for-ourselves-obamas-pentagon-chief-agrees-with-trump-on-huawei-blacklist,"Ash Carter, defense secretary under President Barack Obama, praised the Trump administration's blacklist of certain products from Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei over national security concerns.

Carter made the comments the same day the administration announced some relaxations of its restriction on American companies doing business with Huawei.

""We've got to stick up for ourselves. China is a communist dictatorship,"" Carter said during a Tuesday talk at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""And I'm not out to change them, but when they come to the business scene, they bring a combination of political, military, and economic tools that societies like ours don't posses. And we need to protect our companies and protect our friends and allies against what is inherently an uneven playing field.""

Officials and observers warn that Huawei's connections to the Chinese government raise serious national security concerns, especially with regards to the company's dominance of the 5G equipment market. A just-released study found those links might be even deeper than thought, with some Huawei employees linked ""to specific instances of hacking or industrial espionage conducted against Western firms.""

Huawei's 5G equipment is significantly cheaper than that of its American and European competition, due in part to Chinese government subsidies, leaving countries to choose between building an economical modern communications network and protecting data privacy.

The Trump administration barred American companies from doing business with the Chinese tech giant in May, placing Huawei on the Bureau of Industry and Security's entity list. “This will prevent American technology from being used by foreign owned entities in ways that potentially undermine U.S. national security or foreign policy interests,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said.

Ross announced Tuesday the administration would make exceptions to that designation and allow U.S. companies to buy Huawei equipment ""where there is no threat to national security.""

In addition to 5G equipment, Huawei is also one of the largest distributors of mobile handsets, making it a major revenue source for U.S. microchip manufacturers. The Semiconductor Industry Association, which represents companies like Intel and Qualcomm, lobbied the administration to ease the restrictions.

Though American companies can now apply for licenses to purchase from Huawei, Ross said the Chinese company will remain on the entity list.

Carter noted that the expectations of many Western observers in the 1990s that China would become more like a normal nation-state — a ""big France"" — were wrong. He said the United States needs a better strategy for its complicated relationship with Beijing, arguing that Trump's tariffs on their own are not sufficient.

""It seems to be one instrument and not an orchestra,"" said Carter.

The blame is not Trump's alone, Carter added, pointing out that policymakers have not offered up a new plan. ""I see us still scratching for a playbook,"" he said. ""Which is intrinsically hard for a country like ours, because we can't just decide this is the playbook like you can do in China."""
Justice Dept. Seeks to Halt Democrats’ Suit Over Trump’s Profits in Office,https://www.nytimes.com,['Sharon Lafraniere'],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/us/politics/trump-emoluments-lawsuit.html,"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department on Monday asked a federal appeals court to issue an emergency order halting a lawsuit by congressional Democrats that alleges that President Trump has illegally profited from his family business while in office.

In a court filing, the department’s lawyers asserted that Judge Emmet G. Sullivan of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia had committed a series of “clear and indisputable” legal errors in allowing the lawsuit to proceed. The most glaring of them, the department said, was his decision that members of Congress had legal standing to sue the president.

Judge Sullivan, they argued in a filing to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, wrongly treated a complaint based on novel and flawed legal constitutional arguments as if it were “a run-of-the-mill commercial dispute.” If the appeals court refuses to intervene, they argued, the case will proceed into the evidence-gathering phase, in which Mr. Trump will be forced to reveal details of his financial affairs."
'I can't handle this:' Doctors treating migrants on the border are walking out,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/i-cant-handle-this-doctors-treating-migrants-on-the-border-are-walking-out,"EL PASO, Texas — Two contracted doctors who had been serving inside overcrowded Border Patrol facilities in the El Paso, Texas, region have walked off the job in separate incidents since late May, two Border Patrol union officials have confirmed to the Washington Examiner.

“The situation became so overwhelming, they just quit,” said Wesley Farris, second vice president of the National Border Patrol Council’s El Paso chapter.

Farris said an agent assigned to the Santa Teresa Station in southeastern New Mexico reached out to the union following one walk-out, asking when they would be getting a new doctor.

“An agent texted the union and said, ‘Hey, is there any plan to get us a new doctor?’” Farris said. “‘The agents start texting me like, ‘Hey man, the doctor quit so what do we do?’”

The local union took the information and looked into what had happened. Agents at the station relayed to the union that the doctor had left in the middle of looking over migrants in custody.

""The doctor just left. Got up and left. He was just like, ‘This is too much. This is too much. I can’t handle this,’” Farris said. “Was probably like, ‘I’m a doctor. I don’t need to be in here.’

“When you see that, you’re like, ‘This is bad. It must be bad,’” he continued.

The Washington Examiner tracked down the first doctor, a woman named Raquel. The doctor did not respond to several phone calls asking for comment about the conditions that prompted her to leave.

The second incident involved a doctor contracted at El Paso Station on Gateway South Boulevard in El Paso, according to NBPC Vice President Joe Frescas, who is also based in El Paso.

A senior Border Patrol official in El Paso said the walk-offs were medical personnel supplied through a contractor, not Coast Guard medical staff who were deployed to the border and would have been deemed AWOL for having left their jobs.

Most of the Border Patrol’s 11 stations in El Paso have medical personnel on site who are either contracted, Coast Guard, or trained agents. The average station has one doctor and two to three nurses, the union said.

Farris complained the El Paso region’s management has done too little proactively to keep both agents and migrants in good health following breakouts of flu, lice, scabies, measles, and other breakouts.

“The Border Patrol sector’s response to a lot of this is, ‘Buy cases of hand sanitizer. Buy crates of face masks.’ And slowly now we’re getting contract medical contractors in here,” he said.

Farris said senior Border Patrol officials should bring in experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to screen people to ensure people in custody are getting adequate care and working conditions for agents are as safe as possible.

“If they can go and set up multimillion-dollar operations in Africa, why are they just kind of like poking us down here?” said Farris. “We are not equipped at all and I would argue that, you could see from the doctor walking out, the contractors are not really equipped to deal with this.”"
Barr says DOJ would back Mueller if he decides not to testify,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/william-barr-robert-mueller-testify-census-question,"Attorney General William Barr said in an interview Monday that the Justice Department would support Robert Mueller if he decides he ""doesn't want to subject himself"" to questioning from congressional Democrats at a planned July 17 hearing.

Barr's comments raised the dramatic possibility that Mueller would pull out of the questioning at the last minute -- a potential coup for Democrats, as some Republicans and commentators have said Mueller's testimony could end up revealing fundamental problems with his now-closed investigation.

Although Mueller no longer was a DOJ employee, the Trump administration could still limit testimony about decisions made while he was special counsel. Barr indicated the Justice Department would seek to block any attempt by Congress to subpoena members of the former special counsel's team but did not say Mueller's testimony would be restricted in any way.

At the same time, a Mueller pullout would avert an unnecessary ""public spectacle,"" Barr told The Associated Press, given that Mueller has stated publicly that his exhaustive report on 2016 foreign election interference spoke for itself.

Trump attorney Jay Sekulow, however, has countered that Mueller's remarks could be necessary. Sekulow, in a Fox News op-ed last month, pushed for answers as to when exactly Mueller learned there was no evidence of collusion between the Trump team and Russia -- and why Mueller's team hinted in sworn court filings even late into the investigation that such collusion remained a tantalizing possibility.

TRUMP ATTY JAY SEKULOW: HERE'S THE QUESTIONS MUELLER MUST BE ASKED ON JULY 17

""I'm not sure what purpose is served by dragging him up there and trying to grill him,"" Barr asserted. ""I don't think Mueller should be treated that way or subject himself to that, if he doesn't want to.""

Mueller's 448-page report, released with redactions in April, found no proof that the Trump campaign conspired with Russian actors to influence the election, despite multiple outreach efforts by Russians, and did not reach a conclusion on whether President Trump obstructed justice.

Even so, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, tweeted Monday that Barr's remarks were ""no surprise.""

""Barr misled the public about Mueller's report, and wants his own deception to stand,"" Schiff wrote, referring to Barr's decision to release an initial summary of Mueller's report shortly before publishing the complete, redacted version. ""The public has a right to hear the truth, from Mueller himself, about Trump's misconduct and ongoing national security risks.""

In a news conference this past May, Mueller defended Barr's decision to release the summary: ""At one point in time, I requested that certain portions of the report be released,"" Mueller said. ""The attorney general preferred to make the entire report public all at once. We appreciate that the attorney general made the report largely public, and I certainly do not question the attorney general's good faith in that decision.""

MUELLER SUBPOENA COULD BACKFIRE ON DEMOCRATS, SAY POLITICAL, LEGAL EXPERTS

Barr's additionally said he still saw a legal path forward for requiring 2020 Census respondents to declare whether or not they're citizens. The Justice Department announced Sunday it was putting together a new legal team to spearhead its effort to ask the citizenship question after the Supreme Court temporarily blocked the move.

The justices said the administration's justification for the question ""seems to have been contrived,"" but implied they would consider additional arguments from the White House.

The new legal team, named in court papers, included Deputy Assistant Attorney General David Morrell, a former Trump White House lawyer and law clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas; Christopher Bates, who previously worked for Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch, and four career Justice Department attorneys: Glenn Girdharry, Colin Kisor, Christopher Reimer and Daniel Schiffer.

James Burnham, a top lawyer in the department's civil division who had been leading the team, had told Barr that a number of people who'd been litigating the case preferred ""not to continue during this new phase,"" the attorney general said.

Barr would not detail the new team's precise plans, though a senior official told The Associated Press that Trump was expected to issue a memorandum to the Commerce Department instructing it to include the question on census forms. Barr said he didn't have details on why the attorneys didn't want to continue, but ""as far as I know, they don't think we are legally wrong.""

Many Democrats have said a citizenship question would deter illegal immigrants from filling out census forms. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Monday that Trump wanted to add the demand for citizenship information because he wanted to ""make America white again.""

Census data counts all residents, including illegal immigrants, and is used to determine congressional apportionments and the makeup of the Electoral College. Although illegal immigrants cannot vote, their children become citizens automatically if born in the United States under a practice known as birthright citizenship -- which the Trump administration separately has called into question.

OPINION: WHY ENDING BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP IS CONSTITUTIONAL

The Trump administration has argued it wanted the citizenship question included to aid in enforcing the Voting Rights Act, which protects minority voters' access to the ballot box. However, Chief Justice John Roberts joined the court's four more liberal members in last month's Supreme Court decision, openly skeptical about that justification.

Pelosi, meanwhile, said in a letter to colleagues that the full House would be moving forward with a vote to hold Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt of Congress after the administration failed to comply with subpoenas regarding the census question.

Barr spoke to the AP after touring a federal prison in Edgefield, South Carolina, where he met with inmates and staff members to discuss the criminal justice reform law that Congress approved and Trump signed into law last year.

Separately, Barr revealed that he recused himself from the Jeffrey Epstein criminal case ""because one of the law firms that represented Epstein long ago was a firm I subsequently joined for a period of time.""

An indictment alleging sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy was unsealed Monday morning against Epstein, the wealthy and politically connected financier who pleaded not guilty during his initial appearance in a New York City federal court. Prosecutors alleged that Epstein, the 66-year-old hedge fund manager arrested on Saturday, preyed on ""dozens"" of victims as young as 14.

EPA's new public records rule lets Trump administration pollute in private,https://thehill.com,[],07-10-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/452417-epas-new-public-records-rule-lets-trump-administration-pollute-in,"If it weren’t for the public records law, scandal-plagued Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott PruittAcosta defends Epstein deal, bucking calls for resignation EPA's new public records rule lets Trump administration pollute in private Acosta on shaky ground as GOP support wavers MORE might still be running the Environmental Protection Agency.

These revelations ultimately forced him to resign.

But Americans’ access to such crucial information is now at risk.

This is a great deal for Wheeler and the fossil-fuel industry, but a dangerous development for public health, wildlife and the environment. Maybe that’s why, in a dazzling display of hubris that almost matches his predecessor, Wheeler ignored the required public comment period before quietly signing the rule last month.

This week the Center for Biological Diversity joined 16 other conservation and public-interest groups to urge Wheeler ― a former oil-industry lobbyist ― to delay the rule at least until the public has a chance to weigh in.

Wheeler’s EPA mischaracterizes these significant changes as minor and claims any public discussion about this is “contrary to the public interest.” Those claims are false and ridiculous.

Previous administrations have taken pains to separate political appointees from the process of determining which of the public’s records should be released to the public. But the Trump administration has taken government secrecy to a whole new level.

Injecting politics into the public records process defeats the law’s key purpose. It gives this pollution-friendly administration a powerful new way to hide the damage it’s doing to our air, water and wildlife by unprecedented rollbacks of environmental protections.

Wheeler’s new public records rule also creates an entirely new reason for the EPA to hide federal documents ― “responsiveness.”

This contradicts longstanding Department of Justice interpretations of the law. And it conflicts with previous court rulings that forbid federal agencies from redacting or withholding public records or portions of public records they deem “non-responsive.”

Even worse, this new blanket exemption from the public records law will make it nearly impossible for people to challenge EPA’s decisions to keep documents secret. If the EPA says there are no records because a political appointee has determined, illegally, that the documents are “not responsive” to the public records request, then the requestor won’t know that the records even exist.

That makes a mockery of the Freedom of Information Act.

As if that weren’t enough, Wheeler’s new rule will funnel all public records requests to EPA’s Washington, D.C., headquarters, which is already bogged down with an ever-growing backlog.

No longer will regional FOIA staff ― those who are most familiar with the issues ― make decisions about what to release and what to redact. That crucial task is now entrusted to the office with most of EPA’s political appointees.

This comes despite an internal audit that showed hundreds of career EPA FOIA staffers opposed efforts to centralize the work in D.C. And it contradicts EPA’s claim that this new rule is an effort to improve efficiency and transparency. In fact, it will have the opposite effect.

Regional EPA staff recently blew the whistle on a Minnesota pollution regulator who was trying to stifle EPA’s concerns about the proposed PolyMet open-pit copper mine. Wheeler’s new rule would take dedicated career employees like these out of the loop.

Let’s be clear. This new EPA rule is aimed at hiding policies that foul our air and water, harm endangered wildlife and benefit polluting industries.

The changes to EPA’s public records rule are similar to those approved by the Interior Department earlier this year. As with the Interior rule, the intention is obfuscation and secrecy, not efficiency or transparency.

The public records law may have led to Pruitt’s downfall, but the law is about much more than that.

When our federal agencies undermine the public records law, they hijack democracy and jeopardize public health and the environment. The Trump administration is already working overtime to give powerful polluters everything they want. If Trump’s EPA is able to operate in the shadows, beyond the reach of public scrutiny, the damage could be inconceivable.

Senators and State Department at Each Other’s Throats,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Betsy Woodruff', 'Political Reporter']",07-10-2019,2019,7,https://www.thedailybeast.com/senators-and-state-department-at-each-others-throats,"On Friday, June 28, an email with an odd subject line hit the inboxes of the Senate’s top national security staffers.

“RE: Gabriel—does this look good to you?” it read.

Beneath the cryptic subject line was an invitation from the State Department asking Senate Foreign Relations Committee (SFRC) staff to join a question-and-answer conference call with a top official working on Iran policy.

The call, on the following Monday, did not go well. Staff had been eager—and impatient—to hear how the administration would handle Iran’s decision to amp up its uranium enrichment. But after reading a bland statement full of already public information, Matt McInnis, a political appointee who works on Iran policy, said a technical difficulty meant he couldn’t take questions. The whole call lasted less than 10 minutes, according to multiple people on it.

“It was insulting,” said one staffer on the call. “It was such a box-checking exercise for them.” Another staffer described feelings of amusement mixed with horror.

For participants, the blunders were a microcosm of the metastasizing tensions between SFRC and the State Department. The committee is supposed to oversee the department. But five Hill staffers familiar with its work told The Daily Beast it has struggled under the leadership of Chairman Jim Risch, an Idaho Republican and Trump ally who wasn’t distinguished for broad foreign policy chops when he ascended to the post. Before Risch took the gavel, Sen. Bob Corker—who retired last year—ran the committee. While Corker was a traditional Republican who almost always voted with President Trump, he used the post to lambaste the administration’s frequently perplexing foreign policy choices. He even called the White House “an adult day care center.”

Under Risch, things are different. The conservative from Idaho has taken a much more deferential approach and is loath to publicly criticize the administration. He has yet to schedule open hearings on the war in Libya, the violent unrest in Sudan, and the free trade deal between the U.S. and Mexico.

Multiple staff blamed Risch’s non-combative approach for the committee’s struggles to get briefings and testimony from the department. And they point to debacles like the Iran conference call as evidence of the department’s disregard for the committee.

Risch’s defenders, meanwhile, say he engages in effective behind-the-scenes advocacy to the president and that until a few months ago, there were hardly any Senate-confirmed senior State Department officials who could testify. They also credit Risch with securing a long-awaited classified briefing from Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad, though Democrats say they’re still frustrated Khalilzad hasn’t testified publicly.

The committee still has trouble getting answers. To this day, according to two staffers, the department has yet to provide the committee with a copy of the U.S./Mexico agreement on tariffs that Trump himself waved around in front of news cameras on June 11. Committee staff have sent weekly emails to the State Department—for months now—asking for details on the administration’s decision to cut aid to Central American countries and have yet to get substantive answers to their questions, per one aide.

“ It is like pulling teeth to get information from this administration. ” — Senate aide

“It is like pulling teeth to get information from this administration,” another aide said.

“We get very much a head-pat acknowledgement,” said a third staffer. “Kind of, ‘There, there, Congress, we’ll tell you the bare minimum and that’s that.”

Suzanne Wrasse, the communications director for Risch on the committee, said the chairman effectively advocates for SFRC.

“The chairman is a pragmatic lawmaker with a long history of working ‘behind the scenes’ to get results, not to make political points,” she said. “He is in regular contact with the president and his senior advisers, and has used his stature to deliver results for the committee on a bipartisan basis.”

Risch has also touted his warm relationship with Trump.

“He has treated me with nothing but respect and listened carefully to what I had to say, and sometimes I was able to move him,” the senator said in a February Roll Call interview. “Sometimes a little bit, sometimes more than a little bit. Sometimes not at all.”

One tense moment came when the administration decided to use an emergency declaration to green-light billions of dollars in arms sales to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Jordan.

Traditionally, the State Department consults with SFRC on arms sales—but not this time. And it wasn’t for lack of talking; in the days leading up to the declaration, there was communication on the Iran situation between senior Trump administration officials and the Senate. Sec. Mike Pompeo and Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, held a members-only briefing for senators just two days before the arms announcement. But the topic of an emergency declaration didn’t come up in that briefing, according to people familiar with it. Instead, SFRC staff found out about the arms deals the day the administration announced them, on May 24.

That day, State set up another conference call for congressional staff to explain their move. Clarke Cooper, the assistant secretary for political-military affairs, was on the call. At one point, a staffer pushed Cooper on why the department hadn’t worked with Congress on the move, given its oversight responsibility.

“That’s a matter of semantics,” Cooper replied, according to a source who was on the call—which then exploded. To some listeners, Cooper’s comment sounded like a glib write-off of Congress’s constitutional duty to hold the executive branch accountable.

Reached for comment on this incident, a State Department spokesperson pointed to congressional testimony Cooper gave several weeks later, where he said the department “value[s] deeply this Committee’s and Congress’ role more broadly in the review of the arms transfer process.”

The frustrations are percolating as Trump faces some of his thorniest foreign policy dilemmas yet. Just weeks ago, the president said he nearly green-lit a strike on Iranian targets that could have killed scores of people. Instead, the president deferred to the non-interventionists in his orbit—including Fox News host Tucker Carlson. But as crises materialize like it’s Whack-A-Mole, staff working with the committee responsible for overseeing American diplomacy say it’s in the dark. And they have to wonder: How could this administration handle negotiations with the Iranians if they can barely run a conference call about them?"
Department of Education not National School Board,https://www.nationalreview.com,"['Yuval Levin', 'Victor Davis Hanson', 'Kyle Smith', 'Robert Verbruggen', 'Rich Lowry', 'Jim Geraghty', 'A. G.

Last week, Joe Biden joined the bandwagon of Democrats (started by Elizabeth Warren this year) promising to name a public-school teacher to be Secretary of Education if he wins the presidency. It’s an easy commitment to make in front of a teachers’ union audience, and it wouldn’t be all that odd to do it—several past presidents of both parties have named former public-school teachers to the job.

But the promise is another example of a thoroughly bipartisan misconception about the work of the federal education department. Even if they haven’t been former teachers, nearly every education secretary since the Department of Education was created in the Carter years has been someone with expertise or experience in K-12 education—whether as an educator, administrator, reformer, or policymaker. But the Department of Education actually has a lot more say over higher education than primary or secondary schooling, and its work has suffered from the lack of focus on higher ed over the years. If we must have a Department of Education, it could at least be run by someone who knows something about higher education.

The American system of primary and secondary schools is gloriously decentralized. There are about 130,000 K-12 schools in America, about three-quarters of which are public schools. The latter are governed by about 13,000 different school districts across the 50 states. These districts have enormous power over curriculum and staffing decisions, and the states have most of the remaining power over education policy.

The federal role in K-12 education is strongest in circumstances where racial or other discrimination triggers legally-mandated responses. Otherwise, the federal government uses some levers of conditional funding under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act—a Great Society law that has been updated every few years since. Recent updates include the No Child Left Behind Act and the Every Student Succeeds Act. These have given the federal government more leverage over time, but its power is still greatest at the margins. Federal dollars are about 8 percent of K-12 education funding, and the Department of Education doesn’t really shape primary and secondary education policy.

We should all be glad about that. And a teacher who wants to influence education policy would be better advised to run for school board or for the state legislature than to go to Washington.

But unfortunately, the federal Department of Education does play a critical role in setting the direction of American higher education. Here too, its power comes mostly from the leverage created by federal dollars, but that leverage is immense, especially because of the student-loan system. And it has meant that the federal government has played a central role in driving the tuition inflation that plagues higher ed and in creating all manner of policy trouble besides.

Price inflation in higher education has been massively exacerbated by the basic structure of federal policy in this area, which might be best described as simultaneously subsidizing demand and restricting supply.

The subsidization of demand is done through student aid, which has been too open-ended and has risen with tuition, thereby creating upward pressure on costs. This leverage over funds has also given the Department of Education lots of informal power to drive policy through nudges and “suggestions” in a variety of areas. The Obama administration’s notorious “Dear Colleague” letters are a prominent example.

The restriction of supply, meanwhile, has been a function of accreditation, which the incumbent players in American higher education have used to restrict new entrants and new uses of technology. Accreditation is technically a private process, run by a group of NGOs, but because it is the means by which schools become eligible for students with federal loans and grants, the Department of Education has enormous power over it, essentially accrediting the accreditors.

All of this gives the Secretary of Education a lot of opportunities to improve (or to worsen) higher-ed policy—both by working with Congress to change the law and by working directly to change the department’s policies. Higher-ed policy is badly in need of reforms, getting those right could make a huge difference, and the Secretary of Education would be a key figure in making that happen. The Trump administration has taken some useful steps in this direction, but there is lots more to be done.

So a president who wanted to do something useful in education policy would be wise to appoint an education secretary who knows something about higher education, rather than just one who will say nice things about primary and secondary schools."
