James Comey: No ‘treason.’ No coup. Just lies — and dumb lies at that.,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['James Comey', 'May At Pm']",05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/james-comey-no-treason-no-coup-just-lies--and-dumb-lies-at-that/2019/05/28/45f8d802-8175-11e9-bce7-40b4105f7ca0_story.html,"James Comey is a former director of the FBI and a former deputy attorney general.

It is tempting for normal people to ignore our president when he starts ranting about treason and corruption at the FBI. I understand the temptation. I’m the object of many of his rants, and even I try to ignore him.

But we shouldn’t, because millions of good people believe what a president of the United States says. In normal times, that’s healthy. But not now, when the president is a liar who doesn’t care what damage he does to vital institutions. We must call out his lies that the FBI was corrupt and committed treason, that we spied on the Trump campaign and tried to defeat Donald Trump. We must constantly return to the stubborn facts.

Russia engaged in a massive effort to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. Near as I can tell, there is only one U.S. leader who still denies that fact. The FBI saw the attack starting in mid-June 2016, with the first dumping of stolen emails. In late July, when we were hard at work trying to understand the scope of the effort, we learned that one of Trump’s foreign policy advisers knew about the Russian effort seven weeks before we did.

In April 2016, that adviser talked to a Russian agent in London, learned that the Russians had obtained “dirt” on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands of emails and that the Russians could assist the Trump campaign through the anonymous release of information damaging to Clinton. Of course, nobody from the Trump campaign told us this (or about later Russian approaches); we had to learn it, months after the fact, from an allied ambassador.

But when we finally learned of it in late July, what should the FBI have done? Let it go? Go tell the Trump campaign? Tell the press? No. Investigate, to see what the facts were. We didn’t know what was true. Maybe there was nothing to it, or maybe Americans were actively conspiring with the Russians. To find out, the FBI would live up to its name and investigate.

As director, I was determined that the work would be done carefully, professionally and discreetly. We were just starting. If there was nothing to it, we didn’t want to smear Americans. If there was something to it, we didn’t want to let corrupt Americans know we were onto them. So, we kept it secret. That’s how the FBI approaches all counterintelligence cases.

And there’s the first problem with Trump’s whole “treason” narrative. If we were “deep state” Clinton loyalists bent on stopping him, why would we keep it secret? Why wouldn’t the much-maligned FBI supervisor Peter Strzok — the alleged kingpin of the “treasonous” plot to stop Trump — tell anyone? He was one of the very few people who knew what we were investigating.

We investigated. We didn’t gather information about the campaign’s strategy. We didn’t “spy” on anyone’s campaign. We investigated to see whether it was true that Americans associated with the campaign had taken the Russians up on any offer of help. By late October, the investigators thought they had probable cause to get a federal court order to conduct electronic surveillance of a former Trump campaign adviser named Carter Page. Page was no longer with the campaign, but there was reason to believe he was acting as an agent of the Russian government. We asked a federal judge for permission to surveil him and then we did it, all without revealing our work, despite the fact that it was late October and a leak would have been very harmful to candidate Trump. Worst deep-state conspiracy ever.

But wait, the conspiracy idea gets dumber. On Oct. 28, after agonizing deliberation over two terrible options, I concluded I had no choice but to inform Congress that we had reopened the Clinton email investigation. I judged that hiding that fact — after having told Congress repeatedly and under oath that the case was finished — would be worse than telling Congress the truth. It was a decision William Barr praised and Hillary Clinton blamed for her loss 11 days later. Strzok, alleged architect of the treasonous plot to stop Trump, drafted the letter I sent Congress.

And there’s still more to the dumbness of the conspiracy allegation. At the center of the alleged FBI “corruption” we hear so much about was the conclusion that Deputy Director Andrew McCabe lied to internal investigators about a disclosure to the press in late October 2016. McCabe was fired over it. And what was that disclosure? Some stop-Trump election-eve screed? No. McCabe authorized a disclosure that revealed the FBI was actively investigating the Clinton Foundation, a disclosure that was harmful to Clinton.

There is a reason the non-fringe media doesn’t spend much time on this “treason” and “corruption” business. The conspiracy theory makes no sense. The FBI wasn’t out to get Donald Trump. It also wasn’t out to get Hillary Clinton. It was out to do its best to investigate serious matters while walking through a vicious political minefield.

But go ahead, investigate the investigators, if you must. When those investigations are over, you will find the work was done appropriately and focused only on discerning the truth of very serious allegations. There was no corruption. There was no treason. There was no attempted coup. Those are lies, and dumb lies at that. There were just good people trying to figure out what was true, under unprecedented circumstances."
MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski fails to get panel to bash Trump during Memorial Day segment,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Joseph Wulfsohn', 'Joseph A. Wulfsohn Is A Media Reporter For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/morning-joe-mika-brzezinski-trump-memorial-day,"MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski made a failed attempt on Monday morning to rile up her ""Morning Joe"" panel to bash President Trump on a segment dedicated to Memorial Day.

In the segment, Brzezinski began by asking the ""reflections"" of MSNBC commentator Mike Barnicle by invoking Trump's deployment of troops at the southern border.

“I want to ask you what your reflections are during this time in terms of our attitudes in America, our knowledge and our understanding of people who serve in the military, who serve multiple tours of duty, who have taken part in wars on behalf of this country, and also, are being deployed by this President by -- let’s say maybe perhaps controversial means in terms of their deployments at the southern border for caravans that are coming in. It’s a convoluting time, is it not?” Brzezinski said.

Barnicle responded by expressing a ""sadness"" that now surrounds Memorial Day, one that had nothing to do with the president.

“There’s a certain sadness with me, about Memorial Day, because you think of the word memorial, and part of that word incorporates memory,” Barnicle told Brzezinski. He talked about the tendency to forget on a day dedicated to remembrance, about the cultural steps backward of technological steps forward like Twitter, how it used to be there was almost no one in America whose life hadn’t been touched by the loss of an American servicemember.""

Brzezinski then pivoted to SiriusXM host and combat veteran Paul Rieckhoff in hopes that he would take the opportunity to slam Trump. He didn't.

“And Paul, I would love for you to reflect on what Mike Barnicle just said,” Brzezinski told Rieckhoff, “And also, given the work that you have done, how you’re feeling about the way the military perhaps is beings used by this presidency? Does it really match their role in history?”

""I think sadly that's right, Mika, but I think as a starting point Memorial Day still can be a time where we come together as a nation at this time when we are so divided,” Rieckhoff responded. ""Even if you take just one minute on the a moment of silence... just take one minute and reflect on someone that you know that has died or even if you don't know someone that has died, someone that has died on your behalf to give you the opportunity to go have a barbeque or go to the beach..."""
Democrats aim not-so-friendly fire at Trump over military deferments,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Robert Costa', 'National Political Reporter Covering The White House', 'Congress', 'May At Pm']",05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/democrats-aim-not-so-friendly-fire-at-trump-over-military-deferments/2019/05/28/b3531a3c-8154-11e9-bce7-40b4105f7ca0_story.html,"President Trump, who has touted himself as an unmatched ally of military veterans, is facing pointed new attacks from Democratic presidential candidates who question his medical deferment from service in Vietnam — and, in turn, his patriotism and integrity.

Leading the assault are two military veterans: South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.). They have offered searing assessments of Trump, accusing the president of faking a disability and forcing another American of Trump’s generation to risk his life in the jungles of Southeast Asia.

Trump, who had been traveling in Japan, has not yet responded to either Democrat, but he has long defended his deferments as legitimate. More broadly, he portrays himself as a vigorous friend to the military, pushing for a buildup of the armed forces, praising military leaders, reaching out to veterans and promising to avoid misguided wars.

But the questioning of the 1968 diagnosis of bone spurs in his heels presents a challenge for a commander in chief who has tapped generals for his Cabinet and asked the Pentagon to plan a parade celebrating the military. It could test whether the president’s political coalition, which includes many military families, can be cracked.

“I don’t think that lying to get out of serving your country is patriotic. It’s not like there was just some empty seat in Vietnam. Someone had to go in his place,” Moulton said Sunday on MSNBC. “I’d like to meet the American hero who went in Donald Trump’s place to Vietnam. I hope he’s still alive.”

Buttigieg, speaking at a Washington Post Live event last week, said of Trump, “This is somebody who, I think it’s fairly obvious to most of us, took advantage of the fact that he was a child of a multimillionaire in order to pretend to be disabled so that somebody could go to war in his place.”

Buttigieg, 37, then made an overture to Republicans to reconsider their support of Trump, saying he was “old enough to remember when conservatives talked about character as something that mattered in the presidency.”

The flap could propel Democrats toward a more direct discussion of matters of war and service as the 2020 campaign intensifies. Following victories by several Democratic veterans during the 2018 elections, party leaders are putting an emphasis on the protection of diplomatic and military norms amid Trump’s shattering of them.

“This isn’t the usual playbook against a Republican, but they’re not doing it as a playbook,” said Democratic strategist Robert Shrum, who was a top adviser on Vietnam veteran John F. Kerry’s 2004 presidential campaign. “It’s part of the flow of conversation about this president on his patriotism and truthfulness, and a sign of how they’re not going to let him push them around.”

Still, Kerry’s experience could provide a cautionary tale about the political power of military service. Kerry, a former senator from Massachusetts, was a war hero wounded in Vietnam, but that did not prevent unsubstantiated attacks on his record that resonated with some conservatives.

The critiques mark the first time that Trump has been confronted so directly on allegations of draft-dodging. His 2016 rivals of both parties rarely broached the topic, even after he assailed John McCain, the late senator and Republican presidential nominee who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam for over five years.

In a crowded Democratic presidential field, Buttigieg and Moulton, along with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), regularly cite their time in uniform as they look to stand apart from competitors.

“I don’t have a problem standing up to somebody who was working on Season 7 of ‘Celebrity Apprentice’ when I was packing my bags for Afghanistan,” Buttigieg said Thursday during his Post appearance.

Buttigieg was commissioned as an intelligence officer in the Navy Reserve in 2009 and was deployed to Afghanistan in 2013, while serving as mayor. Gabbard, 38, served in a field medical unit of the Hawaii Army National Guard in a combat zone in Iraq from 2004 to 2005 and was deployed to Kuwait from 2008 to 2009. Moulton, 40, is a retired Marine Corps captain who served in Iraq and was an aide to Gen. David Petraeus, then the U.S. commander in Iraq.

Although Gabbard has not engaged Trump’s lack of military service in the same way as Buttigieg or Moulton, she has suggested Trump does not understand the human cost of war and is susceptible to pursuing “stupid wars” in places such as Iran because he has hired hawkish advisers such as national security adviser John Bolton.

“If the main way our President creates a strong economy is to sell weapons to Saudis to bomb innocent people in countries like Yemen, then we need a new president,” Gabbard tweeted heading into Memorial Day weekend.

Other Democratic presidential candidates are grappling with the complicated legacy of Vietnam in different ways, from touting their antiwar activism to showing solidarity with Vietnam veterans.

“As a young man, along with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and others, I marched against the war in Vietnam,” Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who applied for conscientious objector status in the 1960s, said Saturday at a rally in Burlington, Vt.

Sanders, who speaks proudly of his time as chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, added that Vietnam “ravaged my generation, which left 59,000 brave young Americans dead, as well as killing over a million Vietnamese people. I make no apologies for having opposed that war.”

Former vice president Joe Biden, for his part, received four deferments during the 1960s when he was in college and at law school, and then received a fifth and final medical-related deferment in 1968. Like Trump, Biden’s status was “1-Y,” or unqualified for duty except in case of a national emergency, in his case due to asthma.

Unlike Sanders, Biden did not closely associate with the antiwar movement. “I’m not big on flak jackets and tie-dyed shirts,” Biden said in 1987, during his first bid for the White House.

Presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said the Vietnam War carries an emotional wallop more than four decades later.

“Vietnam is still with us,” Brinkley said. “It was a defining, seminal moment, and older voters especially are curious about whether you were a hawk or a dove, or how you dealt with Vietnam when our country was divided.”

Those who served have a better case to criticize their political opponents, he added. “If you put your head down, like Biden, it’s hard to score points,” Brinkely said. “But if you’re younger and served, Trump is seen as vulnerable.”

The Associated Press’s VoteCast poll of midterm voters last year found that 56 percent of veterans approved of Trump’s performance as president, while 43 percent disapproved — a stronger approval rating than among nonveterans.

Debates over military service in Vietnam have featured in previous presidential campaigns, most notably in 1992, when Bill Clinton, whose campaign was under scrutiny on this front, revealed a letter in which he thanked a military recruiter “for saving me from the draft” during Vietnam.

During the 2000 campaign, George W. Bush faced questions about his time in the Texas Air National Guard. Bush maintained that he joined the unit not to avoid service in Vietnam but because he wanted to be a fighter pilot.

Trump, after graduating in 1964 from the New York Military Academy, where he played football and basketball, obtained four separate deferments so he could study at Fordham University and the University of Pennsylvania. Then, in September 1968, he was medically disqualified, according to the ledger from his local Selective Service System draft board in Jamaica, N.Y., which is in the custody of the National Archives.

The ledger does not detail why Trump failed the exam, and the Selective Service destroyed all medical records and individual files after the draft ended in 1973.

The New York Times reported last year that the daughters of a deceased podiatrist said it was “family lore” that their father, as a “favor,” provided the fall 1968 diagnosis and, in return, received access to Fred Trump, Trump’s father and owner of the Queens building in which the father practiced.

Trump obtained his medical deferment as the Vietnam War was escalating and the military needed a wave of new conscripts. In some interviews, Trump has cited his medical deferment. In others, he has said he simply lucked out in the 1969 lottery.

“I had a lot of deferments. I had a foot deferment for a short time. And then I got a lucky number. I got 356 over 360 or something. You don’t get a luckier number than that,” Trump said in an interview with The Post in December 2015.

At the time, young men with the same birth date as Trump — June 14 — were assigned draft number 356 out of 366. Anyone with that number was almost guaranteed to avoid being drafted, unless the entire country mobilized.

Trump said in the 2015 interview, “I’ve always felt somewhat guilty about because I didn’t serve like many other people.”

Trump recalled that he donated $1 million of the $2.5 million needed to fund a memorial to Vietnam veterans in New York in 1985, a donation that was documented by New York news outlets at the time.

“What I did to make up for my guilt is I built the Vietnam memorial,” Trump said. “I spent a fortune, by the way. I built the Vietnam memorial in downtown Manhattan. To this day, people love it. They come up and they thank me.”

Trump and Biden Campaign Trade Jabs Over North Korea’s Remarks,https://www.nytimes.com,['Katie Glueck'],05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/us/politics/trump-biden-north-korea.html,"HOUSTON — President Trump sided again on Tuesday with the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in mocking Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s intelligence, an extraordinary alignment of a United States president and an authoritarian dictator against an American politician — and an insult that Mr. Biden pooh-poohed by letting an aide rebut it.

During his visit to Japan last weekend, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter that he had “smiled” when Mr. Kim described Mr. Biden recently as a “fool of low I.Q.” The White House spokeswoman, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, also said that Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim “agree in their assessment” of Mr. Biden. American leaders have traditionally avoided partisan sniping while outside of the country.

Mr. Biden, who is running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, did not respond to Mr. Trump’s remarks during his one public event on Tuesday, an education speech in Houston, or in response to reporters calling out questions afterward. At a fund-raiser in Houston Tuesday evening, Mr. Biden sought to stay above the fray, reaching for a line he has used to dismiss Mr. Trump in the past.

“I’m not going to get down in the mud wrestling with this fella,” Mr. Biden said. “I’m not going to do it. I don’t want to get into it. Everybody already knows who he is.”"
U.S. service members seen wearing MAGA-inspired patches at Trump speech may have violated DOD rules,https://www.cbsnews.com,"['Emily Tillett', 'Emily Tillett Is A Politics Reporter', 'Video Editor For Cbs News Digital']",,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-service-members-seen-with-maga-patches-on-jumpsuits-at-trump-speech/,"U.S. service members attending a Memorial Day address by President Trump during his overseas trip to Japan were photographed wearing patches inspired by his campaign slogan, and this may have violated the Pentagon's strict rules barring soldiers from showing political preferences.

Navy spokesman Samuel Boyle said in a statement to CBS News, ""Navy leadership is currently reviewing this instance to ensure that the wearing of the patch does not violate DoD policy or regulations.""

The group of service members aboard the USS Wasp in Yokosuka, Japan, were photographed by Wall Street Journal reporter Vivian Salama. The airmen posing for the photo all donned matching patches showing what appears to be the president, along with the text, ""Make Aircrew Great Again."" Wire services photographers also captured images of the same military members.

The patches may not be in compliance with longstanding Pentagon guidance that dictates that active-duty military personnel should not engage in partisan political activities.

""All military personnel will avoid the inference that their political activities imply or appear to imply DoD sponsorship, approval or endorsement of a political candidate, campaign or cause,"" the policy states.

Examples of banned political activities include actively campaigning for a candidate, soliciting contributions, marching in a partisan parade or wearing uniforms to a partisan event. Certain political activities are allowed and encouraged — like voting in an election and making personal campaign donations.

While it's not clear whether the crew members belonged to the Navy or the Marines, CBS News' David Martin reports that in either case, the Department of the Navy bears responsibility.

During Mr. Trump's remarks to the approximately 1,000 uniformed sailors and Marines, he remarked that the troops assembled were ""such good-looking people"" that they could leave the military and ""end up in Hollywood."""
Kamala Harris proposes having DOJ approve new abortion laws in certain states,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/kamala-harris-proposes-having-doj-approve-new-abortion-laws-in-certain-states,"Presidential hopeful Sen. Kamala Harris released a plan Tuesday that would mandate states where past anti-abortion laws have been overturned by the courts to have any new ones approved by the Department of Justice

“Under the plan, states and localities will be subject to the preclearance requirement if they have a pattern of violating Roe v. Wade in the preceding 25 years,” the California Democrat said.

“Any change with respect to abortion in a covered jurisdiction will remain legally unenforceable until DOJ determines it comports with the standards laid out by the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade,” she said.

Harris termed her plan the Reproduction Rights Act and wants to codify abortion into state laws nationwide. The plan also allows women and healthcare providers to sue the Department of Justice if “hostile administrations” seek to approve anti-abortion laws.

The plan, which would be similar to the Voting Rights Act, is a response to a slew of anti-abortion laws passed this year in a dozen conservative states, including Georgia, Alabama, and Missouri.

The presidential hopeful’s competitor Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., called this month for Congress to pass legislation to guarantee abortion protections if Roe v. Wade is overturned."
"States Can’t Block Legal Hemp Shipments Within Their Borders, USDA Says",https://www.marijuanamoment.net,"['Kyle Jaeger', 'Chris Roberts']",05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.marijuanamoment.net/states-cant-block-legal-hemp-shipments-within-their-borders-usda-says/,"The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said on Tuesday that hemp can be transported across state lines—even through states that haven’t enacted laws allowing the crop’s production—and that the descheduling of the plant and its derivatives under the 2018 Farm Bill are already in effect because they are self-executing and do not require further action by federal agencies.

In a four-point legal opinion issued by the agency, USDA specified that hemp has been removed from the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), states and Indian tribes may not prohibit the interstate transportation of lawfully marketed hemp products—including those that fall under the more limited research-focused provisions of the previous 2014 Farm Bill—and that restrictions on participation in the hemp industry apply for individuals with felony drug convictions.

The USDA Office of the General Counsel said that while states and Indian tribes can still control the production of hemp in their respective jurisdictions, interstate commerce must be permitted following the implementation of the agency’s hemp regulations.

In the meantime, before any businesses can begin planting, harvesting and processing hemp crops under the new Farm Bill’s provisions, however, the USDA must first enact implementing regulations and then approve state-submitted regulatory plans.

“It is also important to emphasize that the 2018 Farm Bill does not affect or modify the authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services or Commissioner of Food and Drugs to regulate hemp under applicable U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) laws,” the agency added, perhaps referring to confusion that has surrounded the question of including hemp-derived CBD in food products and dietary supplements. “USDA expects to issue regulations implementing new hemp production authorities in 2019.”

The memo also indicates that people with felony drug convictions—who would otherwise be prohibited from participating in the legal hemp industry for 10 years—are exempted from the ban if their participation began following the passage of the 2014 version of the agriculture legislation but prior to the enactment of the broader 2018 bill.

Another notable aspect of the memo concerns THC derived from hemp.

“Congress has removed hemp from Schedule I and removed it entirely from the CSA,” USDA wrote. “In other words, hemp is no longer a controlled substance. Also, by amending Schedule I to exclude THC in hemp, Congress has likewise removed THC in hemp from the CSA.”

The 2018 Farm Bill definition of hemp stipulates that a cannabis crop must not contain more than 0.3 percent THC to qualify. THC derived from marijuana remains federally prohibited.

The agriculture bill shifted regulatory responsibility for hemp from the Justice Department to USDA. As such, USDA noted in its legal opinion that “this decontrolling of hemp (and THC in hemp) is self-executing.”

“Although the CSA implementing regulations must be updated to reflect the 2018 Farm Bill amendments to the CSA, neither the publication of those updated regulations nor any other action is necessary to execute this removal,” USDA wrote. In other words, the Justice Department doesn’t have to update its guidance on hemp and its derivatives for the policies to be in effect.

These are some of the most concrete updates that the USDA has offered since the 2018 Farm Bill was signed into law in December 2018. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has indicated that his department wouldn’t be expediting the rulemaking process, but he said that hemp regulations would be implemented ahead of the 2020 planting season.

One of the more consequential takeaways from the legal opinion for industry stakeholders concerns interstate transportation of hemp and its derivatives. USDA explained that a provision of the agriculture legislation “preempts State law to the extent that State law prohibits the interstate transportation or shipment of hemp that has been produced in accordance with” the Farm Bill.

Hemp produced under the 2014 version of the bill also qualifies for the interstate transportation protection, USDA further explained.

A separate memo released on Tuesday clarifies that Indian tribes can continue to engage with states that authorize hemp pilot programs for research purposes but that they, unlike states, cannot themselves authorize hemp research programs.

That second memo doesn’t touch on the 2018 version of the bill, but it states that the “law remains unchanged in that Indian tribes, individuals, and entities located in States that do no permit hemp production are ineligible to participate in the growing or cultivation of hemp under the 2014 Farm Bill program.”

Treasury Dept. Declines to Label China a Currency Manipulator,https://www.nytimes.com,['Alan Rappeport'],05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/us/politics/treasury-declines-to-label-china-currency-manipulator.html,"In addition, if a country actively intervenes in foreign exchange markets for six out of 12 months, rather than the current eight-month threshold, it will be closer to being flagged for manipulation.

A Treasury Department official said that even with the new thresholds, no country in recent years would have been designated. China meets only one of the thresholds, but the department used its discretion to add it to the watch list because of the size of its trade surplus.

Last week, the Commerce Department proposed a rule change that would allow the United States to expand its ability to penalize countries that manipulate their currencies.

It proposed expanding a type of remedy that is typically used to levy tariffs on products that are determined to be unfairly subsidized by foreign governments. Under the proposed rule, so-called countervailing duties could be imposed when foreign governments “subsidize” their products by weakening their currencies relative to the United States dollar, the department said.

A senior Treasury Department official said the Commerce Department proposal was a separate matter that would not affect how the Treasury executed its designations.

Although the Trump administration has complained about China’s currency practices, the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said during a congressional hearing last week that the weakening of China’s currency would help minimize the impact of Mr. Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods.

As a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump made labeling China a currency manipulator a central plank of his economic policy, promising in his “contract” with American voters that he would direct the secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator in the first 100 days of his presidency."
"DOJ agrees to make Mueller court activity public, with some redactions",https://www.cnn.com,['Katelyn Polantz'],05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/28/politics/mueller-court-activity-public/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Justice Department said Tuesday it agrees that a federal court in Washington can make public lists describing potentially hundreds of miscellaneous court actions, like search warrants, used in the Mueller investigation.

The department asked for three weeks to make redactions on ""a few entries"" because of ongoing law enforcement efforts, and a judge said she would give the agency that time.

CNN had asked the court to make the lists public. The unsealing would not necessarily reveal the details of the court filings, but instead give the public a broader overview of how, when and for what Mueller was going to the federal court to gather evidence.

Mueller said in his final report that his team had received almost 800 search, seizure and communications warrants from federal courts in the investigation, yet his office wouldn't give more detail. It's still unknown exactly how many of those were approved by judges in federal court in DC.

Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the DC District Court has shown the government three lists of unknown length that give limited information about these matters. It is possible that the lists will reveal how often Mueller approached technology and communications companies for access to information -- with the targets of many of the warrants not named in these lists.

"State Department calls Russian, Syrian airstrikes a 'reckless escalation'",https://thehill.com,[],05-28-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/international/middle-east-north-africa/445802-state-department-calls-russian-syrian,"The State Department on Tuesday called recent Russian and Syrian government airstrikes in northwest Syria a “reckless escalation” as Syrian president Bashar Assad seeks to oust rebels from the country’s Idlib province.

“Indiscriminate attacks on civilians and public infrastructure such as schools, markets and hospitals is a reckless escalation of the conflict and is unacceptable,” State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said.

“The violence must end,” she added.

Recent government airstrikes, backed by Assad’s allies in Moscow, have uprooted more than 300,000 people and killed 229 civilians, according to the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations.

The statement came nearly a week after the State Department said it had seen signs that Assad may have renewed his use of chemical weapons in northwest Syria, warning Damascus of a quick response if such an attack were proved.

Idlib is home to thousands of anti-government fighters and has been a focal point of clashes as Assad seeks to wipe out any remaining opposition to his government.

Syria's civil war first began in 2011 and has left hundreds of thousands of civilians dead and forced millions of Syrians to flee violence.

In a POLITICO interview, the Democratic hopeful says she wants quick action to put more money in people's pocketbooks and suggests she's not interested in big, systemic overhauls.

Joe Biden is offering a return to normalcy. Elizabeth Warren aims to bring big corporations to heel and prop up the working class. Bernie Sanders wants a political revolution.

Kamala Harris’ one-sentence rationale for wanting the presidency is less clear.

Story Continued Below

To the extent the former California attorney general and district attorney has defined herself, it’s as the tough-minded prosecutor with the backbone to litigate the case against Donald Trump. Yet her law enforcement credentials have been met with some resistance from progressive Democrats, and at times she’s seemed to shy away from her record.

Harris, who has now begun fleshing out her policy agenda, told POLITICO in an interview that she’s looking to offer something tangible to voters. She’s pitching herself as the kitchen-table realist of the field, the candidate who eschews lofty speeches and understands the day-to-day financial struggles of regular Americans and, bottom line, wants to put more money in their pockets.

Harris’ plans include big raises for public school teachers, a proposal to pay women equally to men and a tax plan that calls for a $500 monthly credit for families earning less than $100,000 a year. Her paycheck agenda, which one adviser described as a platform of “big tangible solutions,” centers on how Americans are experiencing the economy and is aimed at people whose wages aren’t keeping pace with the cost of living. She’s trying to reach voters who are too often left out of the conversation, with an emphasis on women — and women of color.

Harris said she thinks about the issues she’s taking on in the context of “literally looking at people through the prism of their lives—not some plate glass windows.""

""It’s about solving the problems that keep people up at night,” she said.

""It’s about the value of work and dignity of work and paying people their value — understanding that people are working hard, but they still aren’t able to get through the month and make it with dignity,"" Harris added. ""And it’s about meeting people where they are.""

Another adviser compared her positioning with the other Democratic candidates more bluntly: Harris is calling for direct payments to families to ease their paycheck-to-paycheck burdens. It's a simple message they hope will set her apart as a proactive “doer” focused more on delivering immediate results than waiting around for broad, systemic overhauls. “She’s not creating liberal trickle-down policy,” the adviser said. “She’s focused on bottom-line economics, not abstract economics.”

Harris’ big challenge will be breaking through on policy in a way that captivates voters and tells a broader story — about herself, but also what she’s trying to accomplish. Ben LaBolt, a veteran of Barack Obama’s presidential campaigns, credited Harris’ tough stance against Trump, calling it smart. “Democratic voters are looking for a candidate that can take the fight to Trump and win,” LaBolt said.

He noted that Harris had breakout moments during Judiciary Committee hearings when she grilled then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Attorney General William Barr to the point that they appeared to trip over their answers.

But LaBolt suggested it won't be as easy for Harris to stand out on policy. “As the Clinton campaign learned, it is difficult for pragmatism to match or drown out Trump’s provocation in the headlines — and driving powerful and memorable moments to communicate our message will be more powerful than white papers this cycle,” he said.

Harris is betting that her focus on issues people worry about at “3 a.m.” — “when you wake up in a cold sweat”— will pierce the noise. Her next opportunity in front of a national TV audience comes Tuesday night in an MSNBC town hall in South Carolina. Her faith that the approach will catch on is based partly on her own experience and partly on what she's heard over and over on the campaign trail.

The teacher pay idea, for example, wasn't planned as a standalone proposal but turned into one because Harris heard from so many educators.

Harris' platform has taken shape over several months. She laces her stump speech with statistics and anecdotes diagnosing economic disparities: Nearly half of American families are one unexpected $400 expense away from financial distress, she often says, and in 99 percent of the counties in America, a minimum-wage worker can’t afford market rate price of a one-bedroom apartment.

She describes how her late mother, a breast cancer researcher, sat at the kitchen table and shuffled through bills after Harris and her sister had gone to bed. “She was focused on the demands of what it means to keep all the trains moving on time,"" Harris said of her mother, who split with her husband early in her daughters' lives and took charge of raising the children.

Harris’ policy remedies take a page from Democrats who ran during the 2018 midterm election cylce, when pocketbook issues such as jobs, health care, prescription drug costs and infrastructure resonated with voters in swing districts. Her pitch aims to strike at primary voters who want direct action more than changes that could take generations to bear fruit. She's keeping it simple and avoiding talk of radical change even when the plans include significant changes to government.

But if she makes it far enough, Trump is certain to yoke Harris to ""Medicare for All"" and the ""Green New Deal,"" no matter how she talks about them. She endorsed both proposals early on, amid a rush by some Democratic hopefuls to align with what was thought to be — at least at the time — a sharp leftward turn of the party to align more closely with the energy of the base.

Still, Harris and her team believe she won’t be perceived as a Sanders- or Warren-like figure. They’re hoping her positioning could find favor with — or at least not alienate — voters in a face-off with Trump, who is trying to paint all Democrats as radicals and socialists.

“When I see a tax cut, or teacher pay, or equal pay, those are actually issues that are very important to Democratic primary voters, but also can communicate to swing voters” in the general election, said Neera Tanden, who served as policy director on the campaigns of Obama and Hillary Clinton and is now president of the Center for American Progress. “Democratic primary voters want to see candidates who can appeal to swing voters.”

Harris’ plans call for spending $315 billion over 10 years to boost teacher salaries, which amounts to a raise of $13,500 for the average teacher, a 23 percent increase in base pay. Another plan would mandate that companies prove they aren’t discriminating against women and would fine corporations that don’t close their pay gaps between women and men. If Congress doesn’t act on the gender-pay plan, Harris pledged she would take executive action as president to force federal contractors to comply. She also has promised to take unilateral action on sweeping gun control measures that have stalled in Congress.

A Harris adviser said her upcoming policy plans will fall into three categories: wages and pay, bills and the cost of living, and economic and social justice. Harris said she also plans to release criminal justice reform and immigration proposals.

Harris has long tried to present herself as pragmatic, particularly on issues in her law enforcement wheelhouse, such as dealing with first-time offenders, tackling human trafficking and negotiating a settlement with big banks during the mortgage crisis. But when she arrived in the Senate two years ago, there were still vast areas where she remained a blank slate. Since then, she’s compiled a portfolio on economic issues that she's rolled into her presidential campaign.

She’s proposed a tax credit of up to $6,000 a year—$500 a month—to address the rising cost of living, a separate refundable tax credit for people who spend 30 percent or more of their income on rent and utilities and a bill to help low-income families pay for rising sewer and water bills. On health care, Harris is running on Medicare for All, focusing her remarks on the out-of-pocket deductibles more than premiums.

In the interview, Harris sought to ground her policies in a broader governing philosophy. She stressed that Americans’ hardships are largely the result of policies written over many decades and designed to favor the wealthy at the expense of working people. She blamed those in power for the lack of meaningful commitments on more affordable childcare, universal pre-K and paid family leave. Even the tax overhaul Trump signed, Harris said, was pushed by Republican lawmakers and interest groups that long pre-dated Trump.

“The spirit behind the tax bill—that is not new. It’s not an aberration,” Harris said.

“A large part of what I do, and I try to do, is to actually see people,” she added, turning her attention to Trump. “And that requires having some curiosity and concern about the condition of the lives of people other than one’s self. And then when you ask the questions and you hear the stories, seeing what the opportunities are to actually bring solutions.”

Stanislaus County to conduct pilot project cultivating hemp,https://www.modbee.com,['Thaddeus Miller'],,,,https://www.modbee.com/news/local/article230906063.html,"A cannabis plant low in THC and high in CBD grows inside a greenhouse in rural Merced County on Tuesday, March 26, 2019. tmiller@mercedsunstar.com

The leafy plants look like marijuana. But actually they’re grown for making consumer products.

Stanislaus County is taking a step toward allowing regulated industrial hemp production on farm land with a one-year pilot project. Staff members were directed last week to quickly develop a limited trial so some farmers gain experience in cultivation techniques.

The county wants to learn about odors, testing and other possible concerns.

It could lead to large-scale outdoor hemp cultivation under orderly land use restrictions in Stanislaus County. More than 50 potential growers have made inquiries with the county agricultural commissioner about planting the crop.

Hemp has been grown historically for products used in clothing, rope and cosmetics. But the crop lately is grown for an oil extract called cannabidiol, which is touted as a treatment for seizures and is also used in lotions, ointments and food supplements.

In a time of marijuana legalization, the 2018 Farm Bill took the lid off a budding hemp industry by removing its classification as a federal controlled substance. Under state law, the farm commodity closely related to cannabis can have no more than a .3 percent level of THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana.

If the THC level is exceeded, the crop is considered marijuana and authorities may get involved.

Stanislaus leaders are not following 26 other California counties that have placed a moratorium on industrial hemp cultivation until certain issues are sorted out in state and federal regulations. Those counties are variously concerned about an absence of testing labs for hemp, threats to agriculture, pressures on law enforcement and pest control.





According to a county staff report, there’s a lack of pesticides labeled for use on industrial hemp fields.

Ryan Miller, who works with farmers, was among speakers who opposed a local moratorium at last week’s Board of Supervisors meeting. “This is an opportunity,” Miller said. “If you don’t get in on it immediately it is going to pass you by.”

The county is working on details of the trial program including how much planting to allow. California Hemp Corporation of Oakdale has entered a research agreement with UC Davis to experiment with cultivation in the San Joaquin Valley.

Industrial hemp is grown from special seeds to keep the THC below the .3 percent threshold but the mature plants can exceed the limit, county Agricultural Commissioner Milton O’Haire said. That could be one of the values of experimental grows during the one-year pilot.

In the next few years, county officials expect to see some attempts to illegally grow cannabis outdoors disguised as industrial hemp. Only indoor cultivation of cannabis at permitted sites is allowed under the county’s legal cannabis ordinance adopted after marijuana legalization in California in 2016. The county outlaws outdoor cultivation of commercial cannabis — that is, the stuff that makes people high.

Industrial hemp could be added to a county landscape that includes a wide variety of orchard and field crops, as well as permitted cannabis greenhouses and more than 1,000 illegal marijuana grows that authorities have promised to bust.

Sheriff Jeff Dirkse said last week he favored small-scale cultivation of industrial hemp the first year as an educational experience for law enforcement. Dirkse said initial enforcement of an illegal hemp grow, triggered by plants testing above the THC cap, would likely be an abatement order to destroy the crop, followed by criminal citations if there is no compliance.

County Supervisor Jim DeMartini opposed the pilot project and said the county should wait until federal and state rules are clarified.

“There is no reason to rush into this,” DeMartini said."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States continues to be alarmed by Syrian government and Russian air strikes in northwest Syria and believes they are a “reckless escalation” of violence, the State Department said on Tuesday.

Government air strikes, backed by Russia, have focused on the south of Idlib province and nearby parts of Hama, uprooting nearly 250,000 people. The bombing has killed 229 civilians and injured 727 others, according to the UOSSM medical charity.

“Indiscriminate attacks on civilians and public infrastructure such as schools, markets and hospitals is a reckless escalation of the conflict and is unacceptable,” said State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus.

Related Coverage France says signs of Syria chemical attack, but still checking

“The violence must end,” Ortagus said.

Hundreds of members of the U.S. Congress signed a letter to President Donald Trump last week arguing that the United States should remain engaged with the conflict in Syria, saying they were “deeply concerned” about extremist groups in the country.

Many U.S. lawmakers, Trump’s fellow Republicans as well as Democrats, have been deeply concerned about Syria policy since December, when Trump decided to withdraw all 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria. Trump later agreed to leave a small U.S. presence to help keep pressure on Islamic State."

Bloomberg Environment: ""EPA Curbs Use of 12 Bee-Harming Pesticides"" — ""The Environmental Protection Agency has canceled registration of a dozen pesticides, from a class of chemicals known to harm bees.

""The cancellations are effective as of May 20 for 12 neonicotinoid-based products produced by Syngenta, Valent, and Bayer.

""The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act requires pesticides sold or distributed in the U.S. to be registered by the EPA.

""Under a December settlement agreement linked to an Endangered Species Act challenge by environmental groups, the companies voluntarily agreed to petition EPA to cancel 12 out of 59 products containing the active ingredients clothianidin and thiamethoxam.

""Developed as an alternative to organophosphate and carbamate pesticides, neonicotinoids are chemically related to nicotine, and attack the nervous system of insects.""

""The agency announced Monday it has canceled the registrations of 12 pest-killing products with compounds belonging to a class of chemicals known as neonicotinoids, as part of a legal settlement.

""For years, beekeepers and wildlife conversationalists alike have voiced concern that the widespread use of neonics, as the chemicals are commonly called, is imperiling wild and domesticated bees crucial to pollinating commercial fruit, nut and vegetable crops.""

Return of the State Department news briefing,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Carol Morello', 'National Reporter Focusing On Foreign Policy', 'State Department', 'May At Pm']",05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/return-of-the-state-department-news-briefing/2019/05/28/60b804ef-d4d5-4073-b5b0-ee4e370d9a57_story.html,"The State Department spokeswoman was at the lectern again Tuesday, fielding questions from reporters about hot spots causing diplomatic agita.

Morgan Ortagus had some dismissive words for Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and the Iranian regime. She referred questions about a Middle East peace plan to the White House. She called Secretary of State Mike Pompeo “incredibly supportive” of President Trump and his foreign policy agenda.

Nothing Ortagus said was particularly groundbreaking. But the fact she was answering reporters’ questions at all was news in itself.

Ending an intermittent hiatus, the State Department’s regular news briefing is coming back. After a couple of off-camera practice runs such as Tuesday’s, on-camera briefings are expected to resume later this week, possibly as early as Wednesday.

Ortagus has promised to try to answer questions almost every weekday when she is not traveling with Pompeo. That will come as a relief to diplomats posted at embassies around Washington who follow the briefings closely, listening for any admonitions of their government’s transgressions.

The resumption of news briefings also sets the State Department apart in an administration in which many normal practices have been abandoned.

The Defense Department has gone almost a year without a press-secretary briefing, though Kiss frontman Gene Simmons and actor Gerard Butler have both done star turns on the Pentagon podium.

The White House briefing room has been gathering dust since press secretary Sarah Sanders last showed up March 11 for only her second briefing of 2019. Trump has said he directed Sanders “not to bother” with the tradition, calling the press corps rude and inaccurate.

The State Department briefings, a fixture since the Eisenhower administration, have served a small, targeted audience looking for gleanings of a shift in U.S. foreign policy and reaction to events around the world. They amplify the United States’ message, provide guidance to embassies and diplomats in Foggy Bottom and underscore the American belief in transparency even in the case of questions from Tass and Pravda.

The State Department used to brief daily. But in the Trump administration, the timetable shrank to no more than twice a week, and often less.

Robert Palladino, the deputy spokesman, held the last briefing on April 11. That was barely a week after Ortagus was named as a replacement for Heather Nauert.

Ortagus is a Navy Reserve officer who was the spokeswoman for the U.S. Agency for International Development during the George W. Bush administration and worked in public diplomacy in Baghdad. She was an intelligence analyst and most recently a contributor on Fox News.

Ortagus describes herself as a foreign policy wonk who watched the televised State Department briefings when she was in college and had a printout portrait of former secretary Condoleezza Rice on her dorm-room wall.

In recent months, State Department officials have tried to “widen the aperture” of news organizations that cover Pompeo’s diplomacy, as Palladino was overheard telling a Christian broadcaster he invited to a briefing last month. They have invited reporters from Breitbart and the conservative website Townhall to accompany them on overseas trips while limiting the number of seats available to other media outlets."

“I do not see a sound technical basis for the area we are being directed to finalize in Wisconsin,” Jenny Liljegren, an EPA scientist focused on air quality, wrote in April 2018, according to the Star Tribune.

“I am still in disbelief,” added another who was not named.

A former acting air quality administrator with the EPA called the revelations in the emails ""disturbing,"" adding that it showed a preference for political influence over the agency's actual scientific work.

“To see apparent direction from political leadership that the technical staff is objecting to is disturbing,” Janet McCabe told the Star Tribune.

The EPA responded to the Hill's request for comment by referring to a recent court filing where the agency allowed for the agency's rules to stay in effect.

Foxconn's investment in Wisconsin has been one of the Trump administration's most touted economic victories, as the company originally pledged to create more than 10,000 jobs and invest billions in a manufacturing plant in the state.

The facility's construction has yet to produce any jobs in the region, however, and is reportedly scaling back those plans to invest in the state, citing high labor costs in the U.S."
#Plant19 Still Has a Long Way to Go,https://www.agriculture.com,[],05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.agriculture.com/news/crops/plant19-still-has-a-long-way-to-go,"The nation’s corn and soybean farmers have a long way to go to wrap up #Plant19, according to USDA’s most recent Crop Progress Report, which shows that U.S. corn planting is just 58% complete – a gain of only 9% in the last week.

The report was released Tuesday – a day later than normal due to the Memorial Day Weekend. The report estimates planting and emergence progress through Sunday, May 26.

Corn

U.S. corn planting is just 58% complete, compared with 49% last week and the five-year average of 90%.

As of Sunday, corn planting was just 35%, 22%, and 76% complete in Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa, respectively – three states that account for the bulk of the nation’s corn crop. In the last five years, the crop in those states was 95%, 85%, and 96% complete by this time, signaling that farmers have a long way to go to get the 2019 crop in the ground.

Of the 18 key corn-producing states that USDA tracks in the weekly Crop Progress Report, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas are the furthest along, with 95%, 93%, and 93% of corn plantings complete.

USDA estimates that 32% of the 2019 crop has emerged, compared with 69% vs. the five-year average. Emergence in Illinois, Indiana. and Iowa are 20%, 10%, and 42%, compared with the five-year averages of 84%, 65%, and 77%.

Soybeans

If corn crop progress is behind, soybean planting is falling way back. Soybean plantings in the 18 states that represent 95% of the 2018 soybean acreage are only 29% complete, vs. the five-year average of 66%.

Iowa has 32% of its crop planted, well off the five-year pace of 77% and only a 5% improvement over the May 19 crop report. Illinois has just 14% of its crop planted, compared with 70% from 2014-18; and Indiana is just 11% complete, vs. its five-year average of 63%.

Only 11% of the nation’s crop has emerged, whereas the five-year average is 66%.

Wheat

The 2019 winter wheat harvest has kicked off in Texas, with combines rolling in central Texas.

The crop is 66% headed in key winter wheat producing states, vs. the five-year average of 76%. Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas lead the way in wheat-heading progress among major wheat-growing states, with 96%, 96%, and 84%, respectively. The crop is generally in good to excellent condition, with 61% of the nation’s crop earning those scores, compared with just 38% last year."
"DHS assessment of foreign VPN apps finds security risk real, data lacking",https://www.cyberscoop.com,['Sean Lyngaas'],05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.cyberscoop.com/dhs-mobile-vpn-apps-chris-krebs-ron-wyden/,"Written by Sean Lyngaas

The risk posed by foreign-made virtual private network (VPN) applications must be accounted for — even if government device users have avoided such apps — because adversaries are interested in exploiting the software, according to a senior Department of Homeland Security official.

“Open-source reporting indicates nation-state actors have demonstrated intent and capability to leverage VPN services and vulnerable users for malicious purposes,” Chris Krebs, director of DHS’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), wrote in a May 22 letter to Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., obtained by CyberScoop. There is no overarching U.S. policy preventing government mobile device users from downloading foreign VPN apps, according to Krebs.

“Even with the implementation of technical solutions, if a U.S. government employee downloaded a foreign VPN application originating from an adversary nation, foreign exploitation of that data would be somewhat or highly likely,” Krebs wrote. “This exploitation could lead to loss of data integrity and confidentiality of communications transmitted over the application.” Exposed phone data would likely include geolocation, contacts, and user history, he added.

There is no indication that foreign-made apps are widely used in the U.S. government, and there may not be any government-operated devices that have downloaded foreign VPN apps, Krebs wrote. But a lack of data leaves that question unanswered, and Krebs conceded that CISA had “limited visibility” on the usage. Moreover, it is unclear how widely deployed defensive measures such as sandboxing and application whitelisting are across government, according to Krebs.

The CISA director was replying to a February letter sent by Wyden and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., asking him for a security assessment of foreign VPN apps. The senators had expressed concern that some apps send a phone’s web-browsing data to servers in countries interested in targeting federal personnel. VPN providers promise to obfuscate the physical location of a web browser, but users are generally at the mercy of those companies’ decisions to collect and log data.

As evidence of the risk posed by foreign-made VPN apps, Krebs cited a November 2017 Russian law that allows the Russian government to access VPN providers based in Russia, and an advisory later that year from the Indian government warning that the Chinese government used popular Chinese mobile applications to collect user data.

“DHS has confirmed my fears: that using Chinese or Russian VPN services is essentially just taking your private data, wrapping it in a bow and then sending it directly to foreign spies in Beijing or Moscow,” Wyden told CyberScoop. “U.S government employees should not be using these apps, and I hope that DHS will take steps to prohibit their use on government-issued smartphones.”

CISA will continue to monitor the risk posed by foreign VPN apps and work with agencies to mitigate that risk through measures such as training and technical guidance, Krebs wrote.

Thankfully, the Cold War is over, and has little chance of returning: Neither Russia nor China will ever challenge us in the way the Soviet Union did. Yet our confrontation with an ideological and strategic superpower did produce some useful practices in the art of American diplomacy — norms that President Trump violated during his trip to Japan this week. It’s time we recall why our leaders once followed certain unspoken rules during the Cold War — and to consider re-adopting those same standards of behavior.

First and most importantly, U.S. presidents — be they Democrats or Republicans — never expressed personal approval of our communist adversaries. They never talked about Communist Party leaders as friends. They never “fell in love” with Leonid Brezhnev or Nikita Khrushchev. Of course, U.S. presidents engaged directly with their Soviet counterparts in the pursuit of U.S. national interests. But they did so without personalizing these ties and without excusing dictatorship.

Trump has practiced the opposite policy. During his visit to Japan this week, Trump again expressed affection for Kim Jong Un, tweeting about his “confidence” in the North Korean leader. Perhaps Trump’s personalized praise of autocratic adversaries will one day produce tangible outcomes for U.S. security and economic interests. So far, it has not.

Second, U.S. presidents engaged not only with governments of our enemies, but also sought to appeal directly to the people who live under these autocratic regimes, including especially Soviet citizens. This dual-track diplomacy was animated by the belief that those living in captive nations deserved our moral support even when we engaged with their oppressors on issues like arms control or trade. President Ronald Reagan and his administration were particularly effective in signaling to Soviet leaders that they were not going to check their values at the door in government-to-government negotiating sessions. But Reagan was not alone in this practice. Even Richard M. Nixon spoke directly to the Soviet people to explain our intentions.

To date, Trump has demonstrated very little interest in connecting with the oppressed peoples of North Korea, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Egypt or even Iran. (The only possible exception: Venezuela.) By the third year of his presidency, President Barack Obama already had met with hundreds — maybe thousands — of Russian students, entrepreneurs, civil society activists, journalists, and opposition leaders, both in Moscow and Washington. He even played basketball at the outdoor White House court with some Russian high-school players visiting Washington.

By contrast, to the best of my knowledge, Trump has had zero contact with Russian society. Even regarding Iran, Trump (perhaps inadvertently) offended many Iranians and Iranian Americans hostile to the dictatorship in Tehran when he vowed to bring about “the official end of Iran” in case of war. He ought to have threatened the Islamic Republic, its ruling mullahs or its theocracy, but he also ought to have expressed that the United States did not see the Iranian people as its enemy. Lower-level officials in the Trump administration made the distinction; Trump must do so as well.

Third, U.S. presidents and other politicians have embraced the practice of leaving our domestic squabbles at home when traveling abroad. They wanted to project a unified American voice beyond the borders of the country. In 1947, at the beginning of the Cold War, Republican Sen. Arthur Vandenberg (Mich.) delivered a stirring speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate that included the following remark: “We must stop partisan politics at the water’s edge.”

President Harry S. Truman echoed the phrase a year later while accepting his party’s nomination: “As I have said time and time again, foreign policy should be the policy of the whole Nation and not the policy of one party or the other. Partisanship should stop at the water’s edge.”

During the Cold War, especially during the Vietnam War, some U.S. politicians violated this norm. But the norm remained, nonetheless, and well past the end of the Cold War. While serving as the U.S. ambassador to the Russian Federation during the Obama administration, I saw admiringly how bipartisan congressional delegations spoke with one voice while meeting with Russian government officials, even if they sometimes fell back into factionalism behind closed doors. That commitment to our national interest — not Republican or Democratic interests — served our nation well.

That’s why Trump’s ridicule of a former two-term vice president while visiting Japan was so disheartening. Trump tweeted approvingly that Kim had “called Swampman Joe Biden a low IQ individual, & worse.” Any national leader writing such inflammatory comments about another U.S. public figure (and siding with a foreign adversary in the process) is unacceptable. The president of the United States flinging such insults at a former fellow White House official while in Japan is wrong. Doing so while also expressing affection for a North Korean murderer and dictator is disgusting.

We need a return to Cold War decorum in the conduct of presidential diplomacy. Leaders from the party of Reagan could take the lead in pressing for this return to thoughtful and ethical presidential conduct, especially while traveling abroad. If they don’t, then maybe voters in 2020 will be have to complete the task.

Amy Klobuchar Amy Jean KlobucharMeghan McCain to Amy Klobuchar: Leave my father 'out of presidential politics' 2020 Democrats jockey over surging college costs Democratic senator says McCain listed off names of dictators during Trump inaugural MORE (D-Minn.), a 2020 presidential candidate, is proposing changes to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) biofuel regulations that could help her win over support in Iowa.

Speaking at a campaign stop over the weekend in Iowa, the country's top corn producer, Klobuchar called for the EPA to give away fewer of its waivers that allow oil refineries to avoid mixing their fuel with ethanol, according to Reuters.

The waivers, aimed at helping small refineries meet fuel standards, exempt some refineries from the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which requires oil refiners to blend ethanol with their gasoline pool or purchase credits from refiners that do.

Smaller refineries with a capacity of less than 75,000 barrels per day can obtain a waiver after proving that complying with the rule could cause financial stress. But ethanol groups and politicians representing corn-producing states have long called for the EPA to reconsider how it grants the waivers.

Klobuchar called the EPA’s waivers “misguided” and said the biofuels trading market is manipulated by financial institutions, according to Reuters.

She called for new compliance standards and oversight, a stance likely to drum up support from ethanol groups and leaders in Iowa, a key battleground state in the 2020 race.

Ethanol makers have long argued that too many companies qualify for waivers and that the process is not transparent. While the Trump administration has voiced support for the ethanol industry’s plea to extend the use of gas mixed with 15 percent ethanol year-round, it has also made extensive use of small refinery waivers. Even major companies like Exxon Mobil Corp received exemptions for certain facilities."
DoJ Should Butt Out of the Qualcomm Case,https://www.eetimes.com,"['George Leopold', 'Brian Santo']",,,,https://www.eetimes.com/author.asp?section_id=36&doc_id=1334751,"By , 0

The United States Department of Justice, whose mission is to enforce the law and administer justice (however elusive) is meddling in an antitrust case in which a federal judge struck down the core of dominant wireless chip maker Qualcomm’s business model.

The landmark ruling issued earlier this month by U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh prohibits Qualcomm from cutting exclusive licensing deals. Judge Koh also decided Qualcomm must make key modem chip IP available under license to its chip rivals. The ruling comes as the rollout of 5G wireless technology emerges as a national security cause célèbre for the Trump administration that has effectively blacklisted 5G first-mover and modem chip also-ran Huawei.

DoJ Weighs in on FTC vs. Qcomm

“There is a sufficient likelihood that Qualcomm will hold monopoly power in the 5G modem chip market such that exclusive dealing agreements for the supply of modem chips could foreclose competition in that emerging market,” Judge Koh wrote.

Judge Lucy Koh is being pressured by the feds.

The Justice Department inappropriately sought to sway Koh’s ruling when it undertook the unusual and highly political step of filing a “statement of interest” that constitutes another shot across the bow of an independent American judiciary. Judge Koh was essentially being pressured to think twice before ruling against Qualcomm, which few would dispute has a stranglehold in the 5G modem chip market.

Not even mighty Intel Corp. is willing to take on Qualcomm in the 5G silicon race, exiting the market as soon as Qualcomm settled a cellular patent dispute with Apple last month. (Judge Koh’s ruling invalidates that deal.)

There was a time in conservative economic theory when the government kept its paws off of emerging markets. In those days, the government dared not pick “winners and losers.” Just as what is left of the Republican Party in the Trump era no longer cares about federal budget deficits, the bedrock principle of not favoring one corporation or technology over another has gone the way of the dodo bird.

It is widely assumed DoJ will keep up the pressure on Judge Koh to go easy on Qualcomm, citing U.S. national security concerns as the Trump Administration continues to target 5G competitor Huawei. In so doing, it reinforces a troubling pattern by politicizing the administration of justice. Mark A. Lemley, a law professor at Stanford University, hardly a bastion of antitrust fervor, told our Rick Merritt: “This is a very surprising move by the DOJ. It is extremely rare for them to interfere in the Federal Trade Commission’s cases.”

Back in the 1990s, we interviewed Huawei officials at its sprawling headquarters in Shenzhen. At the time, there was growing suspicion that Huawei had pilfered key networking technologies from its U.S. partner Cisco Systems. During our interview, Huawei managers sized us up, sticking with strictly technical subjects and the marketing spiels they had just learned to master.

Finally, we asked about the Cisco allegations. Interview over!

Huawei’s unwillingness to even address the IP theft issue was telling. We had hit a raw nerve. As the Trump administration targets Huawei, one cannot help but think the country standing for free enterprise and unprecedented technological innovation is behaving in much the same way as those Huawei bosses.

Justice Department meddling in the Federal Trade Commission case against Qualcomm isn’t just troubling. It threatens to undermine the rule of law and the principle of an independent judiciary.

From an antitrust standpoint, FTC actions are often about changing corporate behavior. A decade ago, Intel wisely settled when the agency alleged anticompetitive behavior. The chip maker moved on and the processor market continued to thrive.

Qualcomm can appeal Judge Koh’s ruling, as it promises to do. Fine. That’s how our judicial system works. Meantime, the Justice Department should butt out and let justice takes its course.

"Edmund Morris, acclaimed presidential biographer of Roosevelt and Reagan, has died at 78",https://www.cbsnews.com,['Brian Pascus'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/edmund-morris-died-acclaimed-biographer-presidents-theodore-roosevelt-ronald-reagan-dead-age-78/,"Edmund Morris, the famed author who wrote acclaimed presidential biographies of Theodore Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan, died Friday in Danbury, Connecticut, according to The New York Times. The cause of death was not disclosed, though The Times did report the 78-year-old was at a hospital following a stroke he suffered Thursday.

Morris was a true master of biographical literature. He won the 1980 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography and the 1980 National Book Award for biography for his first book, ""The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt."" The book was the first in a trilogy of works exploring the 26th president's life, the others being ""Theodore Rex,"" published in 2001 and ""Colonel Roosevelt,"" published in 2010.

Edmund Morris, author of ""Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan,"" poses at Random House in New York, Wednesday, Sept. 29, 1999. Morris said he welcomes the controversy over the literary technique he uses in the biography, in which he makes himself a fictional character in Reagan's early life and invents a few other people, too. (AP Photo/Marty Lederhandler) MARTY LEDERHANDLER

In 1999, he published his most controversial work, ""Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan,"" an authorized biography written in an experimental style. Starting in 1985, Morris had been granted ""fly-on-the-wall"" privileges by the Reagan White House, allowing him to interview the President and First Lady and their children. He wrote the biography to include a fictional Edmund Morris who was added to the narrative as an observer and one of Reagan's childhood friends. Within the book, the fictional Edmund Morris told the story of the 40th president's life from his childhood in Illinois to the White House. While some praised the book, others were not so kind.

Morris was born May 27, 1940 in Nairobi, Kenya, the son of South African parents. He married Sylvia Jukes Morris in 1968. According to the author's Penguin Random House biography page, Morris worked as an advertising copywriter in London before immigrating to the United States in 1968. His other biographies included a work on Ludwig von Beethoven titled ""Beethoven: The Universal Composer"" as well as a collection of essays.

According to The New York Times, he is survived by his wife, a brother, Eric and a sister, Judy Davidowitz."
Department of Homeland Security Detains Miami Activist at Homestead Facility for Migrant Children UPDATED,https://www.miaminewtimes.com,['Brittany Shammas'],05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/homestead-shelter-for-migrant-children-alessandra-mondolfi-detained-by-homeland-security-11181156,"Alessandra Mondolfi was painting hearts on a poster board outside the Homestead child migrant camp last Friday when she spotted a pair of law enforcement officers walking toward her. An artist and activist who's part of a group of protesters maintaining a daily presence outside the facility, Mondolfi was working on a memorial to migrant children who have died in custody. ""Here they come,"" one of the other activists said as the officers approached.

The two men — one in a Department of Homeland Security police uniform, the other in plainclothes — asked Mondolfi her name, then pushed her against a car and cuffed her, she says. They then allegedly put her in the back of a car and questioned her for about an hour, asking, bizarrely, whether she had aliases or a neck tattoo, and if she knew the names of the other protesters. Then, about an hour after first approaching Mondolfi, the officers let her go.

Days later, it's still unclear why she was detained. DHS did not respond to a request for comment. Mondolfi says the Miami-Dade Police Department and, weirdly, the Miami-Dade Schools Police, sent squad cars to the scene. The El Paso Police Department has a warrant out for Mondolfi's arrest over a protest she and other activists held at the U.S. Border Patrol Museum. But why would DHS be involved in a city-level case?

Mondolfi has a theory for why she was detained: It was done to rattle her after months of protesting. She notes it was her group that spotted John Kelly — former Homeland Security chief and White House chief of staff under President Donald Trump — touring the Homestead shelter last month, around the same time congresswomen were being denied entry. Soon after Kelly's visit became public, CBS News confirmed he had joined the board of Caliburn International, the for-profit company that runs the place.

""They are trying to scare me, intimidate me,"" Mondolfi says.

Her detainment comes amidst a series of instances of the government watching and prosecuting protesters. Earlier this year, the Intercept revealed that DHS had monitored anti-family separation protests held across the country, treating them as if they were security threats. A contractor working with the agency reviewed demonstrations across South Florida, from West Palm Beach to Miami. The information was shared with DHS and state-level law enforcement.

Meanwhile, two University of Arizona students were arrested in late March for protesting the appearance of Customs and Border Protection officers. The Arizona Republic reported they were among people who stood outside the event calling the officials “murderers” and “an extension of the KKK.” A group of protesters followed the agents as they left the presentation, calling them ""Murder Patrol."" Anti-Dakota Access Pipeline protesters have also been arrested.

At the Homestead shelter, another protester was detained on April 24. That day, MDPD officers handcuffed a New York man named Joshua Rubin and put him in the back of a squad car. Rubin said the cops told him he was being stopped on suspicion of trespassing. He refused to give them his name, he said, because he was on a county road. Eventually he identified himself and was released. MDPD told New Times it had no record of Rubin's detainment.

""You have to expect, when you're protesting, that people are going to try and get you to go away,"" said Rubin, who for months held a one-man vigil outside a camp for migrant teenagers in Texas. ""But the extent to which it's happening here is more extreme.""

Mondolfi says Homeland Security officers began showing up at the facility several weeks ago. When the two men approached her last Friday, they asked for her ID, but it was in her car. She says she asked to go get it, but instead ended up being questioned in the back of a police car. The MDPD and schools police cars showed up.

Daisy Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for Miami-Dade County Public Schools, tells New Times there is no record of a call for service on that date, and questioned whether a photo provided by protesters was actually taken on the date in question. After publication, she said a school officer responded after the Department of Homeland Security ""put out an emergency call for back-up."" When the officer arrived, the situation had already been handled, so he cleared the incident without taking action. MDPD did not respond to a request for information.

For her part, Mondolfi says she hasn't been back to the shelter since the day she was detained.

""I am not in Homestead; I have not been all week,"" she says. ""I'm not able to do the work that I'm doing. And I am scared, which is all the things they want. They want you to be scared, they want you to be intimidated... and at this point, they're winning, and that's angering me."""
Emails show Trump EPA overruled career staff on Wisconsin air pollution,https://www.reuters.com,"['Timothy Gardner', 'Min Read']",05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-epa-smog/emails-show-trump-epa-overruled-career-staff-on-wisconsin-air-pollution-idUSKCN1SY2BP,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Politically appointed U.S. environmental officials last year overruled concerns of career scientists about air pollution in a Wisconsin county where U.S. President Donald Trump has pushed for a factory to be built by Foxconn Technology Co, newly released internal emails show.

Trump has been a supporter of the Taiwanese technology giant Foxconn building a flat screen factory in Racine County Wisconsin, a project the company said could create up to 13,000 jobs. He announced the project at a ceremony in 2017 and has claimed it is proof of his ability to revive U.S. manufacturing. Former Wisconsin governor Scott Walker, a Republican, helped secure about $4 billion in tax breaks for the project.

But Racine County has suffered some of the state’s worst cases of smog, also known as ozone, pollution that causes premature deaths from lung and heart complications.

The emails obtained by the Sierra Club and Clean Wisconsin under a freedom of information request show Trump administration officials, including then-administrator Scott Pruitt, overruled career EPA scientists to exempt Racine County from a list of counties that break smog standards. That has freed Foxconn from having to make millions of dollars in pollution control devices, if the project is eventually built.

The Racine County case is latest example of the administration overlooking concerns flagged by agency scientists over other issues such as climate change or hazardous chemicals.

“My background is in air pollution health effects and more specifically on acute exposures, so for me personally this is hard to digest and support,” Lars Perlmutt, an EPA scientist, wrote to colleagues in an April email last year about pressure to make the exemption, one of the emails shows.

Jenny Liljegren, a scientist in the air and radiation division in EPA’s Midwest region, said she was “in disbelief” about the pressure from officials to make the exemptions. “I do not see a sound technical basis for the areas we are being directed to finalize in Wisconsin.”

In an exchange of emails with Liljegren, another EPA scientist, Eric Svingen, complained that Wisconsin “cherry picked” air quality data over wider areas of the state to suggest that emissions that form smog were not ultimately doing so within the Wisconsin borders.

“These emails show is that the political leadership appeared to be injecting itself in this process in a way that’s contrary to having fact-based decisions,” said Janet McCabe, head of air quality at the EPA under former President Barack Obama.

Foxconn did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In April the company, an Apple Inc supplier, said it was committed to its contract to build the flat screen plant and research facilities in Wisconsin.

EPA spokesman Michael Abboud referred questions about the emails to a brief the agency filed May 10 in the case. The brief said that EPA considers a wide range of information in deciding which areas are in compliance with air pollution rules and that “each designation is intensely fact-driven.”

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Illinois, which neighbors Wisconsin and could see greater levels of pollution, sued the EPA last year over the exemption in Racine County and the agency is also under pressure from lawsuits from environmental groups.

In the May 10 brief, the EPA asked a federal appeals court to take another look at the smog exemption decisions under Pruitt, but until the court makes any ruling companies do not have to purchase the pollution equipment."

TRI-CITIES (WJHL) - The United States Department of Labor has accepted a letter from the USDA, saying the Forest Service will withdraw from operating Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers (CCC).

According to a release from the U.S. Labor Department, ""this action creates an opportunity to serve a greater number of students at higher performing centers at a lower cost to taxpayers by modernizing and reforming part of the Job Corps program.""

The USDA says the mission for CCCs is to ""train eligible youth, ages 16 to 24 with educational, social and vocational skills, while assisting in the conservation of the Nation's public natural resources.""

A review was performed at all CCCs going over outcome measurements, internal controls, ongoing needs, and other items.

According to the department, 16 centers will continue under a new contract operator or partnership.

Locally, Jacobs Creek CCC will continue to operate in Bristol, Tennessee.

The 16 centers under new management are featured below:

Angell CCC in Yachats, Oregon; Boxelder CCC in Nemo, South Dakota; Centennial CCC in Nampa, Idaho; Collbran CCC in Collbran, Colorado; Columbia Basin CCC in Moses Lake, Washington; Curlew CCC in Curlew, Washington; Great Onyx CCC in Mammoth Cave, Kentucky; Harpers Ferry CCC in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia; Lyndon Johnson CCC in Franklin, North Carolina; Jacobs Creek CCC in Bristol, Tennessee; Mingo CCC in Puxico, Missouri; Pine Ridge CCC in Chadron, Nebraska; Schenck CCC in Pisgah Forest, North Carolina; Trapper Creek CCC in Darby, Montana; Weber Basin CCC in Ogden, Utah; and Wolf Creek CCC in Glide, Oregon.

A Federal Register notice will propose nine CCCs to close. Locally, the Flatwoods CCC in Coeburn, Virginia will be up for deactivation.

The nine CCCs up for deactivation are: Anaconda CCC in Anaconda, Montana; Blackwell CCC in Laona, Wisconsin; Cass CCC in Ozark, Arkansas; Flatwoods CCC in Coeburn, Virginia; Fort Simcoe CCC in White Swan, Washington; Frenchburg CCC in Frenchburg, Kentucky; Oconaluftee CCC in Cherokee, North Carolina; Pine Knot CCC in Pine Knot, Kentucky; and Timber Lake CCC in Estacada, Oregon."
Trump climbs into a sumo ring to present a 60-pound ‘President’s Cup’ in highlight of Japan trip,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Ashley Parker', 'White House Reporter', 'Simon Denyer', 'Tokyo Bureau Chief Covering Japan', 'North Korea', 'South Korea.']",05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-presents-gilded-presidents-cup-to-sumo-champion-in-a-highlight-of-his-japan-trip/2019/05/26/fca43394-7e37-11e9-8bb7-0fc796cf2ec0_story.html,"Finally, after a full day of matches, perhaps the biggest star of all — weighing in at 243 pounds, according to his most recent physical — climbed into the sumo ring.

President Trump stepped into the dohyo shortly after 5:30 p.m. Sunday to present the “President’s Cup” — a roughly 4½ -foot, more than 60-pound trophy that served as a physical manifestation of the gilded, ceremonial nature of Trump’s four-day trip here.

The president seemed to enjoy his low-key star turn at Ryogoku Kokugikan stadium, exclaiming afterward, “That was an incredible evening at sumo.”

“Sumo wrestling,” he marveled later.

[Trump is presenting a sumo trophy in Japan. France beat him to it nearly 20 years ago.]

Trump took in just five matches — some lasting but several seconds — alongside Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Sunday evening. But he spent the morning putting on a show of his own; at roughly 7:30 a.m. local time, the president fired off a tweet that, in a single social media missive, undercut his national security adviser, reaffirmed his ties with a dictator and attacked a domestic political rival on foreign soil, while misspelling the rival’s name.

“North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me,” Trump wrote, in a second tweet that corrected his initial misspelling of former vice president Joe Biden’s last name. “I have confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me, & also smiled when he called Swampman Joe Biden a low IQ individual, & worse. Perhaps that’s sending me a signal?”

Less than a day earlier, Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, had argued the opposite to reporters here, warning there is “no doubt” North Korea’s missile tests violated United Nations Security Council resolutions and adding that Trump was determined to maintain sanctions pressure on the regime until it backs down.

In a conference call with reporters before Trump departed for Japan, a senior administration official had promised a “substantive” trip, with “some substantive things to announce.” But until the president made news with his impromptu tweet Sunday morning, Trump’s appearance at the sumo championship seemed to be one of the main events of his visit.

Indeed, Trump spent his first full day in Japan largely as a tourist. Earlier in the day, the president and Abe had played golf at Mobara Country Club in Chiba — complete with selfies and double cheeseburgers made with U.S. beef — and after the sumo championship, the two leaders and their wives headed for dinner of traditional Japanese grilled fare known as robatayaki. (The menu seemed specifically designed for Trump’s generally bland tastes — a five-course meal that included buttered potatoes, grilled chicken, Wagyu beef with vegetables and vanilla ice cream).

Trump’s planned appearance at the sumo match was relatively restrained for a president who became a household name as a reality TV star and often seems to thrive amid chaos and even encourage it. Gone were his days as a World Wrestling Entertainment personality who, in 2007, clotheslined WWE Chairman Vince McMahon and faux-pounded him, ringside, before shaving him bald in a viral pay-per-view moment.

Instead, Trump entered the sumo ring after donning slippers — no shoes are allowed in the dohyo — and read from a scroll, the “certificate of commemoration” in honor of the 25-year-old victor, Asanoyama.

“In honor of your outstanding achievement as sumo grand champion, I hereby award you the President’s Cup,” Trump said.

A sumo official helped him lift the heavy cup and hand it to Asanoyama, who bowed several times. The president shook his hand, clapped, at one point bowed slightly himself, and exited the ring.

Perhaps the most dramatic moment of Trump’s award presentation came before the president was even onstage; the silver trophy — which features an eagle atop it, wings high, and which was displayed Sunday afternoon to some fanfare in the lobby of the hotel where the president is staying — was brought out draped in white cloth, and the crowd gasped when its covering was removed.

Jaime Tiktin, 54, a tourist from Mexico City, said it was a “strange surprise” to learn that Trump would be attending the sumo match. Tiktin said he read in the Japan Times that the Japanese “kind of made up this prize to make him feel good,” but he noted that Trump seemed subdued.

“He didn’t smile at all; he didn’t do any gestures,” Tiktin said. “It was kind of strange to see him not moving his lips at all.”

Tiktin and his wife — who came bearing a homemade “Viva Mexico” sign — said they are not fans of Trump because of the way he has treated Mexicans, but they added that Trump was apparently trying to abide by sumo protocol. “I think he was being respectful,” Tiktin said. “I hate to say that, but I think he was respectful.”

In the run-up to the sumo championship, Trump prompted some griping among the Japanese. Some were annoyed that he and his wife, Melania, received special treatment and were allowed to sit in chairs close to the ring. Normally, attendees on the lower levels sit on cushions, called zabutons, and VIPs opt for seats on the second floor designed specifically for them. There was also concern the president’s entourage and large security detail would take away seats from Japanese sumo fans.

One widely shared article in the Japanese news media pointed out that the Japan Sumo Association is happy to follow many anachronistic traditions, such as forbidding women from standing in the ring. The article asked rhetorically, “Is not it against their traditions to let Trump sit on a seat by the ring and wear slippers into the ring to present his cup?” (Sumo wrestlers fight barefoot, though slippers were an acceptable alternative to shoes for Trump.)

The zabutons — which spectators often throw into the air to cheer or show their dissatisfaction after a spectacular match — also posed a potential security headache. Sankei, a Japanese daily, even featured a story, complete with a photo of a flying zabuton, headlined, “Mr. Trump to watch the final day matches. Fear of zabuton.”

But in the end, Trump proved more a curiosity than a nuisance, the mere mention of his name almost invariably prompting giggles among the spectators.

“He’s a crazy guy, yeah?” said Ryugo Kato, 45, a Tokyo resident.

Kato said he thought Trump should have sat on the floor if he wanted to be close to the ring. “That’s the way this place is set up,” Kato said. “He should respect the custom. It’s the culture.”

Nonetheless, he also welcomed Trump to the match. “If he wants to come, fine,” Kato said. “There’s nothing wrong with watching the sport and paying some respect to Japan’s national sport.”

Asanoyama, for his part, seemed to be a potential Trump convert. According to Nikkan Sports, in an interview Saturday, the champion said, “I am going to check Wikipedia for Trump-san,” apparently to be better prepared.

By Sunday, asked after his victory about being the first person to receive the “President’s Cup,” Asanoyama was emotional.

“I was overjoyed,” he said. “It was almost too much to say in words.”

Mark Meadows views fresh 'Strzok coverup' material at DOJ,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-24-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/mark-meadows-views-fresh-strzok-coverup-material-at-doj,"Rep. Mark Meadows said he was at the Justice Department to review new information about former FBI agent Peter Strzok.

The North Carolina Republican was spotted at Justice Department headquarters in D.C. with Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, on Thursday.

Asked by a reporter why he was there, Meadows said, ""I was reviewing text messages and new correspondence that pertains to the Strzok coverup.""

Hours after their visit, President Trump gave Attorney General William Barr ""full and complete authority to declassify information"" related to the origins of the federal investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.

Meadows and Jordan's visit to the Justice Department also comes after House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes said he learned that an August 2016 text from Strzok about an ""insurance policy"" had to do with the FBI's use of an unverified dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele to obtain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants to wiretap Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

Strzok was the lead investigator of the Hillary Clinton emails inquiry and opened the counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia in the summer of 2016.

Text messages between Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, in which they displayed a negative opinion of Trump, were uncovered over the course of the Justice Department's inspector general investigation into the DOJ and FBI's conduct during the investigation into Hillary Clinton's unauthorized private email server.

The report, which came out in the summer of 2018, said their text messages ""potentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations. But the inspector general determined that there was no evidence “improper considerations, including political bias, directly affected the specific investigative decisions.""

Updated Sunday at 2:14 p.m. ET

On Friday, three days before Memorial Day, attorneys general for 47 states wrote to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos asking her to automatically forgive student loans for eligible disabled veterans.

The Department of Education has identified more than 42,000 veterans who qualify for a federal program known as Total and Permanent Disability Discharge, or TPD, that offers to relieve borrowers from repaying certain government student loans. These veterans, the letter says, shoulder over $1 billion in education debt that could be forgiven.

To get the benefit, veterans must first apply for the program. According to information obtained by the group Veterans Education Success through a Freedom of Information Act request, almost 60 percent of eligible veterans had defaulted on a loan payment as of April 2018. Yet only about 20 percent had applied to the loan forgiveness program.

The attorneys general want that to change. In the letter — which was also signed by attorneys general for the District of Columbia and three U.S. territories — they propose making the forgiveness program automatic for veterans who have been identified by the Department of Education.

""As a nation, we have a moral obligation to assist those who have put their lives on the line to defend us,"" the letter reads. ""There is no statutory or legal requirement that the Department of Education demand that eligible veterans affirmatively apply for TPD discharges before the Department will forgive their loans.""

In a statement to NPR, the Education Department said it recognized the sacrifices that veterans make for their country, adding that it has worked to streamline the TPD discharge process.

""While we have worked to make this process as easy and as seamless as possible for veterans, the last thing we want to do is cause unintended consequences for them,"" according to the statement.

The department said discharges could raise veterans' tax bills or inhibit them from taking out more student loans.

In their letter to DeVos, the attorneys general dismissed the department's concern about increasing borrowers' tax bills.

""[F]ederal tax law now excludes loan discharges for disabled borrowers from taxable income, and most states' tax codes do likewise,"" said the letter. ""Moreover, we think it likely that most borrowers would prefer to have one hundred percent of their outstanding loans discharged, even if this resulted in an increase to their state tax bill.""

The letter from the attorneys general follows at least two other similar letters that Republican and Democratic members of Congress sent to DeVos last year."

For those who enjoy heading south of the border for vacations, the U.S. Department of State has updated travel warnings for Mexican states where tourists are more vulnerable to crime.

Ahead of Memorial Day weekend, the Mexican state of Tamaulipas - which borders south Texas - is on the list of Do Not Travel states because of high crime and possible kidnapping.

Violent crime, such as murder, armed robbery, carjacking, kidnapping, extortion, and sexual assault, is common in the state.

The first quarter of 2019 set a new record for homicides in Mexico, where violent crime has claimed more than 250,000 lives since 2006, according to the Associated press.

The State Department cautioned people on where not to go and also offered tips on how to avoid becoming a victim.

The Mexico Travel Advisory is divided into four levels of caution from the least dangerous – the ""exercise normal precautions"" list, to the most dangerous – the ""do not travel"" list.

USDA staffers quit en masse as Trump administration eyes moving offices out of DC,https://www.foxnews.com,"[""Andrew O'Reilly""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/usda-staffers-quit-en-masse-as-trump-administration-eyes-moving-offices-out-of-dc,"Employees at the U.S. Department of Agriculture are quitting at a rapid clip as Secretary Sonny Perdue prepares to move forward with plans to relocate two offices far outside the Washington, D.C., Beltway.

Federal employees at the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) – two small but important agencies within the USDA – are unhappy with Perdue’s plan, announced last August, to move the majority of their staff from current offices in the capital to an area closer the country’s agricultural centers.

“This move does not serve a public purpose,” Peter Winch, a representative for the American Federation of Government Employees, a union that represents ERS workers, told Fox News. “Employees don’t want to move, and it doesn’t make sense for them to move.”

US FARMERS HURT BY TRADE WAR GETTING $16 BILLION BOOST, US AGRICULTURE SECRETARY SAYS

Winch added that since ERS employees joined AFGE earlier this month, six employees have already quit their jobs with the government agency in response to the planned move. He said overall staffing is down to 209 from 300 during the Obama administration.

A Washington Post report cited an estimate that the ERS used to see roughly one “non-retirement” departure per month – but that pace has doubled since October. NIFA reportedly has also seen people leave.

Perdue said in a statement to Fox News that the move was meant “to improve performance and the services these agencies provide.” The secretary of agriculture added that the planned move would bring the department’s scientists closer to “stakeholders” and “customers” such as Midwest farmers.

“It’s been our goal to make USDA the most effective, efficient, and customer-focused department in the entire federal government,” Perdue said. “We don’t undertake these relocations lightly, and we are doing it to improve performance and the services these agencies provide.”

Perdue added: “We will be placing important USDA resources closer to many stakeholders, most of whom live and work far from Washington, D.C. We will be saving money for the taxpayers and improving our ability to retain more employees in the long run.”

The goal of the ERS, however, is to provide statistical information to lawmakers in Washington, while NIFA works to fund hundreds of millions of dollar annually in research in the agricultural sector.

HISTORIC FLOODS IN MIDWEST HAVE FARMERS WORRIED ABOUT THEIR FUTURE

Congressional Democrats are scrambling to try and block the move.

“This parochial idea of, like, ‘Washington messes everything up. Let’s move it out of town’ overlooks the important role that this agency plays,” Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-Maine, a member of the House Agriculture Committee, told The Washington Post. “There’s just a heightened level of concern about this administration, generally, about data collection and science.”

Critics, including former USDA officials, say the move would weaken the agencies, reduce their influence with lawmakers and provide little benefit to the farming community.

Winch argued that weakening the agencies' influence in Washington is at least part of the point. The NIFA funds grants that go into researching the effects the agriculture sector has on climate change – which the Trump administration has tried to downplay – and Perdue was allegedly upset by NIFA’s policy to support LGBT members of the 4-H youth farming organization.

The president’s 2020 budget has also proposed slashing funding to ERS research from $87 million to $61 million and cutting 160 jobs, while Perdue has suggested moving the agency from under the USDA’s science arm to being supervised by the USDA’s chief economist, a political wing of the department.

“There is some sort of punitive motivation,” Winch said. “Someone has made a negative judgment about these agencies.”

Perdue and his staff have narrowed the list of places where the two agencies could go down to three from an original 130 -- with Kansas City, the state of Indiana and North Carolina’s research triangle in the Raleigh-Durham area on the shortlist. St. Louis, Mo., and Madison, Wis., are two alternate locations.

Perdue is expected to make the announcement of where the agencies will move as soon as Friday, but it remains unclear whether the two agencies will actually leave Washington.

The USDA’s own inspector general is currently looking into whether Perdue has the legal authority to move these agencies, while the House Appropriations Committee’s draft bill of agricultural appropriations, which was released earlier this week, prohibits the USDA from using funds to move agencies outside of the Washington area. Trump’s 2020 budget proposal wants $15.5 million to relocate ERS and $9.5 million to relocate NIFA.

“We continue to believe that the USDA lacks the legal authority to carry out this proposal,” Rep. Steny H. Hoyer, D-Md., and Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., said in a statement earlier this spring. “However, even if it had such authority, USDA has not done the proper analysis of the cost and benefits, and this proposal will harm agriculture research and our constituents.”"

CHANTILLY, VA / ACCESSWIRE / May 28, 2019 / Rekor Systems, Inc. (REKR) (''Rekor'') announced today it has been selected by the Department of Defense (DoD) to provide automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) solutions. The contract with the DoD is for the purchase of 200 licenses to use Rekor's machine learning-enabled vehicle recognition system, powered by our industry-leading OpenALPR software.

''We are pleased to be selected by the DoD to provide vehicle recognition systems. Our systems are easy to integrate and highly scalable, making them an ideal solution to enhance security and surveillance operations,'' said Robert A. Berman, President and CEO of Rekor. ''Selection by the world's preeminent defense department is a great validation of our technology and one we are proud of. We look forward to working with the DoD to support their important work, and to further showcase the power of our solutions.''

Rekor's OpenALPR software enables automatic license plate and vehicle recognition through virtually any IP camera. Its industry-leading artificial intelligence-based solutions can be hosted locally or in the cloud. Enabled by machine learning from its robust and growing database covering over 60 countries, OpenALPR software can identify in real time vehicle license plate data, color, make, model and body type.

Rather than buying expensive cameras that take weeks or months to ship and install, Rekor's OpenALPR software can be deployed to any existing IP camera immediately. This can represent a potential substantial savings per camera, as well as greater flexibility to expand or decrease usage as needed without large capital expenditures on hardware. It also eliminates the need for two separate cameras, one for LPR functionality and one for general surveillance recording. Rekor's solution can be used to collect license plate data and information such as the make, model, and color of a vehicle using the same camera that provides surveillance monitoring.

''The fact that Rekor's solution can be deployed to any existing IP camera is extremely attractive in the defense sector, particularly where cameras may already be set up for surveillance and the installation of new hardware might prove difficult due to time constraints or location in harsh or remote terrains,'' Berman continued. ''The flexibility of our SaaS model also allows for the easy integration of additional cameras if they are needed in a hurry, rather than having to wait for hardware to be shipped and installed. It provides valuable new capabilities within the defense sector.''

DOJ accuses Assange of violating Espionage Act,https://www.politico.com,"['Natasha Bertrand', 'Alex Isenstadt', 'James Arkin', 'Jun Mai', 'South China Morning Post']",05-23-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/23/doj-accuses-assange-of-violating-espionage-act-1342653,"Julian Assange from a police vehicle on his arrival at Westminster Magistrates court on April 11, 2019 in London, England. Among the charges are three counts that Assange violated the Espionage Act, which prohibits the disclosure of national defense information. | Jack Taylor/Getty Images legal DOJ accuses Assange of violating Espionage Act

The Justice Department has hit WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange with Espionage Act charges, escalating a legal fight against the high-profile activist and alarming press freedom activists.

DOJ had previously only indicted Assange on a single count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. Thursday’s revelation of the additional 18 charges, filed in the Eastern District of Virginia, means Assange could face significantly more prison time if found guilty.

Story Continued Below

The alleged Espionage Act violations relate to Assange’s complicity with Chelsea Manning, a former U.S. Army soldier who was convicted in July 2013 of violating the Espionage Act after she shuttled troves of classified government information to WikiLeaks. Officials said Assange solicited the information from and then brazenly published details that put the government's human sources at risk, disregarding explicit warnings from the government.

Traditionally, the Espionage Act has been used against government officials, like Manning, who reveal such classified information, rather than the journalists or foreign nationals who publish the information.

As a result, the use of the Espionage Act against Assange set off alarm bells among press freedom activists on Thursday. While WikiLeaks isn’t a conventional news organization, press advocates have long feared that charging Assange for the publication of government secrets could open the door to prosecuting reporters for doing the same.

""Any government use of the Espionage Act to criminalize the receipt and publication of classified information poses a dire threat to journalists seeking to publish such information in the public interest, irrespective of the Justice Department’s assertion that Assange is not a journalist,"" said Bruce Brown, executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, in a statement.

Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who also touched off a debate about the media's role in publishing secret files when he leaked classified information to reporters in 2013, proclaimed: “the Department of Justice just declared war – not on Wikileaks, but on journalism itself.”

John Demers, head of DOJ’s national security division, pushed back at that argument on Thursday, insisting Assange is “not a journalist,” and alleging that the WikiLeaks founder “purposely published names he knew to be confidential human sources in warzones.”

It's a debate that Justice Department officials have grappled with for years. The Obama administration previously looked into bringing similar charges against Assange, but decided against it.

“We didn’t bring this [Espionage Act] case for a couple of reasons,"" said Matt Miller, an Obama-era DOJ spokesman. ""First, we thought it was a dangerous precedent to prosecute Assange for something that reporters do all the time. We didn’t believe Assange was a journalist, but the Espionage Act doesn’t make any distinction between journalists and others, so if you can apply it to Assange, there’s no real reason you couldn’t apply it to [The New York Times]. Second, and it’s related, it’s not at all clear that charging someone with the publication of classified information could survive court scrutiny.”

Assange’s legal case took off in April after Ecuador revoked its seven-year asylum, forcing him out of the embassy in London and paving the way for his extradition to the United States for one of the biggest ever leaks of classified information. Justice Department officials said they could not comment on how this might affect Assange’s extradition from the U.K. to the U.S.

Among Thursday's charges are three counts that Assange violated the Espionage Act, which prohibits the disclosure of national defense information. The Justice Department alleged that Assange published select State Department cables that contained the unredacted names of human sources in Iran, China and Syria. He also published Afghan activity reports and Iraq activity reports that endangered local Afghans and Iraqis, prosecutors alleged.

“It was explicitly stated in the State Department cables that the identity of sources was to be protected,” a Justice Department official told reporters on Thursday. “Assange was warned by the State Department not to release the names but he did so nevertheless.”

However, the government has not identified any individuals who were directly killed a result of Assange's disclosures. The U.S. counterintelligence official who led the Pentagon's review of the bombshell leaks told a court during Manning’s sentencing hearing in 2013 that investigators had not been able to find any such instances.

Still, Zach Terwilliger, the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, stressed that the government was “not charging Assange for passively obtaining classified information.” Rather, he is being prosecuted for publishing “a narrow set of classified documents in which Assange also published the names of innocent people who risked their safety” to help the United States.

“Assange is not charged simply because he is a publisher,” Terwilliger told reporters on Thursday.

Prosecutors said Manning had contacted Assange as early as November 2009, responding ""to Assange’s solicitation of classified information made through the WikiLeaks website."" The appeal included a “Military and Intelligence Most Wanted Leaks” category that solicited CIA detainee interrogation videos.

Assange also encouraged Manning to transfer him Guantanamo Bay detainee assessment briefs in March 2010, according to chats obtained by the government, as well as Iraq rule of engagement files and 75,000 Afghanistan war-related significant activity reports.

John Brown, the FBI assistant director for counterintelligence, said the indictment was “the result of nearly a decade” of work.

The original Assange indictment, brought in March 2018 and unsealed in April of this year, charged the WikiLeaks founder with conspiring with Manning to hack a government computer to obtain hundreds of thousands of U.S. military reports about U.S. wars in the Middle East. WikiLeaks later published the leaked information.

Assange faces up to 10 years in prison on each count.

Manning was jailed in March after being held in contempt by a judge in Virginia for refusing to testify before a grand jury about Assange. She is still in prison, and DOJ officials would not comment on her situation on Thursday.

Homeland Security to issue spousal H-4 visa changes,https://www.thegazette.com,['Mercury News'],,,,https://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/nation-and-world/homeland-security-to-issue-spousal-h-4-visa-changes-20190528,"The fate of some 200,000 foreign citizens living and working in the United States is resting with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the Trump White House and a federal appeals court.

At issue is work authorization for holders of the H-4 visa, who are spouses of foreign nationals employed in the U.S. under the H-1B visa.

Homeland Security this week updated the schedule for a new rule removing that authorization, saying it would publish the proposed rule this month.

University of Tennessee researchers have estimated that 100,000 people, mostly Indian women, have the work authorization.

Spouses of H-1B workers on track for green cards have been allowed to work in the United States since 2015, when Homeland Security under the administration of former president Barack Obama published a new rule, first proposed in 2011, authorizing their employment.

“Allowing the eligible class of H-4 dependent spouses to work encourages professionals with high demand skills to remain in the country and help spur the innovation and growth of U.S. companies,” the agency said in proposing the rule.

Under the administration of President Donald Trump, Homeland Security has changed its messaging on the work authorization. In proposing to strip the right to work from the H-4 visa holders, the agency said in an online notification late last year that, “Some U.S. workers would benefit from this proposed rule by having a better chance at obtaining jobs that some of the population of the H-4 workers currently hold.”

ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT

The move by Homeland Security is part of a broader crackdown by the Trump administration on the H-1B visa. Silicon Valley’s tech industry, including large companies such as Google, Facebook and Apple, rely heavily on the H-1B and have pushed for an expansion of the annual 85,000 cap on new visas, arguing it’s necessary for securing the world’s top talent.

Critics point to reported abuses by outsources, and contend that the visa is used to supplant U.S. workers with cheaper foreign labor, and to drive down wages.

While Homeland Security has said in this week’s notice it will publish its proposed rule this month — which is expected to trigger a public comment period before any final approval — the agency has several times missed its own deadlines for publication since first proposing cutting the work authorization in 2017.

Bay Area software engineer Ranjana Varadarajan, an Indian citizen on the H-4 visa, said the prospect of losing her right to work makes her worried about her professional future.

“In the tech industry we should not have any gaps in our career,” she said. “We have to keep updating ourselves.” If the government bans her and other H-4 holders from employment, she will have no other choice but to leave the U.S. and live apart from her husband because she won’t give up her career, Varadarajan said."

USDA ends long-standing Forest Service job training program for at-risk youth,https://www.politico.com,['Catherine Boudreau'],05-24-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/24/agriculture-dept-ends-job-corps-conservation-centers-1472208,"The program — known as the Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers — is being transferred to the Labor Department. Employment USDA ends long-standing Forest Service job training program for at-risk youth

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has decided to end a U.S. Forest Service work program that trains at-risk youth to be first responders to natural disasters, maintain national forests and work on rural infrastructure projects.

The program — known for operating the Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers — is being transferred to the Labor Department. As part of the move, the department intends to close nine of 25 centers, according to a statement released Friday. The action could lead to a significant cut of the number of Forest Service employees.

Story Continued Below

“There are reasons why the secretary made this decision,” Forest Service Chief Vicki Christiansen told staff members during a conference call announcing the move on Friday morning, less than an hour before the Department of Labor’s news release. She said she learned of the decision only four days ago.

“Perdue has a goal of efficient and effective government,” Christiansen said, adding that the secretary believes the mission of the program better aligns with the Labor Department. The Forest Service’s Civilian Conservation Centers is the only Labor Department Jobs Corps initiative operated by federal employees.

“This was a high-level policy discussion and decision. It in no way reflects on your excellent work and dedication,” Christiansen said.

Perdue, in a letter to Labor Secretary Alex Acosta, wrote the move would help the Forest Service prioritize its “core natural resource mission to improve the condition and resilience of our nation’s forests, and step away from activities and programs that are not essential to that core mission.”

Forest Service officials did not disclose how many employees will be affected by the change, which is expected to be completed by September. However, a spokesperson for the National Federation of Federal Employees, the union representing Forest Service workers, told POLITICO that as many as 1,065 workers could be let go.

Another Forest Service official on the conference call said the agency will request authority for a reduction in force, which must go through the Office of Personnel Management because of the size of the staff cuts. The Civilian Conservation Centers closing are in states such as Montana, Oregon, Washington, Kentucky and North Carolina.

The Forest Service official said that agency will try to help employees find other jobs within the department and push “voluntary separation incentives,” or buyouts.

The Labor Department said 16 of the 25 centers will be replaced by new contract operators or a partnership overseen by DOL. The announcement added that the “new operators will implement new policies and approaches that will offer students the skills they need to earn an independent living and succeed in meaningful in-demand jobs.”

The Civilian Conservation Corps dates to the Great Depression but was disbanded during World War II. The current iteration was designed during the Johnson administration as part of its Jobs Corps effort. Today, thousands of young people aged 16 to 24 from low-income communities participate in the program.

“During hurricanes, wildfires and other natural disasters, these students are some of the first people to respond,” said Brittany Holder, a spokeswoman for the National Federation of Federal Employees. The organization, in a recent review of the Civilian Conservation Corps, found that in 2017, more than 300 students were sent to wildfire assignments, providing about 200,000 hours of support, among a range of other services.

The union argues the program has been a success and that the administration is misrepresenting data to make its case to privatize the centers. The Trump administration — in annual budget requests — and Republican lawmakers have criticized the program as being wasteful of taxpayer money and having little accountability.

“They have no plan for the students, no idea how to stop the loss of 613,000 hours of student service, and are not concerned about the impact on rural jobs and local economies,” Beverly Tobin-Ford, the union’s Forest Service Council vice president, said in April. “It’s as if this administration just decided to do this without reservation or any forethought.”

Parrot selected by U.S. Department of Defense to take part in the development of the next-generation of Short Range Reconnaissance drone for the U.S. Army,https://finance.yahoo.com,[],05-28-2019,2019,5,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/parrot-selected-u-department-defense-151300332.html,"PARIS, May 28, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- The U.S. Army Program Executive Officer (PEO) for Aviation's Project Manager, Unmanned Aircraft Systems, partnered with the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) and the Army's Maneuver Center of Excellence to identify and prototype new drone capabilities with commercial companies that specialize in on-demand, ""eye in the sky"" technologies. In this process, the U.S. Army is partnering with the Pentagon's internal startup accelerator to adapt small commercial drones for the battlefield.

Parrot, the leading European drone group, is one of the 6 companies1 that have met the standards set in the solicitation issued in November 20182 to develop and prototype the next generation of small-unit surveillance drone.

The Short Range Reconnaissance (SRR) effort has recently awarded $11 million in funding to six companies to prototype and evaluate drones that can provide the Soldier on the ground with a rapidly deployable scouting capability to gain situational awareness beyond the next terrain feature.
