Utah judge suspended without pay for 6 months after critical comments about Trump,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Nicole Darrah', 'Nicole Darrah Covers Breaking', 'Trending News For Foxnews.Com. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/utah-judge-suspended-critical-comments-trump,"A judge in Utah was suspended without pay for six months last week after criticizing President Trump — both online and in court — for his ""political incompetence.""

Judge Michael Kwan, who's been a justice court judge in Taylorsville, a suburb of Salt Lake City, since 1998. Between 2016 and 2017, he shared inappropriate posts on Facebook and LinkedIn about the president, according to Utah's State Supreme Court.

TRUMP: 'SLEEPY JOE BIDEN' HASN'T 'APOLOGIZED' FOR INVOLVEMENT IN 1994 CRIME LAW

Kwan violated the judicial code of conduct and lessened ""the reputation of our entire judiciary,"" Justice John Pearce wrote in an opinion on Wednesday.

""Judge Kwan's behavior denigrates his reputation as an impartial, independent, dignified, and courteous jurist who takes no advantage of the office in which he serves,"" Pearce said.

An investigation was opened after Kwan made comments about Trump during court in 2017, KSTU reported. He told a defendant who said he planned to use his tax refund for his court fees that he would need to pray in order to get a tax return because of Trump's proposed border wall along the southern border.

“Prayer might be the answer. ‘Cause, [Trump] just signed an order to start building the wall and he has no money to do that, and so if you think you are going to get taxes back this year, uh-yeah, maybe, maybe not,"" Kwan reportedly said. ""But don’t worry, there is a tax cut for the wealthy so if you make over $500,000 you’re getting a tax cut.""

TRUMP SEIZES ON NYU PROFESSOR'S TWEET TO PUSH CHANGE OF LIBEL LAWS

On Inauguration Day in 2017, Kwan posted online: ""Welcome to governing. Will you dig your heels in and spend the next four years undermining our country's reputation and standing in the world? . . . Will you continue to demonstrate your inability to govern and political incompetence?""

The following month, he wrote: ""Welcome to the beginning of the fascist takeover. . . We need to be diligent in questioning Congressional Republicans if they are going to be the American Reichstag and refuse to stand up for the Constitution.""

An attorney for the judge — who was first appointed by elected city officials to a six-year term and was later voted in to keep the position — said that, like many others, Kwan felt strongly about the 2016 elections. Kwan, however, recognizes that judges are held to a higher standard.

""He certainly regrets making those statements and is committed to not doing anything like that again,"" attorney Greg Skordas told The Associated Press.

It's unknown what Kwan's political affiliation is because he chooses to keep his voter registration private, an option available to any state voter, Justin Lee, director of elections for Utah's state elections, said.

Skordas noted the judge has been reprimanded previously during his career for comments critical of politicians from both major parties.

"Savior of G.M. Lordstown Plant, Hailed by Trump, Is a Corporate Cipher",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Nelson D. Schwartz', 'Matthew Goldstein', 'Neal E. Boudette']",05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/business/economy/trump-gm-workhorse-lordstown.html,"For months, President Trump had been putting pressure on the chief executive of General Motors, Mary T. Barra, because she had decided to idle an Ohio factory and lay off 1,600 workers. “I am not happy that it is closed when everything else in our Country is BOOMING,” he said on Twitter. “I asked her to sell it or do something quickly.”

In early May, it seemed an answer was at hand. From her spacious office on the 39th floor of the Renaissance Center in Detroit, Ms. Barra called the president on May 8 to update him. The automaker was in negotiations to sell the plant in Lordstown, Ohio, to a new company affiliated with a little-known electrical vehicle maker called Workhorse.

G.M. planned to announce the talks that afternoon along with a $700 million investment elsewhere in Ohio. But Mr. Trump beat the company to the punch, posting on Twitter that the Lordstown sale was practically a done deal. It wasn’t — but that was the least of the problems with what the president said.

The new venture, whose name remains secret, exists almost entirely on paper. Headed by the founder and former chief executive of Workhorse, Steve Burns, the business would have to raise at least $300 million to get Lordstown running again."
"Trump tax return strategy could backfire, recent court decisions indicate",https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/recent-court-decisions-indicate-trump-tax-return-strategy-could-backfire,"The Trump administration is fighting back against the House Democratic push to obtain the president's past tax returns, but two court decisions in recent days indicate it's possible the administration's strategy could backfire.

Recent rulings from two federal courts went against President Trump in his efforts to block subpoenas from financial institutions. If the White House's arguments for withholding Trump's tax returns also fail to convince a judge, an ensuing appeal might only serve to delay the exposure until closer to the 2020 election -- when the president would prefer to talk about other issues.

WELLS FARGO, TD BANK TURN OVER TRUMP FINANCIAL RECORDS TO HOUSE DEMS

Michael Stern, a former senior counsel in the House of Representatives' Office of General Counsel, told Politico, ""I don't think anyone would say that it's impossible for there to be a final order for him to produce the tax returns by the middle of next year."" That would be in the heat of Trump's re-election campaign.

First, Judge Amit Mehta of the D.C. District Court ruled that accounting firm Mazars USA must comply with a House Oversight Committee subpoena for Trump's financial documents. Then Judge Edgardo Ramos of the Southern District of New York ruled similarly regarding the House Financial Services and Intelligence Committees' suboenas issued to Deutsche Bank and Capital One.

Whether a president's tax returns enjoy greater protection remains to be seen. University of Iowa Law Professor Andy Grewal says in his recent paper ""The President's Tax Returns"" that court precedent may be on Trump's side, at least for the time being.

Grewal notes that while congressional committees do have broad authority to request a person's tax returns, that power is not unlimited. Such requests must be made with a legitimate legislative purpose. He cites the Supreme Court's 1957 decision in Watkins v. United States, which pointed to the need for Congress to act in relation to ""a legitimate task,"" and 1880's Kilbourn v. Thompson, which said that Congress' investigation of the Navy Secretary was improper, but ""the whole aspect of the case would have been changed"" had it been in the context of an impeachment inquiry.

Based on those cases, Grewal argues, Congress may not have the authority to presently demand Trump's tax returns, as they have not opened an impeachment investigation.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., stated earlier this month that using an impeachment probe as an excuse to get documents could work, even if the investigation does not lead to impeachment. Grewal's paper appears to support the validitiy of this idea, but so far House Democrats have resisted making that move.

Mehta's ruling, however, appears to claim that opening an official investigation is not even necessary, at least in the context of Trump's financial documents that were subpoenaed from Mazars USA.

""It is simply not fathomable that a Constitution grants Congress the power to remove a President for reasons including criminal behavior would deny Congress the power to investigate him for unlawful conduct---past or present---even without formally opening an impeachment inquiry,"" Mehta wrote.

On top of that, Mehta ruled that Congress does not even need to be motivated by a legitimate legislative purpose, as long as their investigation is based ""on a subject matter on which 'legislation could be had.'""

Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said he would comply with a court order to release Trump's tax returns, but that does not mean the administration would not at least try to appeal a district court's decision. During that time, similar appeals in the Mazars USA and Deutsche Bank cases could advance through the judicial system as well. Since those matters are taking place in different circuits, if those appeals meet different outcomes, it could be grounds for the Supreme Court to consider taking up the issue of the limits of congressional oversight of the executive branch.

The timing of all this is what could ultimately pose a problem, depending on how long these legal battles last.

Trump's own past statements have supported the idea that releasing tax returns sooner rather than later would be a good idea. When Mitt Romney ran for president in 2012, he held out until finally making them public in September. Trump commented on this in 2016.

JUDGE WHO UPHELD TRUMP SUBPOENA DONATED TO DEMS ON COMMITTEE SEEKING THE RECORDS

""He waited until September to give them, just before the election,"" Trump told ABC. ""They made him look so bad, it was so unfair, I actually think he didn't lose because of the 47 percent, I think he lost because of a couple of really minor items in tax return where he did nothing wrong.""

If the issue of Trump's tax returns is decided the way lower courts ruled on his financial documents, the president and his legal team may have to weigh the benefits of trying to push a court case past November 2020, or potentially prevailing beforehand, versus letting the information out early, so that Trump's campaign has more time to address it.

""He's gambling,"" Stern said."
"Michael Wolff’s ‘Draft Indictment’ of Trump Doesn’t Exist, Says Mueller’s Office",https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Jamie Ross'],05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/michael-wolffs-draft-indictment-of-trump-doesnt-exist-says-muellers-office,"A spokesman for Robert Mueller has emphatically denied a claim from Fire and Fury author Michael Wolff that the special counsel drew up a three-count obstruction-of-justice indictment against Donald Trump before deciding to ditch it.

The unverified allegation is made in Wolff’s new book, Siege: Trump Under Fire, which is due to be published next week. It’s the sequel to Fire and Fury, which infuriated the president for its claims about the dysfunctional inner workings of his White House.

The Guardian obtained a copy of the new book and reports that Wolff states his findings about Mueller’s supposed draft indictment are “based on internal documents given to me by sources close to the Office of the Special Counsel.” The newspaper writes that it’s seen the documents.

However, Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, told The Guardian: “The documents that you’ve described do not exist.”

Wolff claims the draft listing the president’s alleged abuses was written under the title “United States of America against Donald J. Trump, Defendant,” and it sat on Mueller’s desk for a year before being discarded.

The Guardian reports the first of the three counts charged the president with corruptly influencing, obstructing, or impeding a pending proceeding before a department or agency. The second count is said to have charged the president with tampering with a witness, victim, or informant, while the third allegedly charged Trump with retaliating against a witness.

According to Wolff, Mueller’s team drew up both the three-count indictment of Trump as well as a supporting draft memorandum of law opposing any motion from Congress or the White House that sought to dismiss it.

The memo quoted by Wolff says: “The Impeachment Judgment Clause, which applies equally to all civil officers including the president… takes for granted… that an officer may be subject to indictment and prosecution before impeachment. If it did not, the clause would be creating, for civil officers, precisely the immunity the Framers rejected.”

Wolff writes that Mueller agonized for a long time over whether to charge the president before ultimately deciding he could not move to prosecute a sitting president.

Wolff's conclusion reads: “Bob Mueller threw up his hands. Surprisingly, he found himself in agreement with the greater White House: Donald Trump was the president, and, for better or for worse, what you saw was what you got—and what the country voted for.”"
'A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall' on Obama's Bad Cops and Spies,https://www.realclearpolitics.com,[],05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/05/28/a_hard_rains_gonna_fall_on_obamas_bad_cops_and_spies_140429.html,"The skies are growing dark and increasingly ominous for dirty officials at the top of Obama-era law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Leading the “I’m really worried” list are James Comey, John Brennan, James Clapper, Loretta Lynch, and their senior aides, all political appointees. They expected Hillary Clinton to win in 2016 and bury any traces of malfeasance, just as they had buried hers. It didn’t work out that way.

Now they need protection themselves. House Democrats and anonymous leakers are busy providing it. Many are delicately called “current and former senior officials” by the New York Times, Washington Post, and other legacy media. Gee, I wonder who they are?

These defenders of the old guard are sliming Attorney General Bill Barr, who heads the investigation into their actions. They have good reasons, if not clean hands, for their attack. First, they want to keep as much secret as they can. Exposure can only harm them. Their main argument is that any disclosures will damage U.S. national security. Second, they want to paint the disclosures and forthcoming indictments as President Trump’s revenge, the illegitimate use of powerful agencies that should be nonpartisan. That, of course, is precisely what they are accused of doing.

Barr won’t be deterred. He did not return for a second stint as AG to pad his résumé or protect Donald Trump. He returned to clean out the Augean Stables. He needs to muck out the mess left by his predecessors and find the horses that left it.

Barr is determined to do that. He intends to find out how and why the Department of Justice embarked on an all-consuming, two-year project to investigate Trump’s alleged cooperation with Putin’s Russia to win the presidency. The investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller found no such cooperation (going well beyond saying he simply could not indict). Now, Barr wants to understand the origins of the probe and whether the tools used to launch it were lies or distortions — and were known to be so by DoJ, FBI, and CIA officials. Barr wants to know if U.S. intelligence agencies were used to spy illegally on Americans, or if they outsourced that to friendly foreign services and then recovered the information from them. He wants to know if the investigations really began in July 2016, as the FBI testified, or earlier, and what evidence was used to begin them.

None dare call it spying. At least no Democrats or Obama officials will. But that’s exactly what it was. As that master of the English language, Winston Churchill, put it, “Short words are best and old words when short are best of all.” That’s far too clear for bureaucratic obfuscators, presidential contenders, and their media allies. They prefer long, Latinate terms like “surveillance” and “surreptitious investigation.” Barr is effectively telling them to “pound sand.”

Over the next few months, the public will finally see what kind of malfeasance there was. At least they will see some of it. Some will remain classified to protect sources and methods; some will be released only after criminal charges are filed. The initial evidence will come from two sources: a major report by DoJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz, and the steady declassification of underlying documents by AG Barr, who was given that task by the president. Barr needed that authority because the FBI and intelligence community are resisting disclosure with all their institutional power. They fear years of abuse will be exposed.

Horowitz, a highly regarded career prosecutor, initially appointed by President Obama, will issue a public report and is virtually certain to make criminal referrals. The referrals will then be handled by John Durham, a skilled, apolitical U.S. attorney, who has successfully prosecuted major corruption cases for AGs in both parties. Apparently, he has already convened a grand jury. Another federal prosecutor, John Huber, has been working on related problems. Durham will coordinate, supervised by Barr.

These joint efforts will show whether there were good legal reasons to spy on Americans, whether the secret intelligence courts were given complete and honest information before they issued search warrants, whether top officials leaked secret information to the media, and whether U.S. intelligence agencies (which cannot legally spy on Americans) evaded that restriction. They may also show if outside contractors illegally tapped into classified databases and spied on American citizens, including political opponents.

These are very serious charges, and, if proven, serious crimes. What makes them worse — far worse — is that they may well be connected to each other. If they are, they would represent a high-level conspiracy by government officials, appointed by one party and directed at political opponents during and after an election.

This assault on democracy has not been proven, but the evidence emerging in dribs and drabs strongly suggests the possibility. If it is proven, and if the Obama White House was directly involved, as some FBI texts plainly say, the scandal would be one of the biggest in American history.

How big? Big enough that major news organizations, which always favor transparency (“Democracy Dies in Darkness”), are now deeply troubled by the release of any secret documents. They know the stakes are too high and transparency too dangerous for their side, politically.

Right now, we don’t know how big the scandal is, how extensive the coordination was, and how far up it went. But we certainly need to know, just as we needed to know if Donald Trump won the presidency by cooperating with a hostile foreign power. He did not, according to the Mueller report. Now, we need to know if the U.S. government itself worked secretly and illegally to prevent his election and, when that failed, to damage his new presidency. That conspiracy would be equally serious, and for the same reasons. It needs to be rooted out, exposed, and punished.

The fundamental problem was identified by James Madison, who led the drafting of our constitution. “In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men,” he wrote in Federalist Paper 51, “the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself."" Under Comey, Lynch, Brennan, and Clapper, under Obama and Biden, it failed to control itself.

Over the next few months, we will learn the extent of that failure. We will see if top officials misused their agencies to investigate and crush their political opponents. Constitutional democracies cannot permit that. They cannot wave it off as yesterday’s news and expect to survive unscathed. If undetected and unpunished, it will happen again to another party, another candidate.

As the evidence comes out, a hard rain’s gonna fall. The damage will be compounded by partisan divisions, corroding trust in our basic institutions, and an impending election. For democracy’s sake, let’s hope the bitter winds are not a Cat-5 storm."
"Amid censorship fears, Trump campaign 'checking out' alternative social network",https://www.politico.com,"['Ben Schreckinger', 'Ted Hesson']",05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/28/trump-campaign-twitter-1345357,"Some say that if President Donald Trump leaves Twitter for Parler, a Twitter-like social media platform, his supporters will follow. | Darren Hauck/Getty Images White House Amid censorship fears, Trump campaign 'checking out' alternative social network Parler is like Twitter, but for Trump fans.

They've been banned from Facebook, purged from Twitter and blocked from Instagram. Some of them have been barred from setting foot on the continent of Australia. But you can still find them all on the fledgling social media network Parler.

The Twitter-like platform was initially hatched last year as a tool for digital news outlets to claw revenue back from big social networks like Facebook. But as those platforms purge some of the internet’s most inflammatory supporters of President Donald Trump over posts deemed dangerous or offensive, Parler has carved out a niche among these banned right-wing influencers — like Gavin McInnes, Laura Loomer and Milo Yiannopoulos.

Story Continued Below

As conservative distrust of social media giants rises to the top of Washington’s political agenda, Parler has also gained the notice of some bona fide Republican leaders: Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale and Utah Sen. Mike Lee both began posting on the site this month.

According to one person close to Trump’s campaign, the president’s team is considering setting him up with an account on the site. A senior Trump campaign official said that there was no imminent plan to have the president join the platform, but that Parscale is scouting Parler. “It’s something he's aware of and is checking out,” the official said of Parscale. “We don’t currently have a plan to make a big move to the platform.”

Having Trump’s imprimatur would give the platform overnight cachet and satisfy calls from his social media-savvy supporters for the president to stick it to the Silicon Valley companies with which he maintains a strained, symbiotic relationship.

""Donald Trump should just switch social media platforms altogether because everyone will follow him,” said Candace Owens, a pro-Trump activist close to Trump’s campaign team. Owens, who is black, was recently banned from Facebook — and then swiftly reinstated with an apology from the company — for posting “Black America must wake up to the great liberal hoax. White supremacy is not a threat. Liberal supremacy is.”

Owens — who recently departed the conservative youth group Turning Point USA — introduced Parler to the pro-Trump grassroots with a December tweet that began, “Wow. Everyone just found out about the new Twitter. Just want to say that I WAS THE FIRST CONSERVATIVE TO JOIN.” Her tweet in turn linked to a tweet from the chairman of X Strategies, a conservative communications firm, promoting Parler.

Parler’s founder, John Matze, said the Owens tweet swamped his site with 40,000 new users, causing its servers to malfunction. (He also said that X Strategies approached him after the tweet. The firm now does public relations work for Parler.)

Parler is the french word for “Speak,” and is pronounced “par-lay.” But as its user base has grown, Matze has seen that Americans tend to pronounce the word phonetically, as in “parlor,” evoking the room in a house where friends might sit down to chat.

Matze and Owens said they first encountered each other late last year in New York at the Gatestone Institute, a think tank that was formerly chaired by Trump’s national security advisor, John Bolton, and is known for its hostility to Islam.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201801/3022/1155968404_5700600100001_5700587444001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

Owens was there to speak, and Matze was working on integrating Parler with Gatestone’s website. Matze, who leans libertarian in his personal views, had not set out to cater to Trump supporters. Originally, he had conceived of Parler as a commenting plugin with social features that media outlets could integrate into their websites as a way to capture more engagement with their content themselves — rather than letting the bulk of engagement and ad dollars flow to established social media platforms.

He said he expected left-leaning digital publishers to become core partners. But as large social media platforms have responded to calls to curb extremism on their sites with bans of several far-right figures and other, more opaque measures like “shadow banning,” conservative users have become increasingly distrustful of the likes of Facebook and Twitter.

This has created an unexpected opening for Parler with pro-Trump users, though it is still far from challenging large social networks. Many aspects of its user interface, such as its search function, remain clunky. And its user base remains miniscule in the grand scheme of things.

Matze said the site had about 100,000 users in total. Twitter, by comparison, claims 326 million.

Activity on the site appears to be devoted mostly to a small universe of Trump-friendly discussions. On a recent Tuesday, trending topics on the site included “#IslamExposed,” “#IllegalImmigrants,” “#BuildThatWall” and “#WomenForTrump.” Even among Trump’s most avid online supporters, many have never heard of Parler. At the moment, the two outlets that appear to use the site most actively are Breitbart News and the Epoch Times, a newspaper associated with Falun Gong — a Chinese spiritual movement on the outs with China’s ruling Communist Party — that has attracted notice for its pointedly pro-Trump editorial line.

Given its limitations, even those sympathetic to Parler remain skeptical of its prospects. Will Chamberlain, who recently relaunched the conservative publication Human Events with a focus on social media censorship, said that though he plans to post his outlet’s content to Parler, he does not expect it to displace the reigning platform for news. “I think Twitter has a natural monopoly,” he said. “I think there are profound network effects.”

And even by the standards of free speech Twitter alternatives, Parler is small. Another platform, Gab, founded in 2016, claims a million users. “Parler is a ghost town,” said Gab’s founder Andrew Torba.

Like Parler, Gab takes a laissez-faire approach to offensive speech and has been a magnet for those banned from other platforms. Its users include white nationalist Richard Spencer and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. The perpetrator of a 2018 mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue was also a Gab user. There are even questions about whether Gab’s frog logo is an homage to Pepe, the cartoon frog symbol of the alt-right, though Torba has said the frog is an allusion to the Book of Exodus. Gab’s popularity with the virulently racist alt-right has tainted Gab’s brand, stymying its prospects for growth into a mainstream platform even as it amassed a large user base.

While Parler’s founder does not want to be limited to a far-right user base, much of the content posted on Parler falls into categories deemed offensive and discouraged by the large platforms — such as anti-Islam and anti-feminist sentiment. In one post typical of the site, a user with the handle @liberalismiscancer, shared a meme criticizing the burka, the body covering worn by some Muslim women, along with the comment, “Where are my fellow feminists why is the oppression of women ok if it's in the name of ISLAM ? Why are Moslems treated differently free from criticism.”

Matze said he still hopes to attract users of all political persuasions. ""We're pretty much bipartisan from our standpoint,” he said. “I really don’t want to take a stance at all on the political side of things. However it seems extremely relevant right now for conservatives at least to build a platform where they can build trust. They feel extremely abused by social media.""

Matze said he plans to bypass these issues by using the FCC’s definition of obscenity to determine what posts cross the line, and to leave up anything that does not meet that threshold, while giving users tools to personally filter out content they do not want to see.

Ongoing fights about the sorts of speech and users that tech giants permit on their platforms have returned to the fore in recent weeks. Earlier this month, the White House posted an online survey seeking to collect information about possible political discrimination by these platforms.

The senior Trump campaign official said that the campaign is also using its financial leverage with social media platforms like Facebook to push back against perceived bias. “We're a significant advertiser so we make sure our viewpoint is heard,” the official said. Trump’s campaign has spent roughly $5 million so far this year on Facebook ads, far more than any of his Democratic rivals, according to a New York Times analysis.

Despite this heavy ad spending, distrust of large social media platforms has loomed large in the strategic thinking of Trump’s team. In October, POLITICO reported that Trump’s 2020 campaign was investing heavily in efforts to reach supporters directly, such as via text message, in order to bypass the platforms.

Earlier this month, Matze swung through Washington, where he ran into Parscale at the Trump Hotel. The Trump campaign manager posted a photo of himself with Matze and Elise Rhodes, a vice president of client relations at X Strategies, to Parler.

While in town, Matze also met with Lee, the libertarian-minded senator, and sold him on Parler’s free speech ethos.

Lee was so taken he decided to set up an account. Matze said he offered to help Lee’s staffers set up an account for him, but the senator insisted he did not want his staff to have access to the account, because he wanted to post directly to it himself.

A spokesman for Lee, Conn Carroll, said he could not confirm the specifics of the conversation, but did confirm that Lee personally posts to Parler himself.

Lee has posted a handful of times in recent weeks on the site -- though he hasn’t exactly been unleashed. When a user named “Anon, yo!” called Lee a “typical RINO fake congressman” for not sponsoring term limits, Lee responded, “I’ve cosponsored term-limits every year I’ve been in the Senate.” This elicited an apology from “Anon, yo!” to the senator.

Matze said he hopes the site will foster civil discussion, and that he has seen users wish each other good night at the end of evenings of heated debate. That civility though, may be a function of the fact that most of the platform’s heavy users share a broadly similar worldview. And it is not clear whether an initial user base that is so invigorated by arguing with liberals — a recent trending topic was “#Triggered” — will find as much satisfaction on a platform dominated by their fellow travelers.

Michael Morrison, a conservative activist who operated a Twitter parody account of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez until being banned from that platform, said many right-leaning social media figures are treating Parler as a backup. They are attracting modest followings on the platform in case they are banned from the larger social networks.

“Obviously I’d like to see it build up,” he said, “For now, it’s a small, nice, conservative community."""
Trump appointees overruled EPA experts on pollution requirements for Foxconn site: report,https://thehill.com,[],05-28-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/445748-trump-appointees-overruled-epa-experts-on-pollution-requirements,"Political appointees at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reportedly convinced then-EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott PruittOn The Money: Conservative blocks disaster relief bill | Trade high on agenda as Trump heads to Japan | Boeing reportedly faces SEC probe over 737 Max | Study finds CEO pay rising twice as fast as worker pay Overnight Energy: Democrats push EPA to collect 4K in 'excessive' Pruitt travel expenses | Greens angered over new rules for rocket fuel chemical | Inslee to join youth climate strikers in Las Vegas Democrats push EPA to collect 4K from Pruitt for 'excessive airfare expenses' MORE to reverse course on declaring a Wisconsin county in violation of federal smog standards, which allowed Foxconn to build a facility in the area without new anti-pollution technologies.

Documents obtained by the Sierra Club and reported by the Star Tribune revealed that a top scientist at the agency questioned the basis for Pruitt's guidance that reversed an earlier decision by officials to declare Racine County as ""non-attainment,"" meaning it would have to adopt new standards to battle air pollution to continue receiving federal funds.

“I do not see a sound technical basis for the area we are being directed to finalize in Wisconsin,” Jenny Liljegren, an EPA scientist focused on air quality, wrote in April 2018, according to the Star Tribune.

“I am still in disbelief,” added another who was not named.

A former acting air quality administrator with the EPA called the revelations in the emails ""disturbing,"" adding that it showed a preference for political influence over the agency's actual scientific work.

“To see apparent direction from political leadership that the technical staff is objecting to is disturbing,” Janet McCabe told the Star Tribune.

The EPA responded to the Hill's request for comment by referring to a recent court filing where the agency allowed for the agency's rules to stay in effect.

Foxconn's investment in Wisconsin has been one of the Trump administration's most touted economic victories, as the company originally pledged to create more than 10,000 jobs and invest billions in a manufacturing plant in the state.

The facility's construction has yet to produce any jobs in the region, however, and is reportedly scaling back those plans to invest in the state, citing high labor costs in the U.S."
Kamala Harris Wants States to Get DOJ Permission Before Passing Anti-Abortion Laws,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Gideon Resnick'],05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/kamala-harris-wants-states-to-get-doj-permission-before-passing-anti-abortion-laws,"Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) on Tuesday evening will unveil a new plan, called the Reproductive Rights Act, to stop states from instituting unconstitutional restrictions on abortion.

According to a senior campaign official, the California senator and 2020 presidential candidate will announce during an MSNBC town hall that as president she would implement, for the first time, a pre-clearance requirement for states and localities attempting to restrict women’s reproductive rights.

The plan would go above and beyond codifying the landmark Roe v. Wade decision with federal law by requiring that states and localities with a history of violating the Supreme Court decision obtain approval from Harris’ Department of Justice before any abortion law or practice can take effect.

Under Harris’ plan, states and localities will be subject to the pre-clearance requirement if they have a pattern of violating Roe v. Wade in the preceding 25 years, akin to a requirement in the Voting Rights Act.

According to the Brennan Center for Justice, between 1998 and 2013, 86 proposed election changes to voting rights were blocked with VRA pre-clearance requirements. The Supreme Court’s 2013 Shelby County v. Holder decision effectively neutered pre-clearance and has left Congress to attempt to restore and strengthen parts of the Voting Rights Act through legislation.

Harris’ proposal dictates that any change in a covered jurisdiction will not be enforceable until DOJ determines that it comports with standards of Roe v. Wade and the Women’s Health Protection Act, a Harris-sponsored bill that would ban certain abortion limitations. Guardrails under the plan, like public determinations and required reviews, would ensure DOJ enforcement even under an administration hostile to reproductive rights, the campaign official said, and patients and providers will have the opportunity to sue if the federal agency does not.

“We have to get really serious about the degree to which the Republicans have really targeted women’s access to abortion as their political way of winning of elections,” Laurie Rubiner, former vice president of public policy at Planned Parenthood said, praising the Harris plan. “I do think that the way that she has thought about this is very creative. I really like that what she is saying is ‘we’re going to shift that burden to the state’ especially in places where they have a history of passing these unconstitutional laws,"" she said referring to how it is currently often incumbent upon providers to file suit against state laws now.

Sasha Bruce, Senior Vice President of NARAL Pro-Choice America was also encouraged by the proposal and hoped to see the rest of the field continue to adopt concrete plans.

""Every candidate in this field should know it’s not enough to simply call yourself pro-choice,"" she said in a statement. ""All candidates need to back up their words with a concrete plan for action, especially given the tenuous thread by which reproductive freedom hangs.""

Harris, like many of her Democratic competitors, also wants to nominate judges who uphold the Roe decision, work to repeal the Hyde Amendment (which bars any federal funds from being spent on abortion), and protect providers like Planned Parenthood from defunding.

The senator’s plan comes as as a number of states like Alabama, Georgia, and Missouri have passed restrictive anti-abortion laws in recent weeks."
"Klobuchar, in Iowa, calls for changes to EPA ethanol rules",https://thehill.com,[],05-28-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/445763-klobuchar-in-iowa-calls-for-changes-to-epa-ethanol-rules,"Sen. Amy Klobuchar Amy Jean KlobucharMeghan McCain to Amy Klobuchar: Leave my father 'out of presidential politics' 2020 Democrats jockey over surging college costs Democratic senator says McCain listed off names of dictators during Trump inaugural MORE (D-Minn.), a 2020 presidential candidate, is proposing changes to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) biofuel regulations that could help her win over support in Iowa.

Speaking at a campaign stop over the weekend in Iowa, the country's top corn producer, Klobuchar called for the EPA to give away fewer of its waivers that allow oil refineries to avoid mixing their fuel with ethanol, according to Reuters.

The waivers, aimed at helping small refineries meet fuel standards, exempt some refineries from the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which requires oil refiners to blend ethanol with their gasoline pool or purchase credits from refiners that do.

Smaller refineries with a capacity of less than 75,000 barrels per day can obtain a waiver after proving that complying with the rule could cause financial stress. But ethanol groups and politicians representing corn-producing states have long called for the EPA to reconsider how it grants the waivers.

Klobuchar called the EPA’s waivers “misguided” and said the biofuels trading market is manipulated by financial institutions, according to Reuters.

She called for new compliance standards and oversight, a stance likely to drum up support from ethanol groups and leaders in Iowa, a key battleground state in the 2020 race.

Ethanol makers have long argued that too many companies qualify for waivers and that the process is not transparent. While the Trump administration has voiced support for the ethanol industry’s plea to extend the use of gas mixed with 15 percent ethanol year-round, it has also made extensive use of small refinery waivers. Even major companies like Exxon Mobil Corp received exemptions for certain facilities."

All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

TRI-CITIES (WJHL) - The United States Department of Labor has accepted a letter from the USDA, saying the Forest Service will withdraw from operating Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers (CCC).

According to a release from the U.S. Labor Department, ""this action creates an opportunity to serve a greater number of students at higher performing centers at a lower cost to taxpayers by modernizing and reforming part of the Job Corps program.""

The USDA says the mission for CCCs is to ""train eligible youth, ages 16 to 24 with educational, social and vocational skills, while assisting in the conservation of the Nation's public natural resources.""

A review was performed at all CCCs going over outcome measurements, internal controls, ongoing needs, and other items.

According to the department, 16 centers will continue under a new contract operator or partnership.

Locally, Jacobs Creek CCC will continue to operate in Bristol, Tennessee.

The 16 centers under new management are featured below:

Angell CCC in Yachats, Oregon; Boxelder CCC in Nemo, South Dakota; Centennial CCC in Nampa, Idaho; Collbran CCC in Collbran, Colorado; Columbia Basin CCC in Moses Lake, Washington; Curlew CCC in Curlew, Washington; Great Onyx CCC in Mammoth Cave, Kentucky; Harpers Ferry CCC in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia; Lyndon Johnson CCC in Franklin, North Carolina; Jacobs Creek CCC in Bristol, Tennessee; Mingo CCC in Puxico, Missouri; Pine Ridge CCC in Chadron, Nebraska; Schenck CCC in Pisgah Forest, North Carolina; Trapper Creek CCC in Darby, Montana; Weber Basin CCC in Ogden, Utah; and Wolf Creek CCC in Glide, Oregon.

A Federal Register notice will propose nine CCCs to close. Locally, the Flatwoods CCC in Coeburn, Virginia will be up for deactivation.

The nine CCCs up for deactivation are: Anaconda CCC in Anaconda, Montana; Blackwell CCC in Laona, Wisconsin; Cass CCC in Ozark, Arkansas; Flatwoods CCC in Coeburn, Virginia; Fort Simcoe CCC in White Swan, Washington; Frenchburg CCC in Frenchburg, Kentucky; Oconaluftee CCC in Cherokee, North Carolina; Pine Knot CCC in Pine Knot, Kentucky; and Timber Lake CCC in Estacada, Oregon."
"Edmund Morris, acclaimed presidential biographer of Roosevelt and Reagan, has died at 78",https://www.cbsnews.com,['Brian Pascus'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/edmund-morris-died-acclaimed-biographer-presidents-theodore-roosevelt-ronald-reagan-dead-age-78/,"Edmund Morris, the famed author who wrote acclaimed presidential biographies of Theodore Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan, died Friday in Danbury, Connecticut, according to The New York Times. The cause of death was not disclosed, though The Times did report the 78-year-old was at a hospital following a stroke he suffered Thursday.

Morris was a true master of biographical literature. He won the 1980 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography and the 1980 National Book Award for biography for his first book, ""The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt."" The book was the first in a trilogy of works exploring the 26th president's life, the others being ""Theodore Rex,"" published in 2001 and ""Colonel Roosevelt,"" published in 2010.

(AP Photo/Marty Lederhandler) MARTY LEDERHANDLER

In 1999, he published his most controversial work, ""Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan,"" an authorized biography written in an experimental style. Starting in 1985, Morris had been granted ""fly-on-the-wall"" privileges by the Reagan White House, allowing him to interview the President and First Lady and their children. He wrote the biography to include a fictional Edmund Morris who was added to the narrative as an observer and one of Reagan's childhood friends. Within the book, the fictional Edmund Morris told the story of the 40th president's life from his childhood in Illinois to the White House. While some praised the book, others were not so kind.

Morris was born May 27, 1940 in Nairobi, Kenya, the son of South African parents. He married Sylvia Jukes Morris in 1968. According to the author's Penguin Random House biography page, Morris worked as an advertising copywriter in London before immigrating to the United States in 1968. His other biographies included a work on Ludwig von Beethoven titled ""Beethoven: The Universal Composer"" as well as a collection of essays.

According to The New York Times, he is survived by his wife, a brother, Eric and a sister, Judy Davidowitz."

Bloomberg Environment: ""EPA Curbs Use of 12 Bee-Harming Pesticides"" — ""The Environmental Protection Agency has canceled registration of a dozen pesticides, from a class of chemicals known to harm bees.

""The cancellations are effective as of May 20 for 12 neonicotinoid-based products produced by Syngenta, Valent, and Bayer.

""The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act requires pesticides sold or distributed in the U.S. to be registered by the EPA.

""Under a December settlement agreement linked to an Endangered Species Act challenge by environmental groups, the companies voluntarily agreed to petition EPA to cancel 12 out of 59 products containing the active ingredients clothianidin and thiamethoxam.

""Developed as an alternative to organophosphate and carbamate pesticides, neonicotinoids are chemically related to nicotine, and attack the nervous system of insects.""

Washington Post: ""The Energy 202: EPA blocks a dozen products containing pesticides thought harmful to bees"" — ""The Environmental Protection Agency is pulling from the market a dozen products containing pesticides known to be toxic to a linchpin of the U.S. food system — the honeybee.

""The agency announced Monday it has canceled the registrations of 12 pest-killing products with compounds belonging to a class of chemicals known as neonicotinoids, as part of a legal settlement.

""For years, beekeepers and wildlife conversationalists alike have voiced concern that the widespread use of neonics, as the chemicals are commonly called, is imperiling wild and domesticated bees crucial to pollinating commercial fruit, nut and vegetable crops.""

Department of Homeland Security Detains Miami Activist at Homestead Facility for Migrant Children UPDATED,https://www.miaminewtimes.com,['Brittany Shammas'],05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/homestead-shelter-for-migrant-children-alessandra-mondolfi-detained-by-homeland-security-11181156,"Alessandra Mondolfi was painting hearts on a poster board outside the Homestead child migrant camp last Friday when she spotted a pair of law enforcement officers walking toward her. An artist and activist who's part of a group of protesters maintaining a daily presence outside the facility, Mondolfi was working on a memorial to migrant children who have died in custody. ""Here they come,"" one of the other activists said as the officers approached.

The two men — one in a Department of Homeland Security police uniform, the other in plainclothes — asked Mondolfi her name, then pushed her against a car and cuffed her, she says. They then allegedly put her in the back of a car and questioned her for about an hour, asking, bizarrely, whether she had aliases or a neck tattoo, and if she knew the names of the other protesters. Then, about an hour after first approaching Mondolfi, the officers let her go.

Days later, it's still unclear why she was detained. DHS did not respond to a request for comment. Mondolfi says the Miami-Dade Police Department and, weirdly, the Miami-Dade Schools Police, sent squad cars to the scene. The El Paso Police Department has a warrant out for Mondolfi's arrest over a protest she and other activists held at the U.S. Border Patrol Museum. But why would DHS be involved in a city-level case?

Mondolfi has a theory for why she was detained: It was done to rattle her after months of protesting. She notes it was her group that spotted John Kelly — former Homeland Security chief and White House chief of staff under President Donald Trump — touring the Homestead shelter last month, around the same time congresswomen were being denied entry. Soon after Kelly's visit became public, CBS News confirmed he had joined the board of Caliburn International, the for-profit company that runs the place.

""They are trying to scare me, intimidate me,"" Mondolfi says.

Her detainment comes amidst a series of instances of the government watching and prosecuting protesters. Earlier this year, the Intercept revealed that DHS had monitored anti-family separation protests held across the country, treating them as if they were security threats. A contractor working with the agency reviewed demonstrations across South Florida, from West Palm Beach to Miami. The information was shared with DHS and state-level law enforcement.

Meanwhile, two University of Arizona students were arrested in late March for protesting the appearance of Customs and Border Protection officers. The Arizona Republic reported they were among people who stood outside the event calling the officials “murderers” and “an extension of the KKK.” A group of protesters followed the agents as they left the presentation, calling them ""Murder Patrol."" Anti-Dakota Access Pipeline protesters have also been arrested.

At the Homestead shelter, another protester was detained on April 24. That day, MDPD officers handcuffed a New York man named Joshua Rubin and put him in the back of a squad car. Rubin said the cops told him he was being stopped on suspicion of trespassing. He refused to give them his name, he said, because he was on a county road. Eventually he identified himself and was released. MDPD told New Times it had no record of Rubin's detainment.

""You have to expect, when you're protesting, that people are going to try and get you to go away,"" said Rubin, who for months held a one-man vigil outside a camp for migrant teenagers in Texas. ""But the extent to which it's happening here is more extreme.""

Mondolfi says Homeland Security officers began showing up at the facility several weeks ago. When the two men approached her last Friday, they asked for her ID, but it was in her car. She says she asked to go get it, but instead ended up being questioned in the back of a police car. The MDPD and schools police cars showed up.

Daisy Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for Miami-Dade County Public Schools, tells New Times there is no record of a call for service on that date, and questioned whether a photo provided by protesters was actually taken on the date in question. After publication, she said a school officer responded after the Department of Homeland Security ""put out an emergency call for back-up."" When the officer arrived, the situation had already been handled, so he cleared the incident without taking action. MDPD did not respond to a request for information.

For her part, Mondolfi says she hasn't been back to the shelter since the day she was detained.

""I am not in Homestead; I have not been all week,"" she says. ""I'm not able to do the work that I'm doing. And I am scared, which is all the things they want. They want you to be scared, they want you to be intimidated... and at this point, they're winning, and that's angering me."""
Trump climbs into a sumo ring to present a 60-pound ‘President’s Cup’ in highlight of Japan trip,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Ashley Parker', 'White House Reporter', 'Simon Denyer', 'Tokyo Bureau Chief Covering Japan', 'North Korea', 'South Korea.']",05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-presents-gilded-presidents-cup-to-sumo-champion-in-a-highlight-of-his-japan-trip/2019/05/26/fca43394-7e37-11e9-8bb7-0fc796cf2ec0_story.html,"Finally, after a full day of matches, perhaps the biggest star of all — weighing in at 243 pounds, according to his most recent physical — climbed into the sumo ring.

President Trump stepped into the dohyo shortly after 5:30 p.m. Sunday to present the “President’s Cup” — a roughly 4½ -foot, more than 60-pound trophy that served as a physical manifestation of the gilded, ceremonial nature of Trump’s four-day trip here.

The president seemed to enjoy his low-key star turn at Ryogoku Kokugikan stadium, exclaiming afterward, “That was an incredible evening at sumo.”

“Sumo wrestling,” he marveled later.

[Trump is presenting a sumo trophy in Japan. France beat him to it nearly 20 years ago.]

Trump took in just five matches — some lasting but several seconds — alongside Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Sunday evening. But he spent the morning putting on a show of his own; at roughly 7:30 a.m. local time, the president fired off a tweet that, in a single social media missive, undercut his national security adviser, reaffirmed his ties with a dictator and attacked a domestic political rival on foreign soil, while misspelling the rival’s name.

“North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me,” Trump wrote, in a second tweet that corrected his initial misspelling of former vice president Joe Biden’s last name. “I have confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me, & also smiled when he called Swampman Joe Biden a low IQ individual, & worse. Perhaps that’s sending me a signal?”

Less than a day earlier, Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, had argued the opposite to reporters here, warning there is “no doubt” North Korea’s missile tests violated United Nations Security Council resolutions and adding that Trump was determined to maintain sanctions pressure on the regime until it backs down.

In a conference call with reporters before Trump departed for Japan, a senior administration official had promised a “substantive” trip, with “some substantive things to announce.” But until the president made news with his impromptu tweet Sunday morning, Trump’s appearance at the sumo championship seemed to be one of the main events of his visit.

Indeed, Trump spent his first full day in Japan largely as a tourist. Earlier in the day, the president and Abe had played golf at Mobara Country Club in Chiba — complete with selfies and double cheeseburgers made with U.S. beef — and after the sumo championship, the two leaders and their wives headed for dinner of traditional Japanese grilled fare known as robatayaki. (The menu seemed specifically designed for Trump’s generally bland tastes — a five-course meal that included buttered potatoes, grilled chicken, Wagyu beef with vegetables and vanilla ice cream).

Trump’s planned appearance at the sumo match was relatively restrained for a president who became a household name as a reality TV star and often seems to thrive amid chaos and even encourage it. Gone were his days as a World Wrestling Entertainment personality who, in 2007, clotheslined WWE Chairman Vince McMahon and faux-pounded him, ringside, before shaving him bald in a viral pay-per-view moment.

Instead, Trump entered the sumo ring after donning slippers — no shoes are allowed in the dohyo — and read from a scroll, the “certificate of commemoration” in honor of the 25-year-old victor, Asanoyama.

“In honor of your outstanding achievement as sumo grand champion, I hereby award you the President’s Cup,” Trump said.

A sumo official helped him lift the heavy cup and hand it to Asanoyama, who bowed several times. The president shook his hand, clapped, at one point bowed slightly himself, and exited the ring.

Perhaps the most dramatic moment of Trump’s award presentation came before the president was even onstage; the silver trophy — which features an eagle atop it, wings high, and which was displayed Sunday afternoon to some fanfare in the lobby of the hotel where the president is staying — was brought out draped in white cloth, and the crowd gasped when its covering was removed.

Jaime Tiktin, 54, a tourist from Mexico City, said it was a “strange surprise” to learn that Trump would be attending the sumo match. Tiktin said he read in the Japan Times that the Japanese “kind of made up this prize to make him feel good,” but he noted that Trump seemed subdued.

“He didn’t smile at all; he didn’t do any gestures,” Tiktin said. “It was kind of strange to see him not moving his lips at all.”

Tiktin and his wife — who came bearing a homemade “Viva Mexico” sign — said they are not fans of Trump because of the way he has treated Mexicans, but they added that Trump was apparently trying to abide by sumo protocol. “I think he was being respectful,” Tiktin said. “I hate to say that, but I think he was respectful.”

In the run-up to the sumo championship, Trump prompted some griping among the Japanese. Some were annoyed that he and his wife, Melania, received special treatment and were allowed to sit in chairs close to the ring. Normally, attendees on the lower levels sit on cushions, called zabutons, and VIPs opt for seats on the second floor designed specifically for them. There was also concern the president’s entourage and large security detail would take away seats from Japanese sumo fans.

One widely shared article in the Japanese news media pointed out that the Japan Sumo Association is happy to follow many anachronistic traditions, such as forbidding women from standing in the ring. The article asked rhetorically, “Is not it against their traditions to let Trump sit on a seat by the ring and wear slippers into the ring to present his cup?” (Sumo wrestlers fight barefoot, though slippers were an acceptable alternative to shoes for Trump.)

The zabutons — which spectators often throw into the air to cheer or show their dissatisfaction after a spectacular match — also posed a potential security headache. Sankei, a Japanese daily, even featured a story, complete with a photo of a flying zabuton, headlined, “Mr. Trump to watch the final day matches. Fear of zabuton.”

But in the end, Trump proved more a curiosity than a nuisance, the mere mention of his name almost invariably prompting giggles among the spectators.

“He’s a crazy guy, yeah?” said Ryugo Kato, 45, a Tokyo resident.

Kato said he thought Trump should have sat on the floor if he wanted to be close to the ring. “That’s the way this place is set up,” Kato said. “He should respect the custom. It’s the culture.”

Nonetheless, he also welcomed Trump to the match. “If he wants to come, fine,” Kato said. “There’s nothing wrong with watching the sport and paying some respect to Japan’s national sport.”

Asanoyama, for his part, seemed to be a potential Trump convert. According to Nikkan Sports, in an interview Saturday, the champion said, “I am going to check Wikipedia for Trump-san,” apparently to be better prepared.

By Sunday, asked after his victory about being the first person to receive the “President’s Cup,” Asanoyama was emotional.

“I was overjoyed,” he said. “It was almost too much to say in words.”

47 States Call On Betsy Devos To Forgive Student Loans For Disabled Veterans,https://www.npr.org,['Cat Schuknecht'],05-25-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/25/727002406/47-states-call-on-betsy-devos-to-forgive-student-loans-for-disabled-veterans,"47 States Call On Betsy Devos To Forgive Student Loans For Disabled Veterans

Enlarge this image toggle caption Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images

Updated Sunday at 2:14 p.m. ET

On Friday, three days before Memorial Day, attorneys general for 47 states wrote to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos asking her to automatically forgive student loans for eligible disabled veterans.

The Department of Education has identified more than 42,000 veterans who qualify for a federal program known as Total and Permanent Disability Discharge, or TPD, that offers to relieve borrowers from repaying certain government student loans. These veterans, the letter says, shoulder over $1 billion in education debt that could be forgiven.

To get the benefit, veterans must first apply for the program. According to information obtained by the group Veterans Education Success through a Freedom of Information Act request, almost 60 percent of eligible veterans had defaulted on a loan payment as of April 2018. Yet only about 20 percent had applied to the loan forgiveness program.

The attorneys general want that to change. In the letter — which was also signed by attorneys general for the District of Columbia and three U.S. territories — they propose making the forgiveness program automatic for veterans who have been identified by the Department of Education.

""As a nation, we have a moral obligation to assist those who have put their lives on the line to defend us,"" the letter reads. ""There is no statutory or legal requirement that the Department of Education demand that eligible veterans affirmatively apply for TPD discharges before the Department will forgive their loans.""

In a statement to NPR, the Education Department said it recognized the sacrifices that veterans make for their country, adding that it has worked to streamline the TPD discharge process.

""While we have worked to make this process as easy and as seamless as possible for veterans, the last thing we want to do is cause unintended consequences for them,"" according to the statement.

The department said discharges could raise veterans' tax bills or inhibit them from taking out more student loans.

In their letter to DeVos, the attorneys general dismissed the department's concern about increasing borrowers' tax bills.

""[F]ederal tax law now excludes loan discharges for disabled borrowers from taxable income, and most states' tax codes do likewise,"" said the letter. ""Moreover, we think it likely that most borrowers would prefer to have one hundred percent of their outstanding loans discharged, even if this resulted in an increase to their state tax bill.""

The letter from the attorneys general follows at least two other similar letters that Republican and Democratic members of Congress sent to DeVos last year."
USDA staffers quit en masse as Trump administration eyes moving offices out of DC,https://www.foxnews.com,"[""Andrew O'Reilly""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/usda-staffers-quit-en-masse-as-trump-administration-eyes-moving-offices-out-of-dc,"Employees at the U.S. Department of Agriculture are quitting at a rapid clip as Secretary Sonny Perdue prepares to move forward with plans to relocate two offices far outside the Washington, D.C., Beltway.

Federal employees at the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) – two small but important agencies within the USDA – are unhappy with Perdue’s plan, announced last August, to move the majority of their staff from current offices in the capital to an area closer the country’s agricultural centers.

“This move does not serve a public purpose,” Peter Winch, a representative for the American Federation of Government Employees, a union that represents ERS workers, told Fox News. “Employees don’t want to move, and it doesn’t make sense for them to move.”

US FARMERS HURT BY TRADE WAR GETTING $16 BILLION BOOST, US AGRICULTURE SECRETARY SAYS

Winch added that since ERS employees joined AFGE earlier this month, six employees have already quit their jobs with the government agency in response to the planned move. He said overall staffing is down to 209 from 300 during the Obama administration.

A Washington Post report cited an estimate that the ERS used to see roughly one “non-retirement” departure per month – but that pace has doubled since October. NIFA reportedly has also seen people leave.

Perdue said in a statement to Fox News that the move was meant “to improve performance and the services these agencies provide.” The secretary of agriculture added that the planned move would bring the department’s scientists closer to “stakeholders” and “customers” such as Midwest farmers.

“It’s been our goal to make USDA the most effective, efficient, and customer-focused department in the entire federal government,” Perdue said. “We don’t undertake these relocations lightly, and we are doing it to improve performance and the services these agencies provide.”

Perdue added: “We will be placing important USDA resources closer to many stakeholders, most of whom live and work far from Washington, D.C. We will be saving money for the taxpayers and improving our ability to retain more employees in the long run.”

The goal of the ERS, however, is to provide statistical information to lawmakers in Washington, while NIFA works to fund hundreds of millions of dollar annually in research in the agricultural sector.

HISTORIC FLOODS IN MIDWEST HAVE FARMERS WORRIED ABOUT THEIR FUTURE

Congressional Democrats are scrambling to try and block the move.

“This parochial idea of, like, ‘Washington messes everything up. Let’s move it out of town’ overlooks the important role that this agency plays,” Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-Maine, a member of the House Agriculture Committee, told The Washington Post. “There’s just a heightened level of concern about this administration, generally, about data collection and science.”

Critics, including former USDA officials, say the move would weaken the agencies, reduce their influence with lawmakers and provide little benefit to the farming community.

Winch argued that weakening the agencies' influence in Washington is at least part of the point. The NIFA funds grants that go into researching the effects the agriculture sector has on climate change – which the Trump administration has tried to downplay – and Perdue was allegedly upset by NIFA’s policy to support LGBT members of the 4-H youth farming organization.

The president’s 2020 budget has also proposed slashing funding to ERS research from $87 million to $61 million and cutting 160 jobs, while Perdue has suggested moving the agency from under the USDA’s science arm to being supervised by the USDA’s chief economist, a political wing of the department.

“There is some sort of punitive motivation,” Winch said. “Someone has made a negative judgment about these agencies.”

Perdue and his staff have narrowed the list of places where the two agencies could go down to three from an original 130 -- with Kansas City, the state of Indiana and North Carolina’s research triangle in the Raleigh-Durham area on the shortlist. St. Louis, Mo., and Madison, Wis., are two alternate locations.

Perdue is expected to make the announcement of where the agencies will move as soon as Friday, but it remains unclear whether the two agencies will actually leave Washington.

The USDA’s own inspector general is currently looking into whether Perdue has the legal authority to move these agencies, while the House Appropriations Committee’s draft bill of agricultural appropriations, which was released earlier this week, prohibits the USDA from using funds to move agencies outside of the Washington area. Trump’s 2020 budget proposal wants $15.5 million to relocate ERS and $9.5 million to relocate NIFA.

“We continue to believe that the USDA lacks the legal authority to carry out this proposal,” Rep. Steny H. Hoyer, D-Md., and Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., said in a statement earlier this spring. “However, even if it had such authority, USDA has not done the proper analysis of the cost and benefits, and this proposal will harm agriculture research and our constituents.”"

''We are pleased to be selected by the DoD to provide vehicle recognition systems. Our systems are easy to integrate and highly scalable, making them an ideal solution to enhance security and surveillance operations,'' said Robert A. Berman, President and CEO of Rekor. ''Selection by the world's preeminent defense department is a great validation of our technology and one we are proud of. We look forward to working with the DoD to support their important work, and to further showcase the power of our solutions.''

Rekor's OpenALPR software enables automatic license plate and vehicle recognition through virtually any IP camera. Its industry-leading artificial intelligence-based solutions can be hosted locally or in the cloud. Enabled by machine learning from its robust and growing database covering over 60 countries, OpenALPR software can identify in real time vehicle license plate data, color, make, model and body type.

Rather than buying expensive cameras that take weeks or months to ship and install, Rekor's OpenALPR software can be deployed to any existing IP camera immediately. This can represent a potential substantial savings per camera, as well as greater flexibility to expand or decrease usage as needed without large capital expenditures on hardware. It also eliminates the need for two separate cameras, one for LPR functionality and one for general surveillance recording. Rekor's solution can be used to collect license plate data and information such as the make, model, and color of a vehicle using the same camera that provides surveillance monitoring.

''The fact that Rekor's solution can be deployed to any existing IP camera is extremely attractive in the defense sector, particularly where cameras may already be set up for surveillance and the installation of new hardware might prove difficult due to time constraints or location in harsh or remote terrains,'' Berman continued. ''The flexibility of our SaaS model also allows for the easy integration of additional cameras if they are needed in a hurry, rather than having to wait for hardware to be shipped and installed. It provides valuable new capabilities within the defense sector.''

Trade War Sparks Fears of China Weaponizing U.S. Treasuries,https://www.ozy.com,['Joe Rennison'],,,,https://www.ozy.com/fast-forward/trade-war-sparks-fears-of-china-weaponizing-us-treasuries/94604,"Beijing’s recent sales of securities are triggering concerns that it might dump U.S. securities for leverage in the ongoing spat with Washington.

It was an unnerving piece of data for investors two weeks back, buried halfway down an esoteric spreadsheet released by the U.S. government that tracks how many Treasuries foreign investors buy and sell. China, the largest foreign creditor to the U.S. government with total Treasury holdings in excess of $1.2 trillion, sold $20 billion of securities with a maturity exceeding one year in March, according to U.S. government data. The sales amounted to China’s largest retreat from the market in more than two years.

The move came shortly before tensions over trade between Beijing and Washington heated up again, with the U.S. slapping additional tariffs on the country’s imports, and Chinese officials retaliating with measures of their own. What’s more, the sales could not be explained away by the typical ebb and flow of China’s Treasury holdings that result from managing its large reserves to keep the currency stable.

If China starts dumping its Treasuries, it would cause huge financial instability. Mark Sobel, former Treasury Department official

The data reignited fears that Beijing may weaponize its holdings as part of the trade war, wreaking havoc with the biggest bond market in the world, pushing interest rates higher and increasing the U.S. government’s cost of borrowing.

“If China starts dumping its Treasuries, it would cause huge financial instability,” says Mark Sobel, a former Treasury Department official who spent nearly four decades at the agency, adding that he considered this an unlikely scenario.

China’s holdings of Treasuries are inextricably linked to the country’s trade with the U.S. China receives dollars in payment for its exports to America, and then needs to invest that money somewhere. The Treasury market has long been China’s destination of choice because the market is not only big enough to host its enormous reserves but it also offers a better return than other supersafe investments. Moreover, China avoids currency fluctuations that could come from selling those dollars to buy other assets.

As a result, China’s Treasury holdings typically dip if its reserves fall. It has also sold Treasuries over the past year to support its beaten-down currency, as tariff talk has intensified. On this occasion, though, neither of those forces appears to have been a factor. To some analysts, it seems as though China simply decided to sell.

“One should take notice of a month of sales during a period when reserves appear to be stable by most indicators,” says Brad Setser, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and a former Treasury Department official. “It is certainly something that warrants attention.”

While concerns are mounting, investors and analysts are wary of jumping to conclusions. Setser cautioned that the March data is a snapshot and not yet a trend. Moreover, few see any alternative for China, other than remaining invested in Treasuries. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield is currently 2.42 percent, well above the negative yields on equivalent German and Japanese sovereign bonds and still markedly higher than the 1.03 percent offered on 10-year gilts in the U.K. Other markets are also much smaller than the U.S. Treasury market, meaning they would struggle to digest any inflows from China’s massive holdings.

“Even if this were to be a threat, it’s a very noncredible one,” says Sonal Desai, chief investment officer for fixed income at Franklin Templeton in California. “What else [is China] going to buy?”

Meanwhile, there are few signs that recent bouts of selling by China have pushed U.S. interest rates higher. In the second half of 2011, China ramped up its sales of Treasuries but interest rates dropped too. The 10-year Treasury yield tumbled from a peak of 3.74 percent earlier in the year to 1.88 percent by the year-end, amid a general bout of risk aversion caused by Europe’s sovereign debt crisis.

In 2016, China sought to prop up its currency and sold a net $160 billion of long-term Treasuries, with its holdings hitting the lowest since 2010 in November that year. Ten-year interest rates did rise in the U.S. — from 2.30 percent to 2.44 percent over the course of the year — but that seemed spurred primarily by the election of President Donald Trump, which brought renewed hopes of growth for the economy.

In March this year, during the latest round of selling, the 10-year Treasury yield slipped 30 basis points over the month to 2.41 percent.

Still, few disagree that if China wanted to cause an upset in U.S. interest rates by heavy selling of Treasuries, it probably could. The catch is that it would lead to a revaluation of the country’s own U.S. bonds as it sold.

“China selling its Treasury holdings is a nuclear option, because it will hurt their own portfolio,” says Shawn Matthews, a former Cantor Fitzgerald trading head who launched his own hedge fund, Hondius Capital Management, last year.

“It depends on what the goal is,” says Torsten Slok, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York. “If the goal is to disturb the U.S. Treasury market, then they may not care about inflicting self-harm.”"

Among the charges are three counts that Assange violated the Espionage Act, which prohibits the disclosure of national defense information. | Jack Taylor/Getty Images legal DOJ accuses Assange of violating Espionage Act

The Justice Department has hit WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange with Espionage Act charges, escalating a legal fight against the high-profile activist and alarming press freedom activists.

DOJ had previously only indicted Assange on a single count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. Thursday’s revelation of the additional 18 charges, filed in the Eastern District of Virginia, means Assange could face significantly more prison time if found guilty.

Story Continued Below

The alleged Espionage Act violations relate to Assange’s complicity with Chelsea Manning, a former U.S. Army soldier who was convicted in July 2013 of violating the Espionage Act after she shuttled troves of classified government information to WikiLeaks. Officials said Assange solicited the information from and then brazenly published details that put the government's human sources at risk, disregarding explicit warnings from the government.

Traditionally, the Espionage Act has been used against government officials, like Manning, who reveal such classified information, rather than the journalists or foreign nationals who publish the information.

As a result, the use of the Espionage Act against Assange set off alarm bells among press freedom activists on Thursday. While WikiLeaks isn’t a conventional news organization, press advocates have long feared that charging Assange for the publication of government secrets could open the door to prosecuting reporters for doing the same.

""Any government use of the Espionage Act to criminalize the receipt and publication of classified information poses a dire threat to journalists seeking to publish such information in the public interest, irrespective of the Justice Department’s assertion that Assange is not a journalist,"" said Bruce Brown, executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, in a statement.

Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who also touched off a debate about the media's role in publishing secret files when he leaked classified information to reporters in 2013, proclaimed: “the Department of Justice just declared war – not on Wikileaks, but on journalism itself.”

John Demers, head of DOJ’s national security division, pushed back at that argument on Thursday, insisting Assange is “not a journalist,” and alleging that the WikiLeaks founder “purposely published names he knew to be confidential human sources in warzones.”

It's a debate that Justice Department officials have grappled with for years. The Obama administration previously looked into bringing similar charges against Assange, but decided against it.

“We didn’t bring this [Espionage Act] case for a couple of reasons,"" said Matt Miller, an Obama-era DOJ spokesman. ""First, we thought it was a dangerous precedent to prosecute Assange for something that reporters do all the time. We didn’t believe Assange was a journalist, but the Espionage Act doesn’t make any distinction between journalists and others, so if you can apply it to Assange, there’s no real reason you couldn’t apply it to [The New York Times]. Second, and it’s related, it’s not at all clear that charging someone with the publication of classified information could survive court scrutiny.”

Assange’s legal case took off in April after Ecuador revoked its seven-year asylum, forcing him out of the embassy in London and paving the way for his extradition to the United States for one of the biggest ever leaks of classified information. Justice Department officials said they could not comment on how this might affect Assange’s extradition from the U.K. to the U.S.

Among Thursday's charges are three counts that Assange violated the Espionage Act, which prohibits the disclosure of national defense information. The Justice Department alleged that Assange published select State Department cables that contained the unredacted names of human sources in Iran, China and Syria. He also published Afghan activity reports and Iraq activity reports that endangered local Afghans and Iraqis, prosecutors alleged.

“It was explicitly stated in the State Department cables that the identity of sources was to be protected,” a Justice Department official told reporters on Thursday. “Assange was warned by the State Department not to release the names but he did so nevertheless.”

However, the government has not identified any individuals who were directly killed a result of Assange's disclosures. The U.S. counterintelligence official who led the Pentagon's review of the bombshell leaks told a court during Manning’s sentencing hearing in 2013 that investigators had not been able to find any such instances.

Still, Zach Terwilliger, the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, stressed that the government was “not charging Assange for passively obtaining classified information.” Rather, he is being prosecuted for publishing “a narrow set of classified documents in which Assange also published the names of innocent people who risked their safety” to help the United States.

“Assange is not charged simply because he is a publisher,” Terwilliger told reporters on Thursday.

Prosecutors said Manning had contacted Assange as early as November 2009, responding ""to Assange’s solicitation of classified information made through the WikiLeaks website."" The appeal included a “Military and Intelligence Most Wanted Leaks” category that solicited CIA detainee interrogation videos.

Assange also encouraged Manning to transfer him Guantanamo Bay detainee assessment briefs in March 2010, according to chats obtained by the government, as well as Iraq rule of engagement files and 75,000 Afghanistan war-related significant activity reports.

John Brown, the FBI assistant director for counterintelligence, said the indictment was “the result of nearly a decade” of work.

The original Assange indictment, brought in March 2018 and unsealed in April of this year, charged the WikiLeaks founder with conspiring with Manning to hack a government computer to obtain hundreds of thousands of U.S. military reports about U.S. wars in the Middle East. WikiLeaks later published the leaked information.

Assange faces up to 10 years in prison on each count.

Manning was jailed in March after being held in contempt by a judge in Virginia for refusing to testify before a grand jury about Assange. She is still in prison, and DOJ officials would not comment on her situation on Thursday.

USDA to shift some inspector tasks to pork plant workers — in everything but name,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Kimberly Kindy', 'National Investigative Reporter', 'Kimberly Kindy Is A National Investigative Reporter For The Washington Post.

The Agriculture Department is attempting to make the most dramatic changes to federal meat-inspection policy since Congress passed a 1906 landmark law that seized control of food safety from plant owners and made it the province of federal inspectors. (Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News)

At a Smithfield hog plant in central Illinois, federal meat inspectors examine pig carcasses on the slaughter line, remove diseased and contaminated meat, and mark it “condemned.” They have the exclusive responsibility for performing this work.

At another hog plant about 75 miles away, JBS USA Food Co. employees are part of a long-running test program in which they perform tasks similar to those done by federal inspectors. When plant employees do this food safety work, the U.S. Department of Agriculture says they are “sorting” and “removing” or “disposing” of the meat, not inspecting or condemning it.

The shift in language is central to the USDA’s efforts to make the most dramatic changes to federal meat-inspection policy since Congress passed a 1906 landmark law that seized control of food safety from plant owners and made it the province of federal inspectors.

The proposed new inspection system transfers some responsibilities that traditionally have been handled by USDA inspectors to employees of pork plants. The USDA says it has studied the new inspection system for 20 years and that pork products from the test plants are at least as safe as those produced by traditional inspection. They say federal inspectors will spend less time visually assessing pork and more time ensuring sanitary conditions are maintained throughout the plant.

Several food safety lawyers, Democratic members of Congress and a former agriculture official say that the USDA is using sleight-of-hand tactics to get around legal mandates that have been in place for more than a century. Those mandates require federal regulators to inspect — and either pass or condemn — every live hog that arrives at a slaughterhouse and every hog carcass on the slaughter line.

“They are playing these linguistics games,” said Rena Steinzor, a food safety expert who teaches law at the University of Maryland. “What they are doing is illegal. If they have a problem with the statute because they think it’s a waste of energy for federal inspectors to eyeball every single animal, they could go to Congress. . . . The Constitution requires them to do that, not gut the law by regulation.”

The test hog-inspection program is expected to expand this summer after the agency approves new rules. Certain pork plants would have the option of using the new inspection system. Thirty-five plants plan to join the five test plants in using the new program; they would produce 90 percent of the pork consumed in the United States.

The number of federal inspectors on hog slaughter lines at the plants new to the program will be reduced from 365 to 218, a 40 percent cut, according to a USDA analysis published in the Federal Register. The overall number of inspectors at those plants will drop from 400 to 288, a decline of 28 percent, according to figures provided by the USDA.

The new rules will allow slaughter-line speeds to run as fast as the plant desires. The current cap on line speed is 1,106 hogs per hour, or 18 per minute.

Records show there have been no serious public health problems or pork food poisoning outbreaks linked to the test plants. Critics of the test plants say they have more food safety problems than the traditional plants; the USDA disputes that.

A half-dozen food safety groups, along with the USDA inspectors’ union, say they are concerned that increased line speeds and federal staff reductions on those lines will cause diseased and contaminated meat to slip by the remaining inspectors. They also cite an inherent conflict of interest among plant employees because they work for pork producers and not the public. Training for those workers, they point out, is also done entirely at the plant owners’ discretion.

Pat Basu, a former chief veterinarian for the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) who retired in 2018, is critical of the proposed regulation. He says the agency is using semantic tricks as it reassigns duties to plant employees that the law says inspectors should perform.

“These are word games they are playing,” Basu said. “What they are really doing is removing hogs that are diseased and contaminated. Why are these suddenly not inspections?”

USDA officials say that they are modernizing the inspection process and that the new system will not violate existing laws and regulations. They say the agency has the authority to change how federal inspections are performed so long as a carcass-by-carcass inspection is performed on all of the hogs presented by the plant as fit for human consumption.

“In the proposed rules, we are just giving the plant employees the opportunity to more fully execute their [food safety] plan before we make that final verification that the product is safe,” said Phil Bronstein, an assistant administrator with the FSIS.

Bronstein acknowledged that under the proposed rules, the number of USDA inspectors on the slaughter line in most large plants will be reduced from seven to three. Bronstein said the remaining inspectors would be more experienced and have a higher level of training. Also, the number of USDA inspectors who will roam large plants to ensure sanitation procedures are in place and to check on animal welfare will grow from one to two, officials said.

At least 17 members of Congress, all Democrats, have stated their opposition to the new system. “It is appalling to watch the Trump Administration and [USDA] leadership justify their gutting of hog slaughter inspections with meaningless technicalities and semantics,” Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.), vice chair of the House Agriculture Appropriations Committee and chair of the Food Safety Caucus, said in a statement to The Washington Post.

“Who do they think they are fooling? This giveaway to corporate special interests means company-based employees will carry out responsibilities that are currently performed by government inspectors.”

Defining inspection

In addition to the term “condemnation,” other transferred tasks have also been given different names under the proposed new program, records show.

For example, when plant workers have examined a hog’s head and internal organs, looking for and removing signs of disease and contamination, they have “trimmed dressing defects and contamination, and identified pathology defects on the carcasses,” the proposed regulation says. They have not inspected the animal, the USDA says.

“The agency has trivialized what we have done and what we do by calling it sorting and other consumer protections,” said Charles “Stan” Painter, chairman of the National Joint Council of Food Inspection Locals, which represents inspectors. “The plant workers are clearly expected to do food safety inspections.” Painter said that given the increased role plant workers will have on slaughter lines, he believes federal inspectors are “now nothing more than window dressing at the end of the line.”

The USDA has long used different terminology for the same tasks, depending on whether they were performed by federal inspectors or employees in the test plants. But it has become more steadfast in asserting the need for others to adopt its language, and the proposed new inspection system has focused attention on the matter.

The proposed regulation emphasizes that plant employees’ primary jobs involve “non-food safety standards concerned primarily with diseases of no public health significance.”

However, records show that nearly every transferred task involves food safety issues. For example, when plant workers are removing defects, such as blemishes, from a carcass, they might also trim abscesses that could be a sign of a serious disease or trim spots with fecal contamination that may contain dangerous pathogens.

When they remove internal organs and examine them, they are looking for signs of disease such as septicemia, which would mean the entire carcass could be filled with harmful bacteria.

[After outcry, USDA will no longer require scientists to label research ‘preliminary’]

“They are, in a sense, performing part of the inspection process, doing a pre-screening,” said Daniel Kovich, director of science and technology with the National Pork Producers Council. “Yes, they are looking at it, and they are supposed to move things from the line that are not supposed to pass inspection. But only FSIS can inspect an animal.”

In an interview, USDA officials acknowledged that many of the tasks handled by plant workers would be related to food safety but said they are not inspections.

Although there is no cap on how fast line speeds may run, the USDA anticipates about a 12.5 percent increase at the large plants under the new system, records show.

Zach Corrigan, an attorney with the nonprofit advocacy group Food & Water Watch, said that means the fewer remaining inspectors would need to examine an average of 6.1 heads per minute versus about 2.7 heads per minute in the traditional system.

Corrigan said the new system places a heavy burden on the USDA inspectors who remain on the line and must inspect every carcass. He said the new system will sometimes make it impossible for the USDA to comply with the law.

“The definition of inspection is a ‘critical appraisal,’ ” said Corrigan, citing a 2000 court case that dealt with USDA inspections. “That legal threshold cannot be met when you remove inspectors from the lines and you increase the line speeds.” He called the USDA’s varying terms for the same food safety tasks “Orwellian doublespeak.”

The USDA said a 2002 legal ruling found that the hog test program did not violate the Federal Meat Inspection Act. However, that court decision was limited to the test program and said it “may not necessarily foreshadow the outcome of judicial review of such future regulations.”

The USDA says only a federal inspector or veterinarian has the power to place the department’s mark of inspection on the pork — under the traditional and the alternative new system.

The department also says the word “inspection” is a technical term and can be applied only to situations in which a USDA inspector or veterinarian has performed a food safety oversight task. At meat plants, veterinarians are typically the highest-ranking federal official.

In response to a recent Washington Post article that said the proposed rules would shift much of the power and responsibility for food safety inspections at hog plants to plant employees, the USDA wrote: “By law, only federal inspection personnel conduct inspections of animals, carcasses and parts — and USDA inspection personnel inspect every carcass and part before it leaves the slaughterhouse and processing plant.”

However, inside the test pork plants, USDA inspectors use the term “inspector” — as in “TS [trimming and sorting] inspector” — to refer to their plant employee counterparts. For example, in a 2013 citation for a food safety violation, a USDA inspector said a diseased hog had “passed all three of your TS inspectors” without them spotting the problem, and the carcass had to be condemned.

And in job advertisements, owners of the test pork plants consistently call some employees inspectors or use the word inspector in job descriptions. In a recent job posting by JBS, “quality control inspector” was used as a job title, and it said tasks include performing “various quality control functions including but not limited to line inspection, audits.” JBS did not respond to several requests for comment.

Spotting problems

Five USDA inspectors said in sworn affidavits, taken by the nonprofit Government Accountability Project, that plant workers routinely miss problems in the test plants that they believe are potential food hazards.

They also said plant workers aren’t in a position to stand up to plant supervisors when they do spot problems.

“On numerous occasions, I witnessed them fail to spot abscesses, lesions, fecal matter and other defects that would render an animal unsafe or unwholesome,” said one inspector, who was not named. “Furthermore, plant inspectors don’t actually want to shut off the line to deal with the problems they spot on the job. . . . Obviously their employer will terminate them if they do it too many times.”

Outside evaluations of the test plants have exposed problems. The most recent review was done in 2018 by Food & Water Watch. In its assessment, the group compared USDA inspection reports from the five test plants with those of five comparably sized traditional plants.

The group received copies of citations from 2013 to 2016 through a Freedom of Information Act request. In all, more than 3,500 citations were issued by USDA inspectors to the 10 plants. Food & Water Watch determined that 73 percent of citations issued for a carcass contaminated with feces, bile, hair or dirt were at the five test plants.

In the five test plants, 32 citations were issued after inspectors spotted carcasses that were “so infected that consumption of the meat may cause food poisoning.” Five comparably sized traditional hog plants received no citations for this offense, which is considered to be one of the most serious food safety violations because it can lead to possible recalls and food-poisoning outbreaks.

Carmen Rottenberg, who runs the FSIS, said the evaluation was not a meaningful comparison. She said citations to the test plants were higher because plant workers had assumed more responsibilities. When they fail to properly perform these new jobs, she said, the plants are then cited for those failures.

“We are holding the plants accountable for a lot more tasks,” Rottenberg said.

[Pork industry soon will have more power over meat inspections]

Inspection reports illustrate some of the problems USDA inspectors found with the work done by plant employees.

At one test pork plant in Michigan, employees assigned to remove sick and diseased live hogs overlooked one that had collapsed and died, then presented it to USDA inspectors as fit for slaughter.

At an Illinois test plant, its workers failed to identify more than a dozen abscesses in the internal organs of a slaughtered hog — a clear sign that the entire carcass was contaminated with dangerous bacteria.

And in Minnesota, employees at a test plant overlooked patches of yellow and green material on the chest wall and hindquarters of a hog carcass. It was fecal matter that could have contained dangerous pathogens.

The Food & Water Watch evaluation followed two independent government audits of the test program that were critical of the alternative inspection system. In 2013, the USDA’s inspector general found that three of the five test plants were among the worst in the nation for food safety and sanitary problems. Also in 2013, the Government Accountability Office raised food safety concerns due to the faster line speeds in those plants.

In the USDA’s self assessment the following year, the agency said its data showed the test plants “are performing as well as comparable large [traditional] market hog establishments and are meeting FSIS expectations.”

Rep. Marcy Kaptur (Ohio) and 16 other Democratic lawmakers opposed to the new inspection system asked the USDA inspector general’s office last month to investigate whether the department properly disclosed data on worker safety during the public review and comment period for the proposed regulations.

In a statement to The Post, Kaptur cited Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data that say 1 in 6 Americans get sick and 3,000 die because of foodborne diseases each year: “If we are to improve those numbers, we cannot hand over the integrity of inspections to an industry focused more on profit and less on human and animal welfare.”"

WASHINGTON — Newly released emails show that Environmental Protection Agency scientists raised strong objections to a 2018 decision by Scott Pruitt, who was head of the agency at the time, to exempt most of southeastern Wisconsin from federal limits on smog.

The decision by Mr. Pruitt was notable because it came as Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, was campaigning for a third term and trying to bring a Foxconn factory, and thousands of new manufacturing jobs, to a part of the state where pollution levels already exceeded federal limits.

Mr. Walker ultimately lost his re-election bid to Tony Evers, a Democrat. And Foxconn , the Taiwanese consumer electronics giant, announced in January that it was reconsidering its plan to build a $10 billion plant in Wisconsin, though the company later said it would build a smaller factory in the state.

But, in spring 2018, as the governor’s race was heating up, Mr. Walker championed the Foxconn deal and the 13,000 jobs it promised to create. The factory, however, also threatened to create a new source of pollution in the region."

For those who enjoy heading south of the border for vacations, the U.S. Department of State has updated travel warnings for Mexican states where tourists are more vulnerable to crime.

Ahead of Memorial Day weekend, the Mexican state of Tamaulipas - which borders south Texas - is on the list of Do Not Travel states because of high crime and possible kidnapping.

Violent crime, such as murder, armed robbery, carjacking, kidnapping, extortion, and sexual assault, is common in the state.

The first quarter of 2019 set a new record for homicides in Mexico, where violent crime has claimed more than 250,000 lives since 2006, according to the Associated press.

The State Department cautioned people on where not to go and also offered tips on how to avoid becoming a victim.

The Mexico Travel Advisory is divided into four levels of caution from the least dangerous – the ""exercise normal precautions"" list, to the most dangerous – the ""do not travel"" list.

Trump moves to escalate investigation of intel agencies,https://www.sltrib.com,"['Zeke Miller', 'Eric Tucker']",05-24-2019,2019,5,https://www.sltrib.com/news/nation-world/2019/05/24/trump-moves-escalate/,"Washington • President Donald Trump directed the U.S. intelligence community on Thursday to “quickly and fully cooperate” with Attorney General William Barr’s investigation of the origins of the multi-year probe of whether his 2016 campaign colluded with Russia, granting a loyalist sweeping powers to review and potentially release highly classified information.

The move marked an escalation in Trump’s efforts to “investigate the investigators,” as he continues to try to undermine the findings of special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe amid mounting Democratic calls to bring impeachment proceedings against Trump.

Press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement that Trump is delegating to Barr the ""full and complete authority"" to declassify documents relating to the probe, which would ease his efforts to review the sensitive intelligence underpinnings of the investigation. Such an action could create fresh tensions within the FBI and other intelligence agencies, which have historically resisted such demands.

Barr has already asked John Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, to examine the origins of the Russia investigation to determine whether intelligence and surveillance methods used during the probe were lawful and appropriate. Still, Barr has been directly involved, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to discuss it publicly, and is also working with CIA Director Gina Haspel, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and FBI Director Christopher Wray.

Trump is giving Barr a new tool in his investigation, empowering his attorney general to unilaterally unseal documents that the Justice Department has historically regarded as among its most highly secret. Warrants obtained from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, for instance, are not made public — not even to the person on whom the surveillance was authorized.

Trump explicitly delegated Barr with declassification power — noting it would not automatically extend to another attorney general — and only for use in the review of the Russia investigation. Before using the new authority, Barr should consult with intelligence officials ""to the extent he deems it practicable,"" Trump wrote in a memo formalizing the matter.

Trump has frequently claimed his campaign was the victim of ""spying,"" though the intelligence community has insisted it acted lawfully in following leads in the Russia investigation and conducted surveillance under court order.

Wray vocally opposed the release by Congress last year of details from a secret surveillance warrant obtained by the bureau on a former campaign adviser, Carter Page. The White House had eagerly encouraged Republicans on the House intelligence committee to disclose that classified information, believing it could help undermine the Russia investigation.

Wray, though cooperating with Barr in a review of the origins of the Russia probe, would presumably balk at declassifying classified information that could reveal sensitive sources or methods of investigators.

Despite Mueller finding no evidence to support criminal charges against Americans related to Russia's actions, his report documented extensive Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 campaign and willingness on the part of some in Trump's orbit to accept their aid.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff accused Trump and Barr of trying to ""conspire to weaponize law enforcement and classified information against their political enemies.""

“The coverup has entered a new and dangerous phase,” Schiff said in a statement released late Thursday. “This is un-American.”

Thursday's move further solidifies Barr's position in Trump's eyes as a legal warrior on fighting on his behalf.

After Mueller submitted his report to Barr in March, the attorney general released a four-page summary to Congress. Barr's letter framed the debate about the probe over the next few weeks and, White House officials believe, allowed Trump to declare victory before the release of the full report, the contents of which are far more ambiguous.

Trump also appreciated Barr's combative stance with lawmakers and reporters as he defended the Justice Department's handling of the report, and again when he declined to appear before Congress and defied a subpoena, drawing a possible contempt charge. Trump has told close confidants that he ""finally"" had ""my attorney general,"" according to two Republicans close to the White House who were not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations.

""Today's action will help ensure that all Americans learn the truth about the events that occurred, and the actions that were taken, during the last Presidential election and will restore confidence in our public institutions,"" Sanders said.

Two of Trump’s congressional allies, Reps. Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan, were seen by reporters earlier Thursday at the Justice Department.

"Arkansas housing authorities in pot quandary; they weigh tenants’ use in situation where state, federal laws at odds",https://www.arkansasonline.com,['Ginny Monk'],05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2019/may/26/housing-authorities-in-pot-quandary-201/,"About 70 people were in line outside Green Springs Medical, a marijuana dispensary on Seneca Street in Hot Springs, when it opened after 8 a.m. on May 13. The dispensary was one of two to open in the state over the weekend; the other, Doctor’s Orders RX, also is in Garland County. - Photo by Richard Rasmussen

Many Arkansas housing authority officials hadn't developed policies on what to do about medical marijuana when the first ounces were sold earlier this month.

Although medical marijuana is legal in 33 states, including Arkansas, it's still a Schedule 1 drug under federal law. The collision of state and federal law means local housing officials must decide whether to evict residents who use cannabis, even if the residents have state-issued medical marijuana cards.

The issue has been debated nationwide for years as various states have legalized medical marijuana. Conflicting policy has resulted in evictions of some and denial of rental assistance for others.

The Hot Springs Housing Authority has banned use of the drug.

""Until we hear something from HUD, it's still illegal,"" said Richard Herrington, the agency's executive director, referring to the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Both of the state's currently operating medical cannabis dispensaries are in Hot Springs. There are 30 more dispensaries across the state yet to open.

Other housing authority officials plan to consider each request for use on a case-by-case basis, and some haven't developed any policies on the matter.

[RELATED: Complete Democrat-Gazette coverage of medical marijuana in Arkansas]

At the Texarkana Housing Authority, executive director Dub Wingfield says his agency will likely take an approach to medical marijuana different from the Hot Springs agency, although the board hasn't addressed the subject yet. He said two authority members have been unavailable because of work responsibilities and illness for the past two months, but he's hopeful the authority will address a medical marijuana policy at its next meeting.

""We don't have anything in place at this time for medical marijuana,"" Wingfield said. ""Government regulation says that any narcotics are not allowed on public housing, so it is a question. But if you have a medical need for it, I would think that we would probably be compliant with that issue.""

HUD's official stance is that residents of public housing, about 20 percent of whom are disabled, aren't allowed to use cannabis, even for medicinal purposes.

""From the federal point of view, marijuana remains a controlled substance and is illegal,"" said Patricia Campbell, a HUD regional public affairs officer.

HUD put out a memo in 2014 and two in 2011 on the topic but hasn't issued any guidance to local-level authorities since. HUD officials in Washington, D.C., sent the 2014 memo to directors of multifamily housing programs.

Its directives make it clear that public housing agencies can't accept new applicants who are taking medical marijuana, said David Gates, Arkansas' chapter president for the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials. The group advocates for ""adequate and affordable housing and strong, viable communities,"" according to its website.

Gates, who is also the executive director at the Lonoke County Housing Authority, said that when voters passed the state's medical marijuana constitutional amendment in 2016, association members began talking about what to do.

The association hasn't taken a stance on medical marijuana, he said.

Gates added that while he sees a potential for conflict with residents who have medical marijuana cards, that problem hasn't arisen in the weeks since the two Hot Springs dispensaries opened.

One 52-year-old woman in Northwest Arkansas, who has a Section 8 voucher for her housing, said she has a medical marijuana card, but because she lives in government-assisted housing, there isn't a way for her to use the drug. It's the only thing that keeps the pain from injuries related to past abuse as well as scoliosis and fibromyalgia, among other ailments, at bay, she said.

Her income comes from Social Security because she is disabled, she said.

The woman, who spoke to the newspaper on the condition of anonymity because she fears eviction, said the ban on marijuana was included in a ban on smoking at HUD properties in a document sent to residents earlier this year. She refused to sign the document, which requires tenants to smoke tobacco or any other product at least 25 feet away from their homes.

For her, that means either smoking the medical marijuana in public, which isn't allowed under state regulations, or on someone else's property.

""Their rules require us to BREAK the rules we agreed to as patients,"" she said via text message. ""I can literally lose ALL federal assistance ... I'm unable to work ... so that leaves a lot of us homeless and destitute.""

Herrington said that while no medical marijuana will be allowed for Hot Springs tenants, no matter what program they are in, officials don't drug-test residents and won't ""go in their units and go through their personal things.""

The Hot Springs Housing Authority provides rental assistance to just over 1,000 low-income people.

""It's still an eviction issue,"" he said ""It's a termination issue from the program, so HUD's going to have to make a decision on what they want, but right now we tell people if you take it ... we don't do drug tests on residents.""

The drug policy of Little Rock's Metropolitan Housing Alliance bans all residents from ""engaging in illegal use of a drug."" The policy doesn't specifically mention marijuana. The alliance is the largest housing authority in the state and serves about 8,000 people.

The policy refers to HUD regulations that deny admission to applicants and require removal of tenants from the housing program if they use illegal drugs.

Kenyon Lowe, a commissioner at the Little Rock agency, has been outspoken in past meetings about a need for the five-member board of commissioners to establish a policy.

""That's already been taken care of in our drug use policy,"" Lowe said in an interview. ""All you have to do is get a copy of that, and it's all spelled out.""

Across the river, the North Little Rock Housing Authority remains undecided.

Executive Director Belinda Snow said the board hasn't made a decision on a policy and that the agency's attorney was researching the best steps to take.

""We haven't had a reason at this point,"" Snow said.

Legal and bureaucratic snags delayed the sale of medical marijuana in Arkansas for months.

In Lonoke County, Gates said his agency has decided to follow a federal no-smoking policy for public housing that was enacted last year. But when it comes to oils and edibles, he said all requests will need to go through the agency housing manager.

The Lonoke authority will review each case, along with doctors' notes, to ensure that using medical marijuana ""would not impact the housing authority in any negative way,"" he said.

None of the housing directors interviewed by the Democrat-Gazette said they had received any ""reasonable accommodation"" requests for medical marijuana.

A reasonable accommodation, as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act, is a change in rules, policies, practices or services to help someone with a disability use his home. Failure to provide these changes is a violation of the federal Fair Housing Act.

But a 2011 HUD Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity memo stated that although many states had legalized medical marijuana, HUD tenants can't receive reasonable accommodations for their prescriptions or protest evictions if they are caught using medical marijuana.

""Accommodations that allow the use of medical marijuana would sanction violations of federal criminal law and thus constitute a fundamental alteration in the nature of the housing operation,"" the memo reads in part. ""Indeed, allowing such an accommodation would thwart a central programmatic goal of providing a safe living environment free from illegal drug use.""

Campbell said that in the five-state region she serves, there has been only one Fair Housing complaint regarding medical marijuana since 2016. HUD determined that there was ""no cause"" to investigate, she said. The region includes Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas.

Carol Johnson, the executive director of the Arkansas Fair Housing Commission, said her office hadn't received any complaints and wasn't surprised ""given the newness of the law.""

Over the past year, Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat who serves as a nonvoting delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives from Washington, D.C., has twice proposed bills that would allow public housing residents to use medical marijuana, in compliance with state law.

The first, from 2018, died. The second, which Norton introduced April 18, is in committee.

Ingraham exclusive: Homeland Security boss defends against family-separation accusations at border,https://www.foxnews.com,['Victor Garcia'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ingraham-exclusive-dhs-head-defends-against-family-separation-accusat-at-the-border,"The acting head of the Department of Homeland Security is disputing accusations that U.S. authorities are continuing to separate children from their families.

""First of all, that is not happening. We're separating children in maybe one case a day out of the 3,000 families arriving,"" Kevin McAleenan said Thursday in an exclusive interview on Fox News' ""The Ingraham Angle.""

""It's very rare,"" he added. ""It's for the safety of the child first and foremost.""

US CLOSES TEXAS PROCESSING CENTER AMID FLU OUTBREAK AFTER TEEN MIGRANT'S DEATH

McAleenan, 47, a native of Hawaii, was appointed to DHS by President Trump in April, after the departure of former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. He previously served as a commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, a unit of DHS.

On Thursday's show, McAleenan responded to a clip of MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski talking about family separations on Thursday morning.

""This is our responsibility as a country and as a nation,"" Brzezinski said. ""We are not being given answers as to what is happening to small, young children, to teenagers, to girls, to boys [who were] being taken away from their families, from their parents and left alone in our custody.""

McAleenan also discussed his recent appearances on Capitol Hill asking for funding, including a hearing where Rep. Lauren Underwood, D-Ill., asked him about the effects of separating children from their families at the border. She closed by claiming that children in U.S. custody were living in poor conditions and alluded to news reports that several children in U.S. custody had died.

McAleenan told Ingraham that he objected to Underwood's depiction of the situation.

""It's a sad state of affairs in our politics but we have an actual crisis and we have solutions on the table and clarity of what the men and women on the border need from Congress and yet that is the kind of thing we are hearing,"" McAleenan said.

McAleenan also spoke about illnesses afflicting migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border.

""We are seeing younger children arriving sicker every single day. We had an H1N1 outbreak yesterday at McAllen [Texas] station, the infectious disease with the teenager who passed away on Monday. It looks like he had the flu, a very virulent strain of the flu, H1N1. We have seen measles, we've seen mumps, folks in ICE custody that are quarantined due to mumps. It's a tremendous challenge,"" McAleenan said, adding that the situation with smugglers exacerbates the illnesses."
USDA ends long-standing Forest Service job training program for at-risk youth,https://www.politico.com,['Catherine Boudreau'],05-24-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/24/agriculture-dept-ends-job-corps-conservation-centers-1472208,"The program — known as the Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers — is being transferred to the Labor Department. Employment USDA ends long-standing Forest Service job training program for at-risk youth

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has decided to end a U.S. Forest Service work program that trains at-risk youth to be first responders to natural disasters, maintain national forests and work on rural infrastructure projects.

The program — known for operating the Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers — is being transferred to the Labor Department. As part of the move, the department intends to close nine of 25 centers, according to a statement released Friday. The action could lead to a significant cut of the number of Forest Service employees.

Story Continued Below

“There are reasons why the secretary made this decision,” Forest Service Chief Vicki Christiansen told staff members during a conference call announcing the move on Friday morning, less than an hour before the Department of Labor’s news release. She said she learned of the decision only four days ago.

“Perdue has a goal of efficient and effective government,” Christiansen said, adding that the secretary believes the mission of the program better aligns with the Labor Department. The Forest Service’s Civilian Conservation Centers is the only Labor Department Jobs Corps initiative operated by federal employees.

“This was a high-level policy discussion and decision. It in no way reflects on your excellent work and dedication,” Christiansen said.

Perdue, in a letter to Labor Secretary Alex Acosta, wrote the move would help the Forest Service prioritize its “core natural resource mission to improve the condition and resilience of our nation’s forests, and step away from activities and programs that are not essential to that core mission.”

Forest Service officials did not disclose how many employees will be affected by the change, which is expected to be completed by September. However, a spokesperson for the National Federation of Federal Employees, the union representing Forest Service workers, told POLITICO that as many as 1,065 workers could be let go.

Another Forest Service official on the conference call said the agency will request authority for a reduction in force, which must go through the Office of Personnel Management because of the size of the staff cuts. The Civilian Conservation Centers closing are in states such as Montana, Oregon, Washington, Kentucky and North Carolina.

The Forest Service official said that agency will try to help employees find other jobs within the department and push “voluntary separation incentives,” or buyouts.

The Labor Department said 16 of the 25 centers will be replaced by new contract operators or a partnership overseen by DOL. The announcement added that the “new operators will implement new policies and approaches that will offer students the skills they need to earn an independent living and succeed in meaningful in-demand jobs.”

The Civilian Conservation Corps dates to the Great Depression but was disbanded during World War II. The current iteration was designed during the Johnson administration as part of its Jobs Corps effort. Today, thousands of young people aged 16 to 24 from low-income communities participate in the program.

“During hurricanes, wildfires and other natural disasters, these students are some of the first people to respond,” said Brittany Holder, a spokeswoman for the National Federation of Federal Employees. The organization, in a recent review of the Civilian Conservation Corps, found that in 2017, more than 300 students were sent to wildfire assignments, providing about 200,000 hours of support, among a range of other services.

The union argues the program has been a success and that the administration is misrepresenting data to make its case to privatize the centers. The Trump administration — in annual budget requests — and Republican lawmakers have criticized the program as being wasteful of taxpayer money and having little accountability.

“They have no plan for the students, no idea how to stop the loss of 613,000 hours of student service, and are not concerned about the impact on rural jobs and local economies,” Beverly Tobin-Ford, the union’s Forest Service Council vice president, said in April. “It’s as if this administration just decided to do this without reservation or any forethought.”

EPA wants to triple level of rocket fuel chemical allowed in drinking water,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/epa-rocket-fuel-chemical-drinking-water-e6ee56c9ee13/,"The Trump Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) wants to raise the threshold for a chemical found in rocket fuel to triple the previous limit allowed in drinking water supplies. This is the first new drinking water rule introduced by the agency since the George W. Bush administration.

In the EPA’s latest move to weaken environmental and health protections, it released a notice on Thursday requesting public comment on its proposal to raise the maximum level allowed for the chemical perchlorate — which is linked to thyroid problems — to 56 micrograms per liter.

This is three times higher than what the EPA previously recommended as a safe level for drinking water (15 micrograms per liter). The previous recommendation was just an advisory to help guide states, as opposed to an enforceable limit, which is what the agency is now proposing.

In addition to this change, the EPA is seeking comment on three other alternate options: setting the level to 18 micrograms per liter, to 90 micrograms per liter, or simply abolishing the rule regulating perchlorate in drinking water.

The news comes after a decade-long delay following a lawsuit by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) demanding the EPA set an enforceable standard for the chemical.

“This is enough to make you sick—literally,” Erik Olson, senior director for health and food at NRDC, said in a statement on the new proposed limits. “As a result, millions of Americans will be at risk of exposure to dangerous levels of this toxic chemical in their drinking water.”

In addition to rocket fuel, perchlorate is found in fireworks, airbags, matches, signal flares, some food packaging, and munitions. Health risks from exposure include disruption to the thyroid’s ability to produce hormones needed for normal growth and development, along with potentially causing reproductive problems.

According to NRDC, scientists recommend a limit that is “10 to more than 50 times lower” than what the EPA is currently proposing. Two states currently have much stricter, enforceable standards than required by the EPA: California (at 6 micrograms per liter) and Massachusetts (at 2 micrograms per liter).

The EPA’s proposal comes as the agency has been dragging its feet on implementing a similar legally enforceable standard for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) — a group of man-made chemicals that are toxic to humans and can increase the risk of cancer — in drinking water. Currently there is no maximum level for PFAS chemicals under EPA rules. Numerous communities in 43 states are currently suffering from the toxic chemical polluting their water.

These delays or weakening of chemical standards come despite EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler recent arguments that water issues are the world’s leading environmental crisis.

“This is another Trump administration gift to polluters and water utilities that have lobbied to be off the hook for cleaning up the problem,” Olson said of the proposed change to perchlorate.

The Trump EPA features several top officials who once worked for the chemical industry. This includes a former Koch Industries staffer, David Dunlap, who worked on water and chemical policy and now serves as deputy EPA assistant administrator for research and development, and a former chemical industry attorney, Steven Cook, who oversees Superfund sites. Meanwhile, Nancy Beck, the Trump administration appointee who oversees the EPA’s toxic chemical unit, previously worked as an executive at the American Chemistry Council, one of the industry’s main lobbying groups.

What’s more, a 2009 House Committee report found that Beck, a former Bush administration official, was slowing progress in confirming the health threats from chemicals like perchlorate found in drinking water. The committee concluded she had been “inappropriately intervening in agency science.”

Ties to the chemical industry also extend to Wheeler. In a letter sent to the EPA administrator last month, Chairman of the House Oversight Committee, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D- MD), accused Wheeler of failing to disclose his previous lobbying on behalf of Darling Ingredients, which is involved in making fuel and fertilizers regulated by the EPA."
Trump Takes Credit for Obama’s Gains for Vets,https://www.snopes.com,['Associated Press'],05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.snopes.com/ap/2019/05/27/trump-takes-credit-for-obamas-gains-for-vets/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Boastful on the occasion of Memorial Day, President Donald Trump and his Veterans Affairs secretary are claiming full credit for health care improvements that were underway before they took office.

Trump said he passed a private-sector health care program, Veterans Choice, after failed attempts by past presidents for the last “45 years.” That’s not true. The Choice program, which allows veterans to see doctors outside the government-run VA system at taxpayer expense, was first passed in 2014 under President Barack Obama.

Trump’s VA secretary, Robert Wilkie, also is distorting the facts. Faulting previous “bad leadership” at VA, Wilkie suggested it was his own efforts that improved waiting times at VA medical centers and brought new offerings of same-day mental health service. The problem: The study cited by Wilkie on wait times covers the period from 2014 to 2017, before Wilkie took the helm as VA secretary. Same-day mental health services at VA were started during the Obama administration under Wilkie’s predecessor, David Shulkin.

A look at the claims:

TRUMP: “We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability to give our veterans the care that they deserve and they have been trying to pass these things for 45 years.” — Montoursville, Pennsylvania, rally on May 20.

THE FACTS: Wrong. Trump is not the first president in 45 years to get Congress to pass Veterans Choice; Obama did it in the wake of a scandal at VA’s medical center in Phoenix, where some veterans died while waiting months for appointments. The program currently allows veterans to see doctors outside the VA system if they must wait more than 30 days for an appointment or drive more than 40 miles (65 kilometers) to a VA facility.

Trump did expand eligibility for the program. Now, starting June 6, veterans are to have that option for a private doctor if their VA wait is only 20 days (28 for specialty care) or their drive is only 30 minutes.

Still, VA’s top health official, Dr. Richard Stone, described the new program’s start to “almost be a non-event” in testimony to Congress. That’s in part because wait times in the private sector are typically longer than at VA. In 2018, 34 percent of all VA appointments were with outside physicians, down from 36 percent in 2017.

Also key to the Choice program’s success is an overhaul of VA’s electronic medical records to allow seamless sharing of them with private physicians, a process expected to take up to 10 years. Wilkie has said full implementation of the expanded Choice program is “years” away.

WILKIE: “The first thing I did was change out the leadership at VA. … (The president) also allowed me to change out leadership in the VA centers. If someone wasn’t walking the post, getting to know the people who work for her or him, or getting to know those veterans, they had to leave. And, as a result, the Journal of the American Medical Association this year said that our waiting times are now as good or better than any in the private sector.” — interview Thursday with Fox News.

THE FACTS: It’s true that a study by the medical association came out in January that found wait times at VA medical centers on average were better than the private sector. But the improvement wasn’t a “result” of anything that Wilkie did: The study involved a period largely covering the Obama administration — and before Wilkie became acting VA secretary in late March 2018.

In fact, in a VA press release in January announcing the study’s results, Wilkie credits the department’s “concerted” effort to improve access to care “since 2014.”

The study covered four specialties, primary care, dermatology, cardiology and orthopedics.

It found that in 2014, the average wait time at VA medical centers was 22.5 days, compared with 18.7 days in the private sector, which was not statistically different. By 2017, the wait time at VA improved to 17.7 days, while increasing to 29.8 days for private doctors. Wait times at VA medical centers were shorter in all specialties except orthopedics.

According to the study, the number of patients seen yearly in VA increased slightly between 2014 and 2017, to about 5.1 million. VA patient satisfaction also rose, according to patient surveys cited in the study.

WILKIE: The VA “had suffered from bad leadership. And that’s a bipartisan comment. And the second thing I had to do was make sure that as we approach our veteran population that we make sure that they are at the center, their needs are at the center of what we do … I think we’ve had it backwards at VA for many years. … One of the things that we’re doing at VA is that we have same-day mental health service. … It is huge.” — interview with Fox News.

THE FACTS: Same-day mental health service started at VA before Trump took office in January 2017, let alone Wilkie.

VA’s effort to provide same-day primary and mental-health care when medically necessary at every VA medical center was publicized in April 2016 under the Obama administration. At the time, Shulkin was helping lead the effort as VA’s top health official. By late 2016, the department’s blog announced that the goal of same-day mental health services would be achieved by year’s end.

A Dec. 23, 2016, article in the Harvard Business Review cites new same-day services at all VA hospitals as evidence of notable progress at the department. Shulkin, who was then named by Trump to be his VA secretary, told Congress in late January 2017 the services already were fully in place.

Trump selected Wilkie to be his VA secretary after firing Shulkin in March 2018 because of ethics charges and internal rebellion at the department over the role of private care for veterans. Trump’s initial replacement choice, White House doctor Ronny Jackson, withdrew after allegations of workplace misconduct surfaced. While Wilkie has been credited by both parties in Congress for bringing stability to the department, the VA improvements he attributes to himself this past week are misplaced."
Top DHS official to depart agency at Trump's request,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-25-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/top-dhs-official-to-depart-agency-at-trumps-request,"The head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is stepping down from his post next month per the request of President Trump, according to a new report.

Lee Francis Cissna notified staff Friday that he would be leaving the Department of Homeland Security on June 1. It’s unclear what his plans are after departing the administration.

“During the past 20 months, every day, I have passionately worked to carry out USCIS’ mission to faithfully administer the nation’s lawful immigration system,” Cissna wrote to staff, according to an email obtained by the Associated Press.

Cissna’s job was in jeopardy last month as the agency coped with a surge of migrants crossing the border and a new caravan assembling. But Republicans including Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa went to bat for Cissna, and he did not leave with former Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen.

Cissna’s position requires Senate confirmation. It’s unknown who will replace Cissna, although the Trump administration announced that former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli would join the agency."

Atlanta Braves Latin American scouting records requested by Justice Department,https://tomahawktake.com,"['Jonathan Magel', 'Alan Carpenter', 'Scott Polacek']",05-26-2019,2019,5,https://tomahawktake.com/2019/05/26/atlanta-braves-latin-american-scouting-records-subpoenaed-by-doj/,"Atlanta Braves must send Latin American scouting reports to the Department of Justice.

According to a report in the Washington Post, The US Department of Justice (DoJ) served subpoenas on the Atlanta Braves, Los Angeles Dodgers, and San Diego Padres “seeking records relating to scouting and signing of players from Latin America.”

While this report is dated May 23rd, there was no indication of when these subpoenas were actually issued, though the investigation is known to have been in progress for close to a year now.

Last September Jeff Passan reported that a Federal Grand Jury subpoenaed officials from several teams including “at least one former Atlanta Braves official as well as people involved with the signing of Cuban star Hector Olivera.”

Agents from the FBI have spearheaded the investigation, according to sources familiar with it, and lawyers from the Department of Justice who specialize in Foreign Corrupt Practices Act cases – which typically involve bribery of foreign officials – are involved as well.

This news comes just a year after MLB severely sanctioned the Atlanta Braves for their actions in Latin America during the John Coppolella/John Hart regime.

Alan wondered at the time why Gordon Blakeley’s name never appeared in Passan’s post, as he helped the Yankees scout and sign in Latin America before coming to Atlanta to assist Coppolella. We may now have an answer,

What’s it all about Alfie?

The probe centers on something called the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which Alan explained in layman’s terms in his original post.

the provisions of the FCPA are an attempt to level the playing field for those doing business internationally by telling US citizens that they can’t pay a bribe to (or anything that looks like there’s a bribe) to a ‘foreign official’ to facilitate a business transaction.

In the Post article, Hobson says that more than a dozen people associated with the game, including scouts and a former MLB official (Bud Selig comes to mind) testified before the Grand Jury, as well as players and at least one agent.

The DoJ indicted a native Cuban agent Bart Hernandez sports and trainer Julio Estrada also from Cuba. At their trial, documents produced suggested the New York Yankees were aware crimes were being committed.

… State Department document summarized an August 2012 interview … between a U.S. consulate official and a Cuban pitcher, Omar Luis … (that Luis) “Was directly recruited from Cuba by the Yankees,” the State Department official wrote. When asked about how he got residency in Haiti, the report said the player replied, “The Yankees contacted a Haitian functionary who make [sic] it all happen.”

Blakeley left the Yankees in 2014 and joined the Atlanta Braves."

U.S. Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, sponsors the bill called the Safe Drinking Water Assistance Act. The bill would address barriers that limit the government’s response to the chemicals called PFAS, found in man-made firefighting foam, his office said.

RELATED: What you need to know about chemicals in water

The bill would also expedite analysis of the chemicals and provide support and resources to states dealing with them, the office said. The bill also proposes efforts to identify the health effects of cyanotoxins, the toxin in the algal bloom that shut down Toledo’s water supply in 2014.

Drinking water safety is one of the topics examined by the Dayton Daily News Path Forward project, which digs into solutions for the most pressing issues facing the community.

For several years, Wright-Patt officials have faced concerns about PFAS, formally known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. Last year, the city of Dayton found PFAS in the groundwater near the McFadden Avenue firefighter training center.

The city of Dayton runs the region’s largest water system, which includes several other Montgomery County communities.

Existing law requires the Environmental Protection Agency to identify and analyze emerging contaminants, but Portman’s office said actions to monitor and treat contaminants is often delayed due to “the rigorous yet lengthy nature of EPA’s multi-step review process.”

“This legislation will help the federal government more efficiently and effectively analyze the impacts of, and respond to, emerging contaminants through greater coordination among federal agencies, and will provide states with the resources they need to monitor, test, and respond to potential risks posed by emerging contaminants,” Portman said in a statement.

Activists like Bill Walker said the encroachment of PFAS in the water is “rooted in the failure of federal chemical regulation.”

Walker, vice president of the Environmental Working Group, said PFAS presents “the biggest drinking water contamination crisis in the country right now and certainly for quite some time.”

“We still believe this is basically the tip of the toxic iceberg,” Walker said.

The Dayton Daily News earlier this year reported Dayton and Wright-Patt are working to keep the chemicals out of regional drinking water, but progress is slow because federal agencies have not set safety levels for some chemicals or funded clean-up efforts of groundwater contamination.

The bill would direct the EPA to give support and technical assistance to communities that have detected emerging contaminants in their water supply. It additionally would establish and maintain a database of resources to assist states and water utilities with testing for contaminants. The bill also would direct certain federal agencies to create inter-agency working groups to coordinate the federal response and research strategy.

Trump's 'most transparent president' claim looks cloudy,https://www.politico.com,"['Andrew Restuccia', 'Alex Isenstadt', 'James Arkin', 'John Bresnahan', 'Burgess Everett']",05-23-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/23/trumps-transparency-1342875,"President Donald Trump declared himself “the most transparent president” during an impromptu Rose Garden appearance. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images white house Trump's 'most transparent president' claim looks cloudy A personally accessible president has approved several precedent-breaking retreats from public disclosure.

President Donald Trump won’t release White House visitor logs, he refuses to hand over his tax returns, he made staffers sign non-disclosure agreements and he’s balking at congressional investigators.

Yet during a Rose Garden speech on Wednesday, he again proclaimed himself “the most transparent president” in U.S. history, adding to the reporters gathered before him, “I think most of you would agree.”

Story Continued Below

It may be true that Trump reveals more of his personal thoughts and emotions than any of his predecessors. But by most other measures of presidential transparency, including the congressional oversight at issue during his White House appearance Wednesday, Trump operates behind dark-tinted windows.

The end to White House visitor logs, a way for the public to see who is getting direct access to the most powerful man in America, is a break from Obama administration practice. He’s the first president in decades not to release his tax returns. No modern White House has held as few daily press briefings as Trump’s, a ritual his Pentagon and State Department have also largely phased out. And while many presidents have battled Congressional oversight requests, Trump has dismissed the queries of House Democrats as illegitimate partisan inquests.

All of which has many critics saying that Trump has it backwards.

“It is for sure the least transparent administration in modern history,” said Robert Weissman, the president of Public Citizen, a prominent Washington consumer advocacy group.

Norm Ornstein, a longtime government reform advocate and resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, called the Trump administration “the opposite of transparent.” Trump’s statement, he deadpanned, “made me laugh -- before I cried again.”

Even by the standards of Trump’s penchant for embellishment and falsehoods, Trump’s claim of unprecedented transparency — which he and his aides have made repeatedly — is particularly outrageous to the cadre of outside groups who’ve spent the last 2.5 years clashing with an administration they view as deeply secretive.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201905/2659/1155968404_6039857995001_6039857592001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

There is no universal definition of government transparency. But the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service defines transparency as “the disclosure of government information” that can be used to “hold the federal government more accountable for its actions or inactions.”

Measured by that sort of standard, critics say, Trump has fallen far short.

Within the first year of Trump’s presidency, the federal government denied or censored more public information requests than at any time in the last decade. And Freedom of Information Act lawsuits intended to force the administration to turn over records reached a record high last year, increasing by nearly 70 percent compared with the last full fiscal year of President Barack Obama’s term.

“There’s only one way in which he’s the most transparent president and that’s that we can see him broadcasting his thoughts on Twitter when he gets angry in the morning,” said John Wonderlich, the executive director of the Sunlight Foundation, a government accountability group. “Otherwise, it’s ridiculous.”

White House officials counter that Trump is more accessible than any modern president, broadcasting his thoughts to his millions of followers everyday, answering shouted questions from reporters and granting regular print, television and radio interviews. By that measure, the public likely has a better understanding of Trump’s minute-to-minute opinions than they did of other recent presidents, who were often reluctant to spout off in public until their ideas had been vetted by their advisers.

Though White House aides hold up Trump as a pillar of accessibility, they have also sought to tightly control Trump’s interactions with the media. Trump’s exclusive interviews tend to be with friendly news outlets. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders last appeared in the press briefing room in April to answer children’s questions during “Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day,” and White House officials argued that her answers should be off the record.

Watchdog groups said accessibility alone isn’t enough to claim the transparency mantle.

“I don’t think that’s meaningful transparency,” said Liz Hempowicz, public policy director at the Project on Government Oversight, adding that the true transparency requires a government-wide commitment across federal agencies.

Hempowicz and other experts noted that the lack of transparency at federal agencies has massive consequences for the public, but often gets less attention than Trump’s headline-grabbing statements.

Just this week, for example, the Washington Post disclosed the existence of an internal Defense Department memo restricting the way the Pentagon shares information with Congress. And POLITICO recently detailed efforts by the Agriculture Department to reassign nearly all its researchers who study the economic effects of climate change, trade policy and food stamps, in what employees call a crackdown on economists whose assessments don’t square with Trump’s policies.

Then there is Trump’s categorical rejection of House Democratic oversight requests, including the extraordinary use of lawsuits to fight back against his investigators.

Trump’s claims of unprecedented transparency seem to be increasing as he grows more frustrated with the investigations encircling him. Aides and associates say Trump is furious that the release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report has not dampened appetites for more investigation into subjects like his finances and tax returns.

“The President was fully transparent during the Mueller investigation. He made all requested White House staff available for interviews, produced tens of thousands of documents, and answered questions about the ridiculous ‘collusion’ allegations,” White House spokesman Steven Groves said in a statement. “The White House and the Administration will continue to cooperate with legitimate congressional oversight while protecting Executive Branch rights and privileges. In addition, the President and his staff engage with the press and answer their questions almost every day.”

On Wednesday, Trump lashed out at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for accusing him of engaging in a “cover-up,” countering that his administration had cooperated extensively with Mueller’s inquiries. Trump did give current and former staffers the green-light to participate with Mueller, although he himself refused to sit for an in-person interview, answering written questions instead.

“I think most of you would agree to this,” Trump said after abruptly ending a meeting with Democrats and vowing not to work with them until they end their investigations. “I’m the most transparent president, probably, in the history of this country. And instead of walking in happily to a meeting, I walk in to look at people that had just said I was doing a cover-up. I don’t do cover-ups.”

Trump isn’t the first president to throw around transparency-related superlatives. Soon after winning the presidency, Barack Obama vowed to make his administration the most transparent in history. And he did take steps toward that goal, including through the first-ever release of White House visitor logs. But watchdog groups often complained that Obama was betraying that promise when he blocked access to records or his Justice Department prosecuted government leakers.

“The [Obama] administration’s war on leaks and other efforts to control information are the most aggressive I’ve seen since the Nixon administration,” former Washington Post editor Len Downie wrote in a 2013 report.

“It’s unwise for a president to make a statement like that” unless he can back it up, Hempowicz said of Obama’s boast, noting that good government groups criticized the 44th president throughout his time in office. “It makes it very easy for us to push back.”"

U.S. State Department misses deadline to explain Iran arms control report: aide,https://www.reuters.com,"['Arshad Mohammed', 'Min Read']",05-23-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-iran-armscontrol/u-s-state-department-misses-deadline-to-explain-iran-arms-control-report-aide-idUSKCN1ST2VY,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department failed to meet a deadline on Thursday to provide information to three congressional committee chairmen looking into whether an annual arms control report slanted and politicized assessments about Iran, a congressional aide said.

FILE PHOTO - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speaks to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov during their talks in the Black Sea resort city of Sochi, Russia, May 14, 2019. Pavel Golovkin/Pool via REUTERS

In a May 16 letter, the Democratic chairmen of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs, Armed Services and Intelligence committees asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to provide a State Department briefing and documents no later than Thursday.

The chairmen’s letter cited a Reuters article on April 17 about how the administration’s annual report to Congress on global compliance with international arms control accords provoked a dispute with U.S. intelligence agencies and some State Department officials.

The dissenting officials, sources said, were concerned that the document politicized and skewed assessments against Iran in a bid to lay the groundwork to justify military action.

A U.S. official familiar with the issue and speaking on condition of anonymity said the chairmen were to be invited to a briefing by State Department and other government experts about the report on “adherence to and compliance with arms control, nonproliferation and disarmament agreements and commitments.”

The congressional aide, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said no such communication had been received.

The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

U.S.-Iranian tensions rose following U.S. President Donald Trump’s withdrawal last year from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and his reimposition of tough economic sanctions. They sharpened earlier this month after Trump tightened sanctions to try to eliminate Iran’s oil exports.

Strains further deepened with Saudi Arabia accusing Iran of ordering armed drone attacks on two oil pumping stations and the May 12 sabotage of four vessels, including two Saudi tankers, off the coast of the United Arab Emirates.

U.S. government sources said Washington strongly suspects militias with ties to Tehran were behind those attacks as well as a rocket strike in Baghdad’s Green Zone.

Iran denied involvement in the incidents.

In their May 16 letter to Pompeo, the three chairmen said they were “deeply concerned” the arms control report may have been produced by political appointees “disregarding intelligence or distorting its meaning.”

The State Department, they noted, was legally bound to submit to Congress a “detailed report” on compliance by the United States and other countries with international arms control accords.

Instead, they wrote, this year’s report was only 12 pages long, “contains no meaningful discussion” of U.S. and Russian compliance with such agreements and “consists largely of hypotheticals or opinion.”

Several sources told Reuters that the report made them wonder if the administration was painting Iran in the darkest light possible, much as the George W. Bush administration used bogus and exaggerated intelligence to justify its 2003 invasion of Iraq."
USDA farms out economists whose work challenges Trump policies,https://www.politico.com,"['Liz Crampton', 'Quint Forgey', 'Burgess Everett', 'John Bresnahan', 'Nancy Cook']",05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/22/usda-agriculture-economists-trump-policies-1340168,"Following Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue's announcement of a staff relocation within the department, employees have been wondering who would be able to stay in Washington. | Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo agriculture USDA farms out economists whose work challenges Trump policies Those who examine the impact of tariffs, climate change and taxes on rural America are among employees being relocated.

The Agriculture Department is moving nearly all its researchers into the economic effects of climate change, trade policy and food stamps – subjects of controversial Trump administration initiatives – outside of Washington, part of what employees claim is a political crackdown on economists whose assessments have raised questions about the president’s policies.

Since last year, employees in the department’s Economic Research Service have awaited news of which members of their agency would be forced to relocate, after Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue stunned them by declaring he was moving most of the agency to a location outside the capital. The announcement sparked claims that Perdue was trying to pressure economists into leaving the agency rather than move their families.

Story Continued Below

On March 5, the department began notifying people who were allowed to stay in Washington, but didn’t provide a comprehensive list, only telling employees in person if they made the cut.

But current and former employees compiled one anyway, covering all 279 people on staff, 76 of whom are being allowed to stay in Washington.

Morning Agriculture A daily briefing on agriculture and food policy — in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.

The current and former employees, all of whom requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation, say the specialties of those who are being asked to move corresponds closely to the areas where economic assessments often clash with the president’s policies, including tax policies, climate change, and the farm economy. The list, shared exclusively with POLITICO, shows a clear emphasis was placed on keeping employees whose work covers relatively non-controversial issues like crop planting over those whose research focused on areas sensitive to the administration.

“This was a clear politicization of the agency many of us loved for its non-partisan research and analysis,” a current ERS employee told POLITICO, claiming that department leaders picked those whose work was more likely to offend the administration and forced them to move “out or quit.”

A former researcher who left last month in anticipation of being moved put it this way: “You can draw the conclusion that these are the less valued activities that are undertaken by ERS. They view ERS as being useful in that it produces data and statistics that can inform policy but the research that’s done by the economists and geographers and statisticians at ERS is less valuable and that they’re not concerned with a significant deterioration in ERS’ ability to do research.”

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201902/1491/1155968404_5997228199001_5997114904001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

A USDA spokesman declined to directly address the employees’ allegation of political bias, but provided a written statement from Perdue saying that the moves were not prompted by the work being done by ERS

“None of this reflects on the jobs being done by our . . . employees, and in fact, I frequently tell my Cabinet colleagues that USDA has the best workforce in the federal government,” Perdue said. “These changes are more steps down the path to better service to our customers, and will help us fulfill our informal motto to ‘Do right and feed everyone. . .”

“We don’t undertake these relocations lightly, and we are doing it to improve performance and the services these agencies provide. We will be placing important USDA resources closer to many stakeholders, most of whom live and work far from Washington, D.C. We will be saving money for the taxpayers and improving our ability to retain more employees in the long run. And we are increasing the probability of attracting highly-qualified staff with training and interests in agriculture, many of whom come from land-grant universities.”

But employees claim the department’s leadership, including Perdue, turned against the research service after an estimate early last year suggested that the Republican-backed tax plan would largely benefit the wealthiest farmers.

Perdue’s decision to move ERS came several months after news outlets highlighted the USDA study on the Republican tax changes. In response to Perdue’s move, cities from all over the country submitted bids to host the ERS and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which will also move. The finalists, announced May 3, were the greater Kansas City area, North Carolina‘s Research Triangle Park and multiple locations in Indiana.

Accompanying his announcement of a final selection, which is expected as early as this week, Perdue has promised to provide Congress with a cost-benefit analysis detailing why USDA says the move makes financial sense.

The impending announcement comes as pressure builds on Capitol Hill to stop the move. On Thursday, the House Appropriations Committee is scheduled to consider a spending bill that includes a provision barring the Agriculture Department from moving the two agencies out of the national capital zone. It also would block Perdue’s decision to put ERS under the control of USDA’s chief economist, a move that placed oversight of the agency closer to the secretary’s office.

Employees said that moving nearly all researchers out of Washington would have a clear impact on the agency’s work. Researchers said they usually draw on information from other USDA divisions, members of Congress and Washington-based stakeholder groups, which would be more difficult from a remote location. Allowing 76 members of the agency to stay in Washington while the other left also impacts morale, they said, and limits collaboration.

Among the employees staying in Washington are senior analysts who conduct global market and crop-outlook estimates and administrative personnel. According to the list, approximately 49 percent of agricultural economists will be allowed to remain in Washington, compared with 14 percent of researchers.

Rumors had been swirling among staff for months about who would be allowed to remain in Washington when all ERS employees were called into an auditorium in March to be briefed by Acting Administrator Chris Hartley. He then read aloud the names of those who qualified to stay. But it wasn’t until employees compiled a full roster of who was staying and going that they got a clear picture of how the agency would be split up.

Decisions on who would stay in Washington were made by ERS leadership and approved by Perdue, according to a “Frequently Asked Questions” document distributed at the March meeting. The FAQ states that “every ERS employee had the ability to provide input” on the move. Senior managers “proposed critical ERS functions” that they believed needed to remain in Washington.

Some employees said that description of the decision-making process validates their concerns that Perdue was behind the move.

“They went in and handpicked who they wanted and called them ‘critical,’” said a current ERS employee.

Neil Conklin, a former senior administrator at ERS under the George W. Bush administration, said the agency stands to be fundamentally changed by the relocation.

“This is going to be very destructive of the agency, as certainly as we’ve known it,” Conklin said.

To literally no one’s surprise, the head of the Federal Communications Commission on Monday announced Monday that he’d recommend approving the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint. But it now looks as if the Justice Department’s own attorneys vehemently oppose the merger.



Reuters reported Wednesday that the DOJ’s antitrust division has recommended filing a lawsuit to block the $26.5 billion deal. Citing two sources familiar with the matter, the news agency said the division’s staff have long been “skeptical” of the proposed merger, in that it does not appear to be in the best interests of consumers.

Per Reuters: “T-Mobile has a reputation for aggressively seeking to cut prices and improve service to woo customers away from market leaders Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc, and staff may want to preserve that dynamic.”

Ajit Pai, the FCC chairman, said earlier that commitments by T-Mobile and Sprint to close “the digital divide in rural America” and advance “United States leadership in 5G, the next generation in wireless connectivity,” has persuaded him to approve the deal.

FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr—only days after accepting an award from the nation’s largest wireless industry trade association—announced that he, too, was also swayed by the companies’ commitments and would support the chairman’s decision.

Praising his “ongoing leadership,” T-Mobile CEO John Legere thanked Pai for his support in a statement Monday, while promising the commitments T-Mobile agreed to are “verifiable, enforceable and specific.” But consumer advocacy groups and legal experts following the news disagreed entirely.

“Rather than actually examine the competitive impact, Chairman Pai’s recommended approval points to T-Mobile’s commitments and behavioral conditions,” said Yosef Getachew, media and democracy program director for Common Cause. “Not only are these commitments and conditions unenforceable and riddled with loopholes, they do nothing to address the blatant competitive harms the merger poses to consumers.”

Gigi Sohn, a counselor to former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, echoed those concerns in a Wired op-ed this week, writing that Legere’s assurances “are speculative, unsubstantiated, and entirely unenforceable.” Sohn went on to call T-Mobile’s vow not to raise prices for three years an “admission” that, should the merger be approved, “there would not be enough competition in the wireless market to constrain price increases.”

Pai’s announcement was also rebuked by, among others, New America’s Open Technology Institute and the Rural Wireless Association. FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, who is Democrat, compared the merger to “consolidation in airlines and with drug companies,” which she argued, “hasn’t worked out well for consumers.”

“The inadequate conditions [Pai] and his fellow GOP commissioners so readily and rapidly blessed are a tiny Band-Aid on what would be a fatal wound to wireless competition and affordability in this country,” said Matt Wood, vice president of policy at the advocacy group Free Press. “DOJ’s staff seems to get that, even if some of the political appointees leading the FCC don’t.”"
Veterans Affairs is changing for the better,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-24-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/veterans-affairs-is-changing-for-the-better,"President Abraham Lincoln once said, “I am not concerned that you have fallen — I am concerned that you arise.”

Like any large organization, the Department of Veterans Affairs has seen its share of problems.

But under President Trump’s leadership, the VA is living up to Lincoln’s ideals by finding ways to fix those problems from past administrations.

When we realized our claim-appeals process was complex and inefficient, we worked with veterans service organizations, Congress, and the president to draft and pass a new law designed to fix it and put veterans first.

We launched a 24/7 White House VA hotline to help veterans cut through red tape and serve as an important feedback mechanism that lets agency leaders identify trends, spot problems more quickly, and drive improvements across the department.

And after Trump promised to give veterans more healthcare choices, we worked with Congress to do just that by passing the Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks, or MISSION, Act, which will consolidate our community care efforts into a single, simple-to-use program that puts veterans at the center of their healthcare decisions.

But perhaps the best example of VA’s continuous improvement on behalf of veterans is the progress we’ve made in expanding accessibility to, and quality of, the healthcare we deliver.

When it comes to access, a January study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that by 2017, VA had significantly shorter wait times for primary care, cardiology, and dermatology than private doctors. The study said the data it collected is “further supporting the finding that access to care has improved over time within the VA.”

That improvement came even as the VA was steadily seeing more patients.

In December, a Dartmouth study in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that care at the VA was “significantly better” than the care found in non-VA facilities in 14 of 15 categories. “We found that VHA hospitals provided the best care in most referral regions and rarely provided the worst care,” the study found.

Our focus on customer service is part of the reason for these improvements. Our Veterans Experience Office is constantly assessing our performance and giving us the feedback we need to identify and resolve problems.

That office has been so successful that the Trump administration is using it as a model to develop customer service strategies across the entire government. This summer, lessons learned at the VA will be used to develop customer service plans at more than two dozen major federal agencies.

The cornerstone of our commitment to improving customer service is our willingness to acknowledge that things aren’t perfect and that change is a good thing. That’s the attitude we have as we prepare to undergo the biggest transition in our history: implementing the MISSION Act.

Under that law, which we’ll start implementing on June 6, our community care programs will be streamlined into a single program, and veterans will be able to more easily access outside care when necessary or when VA care is simply too far away.

This landmark change won’t supplant VA or cause the quality of its care to diminish. It will support our mission by improving its ability to get veterans the care they need when and where they need it.

This Memorial Day, I urge all Americans to remember the more than 1 million service members who gave their lives for our freedom in the several wars we’ve fought during the history of this country. At the VA, we are undergoing change at a rate that hasn’t been seen since the end of World War II to improve the lives of our living veterans.

We are welcoming these challenges as the best way to live up to the charge Lincoln laid on the nation after the Civil War — that we continue “to care for him who shall have borne the battle.”
