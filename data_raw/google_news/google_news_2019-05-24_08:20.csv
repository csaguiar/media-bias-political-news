Trump gives AG Barr authority to declassify documents related to 2016 campaign surveillance,https://www.foxnews.com,['Talia Kaplan'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-gives-ag-barr-authority-to-declassify-documents-related-to-2016-campaign-surveillance,"President Trump on Thursday night issued a memo giving Attorney General William Barr the authority to declassify any documents related to surveillance of the Trump campaign in 2016.

Trump also ordered the intelligence community to cooperate with Barr. The memo read: ""The heads of elements of the intelligence community... and the heads of each department or agency that includes an element of the intelligence community shall promptly provide such assistance and information as the Attorney General may request in connection with that review.""

""Today, at the request and recommendation of the Attorney General of the United States, President Donald J. Trump directed the intelligence community to quickly and fully cooperate with the Attorney General’s investigation into surveillance activities during the 2016 Presidential election,"" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement.

""The Attorney General has also been delegated full and complete authority to declassify information pertaining to this investigation, in accordance with the long-established standards for handling classified information. Today’s action will help ensure that all Americans learn the truth about the events that occurred, and the actions that were taken, during the last Presidential election and will restore confidence in our public institutions.""

In a Twitter message late Thursday, Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani defended the president's action.

""The President @realDonaldTrump made a wise decision to let AG Barr on the documents,"" Giuliani wrote. ""I don’t know for sure but I seriously doubt there’s any national security concern but some of it could affect pending investigations. I’m sure AG and DOJ will make a very appropriate decision.""

U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, blasted the move as an attempt to ""weaponize law enforcement and classified information.""

BARR HAMMERED FOR STATING 'SPYING DID OCCUR,' DESPITE CONFIRMATION OF TRUMP TEAM SURVEILLANCE

Trump claims his campaign was the victim of ""spying,"" though the intelligence community has insisted it acted lawfully in following leads in the Russia investigation.

The president had told Fox News earlier in May that he would allow declassification ""soon."" He elaborated, ""I didn’t want to do it originally because I wanted to wait, because I know what they -- you know I’ve seen the way they play. They play very dirty.""

Last month, Barr ran into a buzz saw of criticism from Democratic lawmakers and media figures for testifying that “spying did occur” against the Trump campaign in 2016. But despite the backlash, Barr appeared to be referring to intelligence collection that already has been widely reported and confirmed.

Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants against former Trump campaign aide Carter Page are currently the subject of a Justice Department inspector general investigation looking at potential misconduct in the issuance of those warrants. That review also reportedly is scrutinizing the role of an FBI informant who had contacts with Trump advisers in the early stages of the Russia investigation.

The use of the term ""spying"" as it applies to the FBI's surveillance in 2016 has been fiercely disputed. The New York Times, even as it reported last year on how the FBI sent an informant to speak to campaign advisers amid concerns about suspicious Russia contacts, stated that this was to ""investigate"" Russia ties and ""not to spy.""

DEMS RAGE AGAINST BARR FOR BACKING CLAIMS OF TRUMP CAMPAIGN 'SPYING' BY FBI

“I think spying did occur. The question is whether it was adequately predicated,” Barr testified last month, adding that he believed it is his “obligation” to review whether there was misconduct in the original investigation. “Congress is usually very concerned with intelligence agencies and law enforcement agencies staying in their proper lane.”

He added that “spying on a political campaign is a big deal.”

President Trump backed the attorney general's testimony, saying the same day Barr testified last month that he thinks what Barr said ""was absolutely true,"" adding, ""There was absolutely spying into my campaign.”

Democrats, though, charged that the testimony indicated Barr was a compromised witness.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told the Associated Press last month that she doesn’t “trust Barr,” but she trusts Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., accused Barr of “peddling conspiracy theories.”

Trump’s latest explanation for the Huawei ban is unacceptably bad,https://www.theverge.com,['May'],05-23-2019,2019,5,https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/23/18637836/trump-huawei-ban-explanation-trade-deal-national-security-risk,"Over the past week, the US government has taken extreme and unprecedented steps against Huawei, cutting it off from every US partner at the risk of a long-term rupture in trade between the US and China. But while the impact of the order is clear, it’s still not entirely clear why it was put in place.

The official explanation, according to the initial executive order, is that Huawei hardware puts the US at risk for espionage. As the order puts it, “foreign adversaries are increasingly creating and exploiting vulnerabilities in information and communications technology and services,” and the “unrestricted acquisition or use” of hardware made by foreign adversaries makes those vulnerabilities worse.

Are Huawei phones bound for Europe really a US security risk?

It’s a convincing case when it comes to restricting Huawei’s role in network infrastructure, and it’s a case a number of officials have made in that context. But it makes a lot less sense for exported hardware. Why shouldn’t Corning glass or Micron flash memory be sold to Huawei for use in phones bound for Europe? Huawei doesn’t sell phones within the US, so the infrastructure security argument doesn’t make as much sense. And if the problem is really just that China has a history of intellectual property violations and trade secret theft, the same logic might apply just as easily to Chinese companies like Lenovo or dronemaker DJI, with catastrophic consequences for those companies and the industry at large.

Complicating all of this is the growing trade war, which is taking place on a largely separate diplomatic track. For more than a year now, Trump has been placing an escalating series of tariffs on Chinese imports in order to force leaders to the bargaining table, with China retaliating with its own tariffs, and increased tension as various summits have fallen through. From afar, it’s easy to see the measures against Huawei as part of that same logic: pressure placed on China’s economy to extract concessions down the road. But if that’s true, offering a national security justification would be both dishonest and diplomatically counterproductive, doing lasting damage to America’s credibility in the event that a genuine security threat emerges.

All that was in the background on Thursday afternoon, when Trump addressed the press after an event with agricultural groups. When a reporter asked Trump about the moves against Huawei, his answer was troubling. (The video footage is here, if you want to see it for yourself; it starts about 41 minutes in.)

TRUMP: Huawei is something that’s very dangerous. You look at what they’ve done from a security standpoint, from a military standpoint, it’s very dangerous. So it’s possible that Huawei even would be included in some kind of a trade deal. If we made a deal, I could imagine Huawei being possibly included in some form, some part of a trade deal. REPORTER: How would that look? TRUMP: It would look very good for us. REPORTER: But the Huawei part, how would you design that. TRUMP: Oh it’s too early to say. We’re just very concerned about Huawei from a security standpoint.

There are two claims here, which Trump makes quite clearly: First, that the restrictions were placed on Huawei because the company is a security threat, and second, that the restrictions against Huawei could potentially be lifted as part of a trade deal.

These two claims are incompatible — or to be more precise, they only make sense if the security threat is a bluff. You can’t negotiate away a security threat as part of a trade deal, for the simple reason that China can’t credibly promise that it will stop spying. No matter what deal Trump signs, China’s spy agencies will continue to seek out valuable information within the US. If Huawei was a threat before the deal, it will be just as much of a threat afterwards.

It only makes sense if the security threat is a bluff, but that would be very bad

Of course, if Huawei wasn’t really a security threat, and Trump just used that as an excuse to escalate the trade war, that would be even worse. The national security world runs on confidential intelligence, and life-or-death operations often need to be undertaken for reasons that can’t be made public. On those occasions, the president and other government leaders can only tell part of the story, and beyond that, they need the public to trust that there’s a valid national security concern for concealing the rest. That trust has taken a hit in recent years, often for good reason, but it’s an important part of what it means to have a functioning intelligence service. Rolling back massive restrictions in the wake of a trade deal would be catastrophic to that credibility, and trust in this institution is the main reason we have to believe Huawei is a threat in the first place.

I don’t know why the executive order was put in place. It’s genuinely plausible that the threat described in the order is real. It may be that Trump was simply speaking out of turn and the company won’t be part of any broader deal. But whatever the facts, it’s the President’s job to justify his actions to the public, to present these measures against Huawei as part of some broader plan undertaken for the good of the country. Trump’s executive order has caused immense chaos and concern, not just for Huawei but for its suppliers in America and users around the world. He owes those people an honest explanation for why this was done. So far, they haven’t gotten one."
Judge who upheld Trump subpoena donated to Dems on committee seeking the records,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/judge-who-ruled-against-trump-on-house-subpoenas-donated-to-dems-on-panel-that-requested-the-records,"The New York federal judge who ruled on Wednesday that the Trump administration must comply with two subpoenas from the House Financial Services and Intelligence Committees has donated in the past to a slew of big-name Democrats -- including two who currently sit on those committees, according to federal election filings.

After an hour of oral arguments, Barack Obama-appointed U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos ruled the subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and Capital One have ""a legitimate legislative purpose,"" and that Trump was unlikely to prevail in a lawsuit to quash the requests. Judges have the option to recuse themselves if there is an appearance of bias.

Federal election records show that, when he was a partner at the law firm Day Pitney LLP and before he was appointed to the bench in 2011, Ramos sent $350 to Connecticut Democrat Rep. Jim Himes from 2007 to 2008, as well as $500 to elect New York Rep. Nydia Velazquez in 2010.

Himes sits on both the Intelligence and Financial Services Committees, while Velazquez sits on Financial Services.

Ramos also contributed $1,000 to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand's Senate campaign in 2009, another $1,000 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and several thousand dollars over several years to Obama for America. His political donations apparently stopped after his elevation to the judgeship, in line with ethical standards.

Trump’s lawyers had asked Ramos to temporarily block Congress from gaining access to the records. They said it was a ""safe bet"" they would appeal his decision.

Ramos' ruling came two days after another federal judge in Washington upheld a separate congressional subpoena seeking financial documents dating back to 2011 from Trump accounting firm Mazars USA.

That judge, Obama appointee Amit Mehta, donated to the Obama-Biden campaign in 2012.

DEMS FUME AS FORMER WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL SKIPS HEARING

The White House has aggressively pushed back against Democrat-led investigations in the wake of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report, saying Democrats simply want a ""do-over"" of Mueller's lengthy investigation that ultimately found no evidence of any Trump-Russia collusion.

Trump this week blocked former White House lawyer Don McGhan, a central figure in Mueller's report, from appearing before the House Judiciary Committee.

Some congressional Republicans have also characterized the subpoenas as an abuse of authority and blasted the Trump-focused investigations.

Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, called the inquiry into Mazars USA ""an unprecedented abuse of the Committee’s subpoena authority to target and expose the private financial information of the President of the United States.”

Trump Officials Prepare to Bypass Congress to Sell Weapons to Gulf Nations,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Edward Wong', 'Catie Edmondson', 'Eric Schmitt']",05-23-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/us/politics/trump-saudi-arabia-arms-sales.html,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is preparing to circumvent Congress to allow the export to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates of billions of dollars of munitions that are now on hold, according to current and former American officials and legislators familiar with the plan.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and some political appointees in the State Department are pushing for the administration to invoke an emergency provision that would allow President Trump to prevent Congress from halting the sales, worth about $7 billion. The transactions, which include precision-guided munitions and combat aircraft, would infuriate lawmakers in both parties.

They would also further inflame tensions between the United States and Iran, which views Saudi Arabia as its main rival and has been supporting the Houthi rebels in Yemen in their campaign against a Saudi-led military coalition that includes the United Arab Emirates.

American legislators from both parties remain incensed by the Trump administration’s equivocal response to the grisly killing last October by Saudi agents of Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and Virginia resident. They are also frustrated by the administration’s role in supporting the Saudi-led coalition in the Yemen war, a four-year conflict that the United Nations has deemed the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, with thousands of civilians killed and millions suffering from famine."

Trump Gives Farmers $16 Billion in Aid Amid Prolonged China Trade War,https://www.nytimes.com,['Ana Swanson'],05-23-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/us/politics/farm-aid-package.html,"Benchmark indexes in China, Germany and France all dropped, with the S&P 500 falling 1.2 percent. American crude oil prices were down more than 5 percent, amid growing concern that the trade war would start to drag on global economic demand. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.29 percent at 3 p.m., according to Bloomberg data. That was its lowest closing level this year and a sign that investors were expecting lower levels of growth and inflation.

Hopes for a quick resolution to the China trade fight have faded, with both countries hardening their positions after a trade deal collapsed this month. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday that no additional meetings with Beijing were scheduled and that he was encouraging American firms to reorient their supply chains and source their products elsewhere.

Progress toward a trade agreement between the United States and China collapsed after American negotiators accused Beijing of reneging on terms it had previously committed to. Significant differences remain over how tariffs should be rolled back between the countries, and whether the negotiated provisions must be enshrined in Chinese law.

While both sides initially suggested they would continue talking, Beijing has also begun bracing for a long trade fight. In a defiant statement this week, China’s president, Xi Jinping, called for the Chinese people to begin a modern “long march,” invoking a time of hardship from the country’s history, which many China watchers viewed as a hardening of Beijing’s trade stance.

“I am growing more and more skeptical that there is a place where the two sides can come to a deal,” said Edward Alden, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. “If I look at the positions the two sides have taken at the moment, I do not see a path to a deal.”"
USDA staffers quit en masse as Trump administration eyes moving offices out of DC,https://www.foxnews.com,"[""Andrew O'Reilly""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/usda-staffers-quit-en-masse-as-trump-administration-eyes-moving-offices-out-of-dc,"Employees at the U.S. Department of Agriculture are quitting at a rapid clip as Secretary Sonny Perdue prepares to move forward with plans to relocate two offices far outside the Washington, D.C., Beltway.

Federal employees at the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) – two small but important agencies within the USDA – are unhappy with Perdue’s plan, announced last August, to move the majority of their staff from current offices in the capital to an area closer the country’s agricultural centers.

“This move does not serve a public purpose,” Peter Winch, a representative for the American Federation of Government Employees, a union that represents ERS workers, told Fox News. “Employees don’t want to move, and it doesn’t make sense for them to move.”

US FARMERS HURT BY TRADE WAR GETTING $16 BILLION BOOST, US AGRICULTURE SECRETARY SAYS

Winch added that since ERS employees joined AFGE earlier this month, six employees have already quit their jobs with the government agency in response to the planned move. He said overall staffing is down to 209 from 300 during the Obama administration.

A Washington Post report cited an estimate that the ERS used to see roughly one “non-retirement” departure per month – but that pace has doubled since October. NIFA reportedly has also seen people leave.

Perdue said in a statement to Fox News that the move was meant “to improve performance and the services these agencies provide.” The secretary of agriculture added that the planned move would bring the department’s scientists closer to “stakeholders” and “customers” such as Midwest farmers.

“It’s been our goal to make USDA the most effective, efficient, and customer-focused department in the entire federal government,” Perdue said. “We don’t undertake these relocations lightly, and we are doing it to improve performance and the services these agencies provide.”

Perdue added: “We will be placing important USDA resources closer to many stakeholders, most of whom live and work far from Washington, D.C. We will be saving money for the taxpayers and improving our ability to retain more employees in the long run.”

The goal of the ERS, however, is to provide statistical information to lawmakers in Washington, while NIFA works to fund hundreds of millions of dollar annually in research in the agricultural sector.

HISTORIC FLOODS IN MIDWEST HAVE FARMERS WORRIED ABOUT THEIR FUTURE

Congressional Democrats are scrambling to try and block the move.

“This parochial idea of, like, ‘Washington messes everything up. Let’s move it out of town’ overlooks the important role that this agency plays,” Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-Maine, a member of the House Agriculture Committee, told The Washington Post. “There’s just a heightened level of concern about this administration, generally, about data collection and science.”

Critics, including former USDA officials, say the move would weaken the agencies, reduce their influence with lawmakers and provide little benefit to the farming community.

Winch argued that weakening the agencies' influence in Washington is at least part of the point. The NIFA funds grants that go into researching the effects the agriculture sector has on climate change – which the Trump administration has tried to downplay – and Perdue was allegedly upset by NIFA’s policy to support LGBT members of the 4-H youth farming organization.

The president’s 2020 budget has also proposed slashing funding to ERS research from $87 million to $61 million and cutting 160 jobs, while Perdue has suggested moving the agency from under the USDA’s science arm to being supervised by the USDA’s chief economist, a political wing of the department.

“There is some sort of punitive motivation,” Winch said. “Someone has made a negative judgment about these agencies.”

Perdue and his staff have narrowed the list of places where the two agencies could go down to three from an original 130 -- with Kansas City, the state of Indiana and North Carolina’s research triangle in the Raleigh-Durham area on the shortlist. St. Louis, Mo., and Madison, Wis., are two alternate locations.

Perdue is expected to make the announcement of where the agencies will move as soon as Friday, but it remains unclear whether the two agencies will actually leave Washington.

The USDA’s own inspector general is currently looking into whether Perdue has the legal authority to move these agencies, while the House Appropriations Committee’s draft bill of agricultural appropriations, which was released earlier this week, prohibits the USDA from using funds to move agencies outside of the Washington area. Trump’s 2020 budget proposal wants $15.5 million to relocate ERS and $9.5 million to relocate NIFA.

“We continue to believe that the USDA lacks the legal authority to carry out this proposal,” Rep. Steny H. Hoyer, D-Md., and Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., said in a statement earlier this spring. “However, even if it had such authority, USDA has not done the proper analysis of the cost and benefits, and this proposal will harm agriculture research and our constituents.”"

Among the charges are three counts that Assange violated the Espionage Act, which prohibits the disclosure of national defense information. | Jack Taylor/Getty Images legal DOJ accuses Assange of violating Espionage Act

The Justice Department has hit WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange with Espionage Act charges, escalating a legal fight against the high-profile activist and alarming press freedom activists.

DOJ had previously only indicted Assange on a single count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. Thursday’s revelation of the additional 18 charges, filed in the Eastern District of Virginia, means Assange could face significantly more prison time if found guilty.

Story Continued Below

The alleged Espionage Act violations relate to Assange’s complicity with Chelsea Manning, a former U.S. Army soldier who was convicted in July 2013 of violating the Espionage Act after she shuttled troves of classified government information to WikiLeaks. Officials said Assange solicited the information from and then brazenly published details that put the government's human sources at risk, disregarding explicit warnings from the government.

Traditionally, the Espionage Act has been used against government officials, like Manning, who reveal such classified information, rather than the journalists or foreign nationals who publish the information.

As a result, the use of the Espionage Act against Assange set off alarm bells among press freedom activists on Thursday. While WikiLeaks isn’t a conventional news organization, press advocates have long feared that charging Assange for the publication of government secrets could open the door to prosecuting reporters for doing the same.

""Any government use of the Espionage Act to criminalize the receipt and publication of classified information poses a dire threat to journalists seeking to publish such information in the public interest, irrespective of the Justice Department’s assertion that Assange is not a journalist,"" said Bruce Brown, executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, in a statement.

Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who also touched off a debate about the media's role in publishing secret files when he leaked classified information to reporters in 2013, proclaimed: “the Department of Justice just declared war – not on Wikileaks, but on journalism itself.”

John Demers, head of DOJ’s national security division, pushed back at that argument on Thursday, insisting Assange is “not a journalist,” and alleging that the WikiLeaks founder “purposely published names he knew to be confidential human sources in warzones.”

It's a debate that Justice Department officials have grappled with for years. The Obama administration previously looked into bringing similar charges against Assange, but decided against it.

“We didn’t bring this [Espionage Act] case for a couple of reasons,"" said Matt Miller, an Obama-era DOJ spokesman. ""First, we thought it was a dangerous precedent to prosecute Assange for something that reporters do all the time. We didn’t believe Assange was a journalist, but the Espionage Act doesn’t make any distinction between journalists and others, so if you can apply it to Assange, there’s no real reason you couldn’t apply it to [The New York Times]. Second, and it’s related, it’s not at all clear that charging someone with the publication of classified information could survive court scrutiny.”

Assange’s legal case took off in April after Ecuador revoked its seven-year asylum, forcing him out of the embassy in London and paving the way for his extradition to the United States for one of the biggest ever leaks of classified information. Justice Department officials said they could not comment on how this might affect Assange’s extradition from the U.K. to the U.S.

Among Thursday's charges are three counts that Assange violated the Espionage Act, which prohibits the disclosure of national defense information. The Justice Department alleged that Assange published select State Department cables that contained the unredacted names of human sources in Iran, China and Syria. He also published Afghan activity reports and Iraq activity reports that endangered local Afghans and Iraqis, prosecutors alleged.

“It was explicitly stated in the State Department cables that the identity of sources was to be protected,” a Justice Department official told reporters on Thursday. “Assange was warned by the State Department not to release the names but he did so nevertheless.”

However, the government has not identified any individuals who were directly killed a result of Assange's disclosures. The U.S. counterintelligence official who led the Pentagon's review of the bombshell leaks told a court during Manning’s sentencing hearing in 2013 that investigators had not been able to find any such instances.

Still, Zach Terwilliger, the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, stressed that the government was “not charging Assange for passively obtaining classified information.” Rather, he is being prosecuted for publishing “a narrow set of classified documents in which Assange also published the names of innocent people who risked their safety” to help the United States.

“Assange is not charged simply because he is a publisher,” Terwilliger told reporters on Thursday.

Prosecutors said Manning had contacted Assange as early as November 2009, responding ""to Assange’s solicitation of classified information made through the WikiLeaks website."" The appeal included a “Military and Intelligence Most Wanted Leaks” category that solicited CIA detainee interrogation videos.

Assange also encouraged Manning to transfer him Guantanamo Bay detainee assessment briefs in March 2010, according to chats obtained by the government, as well as Iraq rule of engagement files and 75,000 Afghanistan war-related significant activity reports.

John Brown, the FBI assistant director for national security, said the indictment was “the result of nearly a decade” of work.

The original Assange indictment, brought in March 2018 and unsealed in April of this year, charged the WikiLeaks founder with conspiring with Manning to hack a government computer to obtain hundreds of thousands of U.S. military reports about U.S. wars in the Middle East. WikiLeaks later published the leaked information.

Assange faces up to 10 years in prison on each count.

Manning was jailed in March after being held in contempt by a judge in Virginia for refusing to testify before a grand jury about Assange. She is still in prison, and DOJ officials would not comment on her situation on Thursday.

US is considering duties on countries that undervalue their currencies,https://www.cnbc.com,[],05-24-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/24/us-is-considering-duties-on-countries-that-undervalue-their-currencies.html,"The U.S. Commerce Department said on Thursday it was proposing a new rule to impose anti-subsidy duties on products from countries that undervalue their currencies against the dollar, another move that could slap higher tariffs on Chinese products.

The new rule also could put goods from other countries at risk of higher tariffs, including Japan, South Korea, India, Germany and Switzerland.

Those countries, along with China, were all listed on the Treasury Department's semi-annual currency report's ""monitoring list,"" which tracks currency market interventions, high global current account surpluses and high bilateral trade surpluses.

The department said its proposed rule would amend the normal countervailing duty process to include new criteria for currency undervaluation. Trump administration officials have long viewed China's yuan as undervalued against the dollar, despite the U.S.-China trade war, which foreign currency experts say has hurt the yuan's value.

""This change puts foreign exporters on notice that the Department of Commerce can countervail currency subsidies that harm U.S. industries,"" Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement.

""Foreign nations would no longer be able to use currency policies to the disadvantage of American workers and businesses,"" he said.

It was a step toward making good on a campaign promise by U.S. President Donald Trump to address unfair currency practices, Ross said.

The department did not identify the specific criteria that it would use to evaluate whether U.S. pricing of a product was artificially low because of currency undervaluation."
How Much Political Experience Does It Take to Be Elected President?,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Maggie Astor', 'Alicia Parlapiano']",05-23-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/05/23/us/politics/presidential-experience.html,"Highest previous position 2020 candidates Presidents elected Most recently elected Senator 7 2008 House member 2 1880 Governor 10 2000 Mayor 0 (never) No political or military experience 1 2016 Cabinet member 6 1928 Vice president 5 1988 General officer 4 1952 Notes: Does not include the nine vice presidents who assumed the presidency after the death or resignation of the previous president.

From highest to lowest, we ranked the positions as follows: vice president, cabinet member, governor or senator, House member, mayor. No tiebreakers were needed between governor and senator.

You’ve never seen a House member elected president. Neither have your parents — nor, in all likelihood, their parents. The last time it happened, there were 38 states and electricity was a novelty.

The year was 1880, the congressman James Garfield. The 14 decades since are littered with the failed campaigns of House members who thought they could replicate his feat.

But that hasn’t stopped six more from trying this year, a full quarter of the Democratic field.

As for what Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, the most recent addition to the candidate throng, is trying to do: Well, no one has ever done it. Never in American history has a sitting mayor been elected president, or even received a major party’s nomination. But three — Mr. de Blasio, Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Wayne Messam of Miramar, Fla. — are running now.

In 2016, when Republicans had a field almost as big as the Democrats do now, it included no House members or mayors. Of the 17 candidates, nine were sitting or former governors, and five were sitting or former senators.

But, of course, all those governors and senators lost to Donald J. Trump, who had no political experience at all. Before Mr. Trump was elected, no one had ever become president without a background in government or the military. Now, it’s harder to say what the bar is — or whether voters care.

As the chart above shows, a small number of offices have produced the vast majority of our presidents. A governorship is the most common steppingstone. This year, though, only three of the 23 Democratic candidates are (or were) governors, and all of them are trailing in polls.

While the vice presidency might seem the most obvious launching pad for the presidency, only five people have done what Joseph R. Biden Jr. is trying to do now: get elected after completing his vice presidency. Fourteen presidents were previously vice presidents, but nine of them took over when a president died or resigned. (Four of those nine went on to win a full term.)

Cabinet secretaries were elected president much more often in the early days of the republic than they are now. Hillary Clinton came close in 2016. But of the six presidents whose highest previous office was in the cabinet, four were elected before 1850, and the most recent, Herbert Hoover, was elected almost 100 years ago.

Senators occupy an interesting space in modern presidential history: frequently nominated but rarely elected. Since 1960, Americans have elected only two senators — John F. Kennedy and Barack Obama — to the presidency, but five more received their party’s nomination. This year, however, seven are running for the Democratic nomination, and most of the front-runners are among them.

By the time you get down to the House, the history is paper-thin, and thinner still for rank-and-file members. Garfield, the last House member elected, was a committee chairman.

But the six 2020 candidates in this category have one thing going for them: They are not the least experienced in the pack.

Two of their competitors, Marianne Williamson and Andrew Yang, are following a path on which nobody but Mr. Trump has been successful: They are running for president with no political or military experience at all."
Why Trump’s new $16B farmer bailout could hurt agriculture,https://www.politico.com,"['Catherine Boudreau', 'Ryan Mccrimmon', 'Liz Crampton']",05-23-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/23/trump-farmer-bailout-trade-usda-1459840,"Many farmers are still contemplating what to produce this spring and could be swayed toward crops that receive higher payouts from the trade package, such as soybeans. | Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images agriculture Why Trump’s new $16B farmer bailout could hurt agriculture

President Donald Trump's snap decision to send billions of dollars in new aid to farmers could be bad for the farm economy and the federal budget.

Many farmers are still deciding what to plant this spring and could be swayed toward crops that receive higher payouts from the aid package, such as soybeans. That would add to already record supplies and further depress prices that have been falling for five years.

Story Continued Below

Trump tweeted about the new bailout for farmers earlier this month, soon after he decided to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of imports from China and Beijing retaliated by raising duties on $60 billion in U.S. products, many of them agricultural. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, who weeks earlier denied the White House was discussing another round of aid so soon after a $12 billion bailout last year, suddenly interrupted a trip to South Korea to announce a second program.

Farm groups are headed to the White House on Thursday afternoon to join Trump as he announces a $16 billion boost for agriculture. The American Farm Bureau Federation and groups representing soybean, corn, wheat and pork producers are expected to attend, as well as lawmakers including Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.), who has worked closely with the administration on the aid package.

“We want to make sure that the farmers are being protected as we go through the process of negotiating new trade deals,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Wednesday outside the White House.

But the Trump administration’s decision to roll out the program now is drawing critics.

Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, told reporters Wednesday that the White House should have been more cautious about the timing of the announcement because farmers are still planting.

“[W]e want farmers to make decisions on how many acres of corn and soybeans to plant based on the market and not something the government’s doing,” he said.

“The timing couldn’t have been worse,” said Jonathan Coppess, an agricultural policy professor at the University of Illinois, and a former head of the USDA Farm Service Agency during the Obama administration.

Rainfall in the Midwest has delayed planting, so many farmers can still switch up their crops. Even the prospect of another round of trade assistance could encourage them to plant more soybeans, Coppess said.

""There is certainly enough experience at USDA to know that announcing payments during planting might well cause more problems,"" Coppess said.

USDA’s first trade aid package sent the bulk of direct payments to soybeans given the significant damage that China’s 25 percent tariff on U.S. imports has done to prices and demand. China, the world’s top pork producer, is expected to need fewer soybeans to feed its hogs this year because African swine fever has forced the government to kill more than a million animals.

This year, the amount of money farmers receive will largely depend on the county in which they live in, instead of what they grow, the USDA announced on Thursday.

USDA officials estimated the amount of economic damage inflicted on different counties as a result of the trade disputes and will multiply that by what was planted in the area this year.

“We wanted to make sure producers are planting for the market,” Bill Northey, USDA undersecretary for farm production and conservation, told reporters Thursday.

The 2018 trade package was based on what crops farmers actually planted that season — bucking Congress' efforts over the years to make subsidy programs more market-oriented by tying them to farmers' average historical acres and yields.

The aid programs in both years primarily involve sending direct payments to farmers and ranchers using funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation, a Depression-era financial institution under the USDA that has broad authority to stabilize the farm economy.

But it is unclear whether the CCC has enough borrowing authority to fund another tariff-relief program. It is only allowed to borrow $30 billion per fiscal year from the U.S. Treasury to fund its work, and last year’s bailout used a big chunk of that. The CCC also is used to fund traditional farm subsidies authorized every five years by Congress.

Lawmakers last September included language in a short-term spending bill that effectively gave the CCC more flexibility to keep money flowing.

Hoeven, who chairs the Senate Appropriations subpanel overseeing USDA, told reporters last week that Congress can easily reimburse the financial institution if needed.

Trump is using taxpayer money to help just one industry harmed by trade policy. Other industries reeling from the tariff battles, from car manufacturers to shoe retailers, are not expected to receive financial aid.

Some farmers recognize the disparity, and stress that they would prefer to have open access to markets.

""We prefer that over a check from the government,"" said Mark Watne, president of the North Dakota Farmers Union. ""But right now, our own government is making our demand go down. We can't control that.""

To literally no one’s surprise, the head of the Federal Communications Commission on Monday announced Monday that he’d recommend approving the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint. But it now looks as if the Justice Department’s own attorneys vehemently oppose the merger.



Reuters reported Wednesday that the DOJ’s antitrust division has recommended filing a lawsuit to block the $26.5 billion deal. Citing two sources familiar with the matter, the news agency said the division’s staff have long been “skeptical” of the proposed merger, in that it does not appear to be in the best interests of consumers.

Per Reuters: “T-Mobile has a reputation for aggressively seeking to cut prices and improve service to woo customers away from market leaders Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc, and staff may want to preserve that dynamic.”

Ajit Pai, the FCC chairman, said earlier that commitments by T-Mobile and Sprint to close “the digital divide in rural America” and advance “United States leadership in 5G, the next generation in wireless connectivity,” has persuaded him to approve the deal.

FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr—only days after accepting an award from the nation’s largest wireless industry trade association—announced that he, too, was also swayed by the companies’ commitments and would support the chairman’s decision.

Praising his “ongoing leadership,” T-Mobile CEO John Legere thanked Pai for his support in a statement Monday, while promising the commitments T-Mobile agreed to are “verifiable, enforceable and specific.” But consumer advocacy groups and legal experts following the news disagreed entirely.

“Rather than actually examine the competitive impact, Chairman Pai’s recommended approval points to T-Mobile’s commitments and behavioral conditions,” said Yosef Getachew, media and democracy program director for Common Cause. “Not only are these commitments and conditions unenforceable and riddled with loopholes, they do nothing to address the blatant competitive harms the merger poses to consumers.”

Gigi Sohn, a counselor to former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, echoed those concerns in a Wired op-ed this week, writing that Legere’s assurances “are speculative, unsubstantiated, and entirely unenforceable.” Sohn went on to call T-Mobile’s vow not to raise prices for three years an “admission” that, should the merger be approved, “there would not be enough competition in the wireless market to constrain price increases.”

Pai’s announcement was also rebuked by, among others, New America’s Open Technology Institute and the Rural Wireless Association. FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, who is Democrat, compared the merger to “consolidation in airlines and with drug companies,” which she argued, “hasn’t worked out well for consumers.”

“The inadequate conditions [Pai] and his fellow GOP commissioners so readily and rapidly blessed are a tiny Band-Aid on what would be a fatal wound to wireless competition and affordability in this country,” said Matt Wood, vice president of policy at the advocacy group Free Press. “DOJ’s staff seems to get that, even if some of the political appointees leading the FCC don’t.”"
Mnuchin’s excuse for delaying the Harriet Tubman $20 bill is insulting,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Editorial Board', 'May At Pm']",05-23-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/put-harriet-tubman-on-the-20-bill-now-to-wait-until-2028-is-insulting/2019/05/23/727a66fa-7d8a-11e9-8bb7-0fc796cf2ec0_story.html,"WHEN THEN-TREASURY Secretary Jack Lew decided in 2016 to put Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill, he knew it would be up to the next administration to implement the change. But it seemed highly unlikely that anyone would upend a plan to honor this great American hero with a currency redesign that would also include depictions of historic events such as the suffragist march on Washington. “I don’t think somebody’s going to probably want to do that — to take the image of Harriet Tubman off of our money? To take the image of the suffragists off?” Mr. Lew said incredulously.

No one can blame him for a failure to imagine that any future administration would be so petty and narrow-minded as to go out of its way to thumb its nose at women, minorities and history. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin disclosed to Congress on Wednesday that redesign of the $20 bill to include an image of the former slave and leader of the Underground Railroad, slated for next year to mark the 100th anniversary of women’s suffrage in the United States, has been pushed back to 2028. Tubman was selected following a massive grass-roots campaign to include a woman on U.S. paper currency.

The explanation Mr. Mnuchin offered for the delay — the need for more time for “counterfeiting issues” — would be laughable if it were not so insulting. Are we really expected to believe that the administration, one that boasts about its can-do capabilities, needs eight more years to implement a new design? If indeed counterfeiting matters are the primary reason for currency design, shouldn’t you start with the $20 bill, since it is one of the most widely circulated?

It is more likely that Mr. Mnuchin, as the New York Times reported, feared President Trump would cause an uproar with an outright cancellation of a bill bearing Tubman’s image. As a candidate, Mr. Trump criticized the decision as “political correctness,” and he has made no secret of his admiration for President Andrew Jackson, whose image Tubman would have dislodged from the front of the $20 bill.

Some would argue there are bigger issues facing the country than who is on the $20 bill, and no doubt the administration is guilty of far more serious offenses. But symbols matter. Backpedaling on putting the first African American woman on paper money tells women and girls and people of color that they don’t — and never have — mattered. Mr. Trump has found yet another way to show that he does not really aspire to be president of all Americans."
USDA farms out economists whose work challenges Trump policies,https://www.politico.com,"['Liz Crampton', 'Quint Forgey', 'Burgess Everett', 'John Bresnahan', 'Nancy Cook']",05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/22/usda-agriculture-economists-trump-policies-1340168,"Following Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue's announcement of a staff relocation within the department, employees have been wondering who would be able to stay in Washington. | Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo agriculture USDA farms out economists whose work challenges Trump policies Those who examine the impact of tariffs, climate change and taxes on rural America are among employees being relocated.

The Agriculture Department is moving nearly all its researchers into the economic effects of climate change, trade policy and food stamps – subjects of controversial Trump administration initiatives – outside of Washington, part of what employees claim is a political crackdown on economists whose assessments have raised questions about the president’s policies.

Since last year, employees in the department’s Economic Research Service have awaited news of which members of their agency would be forced to relocate, after Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue stunned them by declaring he was moving most of the agency to a location outside the capital. The announcement sparked claims that Perdue was trying to pressure economists into leaving the agency rather than move their families.

Story Continued Below

On March 5, the department began notifying people who were allowed to stay in Washington, but didn’t provide a comprehensive list, only telling employees in person if they made the cut.

But current and former employees compiled one anyway, covering all 279 people on staff, 76 of whom are being allowed to stay in Washington.

The current and former employees, all of whom requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation, say the specialties of those who are being asked to move corresponds closely to the areas where economic assessments often clash with the president’s policies, including tax policies, climate change, and the farm economy. The list, shared exclusively with POLITICO, shows a clear emphasis was placed on keeping employees whose work covers relatively non-controversial issues like crop planting over those whose research focused on areas sensitive to the administration.

“This was a clear politicization of the agency many of us loved for its non-partisan research and analysis,” a current ERS employee told POLITICO, claiming that department leaders picked those whose work was more likely to offend the administration and forced them to move “out or quit.”

A former researcher who left last month in anticipation of being moved put it this way: “You can draw the conclusion that these are the less valued activities that are undertaken by ERS. They view ERS as being useful in that it produces data and statistics that can inform policy but the research that’s done by the economists and geographers and statisticians at ERS is less valuable and that they’re not concerned with a significant deterioration in ERS’ ability to do research.”

A USDA spokesman declined to directly address the employees’ allegation of political bias, but provided a written statement from Perdue saying that the moves were not prompted by the work being done by ERS

“None of this reflects on the jobs being done by our . . . employees, and in fact, I frequently tell my Cabinet colleagues that USDA has the best workforce in the federal government,” Perdue said. “These changes are more steps down the path to better service to our customers, and will help us fulfill our informal motto to ‘Do right and feed everyone. . .”

“We don’t undertake these relocations lightly, and we are doing it to improve performance and the services these agencies provide. We will be placing important USDA resources closer to many stakeholders, most of whom live and work far from Washington, D.C. We will be saving money for the taxpayers and improving our ability to retain more employees in the long run. And we are increasing the probability of attracting highly-qualified staff with training and interests in agriculture, many of whom come from land-grant universities.”

But employees claim the department’s leadership, including Perdue, turned against the research service after an estimate early last year suggested that the Republican-backed tax plan would largely benefit the wealthiest farmers.

Perdue’s decision to move ERS came several months after news outlets highlighted the USDA study on the Republican tax changes. In response to Perdue’s move, cities from all over the country submitted bids to host the ERS and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which will also move. The finalists, announced May 3, were the greater Kansas City area, North Carolina‘s Research Triangle Park and multiple locations in Indiana.

Accompanying his announcement of a final selection, which is expected as early as this week, Perdue has promised to provide Congress with a cost-benefit analysis detailing why USDA says the move makes financial sense.

The impending announcement comes as pressure builds on Capitol Hill to stop the move. On Thursday, the House Appropriations Committee is scheduled to consider a spending bill that includes a provision barring the Agriculture Department from moving the two agencies out of the national capital zone. It also would block Perdue’s decision to put ERS under the control of USDA’s chief economist, a move that placed oversight of the agency closer to the secretary’s office.

Employees said that moving nearly all researchers out of Washington would have a clear impact on the agency’s work. Researchers said they usually draw on information from other USDA divisions, members of Congress and Washington-based stakeholder groups, which would be more difficult from a remote location. Allowing 76 members of the agency to stay in Washington while the other left also impacts morale, they said, and limits collaboration.

Among the employees staying in Washington are senior analysts who conduct global market and crop-outlook estimates and administrative personnel. According to the list, approximately 49 percent of agricultural economists will be allowed to remain in Washington, compared with 14 percent of researchers.

Rumors had been swirling among staff for months about who would be allowed to remain in Washington when all ERS employees were called into an auditorium in March to be briefed by Acting Administrator Chris Hartley. He then read aloud the names of those who qualified to stay. But it wasn’t until employees compiled a full roster of who was staying and going that they got a clear picture of how the agency would be split up.

Decisions on who would stay in Washington were made by ERS leadership and approved by Perdue, according to a “Frequently Asked Questions” document distributed at the March meeting. The FAQ states that “every ERS employee had the ability to provide input” on the move. Senior managers “proposed critical ERS functions” that they believed needed to remain in Washington.

Some employees said that description of the decision-making process validates their concerns that Perdue was behind the move.

“They went in and handpicked who they wanted and called them ‘critical,’” said a current ERS employee.

Neil Conklin, a former senior administrator at ERS under the George W. Bush administration, said the agency stands to be fundamentally changed by the relocation.

“This is going to be very destructive of the agency, as certainly as we’ve known it,” Conklin said.

Dem rebuked after calling child deaths ‘intentional’ in fiery exchange with DHS boss,https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dem-rebuked-after-calling-child-deaths-intentional-in-fiery-exchange-with-dhs-boss,"A hearing of the House Homeland Security Committee came to a screeching halt Wednesday when a Democrat had her words struck from the record after calling the deaths of children in custody at the border an ""intentional"" policy decision.

Rep. Lauren Underwood's questioning of Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan was contentious from the beginning, when the Illinois lawmaker asked him about the effects of separating children from their families at the border. She closed by claiming that the continued poor conditions in which children allegedly were being kept, and the recent death of a fifth child in custody, showed that this was the administration's goal.

US CLOSES TEXAS PROCESSING CENTER AMID FLU OUTBREAK AFTER TEEN MIGRANT'S DEATH

""At this point, with five kids that have died, 5,000 separated from their families, I feel like, and the evidence is really clear, this is intentional,"" Underwood said. ""It's a policy choice being made on purpose by this administration, and it's cruel and inhumane.""

McAleenan fired back, disputing Underwood's characterization.

""That's an appalling accusation, and our men and women fight hard to protect people in our custody every single day,"" he said. McAleenan added that his department asked for resources prior to the latest fatality and that Congress has not responded. He also said that DHS asked for changes ""that would have prevented this from happening.""

Underwood's comments were in reference to the government's announcement that a 16-year-old Guatemalan died Monday at a South Texas Border Patrol station. He was diagnosed with the flu on Sunday at a border facility, which was then temporarily closed.

Last week, a 2-year-old died after he and his mother were detained. Government officials said the child was taken to the hospital the same day his mother reported he was sick, and he was in the hospital for weeks. On April 30, a 16-year-old boy also died after officials at a Health and Human Services detention facility noticed that he was sick.

Underwood was given an opportunity to clarify her remarks, and she said the same thing, using virtually identical language. ""With five children dead and 5,000 separated from their families, this is intentional. It's a policy choice being made on purpose by this administration, and it's cruel and inhumane,"" she reiterated.

Ranking Member Mike Rogers, R-Ala., came to McAleenan's defense, calling out Underwood for her remarks.

""Mr. Chairman, you cannot impugn the character of the witness by stating that he intentionally murders children,"" he said. ""That is completely inappropriate, and her words should be taken down. She was very explicit.""

Underwood defended herself, saying she did not use the word ""murder,"" but said that deaths were the result of policy choices.

""He has said that he stands by the policy decisions of this administration, that's what he said at the beginning of his testimony.""

McAleenan said he ""did not say that at all.""

FORMER OBAMA DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY ON INCREASING NUMBER OF BORDER APPREHENSIONS

Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., first allowed Underwood's words to remain on the record, stating that ""the language is approprite and that it should not be taken down.""

This eventually led to a vote over whether to take down Underwood's words from the record.

After a 9-7 vote, Underwood's words were taken down.

Underwood later took to Twitter to comment on what happened.

""For over a year, it’s been clear that policies at the border have harmed the physical and mental health of migrant children,"" she said. ""I believe, at this point, failure to change these broken policies based on that knowledge is intentional and unacceptable.""

The Justice Department remains open to the $26.5 billion merger of T-Mobile and Sprint despite reports that it was leaning toward rejection, sources told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin.

Makan Delrahim, head of the DOJ's antitrust division, is still talking with the companies and may be trying to find a way to support a deal despite his staff's opposition, the sources said.

Discussions about possible remedies are ongoing. But what kind of remedies — beyond what the companies committed to as part of a deal with the Federal Communications Commission — remain unclear.

Shares of Sprint jumped 4.6% in Thursday's premarket following Sorkin's report. T-Mobile shares were up nearly 1%.

Earlier this week, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, elevated to the top post by President Donald Trump in 2017, said he plans to recommend his agency approve the merger after the companies committed to not raising prices for three years.

It's possible, according to Sorkin's reporting, that the DOJ could push for more years on no price hikes, for example.

The Obama administration rebuffed earlier efforts by the companies to merge, as well as an attempted deal between AT&T and T-Mobile, on concerns that such deals would hurt competition in the wireless industry.

Trump crossed that line this month when he pardoned Michael Behenna , who had been sentenced to prison in 2009 for unpremeditated murder in the killing of an Iraqi detainee and released on parole in 2014 after his sentence was reduced.

That Trump is considering other pardons for military crimes on a short timeline before Memorial Day took the Department of Justice and the Pentagon by surprise and added new context to the pardon power, which he's already used to reward political allies and send political messages.

Here's a look at the history and practice of presidential pardons for service members.

Trump's praise for war crimes, shooting deserters

JUST WATCHED Trump tweets debunked legend about US general Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump tweets debunked legend about US general 01:25

This issue first and foremost recalls Trump's repeated endorsement of behavior that could easily be classified as war criminal.

During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump admiringly repeated an apocryphal story about Gen. John Pershing shooting Muslim prisoners with bullets dipped in pig blood -- because it violated Muslim law -- in the Philippines more than 100 years ago

wasn't a true story, but the point is that Trump liked it. He liked the idea of US troops killing 49 prisoners and disrespecting their religion in order to make the 50th tell other people what had happened. It probably wasn't a true story, but the point is that Trump liked it. He liked the idea of US troops killing 49 prisoners and disrespecting their religion in order to make the 50th tell other people what had happened.

It would also be a war crime to shoot prisoners.

Trump said US soldier Bowe Bergdahl, who had been held as a prisoner of war for years in Afghanistan, should be shot for desertion after he walked off his base in 2009. A military court gave Bergdahl no additional prison time after he pleaded guilty.

The new chapter in the annals of Trump and military justice is the news, first reported in The New York Times, that he's considering pardons for two American service members who are anticipating trial on murder charges.

He's also looking at the case of Marines convicted of urinating on dead bodies and the case of a contractor, once employed by Erik Prince's now-defunct Blackwater security company, convicted in federal court of first-degree murder for his role in the killing of 14 Iraqis in 2007.

But it is the idea of pardons for accused service members who have not yet gone to trial and been convicted that is raising the most concern for some military law experts.

Army Maj. Matthew Golsteyn divulged his role in the killing of a bomb maker in Afghanistan during a job interview with the CIA and subsequently in a Fox News interview. The Army says the killing was premeditated and Golsteyn is set to stand trial. He could face the death penalty.

Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher is charged with stabbing a wounded man to death, shooting at a male and female noncombatant and obstructing justice while deployed in Iraq. His own teammates turned him in, but Gallagher, who has pleaded not guilty, has found defenders in the media and on Capitol Hill.

Navy SEAL Chief Edward Gallagher is charged with murder of Iraqi civilians.

He was allowed to leave the brig after Trump tweeted about the case. The President also tweeted about Golsteyn.

The closest a modern president has come to a pardon for war crimes was Richard Nixon's treatment of William Calley, who was convicted of premeditated murder for his role in the Vietnam War My Lai massacre of unarmed civilians in 1968. Nixon released him to house arrest and his life sentence was commuted by Nixon's secretary of the army, Howard Calloway

The first difficulty of assessing war crimes in the US is that there is no commonly accepted definition of the term and the US is not a party to the Rome Statute, which created the International Criminal Court in 1998. In fact, the Trump administration recently revoked visas for the International Criminal Court chief prosecutor, which CNN reported was part of an effort by the US to deter ICC actions against US service members in Afghanistan.

That doesn't mean the US military is not prosecuting those suspected of war crimes, according to Chris Jenks, a law professor at the Southern Methodist University Dedman School of Law who is a former Army judge advocate. Jenks is an expert in the law of armed conflict who wrote about possible Trump pardons for the Just Security blog . He answered some questions about Trump's possible move and what it could mean for the military justice system.

What is a war crime and are US service members charged with war crimes?

Lt. William Calley walks from Fort Benning, GA. stockade, April 1, 1971. Calley was convicted for his part in the 1968 My Lai massacre incident of the Vietnam War. President Richard Nixon ordered him placed under house arrest during appeal.

""As a general proposition, when people say war crimes within the international legal community, what we're talking about is serious violations of the law of armed conflict or international humanitarian law, serious violations of the laws of war,"" said Jenks.

He pointed out that Calley was not charged with a war crime, but rather hundreds of charges of murder. Similarly, he said Sgt. Robert Bales, who killed 16 Afghan civilians , was charged with multiple counts of murder, even though, as Jenks said, ""I would tell you under international law definitions Sgt. Bales committed one or more war crimes.""

Is there any precedent for what Trump is doing?

""In terms of has there ever been an instance where the commander in chief has preemptively pardoned a US service member facing a court-martial for murder? No, I'm not aware of that,"" said Jenks.

""You have an entire military justice apparatus,"" he said, which is set up to make sure justice is served. It starts with the Navy SEALs who reported Gallagher, for example, continues through the Naval Criminal Investigative Service agents who collected evidence and the admiral who recommended that Gallagher be prosecuted.

""What's the point of having the military justice system if it's not allowed to operate?"" asked Jenks. ""What are you saying to the commanders and the judge advocates who participate in the process when you don't let the military justice process proceed?""

Are there adequate protections for US service members accused of war crimes?

Given that American service members are operating in war zones, it's important that they have protection from the US government.

""If there was ever a circumstance by which I was accused of serious wrongdoing and I was offered a choice of being prosecuted in a state court, a federal court, or a military court, I would run to a military court because of the protections and the process that it affords service members, frankly, well in excess of the protections and processes that are afforded in state and federal court,"" said Jenks.

He said there is a larger problem underlying Trump's potential pardons, which is that service members are standing accused of these crimes but also standing in judgment of each other.

""The broader unstated point is the President and those who support pardons are trying to position themselves as this is an us against them. But when you think about who is the us and who is the them -- it's US service members on both sides of this equation.""

He argued that after the criminal justice system is allowed to work, the decision to pardon becomes a matter of judgment. There is precedent for preemptive pardons, however. More on that in a moment.

Retired Army Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling said on CNN that usurping the military justice system will hurt the military as a whole.

""If you lose control of your forces, you're no longer a military force, you're just a mob,"" said Hertling, a CNN analyst.

Chelsea Manning and war crimes

Obama did not pardon but rather commuted the sentence of Chelsea Manning, the convicted leaker of classified information to WikiLeaks -- drawing widespread criticism since Manning arguably jeopardized national security. Supporters argue she uncovered US war crimes , like the killing of Iraqi civilians, including two who worked for Reuters. In that instance, perhaps proving how difficult and rare it is for the military to seek charges against its members, the only charges that were brought after an investigation into those killings were the ones against Manning for her leaks.

Unrelated to her commutation, Manning was ordered back to jail this month after refusing to testify before a grand jury as part of a federal investigation into Julian Assange and WikiLeaks.

Confederates and draft dodgers pardoned

There have been massive military-related pardons in American history. President Andrew Johnson pardoned Confederate soldiers after the Civil War . More than 100 years later, President Jimmy Carter essentially pardoned Confederate President Jefferson Davis by posthumously restoring his citizenship. Carter also, on his first day in office, pardoned draft dodgers after Vietnam."
I.R.S. Memo Undercuts Mnuchin on Withholding Trump’s Tax Returns,https://www.nytimes.com,['Alan Rappeport'],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/us/politics/irs-memo-trump-taxes.html,"WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service has no choice but to honor congressional requests for President Trump’s tax returns unless he invokes executive privilege to protect them, according to a draft legal memo written by agency staff members.

The memo appears to undercut the reasoning offered by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has refused to comply with Democrats’ requests because they lack a “legitimate legislative purpose.” Mr. Mnuchin said he made his decision after consulting with lawyers from the Treasury Department, the I.R.S. and the Justice Department.

But the I.R.S. memo says the Treasury secretary does not have the authority to deny tax-writing committees’ requests for taxpayer returns.

The House Ways and Means Committee is seeking six years of the president’s personal and business tax returns. Mr. Trump has not asserted executive privilege to block the request, and his personal lawyers have asked the Treasury Department not to release them. The president has indicated that he is prepared to take the legal fight over his returns to the Supreme Court."

Trump administration announces $16 billion farm aid plan to offset trade war losses,https://www.reuters.com,"['Humeyra Pamuk', 'Min Read']",05-23-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-aid/u-s-aid-program-to-use-16-billion-to-boost-farmers-expand-markets-usdas-perdue-idUSKCN1ST1F6,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Thursday unveiled a $16 billion farm aid package to offset losses from a 10-month trade war with China and said payment rates to farmers would be determined by where they farm rather than what crops they grow.

The package, the bulk of which will be spent on direct payments, surprised growers and traders who had expected to learn separate payment rates for soybeans, hogs, corn and other crops in the Department of Agriculture (USDA) briefing.

Many farm groups welcomed the move, but called for a trade deal with China as soon as possible. Some Democrats have slammed the plan, calling it a ‘band-aid’ and said the county-based payment system could leave some farmers with reduced aid.

Farmers, a key constituency that helped carry U.S. President Donald Trump to his 2016 electoral win, have been among the hardest hit from a trade dispute with China, once a destination for more than 60 percent of U.S. soybean exports.

“The farmers have been attacked by China,” Trump said in a press conference about the aid package. “But the $16 billion of funds will ... make clear that no country has veto on America’s economic and national security,” he said.

The trade dispute, which escalated this month after Washington and Beijing hiked tariffs on imports of each other’s goods, has left U.S. farmers sitting on record volumes of soybeans with China halting purchases.

USDA officials said on Thursday they will roll out $14.5 billion in direct payments in three separate tranches with the first one planned for late July.

“The package we are announcing today ensures that farmers will not bear the brunt of those trade practices by China or any other nations,” Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue said. “While farmers would tell you they’d rather have trade not aid, without the trade ... they’re going to need some support.”

China, the world’s top soybean importer, curbed purchases of U.S. soy last year when Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, prompting China to retaliate with tariffs on U.S. soy, pork, corn and other products.

An imminent trade deal between Washington and Beijing seems unlikely as the trade tensions between the world’s top two economies rose after U.S. placed China’s Huawei Technologies on a trade blacklist last week, triggering sharp protest from China.

Perdue also said the second and third tranches, with exact amounts yet to be decided, will be dependant on the progress in the trade talks and whether the U.S. will get a deal with China. The total package also includes $1.4 billion of support through food purchases and $100 million allocated to development of foreign markets.

PLANTING DECISIONS

Perdue said the USDA has redesigned last year’s aid program of up to $12 billion based on feedback. The new package therefore will have a single payment rate per county, calculated by the damages in that area, instead of a rate for every commodity across the nation.

“Those per acre payments are not dependent on which of those crops are planted in 2019, and therefore will not distort planting decisions,” USDA said in a statement.

Chicago Board of Trade corn futures turned lower and soybean futures extended earlier losses after the announcement.

The county-based mechanism for the aid payments have triggered a heated debate on whether it would impact planting decisions. Some analysts said the trade aid package could encourage farmers to try to seed their crops in order to qualify for the relief despite overly wet fields that have stalled planting this spring.

Jim Hefner, an Ohio farmer who has not been able to start planting due to heavy rain, said the plan could cause him to alter his initial acreage plans, however.

“I guess we would make more of an effort to get something planted,” Hefner said. “We may forgo corn and plant soybeans.”

Some farmers remain skeptical.

Dan Henebry, a corn and soybean farmer in Buffalo, Illinois, said the payments are directed at rural areas that helped propel Trump into office. Henebry, who voted for a third-party candidate in 2016, said he wants the president to end the trade war with China.

“If we solve the issue, we wouldn’t need this,” he said about the aid package."
Justice Dept. Says It Will Share Some Mueller-Related Intelligence With House Committee,https://www.nytimes.com,['Nicholas Fandos'],05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/us/politics/mueller-report-democrats.html,"The Intelligence Committee appears to be getting material that was not subject to the privilege claim. As one of two congressional bodies charged with overseeing American intelligence agencies, it has strong legal claims on such counterintelligence and intelligence information, and in this case, the Democrats requesting the material had the support of Republicans on the committee.

It is unclear if the department will reconsider Mr. Trump’s privilege claim going forward. Democrats plan to challenge it in court and to hold a House vote in early June on holding Mr. Barr in contempt for his defiance of the Judiciary Committee’s subpoena.

“This is no substitute in any way, shape or form for the appearance of Bob Mueller before our committee and the Judiciary Committee,” Mr. Schiff told reporters. “It’s no substitute for the appearance of Don McGahn and the other witnesses that have been subpoenaed to come before the committee. But we are pleased we are finally going to start to receive documents we are entitled to from the Department of Justice.”

Still, the de-escalation comes as liberal Democratic lawmakers are increasingly restless over the administration’s stonewalling of congressional requests and subpoenas, and a growing number have begun calling for the opening of an impeachment inquiry. The cooperation will likely strengthen the hand of Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her allies, who have argued instead that Democrats should stay the course of their current no-impeachment strategy.

The Justice Department wrote in a letter to Mr. Schiff on Tuesday that it was already in the process of locating and reviewing materials related to the 12 categories and could make them available in “relatively short order.”

But the department has stated that it would comply in this way only if the committee did not proceed with the previously scheduled vote on its enforcement action.

“The proposal set forth above represents a good-faith effort and extraordinary accommodation of the committee’s request for information by proposing a realistic process to provide the committee with information pertaining to counterintelligence and foreign-intelligence activities related to the special counsel’s investigation,” Stephen E. Boyd, an assistant attorney general, wrote in the Tuesday letter.

The department said it was also willing to allow all members of the Intelligence Committee to view a limited redacted version of the first volume of Mr. Mueller’s report. It had previously allowed only a handful of lawmakers in both the House and Senate to see those materials."

“Recent DHS statistics on the number of arrivals at our southern border are clear proof that what is currently being done, is not enough,"" the group wrote.

The letter noted that two weeks ago U.S. Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost told the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Border Security and Immigration that, ""as of March 31, 2019, 361,087 migrants have been apprehended between the points of entry (POEs) in Fiscal Year (FY) 2019, representing a 108 percent increase over the same time in FY 2018.”

“Current projections are that more than 1 million people will have crossed our southern border illegally this year. Our constituents, the American public, are confounded as to why more is not being done by your Department,” the letter said.

Proposals include expanding a training program for border patrol agents to conduct fear interviews, where an undocumented immigrant is referred to an asylum officer if they express fear of returning to their home country.

Other proposals include limiting Immigration and Customs Enforcement's parole policy, limiting work authorization to only those whose asylum applications have been approved, increasing asylum fees and terminating the Flores settlement agreement.

“As the President continues to show leadership on this issue, we strongly encourage you to exercise the same manner of enthusiasm for fixing this crisis,” the letter says. “Included in this letter are proposals that would undoubtedly slow the surge at the border and provide context for long term immigration solutions.”

The group of immigration hard-liners also called for a third country agreement to be negotiated to allow undocumented immigrants to be relocated to another country that didn’t pose a threat in addition to enforcing “Migrant Protection Protocols,” which would require individuals from Central America to remain in Mexico while they await their immigration hearings."
Trump’s EPA is ‘cooking the books’ to justify its attack on clean air rules,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/trumps-epa-is-cooking-the-books-to-justify-its-attack-on-clean-air-rules/,"Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is working to distort the way it measures the benefits of some of the agency’s most impactful policies, regulations that safeguard human health by limiting air pollution. The primary beneficiary of such distortion? The coal industry.

When the government evaluates the health and financial benefits of clean air, the calculation typically incorporates the number of lives saved and the scale of reduced health impacts thanks to reducing pollution — also known as “co-benefits.” Incorporating these factors into a cost-benefit analysis forms the very foundation upon which many environmental protections are based.

But now, experts warn the EPA is opening the door to industry challenges to these clean air rules by changing the way it evaluates the long-accepted science on the risk of particulate matter — microscopic particles polluting the air that are linked to increased heart attacks, strokes, and respiratory disease.

The agency may also be laying the groundwork, experts say, for using these “biased and misleading” calculations in other policy contexts. That fear was stoked by a new EPA memo released this week, ushering in a formal process to change the way the agency calculates its cost-benefit analysis across a slew of issues, from water pollution to pesticides.

It is well-established that reducing air pollution saves lives — a fact backed up by numerous scientific studies and government reports. In fact, a 2017 report from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) found that out of all federal rules, the EPA’s had the “highest estimated benefits as well as the highest estimated costs.” The costs and benefits capture everything from the new equipment required by power plants to the co-benefits from Americans’ reduced exposure to pollution.

What’s more, regulations designed to improve air quality accounted for over 95% of the benefits from EPA rules. When it comes to fine particle pollution, OMB said the benefits of regulation “far exceed” the costs.

Nonetheless, the EPA is now arguing that the calculation used to determine the costs and benefits of air pollution regulations needs to be changed. The agency is exaggerating the costs of these rules while downplaying their ecological, climate, financial, and health benefits so that it can more easily defend its sweeping rollback of environmental protections — changes that are often in line with industry demands.

The EPA’s proposed revisions to this math would reduce the number of lives at risk from repealing the Clean Power Plan and drastically downgrade the projected benefits of retaining the Mercury and Air Toxics standards (MATS) regulating power plant pollution. By eliminating the use of co-benefits, these policy changes don’t look as bad.

“Both approaches are means by which unscrupulous agency officials can cook the cost-benefit books and distort the debate about the value of health and environmental protections,” James Pew, a staff attorney at EarthJustice, told ThinkProgress. “They’re a way to rationalize rolling back these protections, or not establishing them in the first place.”

On Tuesday, the EPA released a memo directing four agency offices to “rectify… inconsistencies” regarding the process for calculating risks and benefits. This includes offices overseeing air pollution, water pollution, land contamination (including Superfund sites), and chemicals and pesticides.

The direction, issued to staff on May 13, codifies and expands an effort to effectively “cook the books” that was initiated by former Administrator Scott Pruitt. In April 2018, Pruitt told attendees at a meeting held at the Heritage Foundation – a think tank known for promoting climate science denial – that he would stop counting the co-benefits of environmental policies.

It is “potentially the first step to a systematic attack on use of co-benefits.”

This trend in fudging the numbers goes back to 2017, when the EPA under Pruitt made what appeared to be a few small changes to a metric known as the social cost of carbon – a figure that agencies use to determine the climate benefits of a particular regulation. In this case, the EPA argued it should only have to calculate how methane emissions reductions benefit the United States alone, a complete reversal from how these costs are typically calculated.

One of the main regulations currently in the agency’s cross-hairs is the MATS rule; introduced in 2011, it established federal limits on hazardous pollution from power plants. The regulation targets chemicals like mercury that can cause serious health impacts such as tremors, respiratory failure, and death. Coal plants are the biggest emitters of this toxic pollution.

The EPA’s own calculations show these regulations save upwards of 17,000 lives each year. Yet the agency is now arguing that the policy is too costly, claiming it costs industry $9.6 billion per year while only producing up to $6 million in benefits — significantly fewer benefits than what the Obama administration said the policy creates.

According the Obama-era calculations, the MATS rule would save $80 billion, in part due the co-benefits of costs avoided through fewer hospital visits and other health care spending resulting from poor air quality.

Among these benefits are ones that come from reducing pollution 2.5 microns in diameter or smaller (PM 2.5, for context, is 30 times smaller than the width of a human hair). While pollution standards set a limit on how much of this pollution is allowed, scientists argue there is no safe level, as even the tiniest particles in very small quantities are believed to impact the brains of unborn children.

But Trump’s EPA doesn’t see it that way, arguing these co-benefits are a stretch for what can be considered cost savings — and that regulating mercury from power plants is therefore not “appropriate and necessary.”

It’s a “biased and misleading estimate of costs and benefits,” Michael Livermore, associate professor of law at University of Virginia, said during a House Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee hearing on Tuesday regarding the proposed changes to MATS.

“The purpose of cost-benefit analysis is to understand consequences of agency decisions,” Livermore told lawmakers. “By excluding a large category… [you’re] turning a blind eye to an enormous category of consequences,” he said of the number of lives at risk from pollution.

Just hours later, the EPA released its memo to expand its cost-benefit revisions.

Meanwhile, regarding the rollback of the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, the New York Times reported Monday that “the EPA plans to get thousands of pollution deaths off the books by changing its math.”

An EPA impact analysis released last August found that repealing the Clean Power Plan and replacing it with a new rule – the Affordable Clean Energy plan – would lead to an additional 1,400 premature deaths per year.

The agency was ridiculed at the time for this admission, and now appears to be trying to reverse course. By adopting a different analytical method, according to the Times, the EPA will be able to reduce this number in order to defend its rollback of the Clean Power Plan.

Many experts, however, warn that there is no scientific basis to the EPA’s reported approach of assuming there are little to no health benefits from reducing pollution as much as possible. The methodology is expected to be made public in June as part of its Affordable Clean Energy rule roll-out.

“The EPA’s current agenda is to mislead and misrepresent the harms of the current Trump rollback agenda,” John Walke, clean air director and senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told ThinkProgress.

“But,” he added, “there’s also a future dimension – to handcuff the EPA and prevent them from protecting Americans and the environment.”

Targeting the science-based economics supporting air pollution regulations “would have very, very broad impacts,” Richard Revesz, director of the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University, told ThinkProgress.

Revesz says the EPA is undercutting the science in three ways, under what he calls the “dirty trinity” — methods that are “extraordinarily flawed and inconsistent with what administrations [both Democrat and Republican]… have done for decades.”

The first method is by calling into question the co-benefits. “I see what the agency proposed in MATS as potentially the first step to a systematic attack on use of co-benefits,” he said, pointing to the EPA’s memo released this week calling on the four offices to reevaluate their cost-benefit analysis.

The next method is by calling into question the benefit of reducing particle pollution to below the national ambient air quality standards on PM 2.5. According to Revesz, the EPA’s logic espoused by the head of air quality, Bill Wehrum, is essentially to say there’s no extra benefit of reducing levels of PM 2.5 below what’s required under the national standards. This “flies in the face” of what previous administrations have done and what science has established, Revesz said.

Finally, he said the administration is trying to call into question previous studies on the harmful health impacts of particle pollution.

The impact of such a “comprehensive attack,” said NRDC’s Walke, is that “the outcome of the agency’s tortured analysis would indicate that greater protections are not justified.”

The proposed changes aren’t just opposed by scientists, environmentalists, and legal experts. They’re also, in the context of MATS, opposed by the utility industry, which has already spent billions of dollars to upgrade its facilities to be in line with the pollution rules. If MATS were to be halted, they would risk not recuperating the costs put into these upgrades.

So why do something so widely opposed? Janet McCabe, former acting EPA air chief, was posed this very question on Tuesday. “I don’t know, but I can think of two reasons why they would do this,” she told lawmakers during the MATS hearing. One of these is to “inaugurate this new way of looking at benefits, and devaluing the full range of benefits.”

The other, she said, is that “this administration has made very clear they will do everything they can to help the coal industry, and this rule is top of that list.”

While it’s hard to know exactly what is going through the minds of EPA officials when introducing these changes, the broader theme across their actions points to an industry-friendly agenda.

Given the widespread opposition to these proposed changes, Pew said, “it appears [EPA Administrator] Wheeler and Wehrum are acting in the interests of a very narrow group of companies, such as Murray Energy, Wheeler’s former client, that want the MATS rule to be withdrawn.”

In 2016, coal giant Murray Energy filed a lawsuit asking a federal appeals court to evaluate the EPA’s finding that it was “appropriate and necessary” to regulate power plants under section 112 of the Clean Air Act. The lawsuit was seen as a way to challenge the EPA’s longstanding practice of considering co-benefits in its cost analysis for regulatory decisions.

As for the new math on the Clean Power Plan’s repeal, that too is tied to a former client of an EPA official.

In 2015, the Utility Air Regulatory Group — which is known for fighting clean air policies and lobbying against the Clean Power Plan — was represented by Wehrum, then a corporate lawyer at Hunton & Williams. The firm filed comments to the EPA on behalf of UARG, arguing that recognizing the benefits of saving lives and reducing PM 2.5 pollution below required levels “fail a common sense test.”

According to the Times this week, Wehrum echoed this logic, arguing that the premise that you can save billions by reducing pollution in areas that already meet the national standard “doesn’t make any sense.”

While the administration is taking the initiative to repeal the Clean Power Plan, it claims it is not actually going to roll back MATS itself.

Some critics remain skeptical, however, and argue that by undoing the science that supports MATS, the EPA is opening the door for industry to challenge the rule all together — why have a rule if the agency’s own math says there aren’t many benefits?

Asked whether the EPA understands it is leaving this standard legally vulnerable, McCabe said she thinks it does. “If people think the EPA is not going to be asked to move forward to vacate the rule… they are mistaken,” she said. “The request will come immediately.”

It’s a “deeply cynical strategy,” Walke told ThinkProgress of the EPA’s attempt to undo the science while at the same time claiming it wants to keep MATS in place.

Doing this could “encourage litigation” by Murray Energy and others to undo the MATS rule, Pew said. “If that litigation were successful, there would be a race to the bottom for power companies to turn off or turn down their pollution controls.”

Coal company Peabody Energy has also indicated that the end result of the agency’s reevaluation to its cost calculations could be the entire undoing of the sweeping toxic pollution rule.

The chances of this type of lawsuit being successful, however, are hard to predict. But many expect it would be a long-fought battle — and that those fighting to keep the pollution controls in place would be able to point to the EPA’s questionable cost calculations and the established science to argue in support of the rules.

“I don’t think, in the end, they’ll be able to survive judicial scrutiny,” said Revesz, who believes the intention is designed to open the door to undermine co-benefits across policy areas rather than spur litigation.

The probability that the courts would uphold the EPA’s “flawed economic analysis” is “very low” he explained, because these actions are “inconsistent with regulatory practice, economics, science. They make no logical sense.”"
U.S. State Department misses deadline to explain Iran arms control report: aide,https://www.reuters.com,"['Arshad Mohammed', 'Min Read']",05-23-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-iran-armscontrol/u-s-state-department-misses-deadline-to-explain-iran-arms-control-report-aide-idUSKCN1ST2VY,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department failed to meet a deadline on Thursday to provide information to three congressional committee chairmen looking into whether an annual arms control report slanted and politicized assessments about Iran, a congressional aide said.

In a May 16 letter, the Democratic chairmen of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs, Armed Services and Intelligence committees asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to provide a State Department briefing and documents no later than Thursday.

The chairmen’s letter cited a Reuters article on April 17 about how the administration’s annual report to Congress on global compliance with international arms control accords provoked a dispute with U.S. intelligence agencies and some State Department officials.

The dissenting officials, sources said, were concerned that the document politicized and skewed assessments against Iran in a bid to lay the groundwork to justify military action.

A U.S. official familiar with the issue and speaking on condition of anonymity said the chairmen were to be invited to a briefing by State Department and other government experts about the report on “adherence to and compliance with arms control, nonproliferation and disarmament agreements and commitments.”

The congressional aide, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said no such communication had been received.

The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

U.S.-Iranian tensions rose following U.S. President Donald Trump’s withdrawal last year from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and his reimposition of tough economic sanctions. They sharpened earlier this month after Trump tightened sanctions to try to eliminate Iran’s oil exports.

Strains further deepened with Saudi Arabia accusing Iran of ordering armed drone attacks on two oil pumping stations and the May 12 sabotage of four vessels, including two Saudi tankers, off the coast of the United Arab Emirates.

U.S. government sources said Washington strongly suspects militias with ties to Tehran were behind those attacks as well as a rocket strike in Baghdad’s Green Zone.

Iran denied involvement in the incidents.

In their May 16 letter to Pompeo, the three chairmen said they were “deeply concerned” the arms control report may have been produced by political appointees “disregarding intelligence or distorting its meaning.”

The State Department, they noted, was legally bound to submit to Congress a “detailed report” on compliance by the United States and other countries with international arms control accords.

Instead, they wrote, this year’s report was only 12 pages long, “contains no meaningful discussion” of U.S. and Russian compliance with such agreements and “consists largely of hypotheticals or opinion.”

Several sources told Reuters that the report made them wonder if the administration was painting Iran in the darkest light possible, much as the George W. Bush administration used bogus and exaggerated intelligence to justify its 2003 invasion of Iraq."

President Donald Trump's children and their spouses will join his state visit to the United Kingdom in June where they are expected to be greeted by the royal family, sources with knowledge of the trip told ABC News.

Many of the details during the three-day trip are still being finalized, but during this official state visit Trump will be feted by Queen Elizabeth II at a lavish banquet dinner on June 3, that his children are expected to attend as well, according to a White House official.

While no official schedule has been released, if the young Trumps -- Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, Tiffany Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump and his wife Lara -- do attend the official state banquet, they could meet the young royals -- Prince William and his wife Kate -- who are also expected to attend the event.

However, the White House and Buckingham Palace are still discussing a final schedule, and as a matter of protocol Buckingham Palace will not put out the guest list so far in advance.

Buckingham Palace would not comment for this story.

“President Donald J. Trump and First Lady Melania Trump accepted the invitation from Her Royal Majesty Queen Elizabeth II to visit the United Kingdom from June 3 to 5, 2019,"" the White House said in a statement. ""This state visit will reaffirm the steadfast and special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom.""

A White House spokesperson declined to comment on the news that Trump's children will be joining him on the trip.

Trump and the first lady had tea with the queen at Windsor Castle during his working visit to the U.K. last July, but he did not meet the heir to the throne Prince Charles or his wife Camilla. On this trip, it is understood that Prince Charles will invite the Trumps to tea, sources told ABC News.

The queen has hosted two previous state visits for U.S. presidents, President George W. Bush and first lady Laura Bush made a state visit in November 2003 and President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama made a State Visit in May 2011.

E.P.A. Plans to Get Thousands of Pollution Deaths Off the Books by Changing Its Math,https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/20/climate/epa-air-pollution-deaths.html,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.

WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency plans to change the way it calculates the health risks of air pollution, a shift that would make it easier to roll back a key climate change rule because it would result in far fewer predicted deaths from pollution, according to five people with knowledge of the agency’s plans.

The E.P.A. had originally forecast that eliminating the Obama-era rule, the Clean Power Plan, and replacing it with a new measure would have resulted in an additional 1,400 premature deaths per year. The new analytical model would significantly reduce that number and would most likely be used by the Trump administration to defend further rollbacks of air pollution rules if it is formally adopted.

The proposed shift is the latest example of the Trump administration downgrading the estimates of environmental harm from pollution in regulations. In this case, the proposed methodology would assume there is little or no health benefit to making the air any cleaner than what the law requires. Many experts said that approach was not scientifically sound and that, in the real world, there are no safe levels of the fine particulate pollution associated with the burning of fossil fuels.

Fine particulate matter — the tiny, deadly particles that can penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream — is linked to heart attacks, strokes and respiratory disease."

A Justice Department investigation into Major League Baseball’s operations in Latin America and the trafficking of Cuban players has expanded in recent months, with former league and team officials among those contacted by FBI agents and called to testify before a grand jury, according to people with knowledge of the probe. The wide-ranging inquiry is, in part, seeking to root out suspected involvement of MLB team officials with smugglers who force Cuban players to sign away exorbitant portions of their earnings in exchange for passage off the island.

While MLB officials have blamed the plight of Cuban players on the U.S. embargo on the island nation, some scouts, agents and former federal prosecutors argue that major league rules — which make it more lucrative for Cuban players to defect to other countries first rather than come straight to the United States — fuel corruption across Latin America, and that MLB has long ignored its role in this black market.

“It’s always been clear that these guys are basically hostages, until the time that they sign major league contracts and give a sizeable portion of their contracts to the criminals involved in smuggling them out,” said Joe Kehoskie, a former player agent. “Everyone stuck their heads in the sand.”

The Los Angeles Dodgers, Atlanta Braves and San Diego Padres have received subpoenas seeking records relating to scouting and signing of players from Latin America, and the Washington Nationals voluntarily turned over documents to federal agents, including emails and financial records. Those who have testified to a federal grand jury in D.C. or have spoken to federal agents, according to people with knowledge of the investigation, include a former MLB official, a former Dodgers front office staffer, a former Dodgers player from Cuba, two veteran scouts who worked for the Dodgers and Braves, a sports agent who has represented Cuban players, and three employees of a player development camp in the Dominican Republic.

Among baseball’s scouting community, rumors have circulated for years of certain teams or scouts with connections on the ground in Cuba, or inside smuggling organizations, providing an illicit advantage. This is at least the third major federal investigation focused on the trafficking of Cuban players in recent years and, to this point, none has yielded criminal charges against anyone employed by an MLB team. But the current probe, reports of which first surfaced last fall, demonstrates the Justice Department’s sustained interest in whether MLB officials and team employees are aware of, or involved in, illegal activities.

A review of documents in an earlier prosecution and interviews with more than a dozen people who have spoken with federal investigators offer insight into the government’s specific interests. People with knowledge of the investigation say it is being overseen by prosecutors at the Justice Department’s D.C. headquarters who specialize in the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, signifying interest in whether MLB team employees have been involved in bribing foreign government officials. Agents in the Los Angeles and Miami offices are contributing to the investigation, and are pursuing possible crimes including human trafficking, money laundering and visa fraud, according to people with knowledge of the probe, most of whom spoke on condition of anonymity.

In a statement, the Dodgers said the club has “cooperated fully with the government’s inquiry and will continue to do so.” The Braves, Padres and Nationals all declined to comment, as did the Justice Department.

[Velocity is strangling baseball — and its grip keeps tightening]

Since the early 2000s, amid a surge of Cuban baseball players fleeing the island, stories have circulated of their harrowing journeys to freedom. Cuban players and their families have been kidnapped, held at gunpoint, threatened with torture, falsely jailed by corrupt police officers, and have endured other traumas at the hands of smugglers demanding money.

This latest investigation dates from at least early 2017, when Nick Francona — a former front-office staffer with the Dodgers and Mets and son of Cleveland Indians Manager Terry Francona — said he gave hundreds of pages of internal records from his time with the Dodgers to an FBI agent. The records, reviewed by The Washington Post, show Francona and his colleagues suspected some of the team’s scouts conspired with “buscones” — often ruthless street agents in Latin America who represent young players — to steal some of the club’s money intended for players.

The current probe follows a sprawling federal investigation based out of Miami that resulted in the 2017 conviction of Cuban sports agent Bart Hernandez and an alleged accomplice for crimes relating to the smuggling of players. That trial offered evidence that provided an unprecedented window into the corruption surrounding Cuban players, with witnesses describing bribery and fraud schemes involving immigration officials in Mexico, the Dominican Republic and Haiti.

In interviews with The Post, two retired federal prosecutors who oversaw previous investigations accused MLB of ignoring obvious signs of the corruption they believe the league’s rules incite across Latin America. Under rules collectively bargained between the league and the MLB Players Association, a Cuban who defects to the United States has to enter the MLB draft, where salaries are suppressed, while a Cuban who defects elsewhere is declared a free agent and can sign with the highest bidder.

“MLB’s own rules and regulations . . . encourage the smuggler and fraudsters to go through the charade,” said Patrick Sullivan, a retired former assistant U.S. Attorney who oversaw the 2017 prosecution of Hernandez and trainer Julio Estrada.

“There’s a lot of willful ignorance going on. It’s obvious American baseball knew what was going on . . . It really is a stupid rule,” said Ben Daniel, a retired former assistant U.S. Attorney who led the 2007 prosecution of former agent Gus Dominguez.

Dan Halem, MLB deputy commissioner and the league’s chief legal officer, said this criticism is misguided.

“The reason that Cuban players are being smuggled out of Cuba is because they can’t voluntarily leave,” Halem said.

U.S.-Cuba relations, after moving toward normalization under the Obama administration, have soured under the Trump administration, which recently scuttled a deal MLB negotiated with the Cuban Baseball Federation intended to reduce trafficking of players.

In 2014, MLB tried to change the rule criticized by former federal prosecutors, Halem said, but the union refused to agree to new terms. The MLBPA declined an interview request or to answer any questions for this story.



‘All of these players received visas from the U.S. consulates either in Dominican Republic, Haiti, or Mexico,’ MLB chief legal officer Dan Halem said. ‘And, if anyone, consular officials are experts in determining whether residency acquired in the countries in which the consulates are operating are legitimate or not. Right?’ (Ross D. Franklin/Associated Press)

A risky path

Before the early 2000s, federal law enforcement largely ignored crimes occurring in connection with how Cuban baseball players made their way to America. The embargo was intended to punish Fidel Castro, a baseball fan who took it as a personal affront when his country’s best players defected, so targeting the people who helped Cuban players get here made little sense, as a matter of U.S. policy.

That changed after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, as federal law enforcement cracked down on illegal immigration. Around this same time, violent drug gangs in Latin America, attracted by a flood of MLB money, became increasingly involved in smuggling Cubans.

Inspired by the path taken by Jose Contreras — a Cuban pitcher who defected not to the United States, but to Nicaragua, and then signed a $32 million contract with the Yankees — these criminal organizations worked with boatmen, or “lancheros,” who plucked players off the island and routed them through countries where they could quickly buy residency with bribes, and then declare free agency.

Among baseball scouts and agents, the suddenly routine occurrence of Cuban players successfully navigating, in a matter of a few weeks, the normally years-long path to residency in other countries raised questions about whether MLB teams were essentially subsidizing organized crime in Latin America. Veteran Cuban outfielder Yasiel Puig’s 2012 defection, according to published reports by ESPN and Los Angeles Magazine, was overseen by smugglers connected to Los Zetas, the Mexican criminal syndicate, who bribed immigration officials to get Puig residency in Mexico within 15 days of his arrival.

In the mid-2000s, federal law enforcement agencies started taking intense interest in the smuggling of Cuban players. Under code names Operation Boys of Summer, Operation Safety Squeeze and Operation Sisyphus, agents with the FBI and Department of Homeland Security worked a series of investigations aimed, in part, at determining whether MLB team employees were doing business with human smugglers.

A window into the world

In 2016, one of those investigations led to the indictments of Bart Hernandez, a Cuban native and sports agent based in Florida, and Julio Estrada, a trainer of Cuban players. Their trial introduced evidence showing the rampant fraud around Cubans entering the major leagues, and raised questions about whether team and league officials ignored obvious red flags noticed years later by federal agents.

In Mexico, according to courtroom testimony, Hernandez partnered with gangsters nicknamed “Nacho” and “Tony Montana.” One player’s wife testified that, when her husband absconded for a few days, Montana called her and said that if her husband didn’t return, they would send him back to her in a box, “chopped in pieces.”

A Mexican woman who acted as an accomplice for Hernandez testified that she and her associates bribed Mexican immigration officials with amounts in the range of $6,000 per player for residency papers that included fraudulent home addresses and fabricated places of employment. Hernandez and his accomplices later routed their players through the Dominican Republic, until a mix-up involving Yoenis Cespedes, the slugging outfielder whose nickname in Cuba had been “La Potencia,” meaning “The Power.”

According to the testimony of Ed Dominguez, a former MLB employee in the league’s investigations office, after Cespedes arrived in the Dominican Republic in 2011, his agent mistakenly attempted to bribe the wrong Dominican immigration official. The immigration official who was supposed to receive a bribe, out of anger, reported Cespedes’s agent to Dominican law enforcement, according to Dominguez, and the ensuing investigation caused problems for months for all Cuban players trying to get residency in the Dominican Republic.

As a result, according to testimony of his alleged accomplices, Hernandez started taking his Cuban players across the border to Haiti. There, according to the testimony of one alleged accomplice, players were greeted by Amin LaTouf, a “fixer” who helped players get residency by giving them fake jobs at a supermarket he owned and then working with contacts in the Haitian government. (LaTouf, who was indicted along with Hernandez and Estrada, evaded extradition from Haiti and remains a fugitive.)

Hernandez, who was sentenced to nearly four years in prison, is appealing his conviction. His attorneys declined to comment.

The Hernandez trial also produced evidence and testimony that could be interpreted as showing officials with the Texas Rangers and New York Yankees involved in schemes to get Cubans to the United States.

One of the prosecution’s key witnesses was Eliezer Lazo Jr., the son and business partner of the former ringleader of a human smuggling organization who worked with Hernandez. Lazo Jr. — when asked about Leonys Martin, a Cuban outfielder who signed with the Rangers in 2011 — testified that his father had told him, after talking to Hernandez, that Rangers officials had approved of a plan to arrange for the player to enter the United States illegally by crossing at the Mexico border.

“The Texas Rangers reject any suggestion of inappropriate conduct,” attorney Gregory Saikin, the club’s outside counsel, wrote in a statement, “and give no credibility to self-serving and uncorroborated hearsay by an admitted human trafficker, relaying what his convicted felon father allegedly told him that another convicted felon said that ‘the team’ said.”

A document introduced as evidence also cited the Yankees as encouraging a Cuban player to defect, a potential violation of the U.S. embargo. The State Department document summarized an August 2012 interview in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, between a U.S. consulate official and a Cuban pitcher, Omar Luis, who had fled his native country a few months before.

“Was directly recruited from Cuba by the Yankees,” the State Department official wrote. When asked about how he got residency in Haiti, the report said the player replied, “The Yankees contacted a Haitian functionary who make it all happen.”

The Yankees declined to comment. Luis, who is out of baseball and lives in Miami, did not respond to a request to comment.

In an interview, Sullivan, the prosecutor who oversaw the case, wondered why MLB failed to take action on the signs of the fraud these Cuban players and their smugglers were committing in other countries. The residency documents these players quickly obtained in Mexico, the Dominican Republic and Haiti — some listing jobs such as jet ski operator, mechanic, and apartment complex supervisor — all flowed through the league office, Sullivan noted, each time Hernandez asked MLB officials to declare a new client of his a free agent.

“To us, it appeared sort of obvious,” Sullivan said.

MLB has for years conducted lengthy, extensive age and identity investigations of free agents in Latin America, sometimes resorting to DNA tests. But Halem, MLB’s legal officer, said investigating the residency documents Cuban players obtain in other countries is not under the league’s purview.

Halem said it is the State Department’s job to vet Cuban players applying for work visas, and pointed out State officials approved the applications of many of the players who, according to courtroom testimony, fraudulently obtained residency via Hernandez and associates.

“All of these players received visas from the U.S. consulates either in the Dominican Republic, Haiti, or Mexico,” Halem said, “and, if anyone, consular officials are experts in determining whether residency acquired in the countries in which the consulates are operating are legitimate or not. Right?”

In a statement, the State Department declined to address the instances of fraud unearthed in the Hernandez trial, and said it “takes all allegations of fraud seriously.”

Who knew what

A few weeks after the Hernandez trial ended, an FBI agent in Los Angeles received a LinkedIn message from Nick Francona, who believes he reignited federal law enforcement’s interest in the league’s dealings in Latin America.

A former U.S. Marine who served in Afghanistan, Francona had a turbulent career in baseball after he left the military, with brief stints in the front offices of the Dodgers and Mets. In 2016, after the Dodgers fired Francona, he accused the club of discriminating against him as a veteran, which the Dodgers denied. In 2017, Francona was fired by the Mets, he claimed, because he was publicly criticizing MLB for not detailing where it spent money raised through the sales of military-themed apparel. In a statement addressing Francona’s departure, the Mets did not disclose a reason.

The documents Francona turned over to the FBI include dozens of emails he and his Dodgers colleagues exchanged in 2014 and 2015, in the first months of new team president Andrew Friedman’s regime. In many of the emails, it is apparent that Francona and his colleagues suspected their scouts in Latin America were skimming from bonuses meant for players.

For several months, the emails show, Francona and others discussed a plan to dismiss these scouts. They didn’t rush the process, Francona said in a recent interview, partly out of concern the departures would interfere with a series of pending signings.

Francona acknowledged he neither witnessed any Dodgers officials committing any crimes, nor did he have any direct evidence of any crimes.

While several Dodgers front office employees were involved in the exchanges, the records don’t indicate if Dodgers GM Friedman was aware of the suspicions. The Dodgers did not conduct an internal investigation of the scouts, the records show, nor did the club alert the league office or law enforcement. In the summer of 2015, the Dodgers parted ways with the scouts, by releasing them from their contracts or failing to renew their contracts.

“The suggestion that the team should have notified law enforcement, or MLB, or any other team, about rumors and unsubstantiated suspicions regarding any former employee is simply wrong,” Dodgers outside counsel David Schindler said in a statement.

Among the documents Francona provided the FBI was a series of emails discussing Hector Olivera, then a well-regarded 29-year-old infielder from Cuba the Dodgers signed in 2015, and harassment he was receiving from the smugglers who helped him defect. Olivera, who declined to comment, has testified to the grand jury in D.C., according to two people with knowledge of the investigation.

In a June 2015 email, a Dodgers interpreter updated Francona and others on Olivera’s progress assimilating into life in America.

“Olivera seems more comfortable both on and off the field,” the interpreter wrote. “Based on telephone conversations I’ve overheard, he has been able to make all his payments to the people who helped him defect from Cuba. He still has one more payment to go, but he seems relieved and is receiving fewer calls from people harassing him for money they are owed.”

According to people with knowledge of the investigation, federal authorities are interested in whether Dodgers scouts in Latin America engaged in illicit business dealings with the smugglers who brought Olivera from Cuba to Haiti, where he obtained residency in 2015. Before he signed with the Dodgers, Olivera was also the subject of a recruiting battle between two agents that resulted in a grievance filed with the players’ union that, according to sources with knowledge of the investigation, produced documents federal authorities are examining.

Olivera was ultimately a bust. The Dodgers traded him to the Braves in 2015, and after he was arrested for assaulting a woman in Arlington, Va., during a series against the Nationals — he was later convicted and sentenced to 90 days in jail — the Braves traded him to the Padres, who released him in 2016.

While Olivera did play for the other two teams that have been subpoenaed as part of the investigation, federal authorities are interested in the Braves and Padres for other reasons, according to people who have been interviewed by FBI agents and prosecutors.

People familiar with the Braves organization say federal authorities have interest in the series of events that led to former general manager John Coppolella’s lifetime ban in 2017 for a raft of rules violations regarding the signing of international players.

Coppolella declined an interview request through his lawyer, Jacksonville criminal defense attorney Hank Coxe.

The precise nature of federal authorities’ interest in the Padres is also unclear. San Diego General Manager A.J. Preller has been punished twice by MLB — once for violating international signing rules with the Rangers, and in 2016 he was suspended for sending incomplete medical records for Padres players to trade partners — and the Padres have also been punished as an organization for breaking international scouting rules, under Preller’s watch.

In interviews with The Post, current and former scouts portrayed Latin America as treacherous territory, where scouts are under intense pressure to sign prospects, and bribes and kickbacks between scouts and buscones are common, and viewed by some in the industry as a cost of doing business.

One scout who testified before the grand jury expressed fear that personnel at his level would end up taking the fall for the actions of top club executives.

John Meringolo, a New York-based federal criminal defense attorney who has consulted with lawyers involved with the investigation, said federal prosecutors clearly have ambitious goals.

“Based upon the scope and breadth of the investigation, I think some of the GMs and others should start retaining counsel,” Meringolo said."
U.S. Treasury backs away from plan for Harriet Tubman on $20 bill next year,https://www.reuters.com,"['Makini Brice', 'Min Read']",05-23-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-currency-tubman/u-s-treasury-backs-away-from-plan-for-harriet-tubman-on-20-bill-next-year-idUSKCN1SS2ZK,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury will not introduce a redesigned $20 bill picturing escaped slave and abolitionist Harriet Tubman next year as planned, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday.

In 2016, the Treasury Department said it would replace former President Andrew Jackson’s image on the front of the bill with that of Tubman by 2020, along with redesigns of the $5 and $10 bill.

President Donald Trump has called the inclusion of Tubman on the $20 bill an example of “pure political correctness.”

As a presidential candidate, Trump suggested Tubman would be better-suited for the $2 bill, a note that is not widely circulated.

Mnuchin said during a hearing with the House Financial Services committee he was focused on redesigning the bills to address counterfeiting issues, not making any changes to their imagery.

“We will meet the security feature redesign (goal) in 2020. The imagery feature will not be an issue that comes up until most likely 2026,” Mnuchin told lawmakers.

“It is not a decision that is likely to come until way past my term, even if I serve a second term for the president, so I am not focused on that at the moment,” Mnuchin added.

He declined to tell lawmakers in the hearing if he supported putting Tubman on the bill.

Tubman was born into slavery and grew up on a Maryland plantation, escaping in her late 20s. She returned to the South to help hundreds of slaves to freedom and later worked as a Union spy during the Civil War. She died in 1913.

The decision to put Tubman on the $20 bill followed months of outreach from the Treasury Department on which woman should be featured on the note.

There have been no women depicted on U.S. bills since former first lady Martha Washington, who was featured on the $1 silver certificate from 1891 to 1896, and Native American woman Pocahontas, who was included in a group image on the $20 bill from 1865 to 1869.

Other women, including Native American interpreter Sacagawea, suffragist Susan B. Anthony and author and activist Helen Keller have been featured on coins.

Jackson, the seventh president of the United States, has been criticized for his ownership of slaves and treatment of American Indians. In the redesign announced in 2016, he would have remained on the back of the $20 bill."
John Bolton Wants to Run a One-Man State Department: Report,http://nymag.com,['Matt Stieb'],05-22-2019,2019,5,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/05/john-bolton-wants-to-run-a-one-man-state-department-report.html,"Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

The Trump White House has long been a place of internal strife, from the early days of Steve Bannon versus everyone else, to the daily sparring of John Kelly and his boss, to the current conflict between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton. According to a new report from CNN, Pompeo is frustrated by Bolton overstepping his role and circumventing the usual policy-making processes.

Since becoming national security adviser in April 2018, Bolton has hosted fewer “principals meetings” involving high-level Cabinet officials and has pursued shorter, more informal briefs with the president and his staff. Generally, he has reengineered his role “into a decision-making perch instead of a position meant to funnel information to the President,” per CNN.

At times, that’s left other top-ranking officials, including Pompeo, feeling excluded and out of the loop.

During a recent debate over how to handle North Korea, Bolton left Pompeo off messages he sent to the CIA that included a list of questions he wanted answered, according to a source in the intelligence community.

That infuriated Pompeo, who as secretary of state has led negotiations with the North Koreans. In its replies to Bolton, the CIA started sharing information with both Bolton and Pompeo.

Bolton is also reportedly holding meetings at the CIA headquarters as an easy way to keep State Department staffers from attending. One source told CNN that “John Bolton is playing secretary of State.”

Pompeo and Bolton agree on foreign policy in broad strokes and are separated mostly by degrees of hawkishness. For example, Pompeo wants to put pressure on the Iranian government, while Bolton has long been an advocate for regime change in Tehran. But the two diverge in their approach to sharing information. While Pompeo tends to be careful in his media appearances, Bolton is happy to put himself at the forefront of policy debates on television and on Twitter, to the consternation of his counterpart at State. Bolton will also attempt to use lawmakers to forward his policy goals, reportedly sending staff to the Hill in advance of representatives’ meetings with Trump, hoping they will rebroadcast an idea of his in their sessions with the president.

Not only is Bolton’s jockeying causing open conflict with Pompeo in national security meetings, Trump also appears to be frustrated by his unconventional adviser. The president reportedly said that he felt undermined by Bolton on North Korea, and that Bolton is pushing a “war agenda” on Iran, when he would prefer diplomatic talks. Naturally, the president also doesn’t like his adviser’s public-facing role. Bolton’s Twitter presence and media appearances are not “appreciated by the president,” a source close to Bolton told CNN. “He wants it to be all about him.”"
DHS warns of 'strong concerns' that Chinese-made drones are stealing data,https://www.cnn.com,['David Shortell'],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/20/politics/dhs-chinese-drone-warning/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Chinese-made drones may be sending sensitive flight data to their manufacturers in China, where it can be accessed by the government there, the US Department of Homeland Security warned in an alert issued Monday obtained by CNN.

The drones are a ""potential risk to an organization's information,"" the alert from DHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency states. The products ""contain components that can compromise your data and share your information on a server accessed beyond the company itself.""

The report does not name any specific manufacturers, but nearly 80% of the drones used in the US and Canada come from DJI, which is headquartered in Shenzhen, China, according to one industry analysis. US local law enforcement organizations and infrastructure operators have grown to rely on drones in recent years.

""The United States government has strong concerns about any technology product that takes American data into the territory of an authoritarian state that permits its intelligence services to have unfettered access to that data or otherwise abuses that access,"" the alert says.

""Those concerns apply with equal force to certain Chinese-made (unmanned aircraft systems)-connected devices capable of collecting and transferring potentially revealing data about their operations and the individuals and entities operating them, as China imposes unusually stringent obligations on its citizens to support national intelligence activities,"" the alert adds.

The Energy 202: EPA blocks a dozen products containing pesticides thought harmful to bees,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Dino Grandoni', 'Reporter Covering Energy', 'Environmental Policy']",05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/05/22/the-energy-202-epa-blocks-a-dozen-products-containing-pesticides-thought-harmful-to-bees/5ce46c34a7a0a46b92a3fd6a/,"THE LIGHTBULB

The Environmental Protection Agency is pulling from the market a dozen products containing pesticides known to be toxic to a linchpin of the U.S. food system — the honeybee.

The agency announced Monday it has canceled the registrations of 12 pest-killing products with compounds belonging to a class of chemicals known as neonicotinoids, as part of a legal settlement.

For years, beekeepers and wildlife conversationalists alike have voiced concern that the widespread use of neonics, as the chemicals are commonly called, is imperiling wild and domesticated bees crucial to pollinating commercial fruit, nut and vegetable crops.

The Trump administration's action was welcome news to some environmentalists. “Certainly we have a ways to go,” said George Kimbrell, legal director at the nonprofit advocacy group Center for Food Safety, whose lawsuit prompted the EPA’s action. “But it's an important first step in acknowledging the harm they cause.”

The EPA has pulled other neonics from market before, agency spokesman John Konkus said in an email. But close observers of the agency say such actions are rare.

“For the EPA to pull a previously registered pesticide is a pretty major step,” said Mark Winston, a professor of apiculture and social insects at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, B.C. “It’s not something they do very often.”

The decision follows five years of litigation in which the beekeepers and environmentalists pressed the agency to mount a response to the use of neonics as regulators in Europe and Canada have taken steps toward banning the chemicals.

Finally, at the end of 2018, three agribusinesses — Bayer, Syngenta and Valent — agreed to let the EPA pull from shelves the 12 pesticide products used by growers ranging from large-scale agricultural businesses to home gardeners. The legal settlement also compels the EPA to analyze the impacts of the entire neonic class on endangered species.

Two of the pesticide makers, Bayer and Valent, say their products are tested and safe to use, noting that the environmentalists and beekeepers won their case on the technical grounds that the EPA did not follow the right steps under the Endangered Species Act when registering their products.

“Neonicotinoids are rigorously tested before going to market to ensure they can be used safely and effectively,” said Steve Tatum, a spokesman for Valent, which makes four of the delisted products.

Bayer noted its two products targeted by the EPA action are not sold in the United States. But spokesman Darren Wallis added: “Growers rely on these critical pest-management tools because of their performance against destructive pests, as well as their favorable human and environmental safety profile.”

Concern over neonics has grown since 2006, when beekeepers first started witnessing the sudden and mysterious collapse of honeybee hives across the nation.

Researchers have shown the compounds to be harmful to bees in laboratory tests. But they have had less luck pinning down the pesticides’ effects on beekeepers’ colonies when they go about their work pollinating apple orchards and other farms.

In his second term Barack Obama, who had earlier approved installing a beehive on the South Lawn of the White House, launched an initiative to promote the health of honeybees and other pollinators.

But Rebecca Riley, legal director of the nature program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that the agency has failed often in the past to adequately consider the potential impact of its pesticide approvals on endangered animals — something every federal agency is supposed to do.

“EPA for years has been ignoring this requirement of the law,” she said.

That has led to a number of lawsuits, such as one the NRDC filed in 2017, asking a federal court to vacate the registrations of nearly 100 products that contain one of several insecticides that are harmful to various bees, butterflies, birds and insects. That case remains unresolved, even as the separate Center for Food Safety case led EPA to pull some pesticides from the market.

“This is a win for both the rule of law and also for bees, birds and other wildlife impacted by these pesticides,” Riley said of the latest case. “But the reality is there are hundreds of pesticide products on the market. So, this is important … but it does not get rid of the danger.”

— EPA doesn't send rep to hearing: Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), chair of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations, criticized the Environmental Protection Agency for failing to send a representative to testify during a hearing about a Trump administration proposal to roll back Obama-era mercury regulations. “I am continually frustrated and surprised by the administration's refusal to send witnesses to Congress,” she said. “And the EPA's refusal to show up today is just another example of the efforts to block Congress from performing its oversight functions. And so we're going to have to move forward, but it would be really helpful if we had the agencies here to help us.”

— Nominee for top Interior Dept. lawyer advances: The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee advanced the president’s pick to be the Interior Department solicitor, Daniel Jorjani, on a party-line vote. Jorjani advanced despite objections from Democrats including Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who criticized the nominee during Tuesday’s panel meeting. “It concerns me Mr. Jorjani has spent the past two years he served as acting solicitor overturning prior interpretations of our public lands laws in a manner that is out of step with the congressional intent,” Manchin said in a statement. “The Solicitor must uphold the law above all else—above party, politics, and ideology. That was not the sense I got from Mr. Jorjani’s responses to our questions.”

— Texas bill could penalize pipeline protesters: Under a new bill approved by both chambers in Texas’s state legislature, protesters who are found to have delayed pipeline operations or otherwise damaged equipment could face up to a decade in prison. “The Texas Oil & Gas Association applauded its passage and said the bill provides property owners and pipeline companies ‘greater protections against intentional damage, delays, and stoppages caused by illegal activity,’” Bloomberg News reports. “Environmental groups, meanwhile, called the measure an assault on free speech.” Cyrus Reed, interim director for the Sierra Club’s Texas chapter, said the bill is about “silencing protesters trying to protect their water and land.”

— The reality of plastic pollution: A new study found there are about 414 million pieces of debris scattered across the remote Cocos Islands of Australia, which could be an underestimate because a lot of the waste is below the surface, NBC News reports. The findings could suggest the amount of plastic polluting the world could be much more than previously realized. “The scientists surveyed seven of the 27 islands, which made up 88 percent of the total landmass of the islands, and estimated that they were littered with 262 tons of plastic. A quarter of those pieces of debris were single-use or disposable items such as straws, bags and toothbrushes (about 373,000 of them). The researchers also identified about 977,000 shoes,” per the report.

— A wild spring storm: A powerful spring system drove a variety of extreme weather throughout the country on Monday and Tuesday, with serious flooding and more than 20 tornadoes blasting through the Southern Plains, The Post’s Jason Samenow reports. ""Flash flooding proved to be more of a widespread hazard than the tornadoes,” he writes. “Flooding spread from the north and west sides of Oklahoma City northeast to Tulsa, where four to eight inches of rain fell in a short time. Roads were closed, and numerous high-water rescues were required.”

Earlier this month, Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta revealed his agency would bring back a fiduciary rule.

Now you can circle December on your calendar as when the Department of Labor will propose its new rule, InvestmentNews reports, citing the DOL’s spring regulatory agenda.

The agency’s old fiduciary rule – a product of the Obama administration – died in court last year, and the Trump administration allowed it to expire without an appeal. The regulation required all professionals offering advice on retirement accounts – including brokers – to act as fiduciaries, and it would have used the potential for class-action lawsuits as its enforcement teeth.

Acosta told lawmakers at the beginning of May the DOL is coordinating development of a new fiduciary rule with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is finalizing its own advice-standards package. The SEC’s package requires brokers on all accounts to act in clients’ best interests, a step up from the current standard that they offer investments that are suitable for clients.

We’re curious to see what enforcement tools the new DOL fiduciary rule will contain.

Senate Democrats on Tuesday hammered a top Treasury Department official over a bombshell report that Deutsche Bank resisted reporting suspicious financial activity tied to President Donald Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, whose companies were clients of the German lender.

One after another, Democrats at a Senate Banking Committee hearing that focused on anonymous shell company abuse urged the director of Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, Kenneth Blanco, to take action on the New York Times story.

Story Continued Below

Blanco's agency, known as FinCEN, is responsible for policing illegal money laundering and would have received any so-called suspicious activity reports filed by Deutsche Bank. According to the Times, bank employees prepared the reports but were blocked by executives.

""The alleged facts are in plain sight,"" Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said. ""It's essential it seems to me to the public trust and the integrity of FinCEN that these be actively pursued.""

Despite the pummeling by Democrats — not a single Republican at the hearing brought up Deutsche Bank — Blanco said he was unable to comment on allegations made in the story, which he said he had been briefed on but had not read.

""You're a very smart man,"" Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), responded. ""It wouldn't take very long to read it, but it might be very informative to you.""

""Just because it's in the newspaper doesn't mean it’s true,"" Blanco said. ""I'm not saying it's false, either.""

Blanco suggested that the bank might have been comfortable with the risks it was taking with Trump.

""Everything is fact-specific,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, it could be quite appropriate.""

Before Tuesday's hearing, Van Hollen and Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) wrote to Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing asking him to confirm the accuracy of the Times story and to divulge how many suspicious activity reports were quashed.

Deutsche Bank has said there were ""numerous inaccuracies and misleading statements"" in the Times story but that legal restrictions prevented it from refuting them in detail."
Justice lawyers say House can't sue Trump over emergency declaration for wall,https://thehill.com,[],05-23-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/445288-justice-lawyers-say-congress-cant-sue-trump-over-emergency,"Department of Justice lawyers argued in a D.C. court Thursday that the House doesn’t have the ability to sue the administration as they sought to block Democrats’ lawsuit challenging President Trump Donald John TrumpFeinstein, Iranian foreign minister had dinner amid tensions: report The Hill's Morning Report - Trump says no legislation until Dems end probes Harris readies a Phase 2 as she seeks to rejuvenate campaign MORE’s ability to use military funds to build a border wall under his national emergency declaration.

The Democratic-controlled House filed suit against the Trump administration last month after the president declared a national emergency to shift funds toward building a wall at the southern border.

ADVERTISEMENT

The lawsuit doesn't challenge the national emergency itself, but rather the transfer of the military funds toward constructing a border wall.

House Democrats have argued that only Congress has the constitutional authority to appropriate funds, and that using money meant for military projects to build a wall violates the separation of powers.

During the first 90 minutes of the roughly three-hour hearing, District Judge Trevor McFadden heard arguments from both parties on whether the courts should even play a role in the fight between Congress and the administration on the border wall funding.

James Burnham, a deputy assistant attorney at the Justice Department, said that the “Constitution nowhere even hints at inter-branch litigation” and that for 200 years, officials “resolved political disputes through political means.”

When McFadden, who indicated throughout the proceedings that he was concerned over whether he should even be ruling on a dispute between the executive and legislative branches, asked him whether that means the House would never have the ability to sue the administration, Burnham replied, “Yes.”

Douglas Letter, the general counsel for the House, argued that it’s well within the courts' rights to make a ruling. He said that in the past, the Supreme Court has found that judges can “tell the other two branches what the Constitution means.”

“We cannot have the president appropriate money, in order to protect the liberty of U.S. persons,” he argued.

When McFadden, a Trump appointee, pressed Letter on whether the House had exhausted all of its other options to oppose the administration before filing the lawsuit, the attorney said that it had.

He pointed to lawmakers in both the House and Senate refusing to include Trump’s requested border security funding in appropriations bills as an implicit denial of funding to construct a border wall.

“Here we have a situation where the House did what the political weaponry told it to, not just the House but Congress,” Letter said.

Congress also passed a resolution opposing Trump's emergency declaration, but Burnham said that the House’s argument was weakened by its failure to override Trump’s veto of that measure.

""Congress of plenty of tools it could use"" to halt the transfer of funds, Burnham argued, ""if it felt strongly enough.""

Trump issued the emergency declaration in January after agreeing to a funding bill to end a record 35-day government shutdown that didn’t include his requested amount of border security funds.

During the second half of Thursday’s hearing, McFadden heard arguments pertaining to whether he should issue a preliminary injunction to temporarily block the military funds from going toward the wall.

Letter claimed that lawmakers are being “irreparably harmed” because the money can’t be returned once it's spent.

While Burnham acknowledged that the funds can't be returned, he said that construction under the scope of the national emergency hasn't fully begun yet. And he said the Defense Department has not formally determined how the reprogrammed funding will be used, so an injunction isn't necessary at this time.

McFadden ended the proceedings without making a ruling, saying that he was taking the matter “under consideration.”

The hearing was held after House Democrats secured a pair of key legal victories this week, with two separate federal judges ruling that financial institutions can hand over Trump's financial records to lawmakers investigating the president.

It's unclear exactly how McFadden will rule. If he determines that House Democrats can't sue the administration, the lawsuit could be tossed out — which lawmakers would likely appeal."
Lawmakers slam Trump's pick for defense secretary over new oversight policy,https://www.cnn.com,['Ryan Browne'],05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/22/politics/shanahan-pentagon-oversight/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The senior Democrat and Republican members of the House Armed Services Committee criticized acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan over a new policy which they say seeks to limit congressional oversight of the Pentagon.

""If implemented, the Department's new policy guidance would dramatically limit Congress' ability to execute our constitutional prerogative,"" said Chairman Adam Smith, a Democrat, and ranking member Mac Thornberry, a Republican.

""Congress oversees the Department of Defense; but with this new policy, the Department is overstepping its authority by presuming to determine what warrants legislative oversight,"" they added.

The statement refers to a Shanahan-approved Pentagon memo , which has been obtained by CNN, and is dated May 8.

The memo stipulates that when a Department of Defense ""component receives a congressional request for access to an operational plan or operational order the DoD component will forward the request"" to a senior official who will review it using a series of criteria to include ""whether the request contains sufficient information to demonstrate a relationship to a legislative function"" and ""whether the request implicates presidential decision-making or the President's prerogatives as the Commander in Chief.""

"Duckworth accuses EPA of deception, calls for probe into ethanol waivers",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-23-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/tammy-duckworth-accuses-epa-of-deception-calls-for-probe-into-ethanol-waivers,"Illinois Democrat Tammy Duckworth asked the Environmental Protection Agency's inspector general Thursday to investigate whether the agency broke the law in granting dozens of waivers to the oil industry to not blend corn ethanol into the gasoline supply.

Duckworth said new documents show that EPA has deceived members of Congress about its reasons for granting 35 small refinery exemptions in the last two years, compared to the seven granted under the Obama administration.

“Recent document disclosures reveal that the EPA misled Members of Congress, industry and the public,"" the senator said in a letter to EPA acting Inspector General Charles Sheehan. “This deception by EPA political appointees may indicate improper motives and conflicts of interest, and it warrants a thorough review.""

Duckworth is the first lawmaker to call on the EPA inspector's office to launch such a probe after months of prodding by the likes of Iowa Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst demanding that agency stop granting the exemptions to oil companies. They argue that most of the refineries were attached to large oil companies such as Exxon, which do not meet the requirements for an exemption under the law.

Duckworth's state is the third-largest ethanol producer in the country behind Iowa and Nebraska. The ethanol industry argues that the agency's refinery exemptions have caused producers of the corn-based fuel to lose market share.

The refinery industry says the ethanol industry's argument is baseless, arguing that they need the waivers to reduce the costs imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency's Renewable Fuel Standard. The standard requires refiners to blend an increasing amount of ethanol and other renewable fuels into the fuel supply each year.

But with increased pressure on farmers from President Trump's trade policies with China, lawmakers say the exemption program is exacerbating the economic harm to farmers. Farmers are suffering from China's retaliatory tariffs on soybeans and a range of other U.S. agricultural commodities.

Nevertheless, the EPA is poised to roll back regulations in a week to allow more ethanol to be sold during the summer months by lifting restrictions on 15% ethanol fuel blends. The pro-ethanol camp says the plan, endorsed personally by Trump, will be a boon to corn farmers. But with the trade war and the refinery exemptions in place, they say, those gains could be lost.

Meanwhile, House Agriculture Committee Chairman Collin Peterson, D-Minn., and Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., on Thursday introduced legislation to prevent the agency from abusing the refinery exemption program. The ethanol lobby in Washington applauded the bipartisan bill as a means of ensuring transparency is reintroduced back into the refinery waiver program."

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez question Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin about his ties to Sears",https://www.chicagotribune.com,['Corilyn Shropshire'],05-23-2019,2019,5,https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-warren-ocasio-cortez-question-mnuchin-20190523-story.html,"Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Thursday challenged Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin over his role in Sears’ bankruptcy.

In a four-page letter to Mnuchin, who was on the retailer’s board until December 2016, the two Democrats said they were “deeply concerned by the financial engineering and potentially illegal activity that took place at Sears Holding Corporation while you served on the company’s board. In addition, we are concerned that, as Treasury Secretary, you are in a position to take actions that benefit Sears’ shareholders and owners at the expense of workers and taxpayers.”

The Treasury Department is in charge of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., which has taken over the retailer’s two underfunded pension plans. In his role, Mnuchin is on the board of directors of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp.

Mnuchin and other former members of the company’s board, as well as former chairman Edward Lampert, are being sued by Sears Holding Corp. for allegedly stripping the retailer of billions of dollars as it struggled before declaring bankruptcy.

The letter from Warren and Ocasio-Cortez tracked elements of the retailer’s demise, including the more than 3,500 store closures and 250,000 workers who lost their jobs during Lampert’s tenure as chief.

It questions Mnuchin on how he advised Lampert and other company leaders on stock buybacks and the company’s debt, and if Sears’ board communicated with him about the government’s decision to take over Sears’ pension plans. The letter also asks about a 2017 ethics agreement in which he said he would not be involved with matters related to Sears Holdings for one year.

Mnuchin, Lampert’s roommate at Yale University, joined Kmart’s board in 2003, which at the time was owned by Lampert’s hedge fund, ESL investments. When Sears and Kmart merged in 2005, Mnuchin became a board member of Sears.

Warren and Ocasio-Cortez also posted a video on Twitter, sharing their concerns about Mnuchin’s role and the possibility that he benefited from the retailer’s bankruptcy.

‘Deeply frustrated’ senators demand action in letter after VA mishandled mental health benefit,https://www.king5.com,"['Author', 'Taylor Mirfendereski', 'Published', 'Am Pdt May', 'Updated', 'Pm Pdt May']",05-23-2019,2019,5,https://www.king5.com/article/news/senators-send-va-letter-demand-action-after-king-5-reveals-agency-mishandled-mental-health-benefit-for-certain-vets/281-d16c9e9a-4643-4228-a3df-6244790c931d,"WASHINGTON, USA — Five U.S. senators sent the Department of Veterans Affairs a letter Thursday demanding immediate corrective action in response to a KING 5 investigation that revealed the VA fumbled the roll out of a 2018 law, which expanded access to mental health care for a group of at-risk veterans.

""We are deeply frustrated that, as a result, thousands of veterans who are legally owed mental health care are unaware of their eligibility or have been denied care at VA facilities,” the senators wrote to VA Secretary Robert Wilkie in the letter signed by Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Sen. Jon Tester (D-Montana), and Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii).

The March 2018 law requires the VA, for the first time, to provide ongoing mental and behavioral health care to hundreds of thousands of combat veterans and sexual assault victims who received other-than-honorable discharges — a group who faces an elevated risk of suicide. It expanded a 2017 VA program that offered short-term mental health care to those vets on an emergency basis.

KING reported last week that the VA missed Congress' deadline to notify eligible veterans of the change, and the agency failed to treat the majority of other-than-honorable veterans who qualified for help under the law.

The May 14 story also shed light on a need for more training among frontline VA staff. The story featured Bran McIan, a former Army special forces medic with an other-than-honorable discharge, who received incorrect information about the law when he visited American Lake VA Medical Center in April to seek treatment for PTSD.

RELATED: ‘It’s Unconscionable:’ Current and Former U.S Lawmakers React To KING's Investigation

Citing the media coverage and information provided directly to their offices, the senators point out that some veterans in Washington state and Connecticut aren't getting the care the new law affords them. VA employees informed the senators, according to the letter, that the agency's IT system still automatically categorizes other-than-honorable veterans as ineligible for care.

""The VA must immediately update its IT systems, retrain VA personnel on the eligibility changes under the Honor Our Commitment Act, and conduct routine inspections of VA intake personnel to ensure they are providing the correct information to (other-than-honorable) veterans,” the senators wrote.

They also ordered the VA to conduct a public outreach campaign to educate veterans, veterans service organizations and the broader public about the new law.

“We recognize that the VA finally complied with the law by mailing 477,404 letters to (other-than-honorable) veterans’ last known address in January, but the VA must do more than the bare minimum,” they wrote in the letter, adding that the agency has ""failed to reach out to veterans adequately” despite receiving substantial budget increases.

The VA sent out this letter to notify other-than-honorable veterans they may be eligible for mental health care.

-

In 2018, less than 1% of the estimated 500,000 veterans with an other-than-honorable discharge received mental health treatment at the VA, according to data provided by the department. In Washington state, 16 veterans with other-than-honorable discharges received VA mental health treatment last year.

While the letter puts the VA on notice to comply with the law, Congress has options if lawmakers are not satisfied with Secretary Wilkie's response. For example, they could withhold funding from the department or pass additional legislation to mandate further outreach to vets.

To date, national VA officials haven’t responded to multiple interview requests, and they haven’t answered specific questions about the issue, including whether the agency will make changes to reach more veterans who qualify for care.

"McGahn confirms he will skip House hearing, as DOJ asserts 'immunity' and Nadler fumes",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-mcgahn-house-hearing,"President Trump has directed former White House Counsel Don McGahn to skip a House Judiciary Committee hearing scheduled for Tuesday, citing a Justice Department opinion that he cannot be compelled to testify about his official duties -- and, through his legal team, McGahn confirmed Monday evening that he won't appear.

The development prompted an obstinate response late Monday from House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y.: “We are having the hearing tomorrow and we’re expecting Mr. McGahn to show pursuant to the subpoena.""

Earlier this month, House Democrats opted to question an empty chair -- and a bucket of fried chicken -- when Attorney General Bill Barr failed to appear, citing Democrats' unusual demands.

In a letter to Nadler, McGahn attorney William Burck said his client won't show up. Burck said current White House Counsel Pat Cipollone had communicated that Trump had instructed McGahn not to testify, and that Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel Steven Engel had said McGahn was immune from testifying.

""Mr. McGahn understands from your prior correspondence that the Committee would vote to hold him in contempt should he not appear tomorrow and the House of Representatives may follow suit,"" Burck wrote to Nadler. ""While we disagree with the Committee’s position and hope it will instead seek an accommodation with the White House, Mr. McGahn also must honor his ethical and legal obligations as a former senior lawyer and senior advisor to the President. In short, it is our view that the Committee’s dispute is not with Mr. McGahn but with the White House.""

Burck added: ""Mr. McGahn remains obligated to maintain the status quo and respect the President’s instruction. In the event an accommodation is agreed between the Committee and the White House, Mr. McGahn will of course comply with that accommodation.""

In a statement released Monday afternoon, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders blasted Democrats for continuing to pursue Trump investigations, saying they want a ""wasteful and unnecessary do-over"" in the wake of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe -- and describing the subpoena for McGahn as part of that.

""The House Judiciary Committee has issued a subpoena to try and force Mr. McGahn to testify again. The Department of Justice has provided a legal opinion stating that, based on long-standing, bipartisan, and Constitutional precedent, the former Counsel to the President cannot be forced to give such testimony, and Mr. McGahn has been directed to act accordingly,"" Sanders said. ""This action has been taken in order to ensure that future Presidents can effectively execute the responsibilities of the Office of the Presidency.""

The related DOJ memo said McGahn, like other senior advisers to a president, has ""immunity"" from being compelled to testify about his official duties.

""This immunity applies to the former White House Counsel. Accordingly, Mr. McGahn is not legally required to appear and testify about matters related to his official duties as Counsel to the President,"" the memo said.

The New York Times first reported that the president would likely direct McGahn to skip the hearing.

HOUSE JUDICIARY CHAIRMAN SUBPOENAS EX-WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL DON MCGAHN

The committee announced the hearing last week, but it was unclear whether McGahn would appear due to the ongoing battle between congressional Democrats and the White House over his testimony.

Earlier this month, Sanders said she did not “anticipate” that a hearing would take place. “We consider this to be a case closed and we’re moving forward to do the work of the American people,” Sanders said on ABC News’ “The Investigation” podcast.

The committee, led by Nadler, subpoenaed McGahn on April 22, days after the release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report, which featured McGahn prominently in its section related to the obstruction of justice inquiry. This included a claim that McGahn disobeyed Trump’s call to have him seek Mueller’s removal.

“On June 17, 2017, the president called [White House Counsel Don] McGahn at home and directed him to call the Acting Attorney General and say that the Special Counsel had conflicts of interest and must be removed. McGahn did not carry out the direction, however, deciding that he would resign rather than trigger what he regarded as a potential Saturday Night Massacre,” the report stated, referencing the Watergate scandal.

The report also revealed that when the media reported on the president’s request, the president directed White House officials “to tell McGahn to dispute the story and create a record stating he had not been ordered to have the special counsel removed.” He did not.

The House committee's subpoena, coming amid a fight over access to the unredacted Mueller report, called for McGahn to appear before the panel to testify and provide documents related to the Mueller investigation.

But earlier this month, Cipollone first notified the committee that McGahn would not be allowed to comply with the subpoena, saying requests for documents and materials must go to the White House.

“The White House provided these records to Mr. McGahn in connection with its cooperation with the Special Counsel’s investigation and with the clear understanding that the records remain subject to the control of the White House for all purposes,” Cipollone wrote. “The White House records remain legally protected from disclosure under longstanding constitutional principles, because they implicate significant Executive Branch confidentiality interests and executive privilege.”

HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SCHEDULES HEARING FOR DON MCGAHN, DESPITE WHITE HOUSE MOVE TO BLOCK SUBPOENA

He added: “Because Mr. McGahn does not have the legal right to disclose these documents to third parties, I would ask the Committee to direct any request for such records to the White House, the appropriate legal custodian.”

Cipollone wrote that acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney “has directed Mr. McGahn not to produce these White House records,” adding that the Justice Department concurs with their legal position.

But Nadler has stressed the importance of McGahn’s testimony, saying it would “help shed further light on the president’s attacks on the rule of law, and his attempts to cover up those actions by lying to the American people and requesting others to do the same.”

Trump, though, said he never told McGahn to fire Mueller, and tweeted last month that if he “wanted to fire Mueller, I didn’t need McGahn to do it, I could have done it myself.""

The battle over McGahn's testimony is just one front in the clash between the White House and congressional Democrats.

Earlier this month, the committee voted to hold Barr in contempt for defying a subpoena for Mueller's full and unredacted report, as well as underlying evidence and documents used in the investigation.

Trump, prior to the vote, asserted executive privilege over the materials in a bid to protect them from being turned over to the committee. The full House has yet to take a final vote on whether to hold Barr in contempt of Congress.

DHS press secretary to leave post for position at State Department,https://www.cnn.com,['Geneva Sands'],05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/22/politics/dhs-press-secretary-leaving-for-state-department/index.html,"(CNN) Department of Homeland Security press secretary Tyler Q. Houlton is leaving his position at the end of the week after nearly two years delivering the public message for a department that has been at the center of the Trump administration's focus on immigration and many of its controversial policies.

Houlton's last day at DHS is Friday and he is expected to remain in the administration, taking a position as a senior adviser at the State Department. CNN has reached out to the State Department for comment.

His departure from the department is the latest in a wave of changes at DHS headquarters, including at top leadership positions, stemming from the forced resignation last month of former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.

The departures included the acting deputy secretary of Homeland Security, the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as well as a leadership shakeup at US Secret Service, Customs and Border Protection and the Transportation Security Administration.

After Nielsen left the department, CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan was appointed as acting secretary, bringing a number of CBP staff with him to headquarters.

EPA Sets Schedules for Long List of Power Plant Regulatory Actions,https://www.powermag.com,"['Sonal Patel', 'Darrell Proctor']",05-23-2019,2019,5,https://www.powermag.com/epa-sets-schedules-for-long-list-of-power-plant-regulatory-actions/,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will act on a spate of power plant rules over the next year, its newly released agenda of regulatory and deregulatory actions shows.

The May 23-released “Spring 2019 Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions” lists 35 new actions, along with 57 actions that it considers “deregulatory.” The list includes new rules governing coal ash, new insights and timelines for effluent limitations, monitoring and record-keeping clarifications for the mercury rule and other rules, and an amendment to a rule governing stationary combustion turbines at power plants.

The agenda shows “continued progress in reducing regulatory burden” envisioned by President Trump’s proposed regulatory reforms, the agency said in a statement. The actions will be overseen by newly confirmed EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler, who has held the role in an acting capacity since July 5, after Scott Pruitt, the Trump administration’s first EPA head, resigned amid scrutiny for questionable ethical decisions involving his office. During his confirmation hearings, Wheeler said if he were confirmed as EPA administrator, he would continue to work to advance President Trump’s regulatory reform agenda. “In 2018, EPA finalized 13 major deregulatory actions, saving Americans roughly $1.8 billion in regulatory costs. To date, under President Trump, EPA has finalized 33 major deregulatory actions saving Americans almost $2 billion,” he noted.

The agenda provides estimated schedules for a number of power plant rules.

Effluent Limitations Guidelines (ELG) and Standards for the Steam Electric Power Generating Point Source Category. The EPA could revise the 2015 Best Available Technology (BAT) effluent limitations and pretreatment standards for bottom ash transport water and flue gas desulfurization wastewater at existing sources. The EPA will issue a notice of the proposed rule-making (NPRM) in June 2019, and a final rule by August 2020. The agency deems the rule “economically significant.” A federal court ruling that vacated key portions of the 2015 rule added a dramatic new element of uncertainty in timing of the rule, which the Trump administration had previously said it expected to finalize by December 2019. The power sector has been preparing to comply with the 2015 ELG rule, which sought to amend an ELG rule last updated in 1982 by setting the first federal limits on levels of toxic metals in wastewater that can be discharged from existing coal, gas, oil, and nuclear plants.

Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) for Power Plants Technical Corrections, Electronic Reporting Revisions, and Clarifications. The action proposes to revise the 2012 rule to clarify and provide flexibility to some monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting provisions in the final rule. A proposed rule is expected in November 2019.

Definition of “Waters of the United States”—Recodification of Preexisting Rule. The Trump administration in February 2017 moved to rescind or replace the Obama administration’s 2015 definition of “waters of the U.S.” In December 2018, the EPA proposed a new definition that could exempt groundwater and ditches from regulation under the Clean Water Act (CWA). The EPA’s agenda suggests a final rule recodifiying the existing rule will come in August 2019. It will also formally issue a revised definition in December 2019.

Hazardous and Solid Waste Management System: Disposal of Coal Combustion Residues From Electric Utilities: Amendments to the National Minimum Criteria (Phase 2). Since a final rule governing disposal of coal combustion residuals (CCR) from power plants was signed in April 2015, the EPA has grappled with legal challenges. In July 2016, the EPA extended compliance deadlines. In the Trump era, responding to utility petitions that urged the EPA to reconsider parts of the rule, the agency in July 2018 signed the first of two rules to overhaul the final 2015 rule and better align it to potential revisions to the ELGs.

The rule weakened requirements for managing coal ash storage areas, allows states to suspend groundwater monitoring if no leaks are detected, and it delays pond closure deadlines until October 2020—about 18 more months compared to the 2015 rule. As part of the second phase, the EPA will propose additional “targeted” changes to the 2015 CCR rule, including actions remanded back to the agency by the D.C. Circuit in August 2018. The court struck down the provisions of the 2015 rule that that allowed unlined and clay-lined impoundments to receive coal ash and exempted inactive impoundments, finding that EPA’s approach “does not address the identified health and environmental harms documented in the record.” The EPA sent Phase 2 to the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review on May 7. The proposal should be issued in July 2019, the agenda says. A final rule will come in December 2019.

Hazardous and Solid Waste Management System: Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals from Electric Utilities; Revision of Cease Receipt of Waste Deadline for CCR Surface Impoundments; Response to Court. Making its appearance in the agenda for the first time, this rule seeks to address issues stemming from the D.C. Circuit’s August 2018 court decision in Utility Solid Waste Activities Group, et al v. EPA, which came a month after the EPA’s finalization of the Phase 1 CCR rule. Environmental groups challenged the Phase 1 rule, and in March 2019, the D.C. District Court allowed the EPA to voluntarily remand the rule without vacated. Among issues the rule addresses is when owners and operators of CCR surface impoundments should cease the receipt of CCR and initiate closure. The new rule extends the cease receipt deadline from October 2018 to October 2020. Abiding by a court deadline that forces the agency to finalize a new rule by December 2019, the EPA expects to propose a rule by July 2019, with final action in December.

Federal Coal Combustion Residuals Permitting Program. After Congress passed the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation (WIIN) Act in 2016—effectively giving the EPA new CCR enforcement authority under amendments to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)—the EPA has designed a new CCR regulatory structure under which states may seek approval from the agency to operate a permitting program that would regulate CCR facilities within their state. This rule will establish the permitting program. “The potentially regulated universe is limited to facilities with CCR disposal units subject to regulation under 40 CFR part 257 subpart D, which are located on tribal lands and in nonparticipating states. The remaining CCR facilities would be regulated by the approved state program and would not be subject to federal permitting requirements,” the EPA says. A proposed rule is expected in July 2019, and a final rule could come in May 2020. This is a new rule on the unified agenda.

Hazardous and Solid Waste Management System; Disposal of CCR; Alternative Demonstration for Unlined Surface Impoundments / Request for Comment on Legacy Units; Response to Court Part B. Responding to the August 2018 D.C. Circuit decision, this rule—also making a first appearance in the agenda—would address a provision in that court decision and provide a mechanism where unlined surface impoundments meeting strict criteria would be allowed to continue to operate. This rule will also address a necessary modification to the timeline of closure by removal, and it requests comments on inactive units at inactive facilities also known as “legacy units.” A proposed rule is expected in July 2019, with a final rule in December 2019.

Financial Responsibility Requirements Under CERCLA Section 108(b) for the Electric Power Generation, Transmission, and Distribution Industry. Section 108(b) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980, as amended, establishes certain authorities concerning financial responsibility requirements. The EPA in January 2010 identified classes of facilities, including those in the power generation, transmission, and distribution sector, as those for which could develop, as necessary, financial responsibility requirements under CERCLA 108(b) to cover costs associated with releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances from their facilities. In January 2017, the EPA made a determination to proceed with these rulemakings. A proposed rule for the power sector will come in July 2019, and a final rule in December 2020.

Review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for Particulate Matter. As required by the Clean Air Act, the EPA must set NAAQS for particulate matter (PM) and five other pollutants and periodically review the standards. In January 2013, the EPA published a final rule tightening the NAAQS for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) to 12.0 micrograms per cubic meter (μg/m3) but declared it would not finalize a proposal to update separate secondary PM2.5 standards. The EPA has since been preparing an integrated review plan and other documents, which it says will inform a “decision” as to whether it will retain or revise the standards. A proposed rule is expected in March 2020.

General Revisions to Emissions Monitoring and Reporting Requirements for Fossil Fuel-Fired Electric Generating Units. This proposed rule would revise the definitions, monitoring, record-keeping, and reporting requirements associated with the allowance trading programs—the Acid Rain and Cross State Air Pollution Rule, for example. The proposed rule would also update or remove other provisions of the Acid Rain Program that applied only in earlier phases of the program. A proposed rule will be issued in November 2019, with a final rule in April 2020.

National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP): Stationary Combustion Turbine Residual Risk and Technology Review. The Stationary Combustion Turbine NESHAP, subpart YYYY, which the EPA promulgated in March 2004, establishes emission standards for hazardous air pollutants at stationary combustion turbines at power plants and other facilities, and for years, industry has been working to get the EPA to delist natural gas subcategories based on low risk. This April, the EPA proposed to amend the rule, including to revise requirements for periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction to be consistent with recent court decisions. The proposed rule also seeks to remove a stay for new gas-fired combustion turbines. The comment period will end in May 2019 and the final rule could come in January 2020.

Commerce Dept. grants Huawei a 90-day license to help existing users,https://www.engadget.com,[],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.engadget.com/2019/05/20/huawei-temp-license/,"Last week the US Commerce Department added Huawei and 68 subsidiaries to its ""Entity List"" that bans it from doing business with US companies without a special license. Today, as anticipated, the Commerce Department loosened that restriction a bit with a temporary 90-day license. According to Wilbur Ross, the Secretary of Commerce, it ""will allow operations to continue for existing Huawei mobile phone users and rural broadband networks.""

Because many operators, or owners of various handsets might not have any other way to get software updates or look into backups for necessary equipment, Huawei can continue to service those existing customers -- for now at least. For the long term, however, it's still looking at the loss of access to technology like Google's Android OS, not to mention any business deals in the US.

Update: Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei made a rare public statement, telling media in China that his company had already made preparations for a ban, and said that its 5G would not be affected by the restrictions. He also said the temporary license ""bears little meaning."""
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke with Walmart's CFO about sourcing products away from China,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/22/treasury-secretary-steven-mnuchin-spoke-with-walmart-about-tariffs.html,"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin testified on Capitol Hill on Wednesday that he has spoken with a top Walmart executive about how the retail giant can best position itself and keep prices low amid the growing trade war with China.

In response to a question from Rep. Ben McAdams, D-Utah, about proposed tariffs and potentially higher prices on items including diapers, infant formula and strollers, Mnuchin said he discussed such concerns with Walmart Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs.

""I can tell you I am monitoring the situation very carefully. I was on phone with the CFO of Walmart, which obviously is one of the biggest sellers of the items that you've described to specifically understand from Walmart what things they can source from other areas and what items they can't,"" Mnuchin said at the House Financial Services Committee hearing.

""I would say we haven't made any decisions yet, but we will be especially sensitive to the consumer items,"" Mnuchin said.

Mnuchin added that he speaks with Biggs on a ""regular basis"" and has ""spoken to all of the major companies that provide consumer goods"" about the issue. Asked for comment, Walmart reiterated statements from its first-quarter earnings call made by Biggs and the chief executive of its U.S. arm, Greg Foran.

""In regards to tariffs, we continue to monitor the situation. Our goal is always to be the low price leader and we'll continue to actively manage pricing and margins with our customers and shareholders in mind,"" Biggs said Thursday. ""We're going to continue to do everything we can to keep prices low, that's who we are. However, increased tariffs will lead to increased prices we believe for our customers.""

Foran later added on the earnings call: ""Merchants are managing costs and retails on an item by item basis. We are working closely with domestic and international suppliers to drive higher efficiency and reduce costs."""
