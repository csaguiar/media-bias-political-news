"Trump promotes Epstein-Clintons conspiracy theory, the latest in a pattern of baseless claims spread by President",https://www.cnn.com,['Jeremy Diamond'],08-11-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/11/politics/jeffrey-epstein-trump-conspiracy-theory-clintons/index.html,"Berkeley Heights, New Jersey (CNN) President Donald Trump on Saturday promoted a conspiracy theory linking the Clinton family to the death of multimillionaire and accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein , the latest instance of Trump propagating baseless conspiracy theories and falsehoods.

Trump shared a tweet and video from conservative comedian Terrence Williams that claimed without evidence that former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton -- Trump's 2016 presidential election rival -- were responsible for Epstein's death. The Federal Bureau of Prisons and Attorney General Bill Barr said Epstein died in an ""apparent suicide"" while in federal custody.

As a result of Trump's retweet, the video received more than 3 million views on Twitter by Sunday morning -- more than triple Williams' most recent videos. Both Trump and Bill Clinton were friendly with Epstein in previous decades, but Trump seized on the conspiracy theory Saturday in his latest dig at the Clintons. The tweet also falsely claimed that Epstein died while on suicide watch, even though Epstein had been taken off of suicide watch before his death.

Angel Ureña, a spokesman for the former president, called the conspiracy theory ""ridiculous, and of course not true.""

""And Donald Trump knows it,"" Ureña tweeted. CNN has also reached out to a spokesperson for Hillary Clinton.

Trump promotes conspiracy theories

Lawmakers and government officials have called for inquiries into Epstein's death , but none have gone so far as to even suggest that political rivals were behind it.

Unlike any other President before him, Trump has repeatedly promoted evidence-free conspiracy theories and falsehoods without regard for the consequences of his rhetoric.

Even before he was a candidate for President, Trump grew his following on the political right by promoting the conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama was born in Kenya -- and not the United States -- even after Obama released a birth certificate showing he was born in the US.

And in the second month of his presidency, Trump accused Obama without evidence of tapping his phones in Trump Tower during the 2016 campaign. More than two years later, there is still no evidence that Trump's phones were wiretapped during the 2016 campaign.

Trump has also repeatedly claimed without evidence that millions of people voted illegally in the 2016 election; has fed conspiracy theories about a ""deep state"" of government officials working against him; and has also falsely smeared former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation as a ""witch hunt"" and called the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign ""treason"" -- among many others.

Trump was not the only official in his administration to promote the Epstein-Clintons conspiracy theory. Lynne Patton, a senior official at the Department of Housing and Urban Development and a longtime Trump family aide and friend, also gave voice to the conspiracy theory on her Instagram account earlier in the day.

Trump's tweet promoting the conspiracy theory came about an hour after Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio warned of the dangers of spreading partisan conspiracy theories about Epstein's death.

""Scrutiny of how #Epstein was able to commit suicide is warranted,"" Rubio tweeted. ""But the immediate rush to spread conspiracy theories about someone on the 'other side' of partisan divide having him killed illustrates why our society is so vulnerable to foreign disinformation & influence efforts.""

White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway appeared on Fox News Sunday defending the President. ""I think the President just wants everything to be investigated,"" Conway said when asked about Trump's controversial retweet.

""Just the day before, there was some unsealed information implicating some people very high up,"" she said, referring to the hundreds of pages of documents from a defamation lawsuit from one of Epstein's accusers. Those documents were unsealed Friday by a court.

""I will say that there's always this rush to (say), 'We need transparency. We need accountability,' when it involves fictional accusations like collusion with Russia to swing an election. This seems to be very concrete and that Jeffrey Epstein has done some very bad things over a number of years. So let's continue to investigate that,"" Conway said.

Democrats call out Trump for 'more recklessness'

Still, two 2020 Democratic presidential candidates on Sunday called out Trump for retweeting the Epstein conspiracy theory and the President's history of spreading baseless claims.

New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker called Trump's latest theory-peddling ""more recklessness"" and ""dangerous,"" telling CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" that Trump has ""been using the Clintons as a means for a lot of his false accusations.""

Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke also told Tapper that Trump is attacking his ""political enemies with unfounded conspiracy theories"" and called it ""bizarre behavior.""

O'Rourke said the President is attempting to shift the focus away from last weekend's mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio.

""He's changing the conversation, and if we allow him to do that, then we will never be able to focus on the true problems, of which he is a part, and make sure that we get to the solutions,"" O'Rourke, an El Paso native, said."
Keep calling him #MoscowMitch: McConnell is finally running scared,https://www.salon.com,[],08-11-2019,2019,8,https://www.salon.com/2019/08/11/keep-calling-him-moscowmitch-mcconnell-is-finally-running-scared/,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell doesn't like it when you call him #MoscowMitch. He hates it so much that he'll accuse you of being a McCarthyist for doing so. If the accusation was untrue — that is, if McConnell, President Donald Trump and other Republicans weren't empowering Russia at the expense of America for their personal benefit — then #MoscowMitch and talk of collusion in Trump's 2016 presidential campaign would be unfair, even unjust. As the facts currently stand, however, it is a perfectly fair label.

They still are not McCarthyist, though, because McCarthyism wasn't really about hating Russia — it was about hating liberals.

A quick history lesson. Joseph McCarthy was a United States senator from Wisconsin who served between 1947 and 1957. His political heyday, however, lasted from 1950 to 1954. On February 9, 1950, he delivered an infamous speech in Wheeling, West Virginia in which he claimed without evidence that he had ""a list of 205 [State Department employees] that were known to the Secretary of State as being members of the Communist Party and who nevertheless are still working and shaping the policy of the State Department."" Notice that he did not say ""Russians"" or ""traitors to Russia."" This isn't because the Soviet Union (the empire controlled by Russia during the bulk of the 20th century) wasn't America's primary geopolitical enemy at the time, or that there wasn't a valid and widespread fear of that nation. Rather it is because the assumption wasn't simply that people would betray America to Russia, but that they would do so because the Soviet Union's authoritarian left-wing ideology was being conflated with all forms of liberalism. When McCarthy warned of ""Communists,"" he was using a dog whistle to vilify anyone whose beliefs were to the left of what he and his supporters deemed acceptable.

McCarthy and his followers continued with their attacks for the next four years, targeting anyone and everyone whose liberalism they regarded as potentially suspicious (they also went after homosexuals and other marginalized groups, although this chapter of McCarthyism tends to be less explored). They even accused wielded the accusation of ""Communist"" against President Harry Truman, a Democrat who was also one of history's most ardent Cold Warriors; the Democratic presidential candidate in 1952, Illinois Gov. Adlai E. Stevenson; and President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a moderate Republican. While Truman, Stevenson and Eisenhower were politically strong enough to not be ruined by their accusations, countless people without their power who dared express views that McCarthyists deemed too liberal had their personal and professional lives ruined by false accusations of being Communist. It wasn't until exactly 52 months had passed — when Army counsel Joseph Welch humiliated McCarthy on national television for smearing an innocent man — that the Wisconsin senator's reign of terror ended.

This isn't to say that his tactics aren't still used, of course. They are — but by conservatives. Whenever you hear liberals described as ""communists"" or ""socialists,"" or liberal policy proposals denounced as preemptively authoritarian, it is because men and women are following McCarthyist tactics. Their goal isn't to protect America from possible treason, but to intimidate liberals by forcing them to fend off false accusations about their ideology. It is a classic example of a straw man fallacy but made worse by the facts that (a) it can be used to scare people into silence and (b) it means that policy proposals which might help innocent people won't be implemented. Indeed, everything from the 1960s civil rights movement to virtually all left-wing economic policies have been attacked by those who wish to quiet them as ""socialist"" or ""communist.""

To be clear: There were traitors to the United States working from the left during the Cold War. This was demonstrated by the successful prosecutions of spies like Alger Hiss and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, by the funneling of money from international Communist organizations into far-left groups that wanted America to adopt a neo-isolationist position, by the revelations of the Venona papers. The point here isn't that there were no leftists who were Communists and subversives, but rather that the threat of left-wing Communist subversion was exaggerated — either due to paranoia or deliberate malice — by opponents of liberalism so that all liberals would be discredited. That, in a nutshell, is McCarthyism.

Now contrast this with the accusations against Trump and McConnell. As former special counsel Robert Mueller's report revealed, members of Trump's campaign knew that Russia was interfering in America's election in a manner that was not only illegal but ""sweeping and systematic,"" and they actively encouraged them to do so. Trump himself publicly asked Russia to dig up dirt on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton during a press conference that July, and one month earlier the president's son and assorted other advisers (including campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who had helped install a puppet of Russian President Vladimir Putin as president of Ukraine) met with a Kremlin-connected lawyer to likewise obtain ""dirt"" on Clinton.

None of these things are open to dispute. Indeed, the president's own words and those of his family and closest advisers confirm that these things are true. On the occasions when Trump's associates have denied their contacts with Russians — such as longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone did when I interviewed him in 2017 — they have usually been revealed to be liars. Stone, for what it's worth, is currently facing criminal charges for his alleged attempts to obstruct the investigation into the Trump-Russia scandal.

Where does McConnell factor into all of this?

Well, considering that the intelligence community unanimously agrees that Russia is still actively interfering in America's elections, it stands to reason that patriots on both sides of the aisle should want to beef up our election security so that our democracy will remain intact. Yet McConnell has obstructed legislation that would do precisely this, and the only logical explanation for him doing so is that he knows Russian meddling is likely to benefit Republican candidates. When he was called out on this with the insulting but deserved epithet ""Moscow Mitch,"" he responded with a Senate speech in which he whined, ""Keeping our republic means we can't let modern-day McCarthyism win. So here is my commitment: No matter how much they lie, no matter how much they bully, I will not be intimidated.""

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat who has actually been accused of being a traitor simply because of her politics, responded to an analogous McConnell tweet by writing on Twitter: ""McCarthyism is the practice of baselessly accusing political opponents of being communists as unjust grounds for targeting & harassment. You are blocking action to protect US elections despite official DoJ pleas. That doesn’t make you a communist. It just makes you a bad leader.""

Ocasio-Cortez is absolutely correct, of course. McConnell isn't being accused of sympathy to Moscow because his opponents lack valid grounds for criticism and are resorting to a straw man fallacy. He is being accused of this because his political actions are inscrutable except as those of a man who so badly wants his party to win that he doesn't care if Russia needs to be empowered for that to happen.

I close with an observation from former Ambassador Michael McFaul, who served as President Barack Obama's point man in Russia from 2012 to 2014 and who Trump considered selling out to Putin during the Helsinki summit last year. When I spoke to him in January, I asked McFaul about what ideology if any is held by the current Russian despot. After all, the disintegration of the Soviet Union eliminated Russia as a force for spreading Communism throughout the world. If Russia has an ideology today, what is it?

""It looks like a president is facing one of the biggest political scandals in American history because he really did have these illicit contacts with Russia, and it was a conservative Republican pushing the party and the country to the right. What does that say? How do you think someone looking at this from a distance will view that, aside from being ironic?"" I asked McFaul.

""I hadn't thought of it in those terms,"" McFaul replied. ""Thanks for reminding me. That is an ironic twist, most certainly. I don't have a great answer... I think it's in part the nature of President Trump and the people around them that this is happening, and their kind of wheeling, dealing style. Obviously, some people around him, including Michael Cohen, were trying to use his notoriety and his campaign to advance their financial opportunities. That's something new to him, but there's another piece, which is that there is an ideological affinity between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin.""

He added: ""They're both kind of a self-styled conservative, self-styled nationalist, anti-multilateralist, kind of 'nation-state should come first.' I think that ideological affinity is also something that's radically new in the era that we live in, not unlike the intellectual affinities that you had from people on the left with communist organizations and communist countries during the Cold War.""

In other words: We need a culture where people stop throwing stones at each other, but if rocks are going to be pelted regardless, anyone aligned with Trump needs to think very carefully about whether their house is made of glass."
The Shame and Disgrace Will Linger,https://www.theatlantic.com,"['David Frum', 'Staff Writer At']",08-10-2019,2019,8,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/trumps-conspiracy-theory-about-clintons-and-epstein/595915/,"Everybody at this point ignores what the president says.

So even though Trump just retweeted the comedian Terrence K. Williams accusing the Clinton family of murder, the people who work for Trump may ignore that, too. They know that the president punching the retweet button like an addled retiree playing the slots through a fog of painkillers means nothing. The days of “taking Trump seriously, not literally” have long since passed. By this point, Trump is taken neither seriously nor literally. His words are as worthless as Trump Organization IOUs.

But cosmic joke or no cosmic joke, Donald Trump is the president of the United States. You may not like it. I don’t like it. Mike Pompeo doesn’t like it. Mitch McConnell doesn’t like it. Kevin McCarthy doesn’t like it. But it’s still a fact, and each succeeding outrage makes it no less a fact. Grinning and flashing a thumbs-up over an orphaned baby? Yes, still president. Tweeting that a third-tier dictator has threatened him with more missile tests unless he halts military exercises with a U.S. ally——and that he has surrendered to that blackmail? Shamefully, still president. Accusing a former U.S. president of murder? It’s incredible, it’s appalling, it’s humiliating … but, yes, he is the president all the same.

Trump’s circle probably expects the world to sputter for a while and then be distracted by some new despicable statement or act. That is how it has gone for nearly three years, and that is how it is likely still to go. Trump is steering the U.S. and the world into a trade war, and perhaps a financial crisis and recession along with it. He is wrecking the structure of U.S. alliances in Asia, and his rhetoric is inciting shooting rampages against minorities. Compared with that, mere slurs and insults perhaps weigh lighter in the crushing Dumpster-load of Trump’s output of unfitness for the office he holds.

But it shouldn’t be forgotten, either, in the onrush of events. The certainty that Trump will descend ever deeper into subbasements of “new lows” after this new low should not numb us to its newness and lowness.

Neither the practical impediments to impeachment and the Twenty-Fifth Amendment process, nor the foibles and failings of the candidates running to replace him, efface the fact that this presidency shames and disgraces the office every minute of every hour of every day. And even when it ends, however it ends, the shame will stain it still."
"With Congressional Blessing, Space Force Is Closer To Launch",https://www.npr.org,['Claudia Grisales'],08-11-2019,2019,8,https://www.npr.org/2019/08/11/743612373/with-congressional-blessing-space-force-is-closer-to-launch,"With Congressional Blessing, Space Force Is Closer To Launch

Enlarge this image toggle caption Walter Scriptunas II/Courtesy United Launch Alliance Walter Scriptunas II/Courtesy United Launch Alliance

It started as a joke.

Early last year, President Trump riffed on an idea he called ""Space Force"" before a crowd of Marines in San Diego.

It drew laughs, but the moment was a breakthrough for a plan that had languished for nearly 20 years.

""I said maybe we need a new force, we'll call it the Space Force,"" Trump said at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in March 2018. ""And I was not really serious. Then I said, 'What a great idea, maybe we'll have to do that.'""

But now, under a new name and with Congress' support, Space Force is closer to becoming a new military reality. It would be the first new military service in more than 70 years.

Concerns about Russia and China

In January 2001, a special commission chaired by former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said space needed to become a top national security priority. But the 9/11 terrorist attacks derailed those plans.

Since that time, military leaders, lawmakers and experts have warned that new resources were needed in space to get ahead of a potential, hostile nation setting out to destroy a U.S. satellite. Such a move could threaten our everyday lives, from our cell phones to the electric grid to the military's ability to launch nuclear weapons.

As a result, proponents argue that the U.S. has fallen behind and needs to upgrade an existing Air Force office focused on space to become an official service.

""One of the main concerns is being able to develop a military space cadre who understands the space domain and understands threats to U.S. military space systems and some of those threats are developing already,"" said Kaitlyn Johnson, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""Some of these are big and flashy anti-satellite weapons ... Some of them are like missiles that are on the ground that shoot up into the air, target a satellite and physically hit and detonate and kill that satellite.""

So far, Russia and China are among the countries that have demonstrated the ability to destroy satellites. And in March, India joined the group when it destroyed one of its own satellites.

Such tests also add to space debris, triggering concerns of fast-moving particles that could now cause damage to a functioning satellites or worse.

Much of the threats in space are classified, but those in the know such as Defense Secretary Mark Esper, are publicly worried.

""I think what we are trying to do is recognize that space is no longer a place in which we support combat operations or from which we look down upon the world and see what's happening,"" Esper said during his July confirmation hearing. ""It is now a warfighting domain. Not because we made it that way but because the Russians and Chinese are making it that way.""

Now, key lawmakers leading the charge have the support they need to make a new U.S. space service a reality. The House and the Senate have both proposed plans for Space Force in their versions of the annual defense bill.

And next month, a congressional conference committee could hammer out a final blueprint in its approval of the fiscal year 2020 National Defense Authorization Act.

""I'm excited that it looks like we'll be able to have, really, the birth of a new service for the first time in 70 years,"" said Democratic Tennessee Rep. Jim Cooper, a key architect of the plan. ""Each warfighting domain should have its own capabilities.""

Trump ""took our idea and he blew it up""

In 2017, Cooper, now the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee subpanel on strategic forces, and Alabama Rep. Mike Rogers, now the subcommittee's ranking Republican, spearheaded a bipartisan effort to create the so-called ""Space Corps."" It was approved in the House version of the annual defense bill.

However, the move was met with plenty of resistance from top Pentagon officials and the Senate, where the effort died.

Cooper said he was was initially irked that Trump had virtually hijacked their idea but under a new name of Space Force.

""I was floored. And then I was annoyed,"" Cooper said of his reaction to Trump's first Space Force speech. But ""imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.""

Cooper said Trump made the idea ""unworkable,"" by adding several elements to it that made it cost prohibitive. However, Congress has now put forth two versions of the plan that are not as costly as Trump's original pitch.

""He took our idea and he blew it up,"" Cooper said. ""So I'm thankful now and the defense authorization bill we've gotten back to the original plan.""

House and Senate lawmakers must now decide between their competing visions for the new space service. That'll happen during their conference committee meetings to hammer out a final version of the defense bill.

The House wants to install their so-called Space Corps in the coming year, while the Senate includes at least a one-year delay to stand up the new command under Trump's Space Force name.

In both versions, the new service would be modeled after the Marine Corps under the Navy, and remain under the Air Force. It would be the first new military service since the Air Force was created in 1947 under President Harry Truman.

""With this new legislation ... it's remarkably similar to Rogers and Cooper's original language to create a Space Corps,"" said Johnson, the CSIS fellow who has studied the proposals. ""So they've been able to build off this this legacy and their work on this and it's looking like it's about to come to fruition.""

Johnson is betting a new service will come together with the passage of the defense bill.

The Senate version also includes language for a stronger leadership model at the top, including a new four-star commander.

""I think we did the art of the possible,"" said Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., who played a key role in crafting a stronger leadership model for the service, including a new, four-star commander.

Although Cramer supports the Senate version, he would have done without a delay to create the service and supported a ""more aggressive approach.""

A fight for a new military headquarters

With plans for a new space military service underway, there's the potential for significant funding that would be focused on its efforts.

Already, the Trump administration has requested $14.1 billion to fund military space endeavors next year, including new GPS technology, space launch systems and personnel supports.

And in true congressional fashion, that's set off a race of lawmakers vying to win the new headquarters to their states.

""There's a lot of people who would like it,"" said Washington Democratic Rep. Adam Smith, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.

California, Colorado, Alabama and Florida are among those states in the running.

Even Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan says he could see some of Space Force's operations land in his state. Alaska is home to the country's missile defense system and the radar tasked with tracking a potential attack and intercepting it.

Rep. Ted Yoho, R-Fla., argues that Florida is the right place because it's the historic role in the space program and a vibrant private sector focused on space today.

Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., however, says his state has an edge. That's where major components of the existing Space Command under the Air Force exists today.

Still, House lawmakers say their focus is to ensure that the move will be largely a restructuring and not turn Space Corps into a ""pork barrel"" spending bill for some particular district.

Instead, it shouldn't come without a large, unnecessary bill, said Smith. As chairman, Smith is slated to serve on the conference panel to hammer out the final version of the defense bill.

""I think we need to better emphasize space as part of our national defense,"" he said. But ""I don't want to waste money, so we need to make sure there's not too much bureaucracy and it's done in an efficient and effective manner."""
State Dept. updates ‘anti-Semitism’ definition following Omar’s anti-Israel resolution,https://www.foxnews.com,['Dom Calicchio'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/state-dept-updates-definition-of-anti-semitism-following-omars-anti-israel-resolution,"The U.S. State Department recently revised its definition of anti-Semitism, in an apparent response to recent comments and actions by U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.

The previous definition of anti-Semitism, issued in May, listed 10 examples. The revised definition now lists 11 examples, adding that anti-Semitism now includes “Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis.”

The leader of a U.S.-based pro-Israel organization praised the move last week.

HOUSE OVERWHLEMINGLY OKS RESOLUTION OPPOSING ISRAEL BOYCOTT IN RARE BIPARTISAN VOTE

“Kudos to @SecPompeo and Special Envoy Elan Carr,” Adam Milstein, a philanthropist and co-founder of the Adam and Gila Milstein Foundation, wrote on Twitter. “It’s more clear now, the BDS Movement is disgustingly Antisemitic.”

BDS refers to the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, whose supporters call for the withdrawal of financial support for the Israeli government in protest of the treatment of Palestinian people.

The State Department revision follows last month's overwhelming bipartisan 398-17 vote by the U.S. House of representatives to oppose an international effort to boycott Israel.

Omar's intention

Omar, who cast one of the 17 dissenting votes, countered with a resolution of her own, supporting the right to boycott foreign governments “to advocate for human rights abroad,” and likening the action to boycotts of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.

Her resolution did not mention Israel or the Palestinians. But she made her intention clear when she spoke with reporters.

“We are introducing a resolution … to really speak about the American values that support and believe in our ability to exercise our First Amendment rights in regard to boycotting,” Omar told Al-Monitor. “And it is an opportunity for us to explain why it is we support a nonviolent movement, which is the BDS movement.”

But several House Democrats gave Omar’s resolution little chance of passage.

“I can’t imagine that any committee is going to mark up or take seriously any pro-BDS resolution,” U.S. Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., said last month.

“Am I worried about the overall BDS movement worldwide as an economic matter? No. As an effort to delegitimize Israel, of course. The comments here today are a tiny part of that delegitimizing effort.”

Petition to censure Omar, Tlaib

Meanwhile, the Washington-based American Center for Law and Justice recently launched an online petition, calling for Congress to censure Omar as well as her Democratic colleague, Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, over rhetoric that the ACLJ describes as anti-Semitic.

“Rep. Omar said that support for Israel is ‘all about the Benjamins’ – a bigoted accusation that Jews control all the money,” the petition states. “She’s attacked Jews and anyone who supports Israel as having a dual allegiance – another anti-Semitic trope.

“Rep. Tlaib said she has a ‘calming feeling’ about the Holocaust,” the petition continues. “Someone espousing these bigoted views should not have access to classified information or sit on congressional committees such as the Foreign Affairs Committee.”

It states later: “Take action with us. Fight back against anti-Semitism. Demand Reps. Omar and Tlaib be removed from the committees and censured.”

"Attorney general 'appalled' over Epstein's death, announces investigation",https://www.cnn.com,['Veronica Stracqualursi'],08-10-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/10/politics/bill-barr-jeffrey-epstein-justice-department-investigation/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Justice Department's inspector general is opening an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of multimillionaire financier and accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, Attorney General William Barr announced on Saturday.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons confirmed Epstein's death, saying he was found unresponsive in his cell on Saturday at New York's Metropolitan Correctional Center around 6:30 a.m. ET. The bureau's release called it ""an apparent suicide,"" and said the FBI is investigating. Two law enforcement sources told CNN that Epstein died by suicide.

Barr said he was ""appalled"" to learn of Epstein's death while in federal custody awaiting trial.

""I was appalled to learn that Jeffrey Epstein was found dead early this morning from an apparent suicide while in federal custody. Mr. Epstein's death raises serious questions that must be answered,"" Barr said in a statement. ""In addition to the FBI's investigation, I have consulted with the Inspector General who is opening an investigation into the circumstances of Mr. Epstein's death.""

Epstein had been jailed since early July, when he pleaded not guilty to charges by New York federal prosecutors after an indictment accused him of sex trafficking dozens of underage girls, some as young as 14 years old.

Trump administration says it won't approve Roundup cancer-warning labels,https://www.cbsnews.com,[],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/roundup-labels-trump-administration-says-it-wont-approve-glyphosate-warning-labels/,"The Trump administration has told companies not to warn customers about products that contain glyphosate, a decision targeted at a California regulation that requires labels to warn consumers that the Roundup ingredient is potentially cancer-causing.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says it will no longer approve labels warning glyphosate is known to cause cancer. The chemical, marketed as a weed killer by Monsanto under the brand Roundup, is currently the focus of lawsuits from thousands of consumers alleging it caused their cancers.

Such labels are ""irresponsible,"" EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a statement. He cited the EPA's conclusions that the chemical doesn't represent a cancer risk.

The decision from the EPA highlights the growing debate over the safety of glyphosate, with scientific research often reaching contradictory conclusions. The World Health Organization's cancer agency has said that the chemical is ""possibly carcinogenic to humans,"" yet on the other side of the debate are studies that refute reports of glyphosate's risks, such as a long-term study of agricultural workers that didn't find a link between Roundup and cancer.

What you need to know about glyphosate, the cancer-linked chemical found in Cheerios

Since Bayer bought Roundup maker Monsanto in June 2018, the company has lost lost three high-profile court cases that alleged the chemical caused cancer.

""It is critical that federal regulatory agencies like EPA relay to consumers accurate, scientific based information about risks that pesticides may pose to them,"" Wheeler said in the statement. ""EPA's notification to glyphosate registrants is an important step to ensuring the information shared with the public on a federal pesticide label is correct and not misleading.""

California's law

California requires warning labels on glyphosate products because the International Agency for Research on Cancer has said it is ""probably carcinogenic.""

Monsanto has sued to block California's warning label requirements. A federal judge blocked California from enforcing the labels while the lawsuit continues."
Trump Administration Moves to Decertify Outspoken Immigration Judges’ Union,https://www.nytimes.com,['Christina Goldbaum'],08-10-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/10/us/immigration-judges-union-justice-department.html,"The pressure to hear more cases more quickly amounts to “psychological warfare,” Judge Tabaddor said last year.

Addressing some of the union’s concerns, the Justice Department has tried to tackle the backlog, which now totals more than 830,000 cases, by hiring more immigration judges. Judges appointed by President Trump now make up 43 percent of the nation’s immigration judges, a larger share than under any of his five predecessors, according to a recent analysis by The Associated Press. A large number of his appointees are former military or Immigration and Customs Enforcement lawyers, the analysis found.

But that hiring has not been accompanied by other necessary support, Judge Khan said.

“I can’t work alone, I am reliant on support staff,” said Judge Khan. “Right now there are two judges to one support staff person,” which has delayed the progress of cases despite the additional judges, she said.

The judges’ union plans to officially respond to the Justice Department’s petition once it receives official notification from the Federal Labor Relations Authority.

If the attempt to decertify the union is successful, it could leave judges without recourse for their already overwhelming workload, judges said.

“The union won’t be able to help judges with overall working conditions at a time when most all judges would tell you working conditions are worse now than they have ever been,” said Paul Schmidt, a former immigration judge.

Judge Khan called the Justice Department’s petition part of “a systematic attack on unions” representing federal employees under the Trump administration. Last year, Mr. Trump signed a series of executive orders that rolled back the workplace role of unions for at least two million federal workers and made it easier to fire them.

Jeffrey Epstein's suicide makes no sense,https://thehill.com,[],08-10-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/opinion/criminal-justice/456965-jeffrey-epsteins-suicide-makes-no-sense,"Accused pedophile Jeffrey Epstein’s death this morning — reportedly a suicide, according to federal officials — is an inexplicable end to a bizarre, tragic case that only got more disturbing the more we learned about it.

The fact that one of the country’s highest-profile federal prisoners could even commit suicide defies all logic and belief.

His death raises doubts about officials’ actions. The FBI says it will investigate; Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrConway downplays Trump's Epstein retweet: 'I think the president just wants everything to be investigated' Epstein death sparks questions for federal government Jeffrey Epstein's suicide makes no sense MORE says he is “appalled” by what happened; members of Congress such as Rep.

Indeed we all need answers, before we lose all faith in our justice system.

But the most basic question, in my mind, is why Epstein was in solitary confinement in the first place — something so totally inappropriate for a prisoner already at risk of suicide.

Epstein, a billionaire financier with powerful friends in the worlds of business and politics, pleaded guilty in Florida in 2008 to sex crimes and served a few months in jail. He was reindicted this summer in New York on charges of sex trafficking underage girls and had been in federal custody ever since.

He tried to commit suicide less than two weeks ago and, we were told, was placed in solitary confinement and under a suicide watch.

So how in the world could he commit suicide?

There is a valid use for solitary confinement in a penal institution. If you’re a threat to the institution or a threat to its staff, an escape risk or a threat to national security, then solitary confinement should be considered.

But not in this case. Jeffrey Epstein — in spite of his previous pleas or the new, serious charges — was none of the above.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons, which had custody over Epstein, and federal prosecutors certainly knew his earlier suicide attempt was real. Yet, instead of putting him into an administrative segregation unit — into a real, true suicide watch — they put him into solitary confinement and, in so doing, enabled him to finish what he had tried before.

Was that their intent? Who knows, but it raises serious questions about his death and the investigation surrounding him.

There is nothing worse than taking a suicidal prisoner and sticking him into a solitary confinement cell. Common sense and any psychologist, any corrections professional, will tell you that — so why was it done in this instance?

In solitary confinement there is a 15-minute “watch” rule, but that is not the same as a “suicide watch.” A prisoner can asphyxiate himself in 90 seconds and, after eight minutes or so, he will be brain dead.

That’s exactly why around-the-clock supervision is necessary when a prisoner is classified as suicidal. And it requires constant supervision, in person or by technology — cameras.

So why was Epstein placed in “solitary” in the first place? After his first attempt, were his cell and his supervision changed? Was he watched constantly by cameras in his cell, or only checked sporadically? Was he allowed to have objects that he could use to attempt suicide again, after having done so once before? How could a prisoner hang himself — as Epstein did, according to early reports — and no guard would immediately see it or react? Why, given his previous attempt and all of the issues surrounding his case, wasn’t a supervisory officer watching him constantly and able to respond immediately?

None of this makes any sense, at least at this point.

The crime here — in my mind, with what is known at this point — is that Epstein was placed in solitary confinement at all. The government often uses every tool in its power to ensure you never have a fair day’s fight in court, including the use of psychological tools to force you to plead guilty or to force you to cooperate with the government.

Solitary confinement is one of those tools. It is a mechanism to demean, degrade and demoralize a prisoner. The mind-altering seclusion of “solitary” will force a prisoner into a deep depression from which, for some, there is no return.

Only time will tell if that’s what happened with Epstein or if something more sinister occurred.

But one thing already is crystal clear: There are flaws and failures in the U.S. criminal justice system that should disturb all of us. And in Jeffrey Epstein’s case, none of it makes any sense.

Chinese reports on U.S. diplomat in Hong Kong 'have gone from irresponsible to dangerous': State Department,https://www.reuters.com,"['David Brunnstrom', 'Min Read']",08-10-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-protests-usa/chinese-reports-on-u-s-diplomat-in-hong-kong-have-gone-from-irresponsible-to-dangerous-state-department-idUSKCN1UZ2HK,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Official Chinese media reports about a U.S. diplomat who met with student leaders of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement “have gone from irresponsible to dangerous” and must stop, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said on Friday.

“Chinese authorities know full well, our accredited consular personnel are just doing their jobs, just like diplomats from every other country,” Ortagus added in a tweet.

She did not elaborate on the nature of the reports, but said: “This must stop.”

On Thursday, Ortagus called China a “thuggish regime” for disclosing photographs and personal details of the diplomat, identified by a Hong Kong newspaper as Julie Eadeh of the U.S. consulate’s political section.

“I don’t think that leaking an American diplomat’s private information, pictures, names of their children — I don’t think that is a formal protest ... That is not how a responsible nation would behave,” she told a briefing.

The Hong Kong office of China’s Foreign Ministry on Thursday asked the United States to explain reports in Communist Party-controlled media that U.S. diplomats were in contact with student leaders of protests that have convulsed Hong Kong for nine weeks.

The denunciations from the State Department are unusually sharp and have come as tensions between Washington and Beijing surge over an expanding trade war and military rivalry in the western Pacific, among other disputes.

The Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao published a photograph it said showed Eadeh talking with student leaders in the lobby of a luxury hotel. It appeared under the headline “Foreign Forces Intervene”.

The State Department has not identified the diplomat and has not elaborated on what kinds of private information or children’s details were disclosed.

In subsequent tweets on Friday, Ortagus said “foreign diplomats in the United States, including Chinese ones, enjoy open access to all elements of American politics, civil society, academia, and business.”

“China has a long record of broken commitments; it’s their duty under the Vienna Conventions, to which China is a party, to treat our diplomats and consular officers with due respect and take all appropriate steps to prevent any attack on their person, freedom or dignity,” she said.

China has accused foreign powers, particularly the United States, of fomenting the demonstrations in Hong Kong.

Earlier on Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he was not ready to make a deal with China and even called a September round of trade talks into question, reviving concerns in financial markets that the bilateral dispute is unlikely to end anytime soon."
EPA drops protection for wild salmon Alaska Bristol Bay,https://www.cnn.com,"['Scott Bronstein', 'Curt Devine', 'Drew Griffin', 'Ashley Hackett']",08-09-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/09/us/epa-alaska-pebble-mine-salmon-invs/index.html,"(CNN) The Environmental Protection Agency told staff scientists that it was no longer opposing a controversial Alaska mining project that could devastate one of the world's most valuable wild salmon fisheries just one day after President Trump met with Alaska's governor, CNN has learned.

The EPA publicly announced the reversal July 30, but EPA staff sources tell CNN that they were informed of the decision a month earlier, during a hastily arranged video conference after Trump's meeting with Gov. Mike Dunleavy. The governor, a supporter of the project, emerged from that meeting saying the president assured him that he's ""doing everything he can to work with us on our mining concerns.""

The news came as a ""total shock"" to some top EPA scientists who were planning to oppose the project on environmental grounds, according to sources. Those sources asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution.

The copper-and-gold mine planned near Bristol Bay, Alaska, known as Pebble Mine, was blocked by the Obama administration's EPA after scientists found that the mine would cause ""complete loss of"" the bay's fish habitat.

EPA insiders tell CNN that the timing of the agency's internal announcement suggests Trump was personally involved in the decision.

Dunleavy met with Trump aboard Air Force One on June 26, as the President's plane was on the tarmac in Alaska. The President had stopped there on his way to the G20 summit in Japan.

A controversial mining project in Bristol Bay, Alaska, that was all but killed by the Obama administration is now moving forward under President Trump's EPA.

Four EPA sources with knowledge of the decision told CNN that senior agency officials in Washington summoned scientists and other staffers to an internal videoconference on June 27, the day after the Trump-Dunleavy meeting, to inform them of the agency's reversal. The details of that meeting are not on any official EPA calendar and have not previously been reported.

Those sources said the decision disregards the standard assessment process under the Clean Water Act, cutting scientists out of the process.

The EPA's new position on the project is the latest development in a decade-long battle that has pitted environmentalists, Alaskan Natives and the fishing industry against pro-mining interests in Alaska.

In 2014, the project was halted because an EPA study found that it would cause ""complete loss of fish habitat due to elimination, dewatering, and fragmentation of streams, wetlands, and other aquatic resources"" in some areas of Bristol Bay. The agency invoked a rarely used provision of the Clean Water Act that works like a veto, effectively banning mining on the site.

Some current and former EPA officials say the decision to remove the Clean Water Act restriction ignores scientific evidence. The decision follows a series of regulatory rollbacks and political appointments within the Trump administration's EPA that have been criticized by former EPA administrators as favoring industry interests over the environment.

Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy met with President Trump aboard Air Force One on June 26.

The June 26 meeting between Trump and Dunleavy marked the fourth time the two had met since December.

Dunleavy has publicly supported the mining project and wrote a letter to Trump in March protesting the EPA's prior handling of the matter. He had dinner with Tom Collier, the CEO of Pebble Limited Partnership, the project's developer, in February and spoke to him on the phone in May, according to copies of Dunleavy's calendar reviewed by CNN. A member of Dunleavy's administration used to work on the Pebble project in public relations.

In response to CNN's question about whether Dunleavy asked Trump to direct the EPA to lift the restriction during the June meeting, Dunleavy's press secretary said the two discussed mining and a public land order, but he declined to provide specifics of the conversation.

Dunleavy said in a statement, ""This project, like all projects, should be scrutinized and examined under a fair and rigorous permitting process prescribed by law. That was not the case under the EPA's unprecedented preemptive veto.""

Neither the White House nor the EPA responded to CNN's question on whether the White House directed the EPA to lift the restriction on the mine.

The same day Trump and Dunleavy met in June, the EPA publicly announced that it would begin reconsidering whether to withdraw the Clean Water Act restriction on the Pebble Mine. EPA scientists and staff believed that they would then have weeks or months to reassess previous findings and potentially permanently stop the project, according to the sources.

Instead, immediately after Trump met with Dunleavy, EPA officials received an invitation from EPA headquarters to attend the video conference the next day, June 27.

During that video conference, EPA General Counsel Matthew Leopold said that a decision had been made to lift the restriction on the Pebble Mine proposal and that no further consideration of the matter was needed, sources said.

""I was dumbfounded,"" an EPA insider said. ""We were basically told we weren't going to examine anything. We were told to get out of the way and just make it happen.""

Leopold took over EPA responsibility for the Pebble Mine proposal since EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler, who previously worked for a law firm that provided services to Pebble, recused himself.

When CNN first asked about the June 27 meeting, EPA spokesman Michael Abboud said that Leopold told him he did not attend any meeting involving Pebble on that day, and therefore any announcement at any such meeting would lack authority.

After CNN told the EPA on Friday that evidence showed that Leopold organized and attended the June 27 meeting, Abboud contradicted his prior statement and said Leopold participated in an internal meeting that day to discuss an EPA memo as well as comment letters related to the project. Abboud said an EPA regional office decided to withdraw from the restriction on July 30.

The Bristol Bay watershed is one of the world's most valuable wild salmon fisheries.

This is the second time the EPA under the Trump administration has sought to remove the Clean Water Act restriction and clear the way for the Pebble Mine project.

In 2017, as CNN previously reported , top EPA officials directed staff to withdraw that protection and allow the project to move forward. That decision was made within hours of a meeting between then-EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and Pebble CEO Collier. However, in January 2018, Pruitt flip-flopped and announced that the protections would stay in place as the EPA gathered more information. The EPA said at the time that the Pebble project could still apply for a permit, but ""their permit application must clear a high bar, because EPA believes the risk to Bristol Bay may be unacceptable.""

When the EPA publicly announced the decision to withdraw from the Obama-era restriction on July 30, the EPA's Chris Hladick, an administrator who presides over Alaska, said the preemptive veto that previously blocked the project ""does not account for the full record and does not grapple with differing conclusions"" about the mine's potential environmental impacts.

EPA spokesman Abboud said in a statement to CNN, ""The previous administration's preemptive veto of this project, without a permit even being submitted, was a departure from regular order and the Trump administration is seeking a return to the correct process.""

Abboud added that the decision to withdraw the restriction does not guarantee that the mine will receive a permit but said the EPA will now focus on the permit-review process.

Pebble Limited Partnership praised the decision in a news release last week that said the EPA's previous objections to the project were based on ""'hypothetical mining scenarios' prepared by EPA itself, and assessed in an 'alleged' scientific study."" The company also said that its most recent permit application has a ""substantially smaller development footprint and enhanced environmental safeguards"" and that the project would employ about 2,000 people in Alaska.

The company's CEO, Collier, also ""expressly thanked Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy for his leadership in encouraging EPA to withdraw"" its earlier decision.

Christine Todd Whitman, who served as an Environmental Protection Agency administrator during the George W. Bush administration, said the EPA's decision to lift the restriction on the mine before the agency's scientists fully reviewed the matter could violate the Clean Water Act.

""It's politics trumping policy and good science,"" said Whitman, who in 2017 joined two other former EPA administrators who served under Republican presidents in opposing the mine due to its estimated environmental impacts. ""If this goes forward now with all the holes and the insufficiencies ... there'll be a lawsuit, no question about that.""

Bristol Bay-area tribes have protested the mine and say it would not only harm the environment, it would ruin their way of life.

""If that mine gets put in, it would ... completely devastate our region,"" said Gayla Hoseth, second chief of the Curyung Tribal Council and a Bristol Bay Native Association director. ""It would not only kill our resources, but it would kill us culturally."""
Trump's DOJ hid shocking report on growing terror threat from white supremacists,https://www.salon.com,[],08-09-2019,2019,8,https://www.salon.com/2019/08/09/trumps-doj-hid-shocking-report-on-growing-terror-threat-from-white-supremacists/,"The Justice Department suppressed a report showing that suspected white supremacists were responsible for all race-based domestic terror incidents last year.

The report by New Jersey’s Office of Homeland Security Preparedness was distributed throughout DHS and to federal agencies like the FBI earlier this year before it was obtained by Yahoo News. The document includes data Congress has sought from the Trump administration but the Justice Department has been “unable or unwilling” to provide.

The report shows that 25 of 46 suspects in 32 domestic terrorism incidents were identified as white supremacists. The 25 suspected white supremacist suspects were responsible for all “race-based” incidents while others were deemed “anti-government extremists” and “single-issue extremists.”

“This map reflects 32 domestic terrorist attacks, disrupted plots, threats of violence, and weapons stockpiling by individuals with a radical political or social agenda who lack direction or influence from foreign terrorist organizations in 2018,” the report said.

The map and data in the document were circulated through the DOJ and law enforcement agencies in April, which is around the time that the Senate Judiciary Committee requested the DOJ provide data showing the number of white supremacists involved in domestic terrorism.

Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., told Yahoo News that the committee still has not received the data.

“I’m troubled by the lack of transparency, given that we haven’t received this critical information after several requests to the FBI and DOJ,” Booker said. “They cannot and should not remain silent in the face of such a dangerous threat.”

An aide to Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., who also sits on the committee, told the outlet that the DOJ and FBI both told the panel they were “unable or unwilling to provide precise data on white supremacist terrorism, and neither agency has responded to our repeated follow-up questions since the briefing.”

The request to the DOJ came after the Trump administration consolidated 11 categories it used to identify domestic terrorism to four. One of the categories was a catch-all “racially-motivated violent extremism.”

“This new category inappropriately combines incidents involving white supremacists and so-called ‘Black identity extremists,’ a fabricated term based on a faulty assessment of a small number of isolated incidents,” the committee’s Democrats said in a letter to Attorney General Bill Barr and FBI Director Christopher Wray. The letter said the senators were “deeply concerned that this reclassification downplays the significance of the white supremacist threat.”

The letter also noted that the senators were not provided with data they had requested at earlier hearings and briefings.

Durbin’s aide accused the Trump administration of trying to make it more difficult to track violence by white supremacists by obscuring it under the “race-based extremists” label.

“The Trump administration’s irresponsible decision to stop tracking white supremacist incidents as a separate category of domestic terrorism obfuscates the extent of this threat,” Durbin’s aide told Yahoo News. “This highlights the problem with not specifically tracking white supremacist attacks. If we do not understand the scope of this problem, we cannot effectively combat it.”

Obfuscation appears to be the game plan. Asked what he would do to combat white supremacy on Wednesday, Trump both-sided the issue like he did after Charlottesville. “I don’t like it,” he said,” whether it’s white supremacy, whether it’s any other kind of supremacy. Whether it’s antifa.”

It isn’t just rhetoric. The Trump administration has taken numerous steps to roll back efforts to combat white supremacist groups while pushing for increased legal action against Antifa by labeling them a terrorist group.

Under Trump, the Department of Homeland Security has redirected resources away from fighting far-right and white supremacist groups. The Los Angeles Times reported that DHS had slashed its office handling domestic terrorism from $21 million and 41 full-time or contracted employees to just $2.6 million and 10 full-time employees in 2017.

The Trump administration also declined to renew an Obama administration Countering Violent Extremism Grant Program and canceled the only grant specifically aimed at combating white supremacism. Since Trump took over, 85 percent of the DHS “Countering Violent Extremism” have instead targeted Muslims and other minority groups, according to an analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice.

“While white supremacy is not a new phenomenon in America, it’s incredibly troubling the way the movement has been emboldened,” Sen. Booker told Yahoo News, “and the administration’s efforts to obfuscate the data on these terrorist incidents simply defies logic.”"

Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff have been briefed by the State Department on the case of Matthew Gebert, a foreign affairs officer in the department's Bureau of Energy Resources, after he was identified by the Southern Poverty Law Center's Hatewatch initiative on Wednesday, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN on Friday. One of the sources said the committee was learning about the facts of the situation and why he had been placed on leave.

In an extensive report released Wednesday, Hatewatch alleged that Gebert ""oversaw the Washington, D.C.-area chapter of a white nationalist organization, hosted white nationalists at his home and published white nationalist propaganda online."" According to the report, Gebert used a pseudonym to express ""a desire to build a country for whites only.""

""That's all that we need. We need a country founded for white people with a nuclear deterrent. And you watch how the world trembles,"" Gebert, speaking as ""Coach Finstock,"" reportedly said on a white nationalist podcast in May 2018. Hatewatch claims it has matched Gebert to the pseudonyms he used online.

The report said that in August 2017, on that same podcast, ""Coach Finstock"" said he was prepared to lose his career for the cause of white nationalism.

EPA reauthorizes use of ‘cyanide bombs’ to kill wild animals,https://nypost.com,['August'],08-09-2019,2019,8,https://nypost.com/2019/08/09/epa-reauthorizes-use-of-cyanide-bombs-to-kill-wild-animals/,"The Trump administration has reauthorized the use of controversial traps dubbed “cyanide bombs” to kill coyotes, foxes and other animals across the US.

The Environmental Protection Agency announced this week that it would allow, on an interim basis, the use of M-44 devices, which trap wildlife with bait before spraying sodium cyanide into their mouths, according to CBS News.

The spring-loaded devices, which have killed more than wild animals since they were first introduced in the 1960s, have been blasted as inhumane.

“Cyanide traps can’t be used safely by anyone, anywhere,” said Collette Adkins, carnivore conservation director at the Center for Biological Diversity.

“While the EPA added some restrictions, these deadly devices have caused too much harm to remain in use. We need a permanent nationwide ban to protect people, pets and imperiled wildlife from this poison,” she said.

The EPA has updated its rules to include some restrictions on the use of the devices, including banning their placement within 100 feet of a public road or pathway, increased from 50 feet. Warning signs also must be placed within 15 feet of each device, decreased from 25 feet.

A final decision on the use of the M-44s is expected to come down after 2021.

In 2017, a child was temporarily blinded and three pet dogs killed in two incidents involving the use of M-44s in Idaho and Wyoming, the BBC reported.

Canyon Mansfield’s family successfully sued the US government for $150,000 last year. One of the devices had been placed near their property in Pocatello, Idaho, and his dog triggered the device, The Guardian reported.

The EPA allows use of the devices by Wildlife Services, the animal-killing program of the US Department of Agriculture — and also authorizes their use by state agencies in South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, New Mexico and Texas.

Last year, Wildlife Services got rid of over 1.5 million native animals — from beavers to black bears, wolves, ducks and owls, primarily for the benefit of private farmers and ranchers, according to The Guardian. About 6,500 of them were killed by M-44s.

At the end of last year, the EPA proposed the renewed use of sodium cyanide, allowing time for public comment until March, CBS News reported.

More than 99.9 percent of the comments urged the agency to ban M-44s, according to the Center for Biological Diversity and Western Environmental Law Center.

“The overwhelming majority of comments from the general public, including the more than 20,000 letters from the write-in campaign, did not support the continued registration of sodium cyanide predacide uses (M-44 devices),” the EPA wrote in its proposal."

Graham: New Bruce Ohr docs show FISA warrant against ex-Trump campaign aide a 'fraud',https://www.foxnews.com,['Charles Creitz'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/graham-new-bruce-ohr-docs-fisa-warrant,"New documents highlighting top Justice Department official Bruce Ohr's contact with ex-British spy Christopher Steele are the latest troubling development for the DOJ in 2016.

That's the claim from Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who said Thursday on ""Hannity"" that he believes there was deep corruption in the department during that year's U.S. presidential election.

""Here's what we're looking at: Systematic corruption at the highest level of the Department of Justice and the FBI against President Trump and in favor of Hillary Clinton,"" Graham said.

FBI KEPT USING STEELE DOSSIER FOR FISA APPLICATIONS DESPITE DOCUMENTING EX-SPY'S BIAS, DOCUMENTS SHOW

Host Sean Hannity then asked Graham whether officials ""lied purposefully"" on a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant application to surveil former Trump campaign aide Carter Page.

""The best you could say is that they were incompetent,"" Graham responded. ""The most likely outcome is that they wanted a result.""

""I think the insurance policy is what we're seeing here, getting into the Trump campaign,"" Graham continued. ""The FISA warrant against Carter Page was a fraud, I believe. The counter-intelligence investigation is something we have to look at very closely.""

On Thursday evening, newly released records obtained by Fox News showed the FBI formally documented the bias of Steele shortly after the November 2016 presidential election, yet continued to use his unverified dossier in multiple FISA court warrant application renewals.

The documents, first obtained by Judicial Watch, also reveal that top Justice Department official Bruce Ohr maintained contact with Steele for at least six months after Steele was fired by the FBI for unauthorized media contacts in November 2016.

The summaries of FBI interviews with Ohr, known as 302s, show that Ohr knew by September 2016 -- a month before the initial application to surveil the Trump campaign -- that Steele was ""desperate"" that Donald Trump not be elected president.

A source close to the matter told Fox News ""this had the effect of putting a senior DOJ official on notice that a witness/source had an extreme bias"" -- yet the FISA warrant application went through in October 2016 with multiple renewals.

In his interview with Hannity, Graham claimed if a Republican operative acted in a way similar to Steele, the news would receive wall-to-wall media coverage.

""You could not turn on your television,"" he said.

USDA eases relocation timeline as researchers flee agency,https://thehill.com,[],08-09-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/456921-usda-eases-relocation-timeline-as-researchers-flee-agency,"The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reversed course late Friday, agreeing to key union demands as nearly two-thirds of its research staff will leave the agency rather than move to new headquarters in the Kansas City area.

The announcement follows a tumultuous few weeks at the USDA where employees were given a month to decide if they would uproot from D.C. by Sept. 30 or lose their jobs that same day.

Employees at both the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) — two of the major research wings within USDA — unionized in the wake of the agency’s relocation plans and the USDA has been heavily criticized by lawmakers for the short timeline and chaos surrounding the decision.

The Friday contract will allow employees who agreed to relocate to telework through the end of the year, including the option to extend the time period.

Employees who make the move will also be given a bonus equal to one month’s pay “to help compensate for the loss of income incurred by employees moving from the higher wage D.C. area,” according to a press release from the American Federation of Government Employees, the union representing the USDA employees.

Two-thirds of the staff at the two agencies told USDA they would forfeit their job rather than move to Kansas City in a plan many say is politically motivated and poorly organized.

“Moving these researchers out of Washington puts them out of earshot from policymakers.

“It keeps science out of the policymaking process. And we’ve seen many times that this administration doesn’t like facts or research that isn’t convenient or [is] an impediment to their agenda, so I think moving them away helps accomplish that,” she added.

Those outside of political circles have also questioned the planned relocation and whether it’s entirely legal. A Tuesday report from USDA’s Office of Inspector General said the decision may have violated the law.

The USDA’s general counsel, Stephen Vaden, has argued that the department is not bound by laws requiring it to secure congressional approval to spend the money to relocate, claiming the law in question is unconstitutional.

The inspector general’s report counters that Vaden's claim is “not consistent with prior positions taken by the Department.”

State Department employee linked to white supremacy placed on leave,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-10-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/state-department-employee-linked-to-white-supremacy-placed-on-leave-report,"A State Department official is reportedly on administrative leave after being linked to a white nationalist group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

The SPLC published a report on Wednesday alleging Bureau of Energy Resources foreign affairs officer Matthew Gebert uses the alias ""Coach Finstock"" to advocate for white supremacy and white nationalism on social media and other places.

The State Department has placed Gebert on leave while it investigates the allegations made in the SPLC report, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN on Friday.

""[Whites] need a country of our own with nukes, and we will retake this thing lickety split,"" a man identified as Coach Finstock said on a white nationalist podcast in May 2018. ""That's all that we need. We need a country founded for white people with a nuclear deterrent. And you watch how the world trembles.""

Gebert held white nationalist parties at his Virginia home, according to the SPLC. The left-wing civil rights group deduced that Gebert operates under the pseudonym ""Coach Finstock"" through a review of the Coach Finstock handle’s history on social media.

The SPLC has made false accusations of bigotry and radicalism in the past. In 2018, the SPLC publicly apologized to Maajid Nawaz, a former Islamic radical the group included in its ""Field Guide to Anti-Muslim Extremists."" The SPLC also paid Nawaz a $3.375 million settlement."
EPA defies California rules over Monsanto Roundup,https://www.upi.com,[],08-10-2019,2019,8,https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/08/10/EPA-defies-California-rules-over-Monsanto-Roundup/4571565463730/,"The Environmental Protection Agency told companies Thursday they would not approve labels which abide by California requirements to warn customers that glyphosate in Monsanto Roundup has been linked to cancer. File Photo by Bill Greenblatt/UPI | License Photo

Aug. 10 (UPI) -- The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has defied California regulators by no longer approving labels claiming Monsanto Roundup is known to cause cancer.

The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment has listed glyphosate, a chemical compound-base for Monsanto Roundup herbicide weed killer, as causing cancer since July 2017. Furthermore, glyphosate was added to the state's Proposition 65 list, which requires businesses to warn customers about chemicals known to cause cancer.

The EPA defied that regulation Thursday by saying it will no longer approve product labels claiming glyphosate is known to cause cancer.

""It is irresponsible to require labels on products that are inaccurate when EPA knows the product does not post a cancer risk,"" the EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a statement.

""It is critical that federal regulatory agencies like EPA relay to consumers accurate, scientific based information about risks that pesticides may pose to them. EPA's notification to glyphosate registrants is an important step to ensuring the information shared with the public on a federal pesticide label is correct and not misleading.""

The EPA added that California's listing of glyphosate on the state's Proposition 65 list is based on the International Agency on the Research for Cancer classifying it as ""probably carcinogenic to humans."" However, EPA's independent evaluation found that glyphosate is ""not likely to be carcinogenic to humans,"" and the agency said that its data set was ""more extensive and relevant.""

The EPA action rejects the idea that the weed killer is likely to pose a cancer risk despite rulings against Bayer-owned Monsanto in California earlier this year resulting in tens of millions of dollars in awards to sick clients, and amid the the world's best-selling herbicide facing more than 13,000 suits nationwide.

Among the rulings so far, was a $2 billion award to a couple diagnosed with cancer after using Roundup for decades, which was later cut down to $86.7 million in a subsequent ruling. Another case involved an $80 million award to a California man whose cancer the jury found was likely linked to the herbicide.

California jurors also awarded $289 million to a man last year who testified that two years after he was soaked with the product in an accident as a groundskeeper for a school district near San Francisco, he was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma despite wearing protective clothing and face mask."
White House rebuffed attempts by DHS to make combating domestic terrorism a higher priority,https://www.cnn.com,"['Jake Tapper', 'Anchor', 'Chief Washington Correspondent']",08-07-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/07/politics/white-house-domestic-terrorism/index.html,"Washington (CNN) White House officials rebuffed efforts by their colleagues at the Department of Homeland Security for more than a year to make combating domestic terror threats, such as those from white supremacists, a greater priority as specifically spelled out in the National Counterterrorism Strategy, current and former senior administration officials as well as other sources close to the Trump administration tell CNN.

""Homeland Security officials battled the White House for more than a year to get them to focus more on domestic terrorism,"" one senior source close to the Trump administration tells CNN. ""The White House wanted to focus only on the jihadist threat which, while serious, ignored the reality that racial supremacist violence was rising fast here at home. They had major ideological blinders on.""

The National Counterterrorism Strategy , issued last fall, states that ""Radical Islamist terrorists remain the primary transnational terrorist threat to the United States and its vital national interests,"" which few experts dispute. What seems glaring to these officials is the minimizing of the threat of domestic terrorism, which they say was on their radar as a growing problem.

""Ultimately the White House just added one paragraph about domestic terrorism as a throw-away line,"" a senior source involved in the discussion told CNN. That paragraph mentions ""other forms of violent extremism, such as racially motivated extremism, animal rights extremism, environmental extremism, sovereign citizen extremism, and militia extremism."" It made no mention of white supremacists. (A separate paragraph in the report mentions investigating domestic terrorists with connections to overseas terrorists, but that does not seem to be a reference to white supremacists.)

The document mentions that domestic terrorism is on the rise, but the subject is only briefly addressed, all the more stark given that FBI Director Christopher Wray's July testimony that there have been almost as many domestic terror arrests in the first three quarters of the fiscal year -- about 100 -- as there have been arrests connected to international terror. Wray noted that the majority of the domestic terrorism cases were motivated by some version of white supremacist violence, adding that the FBI takes the threat ""extremely seriously.""

USDA tried to cast doubt on UW-linked study about climate effects on nutrients in rice,https://www.seattletimes.com,"['Hal Bernton', 'Seattle Times Staff Reporter']",08-11-2019,2019,8,https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/science/usda-made-behind-the-scenes-effort-to-discredit-uw-assisted-study-looking-at-climate-change-impacts-on-rice/,"U.S. Department of Agriculture officials made a behind-the-scenes effort last year to cast doubt on a study co-authored by two University of Washington researchers about how climate change would affect the nutrients in rice.

The UW scientists were part of an international team that included two federal agricultural scientists. They studied how increased levels of carbon dioxide forecast for the end of the century could diminish the nutritional value of rice, and joined together to co-author a peer-reviewed study accepted by a journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

In May 2018, weeks before the scheduled publication, findings in the rice study became a source of concern for program leaders of the USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS).

“The narrative isn’t supported by the data in the paper,” wrote Sharon Durham, a department public affairs specialist in a May 7, 2018, email to a Jeff Hodson, communications director for the UW School of Public Health.

Durham noted the USDA had decided not to send out a news release to publicize the study. “Please let me know how you will proceed with your own press release.”

A statement Durham released to Politico and later to The Seattle Times said the concerns had nothing to do with the study’s focus on climate change. They came from career scientists, Durham wrote, adding that no political appointees viewed the draft news release before the decision was made not to send it out.

“The nutrition program leaders at ARS disagreed with the implication in the paper that 600 million people are at risk of vitamin deficiency,” the statement said.

But a veteran researcher with a lead role in the study thinks the politics of climate change in the Trump administration’s USDA factored into what he views as an attempt to discredit the findings.

“It was a very bizarre set of circumstances. I had been at USDA, altogether for 26 years, and nothing like that had ever occurred to me,” Lewis Ziska said.

The Agricultural Research Service where Ziska worked — and recently resigned from — has a long history of high-quality science that stretches back through decades of Democratic and Republican administrations.

But under President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly questioned the science linking fossil-fuel pollution to rising global temperatures, Ziska said researchers who focus on sensitive topics such as climate change have become more cautious. Some worry their funding may get cut or they could get reassigned if their work comes to the attention of higher-level officials.

“There is basically a miasma of fear,” Ziska said.

Academic freedom

The USDA 2018 criticism of the rice study, first reported by Politico, did spur a response at the UW, which receives grants from the agency. The interim dean of the School of Public Health at that time was Joel Kaufman. He reviewed the study and reached out to the two UW researchers — Kristie Ebi and Adam Drewnowski.

In a May 15, 2018, email to Vice Provost Mary Lidstrom, Kaufman wrote that the methods and results seem straightforward, and the UW researchers involved in the study “stand behind the scientific content…I’m bringing you into the conversation on the possibility that you would be concerned about the potential risk of irritating the USDA or other potential funders. Do you want or need to be involved in considering this issue?”

“For academic freedom aspects, if the authors are supporting the press release, the university will not interfere,” Lidstrom wrote back.

One week later, the UW sent out its news release.

The multiyear study looked at what happens to a range of rice strains when grown under carbon-dioxide concentrations at end-of-the-century levels, which are forecast to be markedly higher due to the combustion of fossil fuels. The study involved eight researchers from the U.S., Japan, Australia and China. In test plots, some rice was grown with the higher levels of carbon dioxide, while control plots received no additional carbon dioxide.

The UW news release noted the study showed how rice grown at the century’s end is expected to have lower levels of four B vitamins as well as less protein, zinc and iron, and it noted that the impacts will have a disproportionate impact on poor countries where rice is a dietary mainstay.

The study had a much rockier path through the USDA bureaucracy.

Initially, Ziska said, the study appeared to be moving smoothly through an internal department review in the early months of 2018.

The paper also completed an independent peer review organized by editors of Science Advances that involved scrutiny from at least two independent experts, according to a statement from the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

But in early May, shortly before the scheduled publication, Ziska said, he unexpectedly received a fresh round of questions from within the department’s Agricultural Research Service and he then found that a USDA news release he had helped to prepare about the study had been spiked.

Durham, in a statement to The Seattle Times, said all research service papers follow the same review and clearance process. “This paper was no exception.”

Media interest

Despite the lack of USDA support for the study, promotional efforts by UW and the editors of Science Advances helped stir media interest, with The Washington Post, The New York Times and other outlets in the U.S. and internationally reporting on the findings.

The USDA did make Ziska available for interviews. But after the splash of publicity for the study faded, Ziska, disillusioned, decided the time had come to leave. Now at Columbia University, he will continue his research on the impacts of a warming world on agriculture.

Ebi, his UW colleague, said Ziska’s departure is a significant loss for the department at a time when it’s important to follow through on research to determine what can be done to counteract the impacts of the declining nutritional values of rice on the global poor who depend on this food.

“We need to understand the breadth and depth of these problems, and what the solutions are,” Ebi said. “It is critically important science, and USDA should be involved.”"
Justice Department moves to potentially decertify immigration judges’ union,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Matt Zapotosky', 'National Security Reporter Covering The Justice Department', ""Matt Zapotosky Covers The Justice Department For The Washington Post'S National Security Team.

The department filed a petition asking the U.S. Federal Labor Relations Authority to examine whether it should revoke the certification of the National Association of Immigration Judges because, a Justice Department spokesman said, its members are “management officials” under the law.

Judge Ashley Tabaddor, the association’s president, said she thinks the petition’s intent is to “disband and destroy the union,” which has publicly pushed for judges to have more independence and sparred with the Justice Department over a quota system it imposed.

“It’s designed to take full control of judges without having a balancing force or a balancing voice,” Tabaddor said.

Immigration judges, who decide deportation and other-immigration related cases, are somewhat unusual in that they are not part of the judicial branch; rather, they are Justice Department employees. Like other Justice Department employees, they are generally prohibited from talking publicly — except that their union can advocate for them.

Tabaddor, for example, was skeptical last year of the administration’s effort to pressure judges to process cases faster by implementing a quota system tied to their performance reviews, saying the directive “could call into question the integrity and impartiality of the court if a judge’s decision is influenced by factors outside the facts of the case.” The union has also advocated for judges to be independent of the attorney general.

Tabaddor disputed that immigration judges could be considered management and thus not eligible to unionize.

“We don’t even have the authority to order the procurement of pencils,” she said.

The Justice Department’s filing will spark the opening of a case, and attorneys with the Federal Labor Relations Authority will probably then conduct an investigation, a Justice Department spokesman said, and the timing of the process varies significantly from case to case."

There are times when retired Staff Sgt. Matt Lammers doesn't look like he needs anyone's help — like when he was competing, and winning, races at the Department of Defense Warrior Games in Tampa, Fla., this summer.

""We don't like to say the word 'can't' in our family,"" says Matt, who lost both his legs above the knee and his left arm to an explosion during his second deployment to Iraq in 2007.

Then he goes on to list all the things he just can't do without help from his wife, Alicia.

""She helps me shower. ... She helps me transfer in my wheelchair, drives me to my appointments,"" says Matt, while on a break between events at the games. ""I'd honestly say, not to be smart, but the question is, What she doesn't do?""

Matt won medals at the games in Tampa for sitting volleyball, swimming and indoor rowing. At the end of the games, the U.S. Army gave him the ""heart of the team"" award. But he and his wife almost didn't attend, because they were short on cash to make the trip after Alicia was cut from the Department of Veterans Affairs' caregiver program last December because Matt had not ""consistently engaged in treatment,"" according to a letter from the VA. Alicia had been Matt's official caregiver for most of eight years.

""It felt like a stab in the back, like what I do is not worth it in their opinion, like I'm not part of their team like I thought I was,"" she says.

Uneven standards and implementation

The VA program provides support and a stipend to caregivers for post-Sept. 11 veterans, usually a wife or parent. It got going in 2011 and was instantly popular among vets as recognition of the billions of dollars worth of labor performed by family members for disabled veterans through the decades. The program was prepared for only a small number of applications and was overwhelmed by the tens of thousands of veterans who applied.

Almost from the start, that meant problems with uneven standards and implementation around the United States. NPR has reported on hundreds of caregivers being arbitrarily cut from the program; so has the Government Accountability Office and the VA's inspector general. Twice in two years, the VA has frozen the process of discharging people from the caregiver program, most recently last Dec. 20.

""It is essential that we get this right,"" VA Secretary Robert Wilkie said at the time. ""This affects one of our most vulnerable veteran populations, and we need to make sure we have consistency on how we process and evaluate benefit applications across VA.""

Unfortunately for Matt and Alicia, that freeze came six days after a letter from the VA in Fayetteville, N.C., on Dec. 14.

""I got a letter saying that I was out of the program because the veteran hasn't shown any progress since 2011,"" said Alicia. ""I asked them, 'What do you mean by progress?' ""

That question is at the heart of a fundamental problem with the way the VA caregiver program was created. Originally it was intended as a temporary intervention.

""Well, amputations and paralysis are permanent conditions,"" says Sherman Gillums, a former Marine who is paraplegic. ""It's not about recovery. It's about sustaining your life. Even if they're cut off from the program, they're still needing that care.""

Gillums is with the group AMVETS, but he's also on the VA's caregiver advisory committee. He's concerned that the VA needs to change the ""recovery based"" model now, before a planned expansion to older vets that could double or even triple the number of caregivers enrolled. And he says the program should be permanent for catastrophically injured vets such as Matt.

""No significant improvement""

Not that Matt's case is without its complications. Besides his missing limbs, Matt has PTSD and brain injuries.

""Not just the physical but the mental disabilities too — that is very challenging. It's every day. It's a constant change,"" says Alicia.

She says that's why the VA's assessment that Matt hasn't improved hurt. He's doing better now than he has in years. He has struggled in the past with drug abuse and even ended up homeless. He has been abusive to his wife and others, sometimes physically.

""He has progress daily,"" says Alicia. ""But sometimes he has bad days or weeks. ... Life is like that.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Eve Edelheit for NPR Eve Edelheit for NPR

The Fayetteville VA told the couple in the Dec. 14 letter that ""there has been no significant improvement"" since Matt entered the program in 2011 and that he ""has not consistently engaged in treatment.""

In response to a query from NPR, the Fayetteville VA said that for Matt, the program ""was no longer in his best interest. He refused to follow his care plan, seriously endangering his health and that of those around him.""

The VA was alluding to his abusive behavior in the past. But Alicia says she has stuck with him through that.

""I'm not leaving. I'm still with him, and I'm still gonna do what I do,"" she says. ""I still have to help him. I still have to drive him. I still have to take him to appointments. I'm still gonna do this if you pay me or not.""

The VA also reached out to the couple and encouraged them to follow the VA's care plan and then reapply for the caregiver program in six months. They say they will, but Matt says he's still stung by the assessment that he hasn't made progress since 2011.

""All three of my limbs are still amputated, as they were June, 10 June 2007. Those have not grown back,"" says Matt. ""I wouldn't change anything for the world. I'm not complaining.

The State Department has put on leave an employee of its energy bureau after reports that he has been an active member of a white supremacist group for more than five years, two sources familiar with the situation said on Thursday.

Matthew Gebert, a foreign affairs officer for the department’s Bureau of Energy Resources, was linked to the Washington D.C.-area chapter of a white supremacist organization and published racist propaganda online, according to a report published Wednesday by the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate speech.

Story Continued Below

In a May 2018 episode of a white nationalist podcast, Gebert, speaking under a pseudonym, called for white people to establish “a country of our own with nukes, and we will retake this thing lickety split,” according to the SPLC report.

“We need a country founded for white people with a nuclear deterrent. And you watch how the world trembles,” the report quoted him saying.

Attempts to contact Gebert were unsuccessful. Twitter accounts that SPLC described in its report as belonging to Gebert and that have posted anti-Semitic and pro-Nazi messages were deleted as of Wednesday afternoon.

A State Department spokesperson did not reply to questions about Gebert‘s employment status.

“The Department of State cannot comment on personnel issues but is committed to providing an inclusive workplace,” a department spokesperson said.

Gebert started working at the bureau as a career employee in 2013, according to a posting in the George Washington alumni magazine the SPLC cited. He worked on energy issues involving Pakistan and India during his time there, former co-workers told POLITICO.

Former State Department officials expressed surprise that security screenings had not flagged Gebert’s involvement with the hate groups. Gebert would have undergone a routine screening before starting his position and another at his five-year work anniversary, said Amos Hochstein, who served as special envoy and coordinator for the State Department’s international energy affairs from 2014 to 2017 and was Gebert’s boss.

“It is inconceivable he got security clearance twice,” Hochstein told POLITICO. “If Gebert was Muslim or a person of color, it would have been caught. Neo-Nazis are not all shaved heads and tattoos, they are hiding in plain sight. I'm horrified Gebert worked for me at the State Department.“

A State Department spokesman did not respond to questions about the department’s security clearance practices.

"EPA plans to downgrade Denver, northern Colorado to 'serious' violator of clean air rules",https://www.thedenverchannel.com,[],08-09-2019,2019,8,https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/epa-plans-to-downgrade-denver-northern-colorado-to-serious-violator-of-clean-air-rules,"DENVER (AP) — Denver and northern Colorado's urban corridor failed to meet federal ozone pollution standards, and the state will have to come up with a new plan to clean up the air, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Thursday.

The move was expected after Democratic Gov. Jared Polis said in March the state would no longer ask for an exemption from the standards by claiming some of the pollution was drifting from China and elsewhere, rather than being created in Colorado.

The EPA said it plans to downgrade Denver and eight other counties in northern Colorado from ""moderate"" to ""serious."" The classifications refer to how far out of compliance the area is with agency standards.

In addition to Denver, the area includes Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Douglas, Jefferson, Larimer and Weld counties.

Colorado is already working on steps to reduce pollution, including writing new rules for the oil and gas industry and encouraging more electric cars, said Jill Hunsaker Ryan, director of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.

""Whether Colorado is classified as moderate or serious doesn't affect our commitment to doing what is necessary, as swiftly as possible, to make sure every Coloradan has clean air to breathe,"" Ryan said in a written statement.

Ground-level ozone, the main component of smog, can aggravate asthma and contribute to early deaths from respiratory disease. Ozone is created from pollution emitted by vehicles, industries, solvents and other sources.

Denver and the northern Front Range have struggled to meet EPA ozone standards since at least 2004.

States can lose some federal highway funding if they don't come up with a plan to correct ozone violations. The EPA says states are not penalized for violating the standards, but only for not developing an agency-approved plan to improve.

Thursday's announcement by the EPA opens a 30-day period for the public to comment on the agency's plan to downgrade the area's status. A public hearing is scheduled for Sept. 6.

""One of the first acts of our administration was to withdraw the waiver request for ozone non attainment to stop sugar-coating the bad state of our air quality. Seniors and kids have been affected the most by our smog this summer,"" Polis said in a statement. ""Moving to 'serious' status finally helps us stop sweeping our air quality crisis under the rug and gives us additional tools to move urgently to make our air cleaner."""
All Eyes on the Aug. 12 USDA Reports,https://www.agweb.com,[],,,,https://www.agweb.com/article/all-eyes-aug-12-usda-reports,"The countdown is on. On Monday, Aug. 12, USDA will release its monthly Crop Production and World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE). This year’s August reports will include more information than ever before, including the resurvey announced in June, satellite data and, for the first time ever, FSA acreage certification information.

This report has the potential to be a market mover and hold several surprises, market analysts say.

“There is no question that the upcoming reports are critical as they should technically set the baseline for production that should have been set six weeks ago, and as such, holds the potential to generate quite a bit of excitement either higher or lower next week,” says Dan Hueber, general manager of The Hueber Report.

Hueber has one big prediction for Monday: “We will experience 30 seconds to a minute of market insanity when the figures are released.”

“Of course, there is a lot of talk about this report,” says Joe Vaclavik, founder and president of Standard Grain. “A lot of people think the USDA will provide us with more clarity in regard to the production situation for corn and soybeans.”

Vaclavik says USDA should provide some certainty around the acreage situation, based on the extensive resurvey it did in July. But yields remain a huge question market.

“I think will continue to be debated through harvest,” he adds. “In any year, it is difficult to predict yields in August. This year, the crop is very late, and maturity is lagging, along with enormous variability.”

Heading into the report, analysts expect a decline in planted and harvested corn acres and a rise in soybean acres, reports Kevin McNew, chief economist at Farmer's Business Network. That’s based on the Reuters pre-survey poll of analysts.

For corn, the average estimate for planted acres is 88 million acres. That’s 3.1 million acres lower than the July WASDE. Harvested acres are pegged at 80 million acres, which is 3.4 million acres lower than the July estimates.

Corn yields are predicted to be 164.9 bu. per acre, which is down 1.1 bu. from July.

For soybeans, the average estimate for planted acres is 81 million acres, which is up 1 million acres from the July WASDE. Harvested acres are predicted to be 79.9 million acres, which is up around 0.6 million acres form July.

Soybean yields are predicted to be 47.6 bu. per acre, which is down 0.9 bu. from July.

“At FBN, we believe that the range of estimates for corn planted, harvested acres and the yield number was large,” McNew adds. “We believe that given the range of estimates for 2019/20 corn production the August WASDE can contain surprises. For soybeans the range of production related estimates was much narrower suggesting that a general directional consensus on the direction of the 2019/20 crop.”

"Kevin McAleenan prepared to resign in June, felt undermined by subordinates",https://www.cnn.com,"['Geneva Sands', 'Priscilla Alvarez', 'Pamela Brown', 'Jeremy Diamond']",08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/08/politics/mcaleenan-immigration-hardliners-white-house/index.html,"Washington (CNN) On Friday, June 21, acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan went to the White House prepared to resign.

Days earlier, President Donald Trump had issued a vague threat to deport ""millions"" of undocumented immigrants, providing few details of the effort and surprising officials within his own administration. McAleenan was concerned that the operation was half-baked and too far-reaching in scope. And he felt undermined by subordinate immigration hardliners who had a direct line to the President over the issue that Trump cares most about, two sources familiar with the matter said.

Then-acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Mark Morgan had begun hyping an upcoming operation targeting undocumented migrant families for deportation and was speaking directly with the President about it, according to a source familiar with the situation.

Arriving at the White House, McAleenan met with the acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and his deputy Emma Doyle, to make his case. The raids, he said, would anger Democrats and jeopardize the administration's request for emergency funding for the border; they should be conducted in phases rather than all at once; and he argued the department needed more time to build out the proper messaging, said a former senior administration official.

On June 22, Trump suspended the operation, citing objections from Democratic lawmakers. But it's not clear Democratic objections drove his decision and sources said Trump's decision to postpone the operation allayed McAleenan's concerns that his advice as the DHS chief was not being heeded. And, days later, Congress passed the $4.5 billion emergency border funding bill that McAleenan thought the ICE raids could undermine.

Immigration hardliners accused McAleenan, without direct evidence, of leaking details of the ICE operation, charges he has denied. The operation targeting 2,000 families ordered removed by an immigration judge eventually took place a month later, but fell short of its goal -- resulting in the arrest of 35 migrants

The episode put into view the tensions within the Department of Homeland Security and the rocky relationship between McAleenan and the White House. McAleenan, who has been increasingly surrounded by Trump loyalists and immigration hardliners, has at times been frustrated that some officials go around him, as he has grappled for control of the department, multiple administration officials tell CNN.

McAleenan took over in April after Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was pushed out of her role at the urging of White House senior adviser and immigration hardliner Stephen Miller. McAleenan, who was commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, had the backing of the President's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner.

But while Trump elevated McAleenan, he still sees the acting secretary -- a career official who served under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama -- as having an allegiance to the previous administration.

In a meeting with congressional Democrats about the government shutdown earlier this year, the President referred to McAleenan, then at CBP, as an ""Obama guy,"" Axios first reported in April.

McAleenan served under the former president, eventually rising through the ranks to the highest-ranking career position at Customs and Border Protection.

The President often still makes comments that McAleenan should go talk to Democrats since he knows how to deal with them, according to a source.

The relationship, however, runs hot and cold based on the numbers of migrants crossing the border and headlines the President doesn't like, sources tell CNN.

Deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley praised McAleenan in a statement after this story published.

""In just a short time at the helm of DHS, Acting Secretary McAleenan has already substantially reduced illegal border-crossings, greatly expanded regional burden sharing, advanced vitally-important regulations, and significantly boosted the rapid removal and return of illegal aliens -- despite relentless obstruction from activist far-left judges and belligerently open-borders Democrat Lawmakers,"" Gidley said in a statement.

Four months into the role, McAleenan has had to navigate a migration crisis at the southern border and a White House that has shunned the traditional policy processes, all while leading the third largest federal department in the wake of a purge that left DHS and many of its component agencies without permanent leadership.

""It's arguably the most politically-charged job in government right now,"" said a senior DHS official about the acting secretary role.

In recent months, the three main immigration components in DHS have had a change in leadership -- Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and US Citizenship and Immigration Services. The President's decision to swap out leadership appeared to be motivated by his desire to go in a ""tougher direction,"" as he once said, amid a swell of migrants arriving at the US-Mexico border.

Trump's personnel choices have, on occasion, have had ideological conflicts with McAleenan. In addition to Morgan, Ken Cuccinelli, an immigration hardliner and former Virginia state attorney general, took over as acting head of US Citizenship and Immigration Services in June.

The White House, led by Mulvaney, previously looked into replacing McAleenan with Cuccinelli, who's been a public face on television on the President's policies, as acting secretary. A senior administration official said that option is no longer being considered.

A White House official told CNN that the ""President expects the acting secretary to continue his work"" on ""many additional policy changes,"" regulations, and foreign cooperative agreements.

However, McAleenan isn't expected to be offered the permanent secretary position, according to sources.

""There's still some apprehension. Everyone is waiting for the other shoe to drop,"" said a DHS official about concerns over more leadership changes to come.

Trump told Fox News in June that McAleenan was ""doing a nice job,"" when asked about whether he will nominate him for the permanent secretary role.

""McAleenan, he is doing a very nice job. We're going to see. I've got to get used to him because it's a very important thing to me, the border. We need strong people at the border. And if people aren't strong, they're not going to do a good job.""

Despite the uncertainty that an acting role brings, multiple current and former DHS officials have praised McAleenan's depth of knowledge, operational experience and leadership.

""I think it's really hard being acting,"" said a former official. ""He is taking, if you will, taking the bull by the horns and spent his time doing the job.""

Trump focuses on numbers

US-Mexico border apprehension numbers are particularly important to Trump, who reviews the numbers at the beginning of each month and views them as a barometer of the situation along the southern border, according to administration officials.

Under his tenure as acting secretary, border apprehensions continued to soar to their highest level in a decade -- more than 130,000 -- before falling 20% in June and 24% in July , a drop that McAleenan attributes in part to a recent agreement with Mexico on immigration enforcement.

The numbers continue to go down for now, according to a source familiar with the trajectory, though they still exceed levels a year ago.

The White House has taken a retaliatory approach to immigration, rolling out policies that seek to discourage those who journey to the US-Mexico border. In March, the US announced it was cutting off aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, which the President accused of having ""set up"" migrant caravans for entry into the US.

McAleenan, who has been a proponent of regional investment in Central America, was not supportive of the move to freeze aid to the Northern Triangle, according to a former administration official.

During a visit to Guatemala at the end of May, McAleenan told CNN Trump was looking for investments that have a return on US interests, including the ability to address the causes of migration. The ""key measure"" of success is whether aid leads to a halt of migration to the US, he said.

""I think there's some very valid aid efforts that are ongoing but we got to assess them all carefully and make sure we're making the right investments,"" he said.

The architect at the core of the administration's immigration policies is White House senior adviser Miller, who had a hand in the purge within DHS earlier this year.

""I don't think anybody that works in the [immigration enforcement] space is eager to participate with him,"" said a former administration official, referring to Miller.

But McAleenan ""understands what Stephen's role is,"" the official added. Still, the two have clashed over Miller's attempts to make personnel changes within DHS, like placing Morgan into the role of acting CBP chief, according to a source familiar with the disagreement.

But McAleenan has forged a relationship with Kushner, the President's son-in-law, according to current and former administration officials, who released a proposal to reform the country's immigration system earlier this year.

During White House meetings, ""you could tell"" they had a ""close working relationship,"" said a former official.

A department roiled by turnover

Since assuming the acting secretary role, McAleenan has focused almost all of his public attention on immigration issues, while running a department that is also responsible for terrorism prevention, election security and natural disaster response. The acting secretary recently canceled a trip to London to travel to Guatemala to work on a new asylum deal that would return most migrants to Guatemala if they did not try to seek asylum there before journeying to the US.

At the end of July, Trump, standing behind McAleenan announced the asylum deal in the Oval Office.

The tension within the department's leadership ranks has become evident over time amid conflicting immigration views.

""The clash of those two views has caused a dysfunctional relationship within the leadership"" at the department, said the source, referring to diverging views on immigration enforcement. ""How do you repair the working relationships between the White House, and the [DHS] components? That seems ambitious, 'they are pretty frayed.'""

Morgan, who clashed with McAleenan over the raids, has since moved to Customs and Border Protection as acting commissioner, replacing John Sanders.

Sanders left the administration in part over concerns about the administration's rhetoric on ICE deportations, after the White House chose Morgan to serve at the acting commissioner, according to a source familiar with the personnel change.

McAleenan fought to keep Sanders at CBP, according to the source. With his departure McAleenan lost an ally at DHS.

""We've been surprised by the twists and turns in personnel,"" said a senior DHS official, who added that leadership appears to be in a ""decent place now."""
DOJ Official Behind Failed Census Citizenship Question To Leave Department,https://www.npr.org,['Hansi Lo Wang'],08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.npr.org/2019/08/08/749573662/doj-official-behind-failed-census-citizenship-question-to-leave-department,"DOJ Official Behind Failed Census Citizenship Question To Leave Department

Enlarge this image toggle caption Steve Helber/AP Steve Helber/AP

Updated at 9:48 p.m. ET

John Gore, the main Justice Department official behind the Trump administration's failed push to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, is set to leave the department Friday.

A person familiar with the matter tells NPR Gore plans to spend time with his family while he is ""discerning next steps.""

Gore, who has been serving as the principal deputy assistant attorney general for the DOJ's Civil Rights Division, is among the administration officials currently facing allegations of providing false testimony and concealing evidence as part of the lawsuits over the citizenship question. In a recent court filing, Gore denied the claims made by advocacy groups represented by the ACLU, New York Civil Liberties Union and the Arnold & Porter.

Gore did not immediately respond to an email and a phone call requesting comment.

A partner at the law firm Jones Day before he joined the administration in 2017, Gore previously led the Civil Rights Division as its acting head. He ghostwrote the Justice Department letter to the Census Bureau that formally requested a citizenship question, which three federal courts have permanently blocked from 2020 census forms.

That letter, which was sent to the bureau in December 2017, claimed the administration wanted to add the question to the census in order to better protect the voting rights of racial minorities — a justification that a majority of the Supreme Court found to appear ""contrived"" and three lower courts have dismissed as a sham.

Pressed by plaintiffs' attorney Dale Ho of the ACLU during a deposition this past October, Gore testified that including the question is ""not necessary"" for enforcing the Voting Rights Act.

Earlier last year, Gore was criticized by both Democratic and Republican lawmakers for failing to appear at a House Oversight committee hearing after he was invited to testify about the DOJ's request for a citizenship question. When he finally showed up at a follow-up hearing, he refused to answer lawmakers' questions beyond information that was publicly available.

Gore did later provide a written response to a question from Rep. Jimmy Gomez, a Democratic committee member from California, about the confidentiality of census responses. Current federal law prohibits the Census Bureau from sharing information identifying individuals until 72 years after the information is collected, and the data cannot be used against individuals.

An internal email released as part of the citizenship question lawsuits later showed that Gore and his staff crafted an intentionally vague response after discussing that the sharing of individuals' census information with law enforcement and national security officers may ""come up later for renewed debate."""
"10-year yield drops under 1.6%, 30-year yield nears record low as collapse in rates accelerates",https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],08-07-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/07/us-treasury-bonds-china-sets-the-yuan-below-expectations.html,"Investors again rushed for the safety of government bonds and dumped stocks on Wednesday, exacerbating the August exodus away from risk assets as traders around the world settled in for a U.S.-China trade war without an end in sight. The flight to safety sent the yield on the 10-year Treasury note — used as a benchmark for mortgage rates and auto loans — falling to a low of 1.595%, the lowest since autumn 2016. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond bottomed around 2.12%, near its all-time low reached in 2016. Yields pared some of their declines later in the session, but held steady near multiyear lows. The 10-year Treasury rate is about 40 basis points below its level one month ago, down more than 35 basis points in August alone and representing a sizable move for the relative stable U.S. bond market. The yield ended July above 2%.

Bond yields move inversely to their prices; yields fall when investors demand Treasurys. The head-turning moves in the bond market weren't isolated to the United States, however, as rates in Germany and the United Kingdom clinched all-time lows across the board on Wednesday. The yield on the German 10-year bund hit a new all-time low of -0.6% while the 30-year bund also hit a record at -0.137%. The 2-year German yield touched -0.849%. The U.K. 10-year and 30-year yields both hit record lows at 0.432% and 1.081%, respectively. The U.S. Treasury yield curve also exacerbated its recent flattening and inversion, with the spread between the yield on the 3-month Treasury bill and that of the 10-year Treasury note close to -40 basis points. The spread between the 2-year Treasury yield and the 10-year yield, a longtime recession gauge, hit a low of 7.4 basis points, its lowest level since June 6, 2007. ""The flattening in 2s/10s should be expected in a world of rising global macro risk, coupled with falling forward inflation expectations,"" Jon Hill, rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets, said in an email to CNBC. ""There is an element of fear here that the Fed won't cut as much as necessary to keep the cycle going and maintain inflation near 2%. This keeps front-end rates elevated while long-tenor yields fall."" ""However, we think eventually this gives way to a more aggressive Fed cutting campaign – even a 'mid-cycle' move could easily be in the 100 bp to 125 bp magnitude,"" Hill added. The Wednesday plunge in the 10-year rate added to a marked fall for the month as fixed-income traders resigned themselves to a U.S.-China trade fight without a clear resolution in sight. Official negotiations between Washington and Beijing broke down in recent weeks after President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. would slap new tariffs on Chinese goods starting Sept. 1. China, in turn, threatened retaliatory action and allowed their currency to weaken against the dollar, triggering a wave of angst across Wall Street that the two nations could fall into a currency war in an effort to boost domestic exports. China's central bank set the official midpoint reference for the yuan at 6.9996 on Wednesday, slightly weaker than what markets anticipated. Its level against the dollar is important given that the lower the currency, the cheaper Chinese products will be when exported. This comes after the United States declared that China was a currency manipulator – a step that hadn't been taken since the Clinton administration and escalated tensions among the two countries. The plummet in rates on Wednesday also came after central banks in India, New Zealand and Thailand surprised investors in overnight trading with aggressive rate cuts, joining a growing global shift toward easier monetary policy. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand slashed its official cash rate by 0.5 percentage point to 1%, a steeper reduction than what economists had forecast. The Reserve Bank of India lowered its benchmark lending rate by 0.35 percentage point to 5.4%, the central bank's fourth rate reduction of 2019.

""Overnight many central banks cut rates, including New Zealand and this is dragging all yields lower,"" Jim Caron, managing director of global fixed income at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, told CNBC. ""The Fed is lagging this cycle, so it is no surprise"" to see the yield curve continue to invert. The Fed's decision in July to only cut by 25 basis points ""was a policy mistake and they should have gone 50bps,"" he added. ""The largest central bank in the world, the Fed, needs to lead not follow. It is important they get out ahead of the risks associated with a trade war."" On the data front, consumer credit figures are released at 3 p.m. ET. Traders will monitor a speech by Chicago Fed President Charles Evans at 9:30 a.m. ET. Also, the U.S. Treasury is set to auction $27 billion in 10-year notes.

Hundreds of USDA employees to be removed from their jobs in September,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Ben Guarino', 'Reporter Covering The Practice', 'Culture Of Science', 'Ben Guarino Is A Reporter For The Washington Post S Science Section. He Joined The Post In']",08-07-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2019/08/07/hundreds-usda-employees-be-removed-their-jobs-september/,"

The Agriculture Department is preparing to issue hundreds of termination letters to employees who have not agreed to move from the District of Columbia to Kansas City. The notices, arriving sooner than some workers and their supporters expected, will accelerate a controversial relocation process that has already stripped two USDA agencies of key research staff.

Last summer, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced he would relocate the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which manages a $1.7 billion portfolio of scientific grants, and the Economic Research Service, an influential federal statistical agency. The agencies rent office space in Southwest Washington near the waterfront.

In June 2019, Perdue declared the Kansas City region as the site of the new offices. USDA’s cost-benefit analysis suggests the move will save taxpayers $300 million over 15 years. The department has not said whether the employees will work in Kansas or Missouri; instead, it has set aside temporary office space for staff in its Beacon Complex in Missouri.

On June 13, USDA sent reassignment letters giving workers until 11:59 p.m. on July 15 to respond. Those who declined or who did not respond would lose their jobs, the letter warned.

The American Federation of Government Employees Local 3403, the union that represents the agencies, requested an extension for the deadline. Given the 900-mile distance from Washington to Kansas City and the uncertainty around which state to move to, the union considered 30 days insufficient time for employees to make a commitment.

In a phone call with Sen. Christopher Van Hollen (D-Md.) on July 14, Perdue told the senator the deadline would be extended until Sept. 30, according to the senator’s description of the call.

Two days later, Van Hollen and 18 other Democratic members of Congress wrote a letter to Perdue to confirm the Sept. 30 deadline. Also that day, USDA announced that 250 USDA employees, two-thirds of those reassigned, declined to relocate and would lose their jobs.

Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney recently praised the USDA attrition as a way to “drain the swamp.”

On July 17, Rep. Jennifer Wexton (D-Va.) wrote a letter to Perdue asking why he had not yet responded to the extension request. “We have heard from numerous federal workers who have requested personal extensions to this July 15 deadline, yet none has been approved,” Wexton wrote. “One such extension request would allow a current employee undergoing chemotherapy to continue their treatment with their trusted team of physicians.”

In a letter to Van Hollen in late July, the secretary said the July 15 deadline was final but that the department would evaluate employee extensions on a case-by-case basis.

Perdue never replied to Wexton’s letter, the congresswoman said in a statement to The Post on Wednesday. The department also “failed to respond to the employees who made requests for extension — yet they are able to issue termination letters to hundreds of dedicated public servants,” she added. On Tuesday, USDA notified the union that employees would soon begin receiving the termination letters.

A draft termination letter obtained by The Washington Post, whose authenticity was confirmed by two USDA employees and Wexton’s office, states that employees will be fired Sept. 27.

USDA did not respond to questions from The Post. The department provided a statement: “While USDA did not extend the notification deadline of July 15, we have continuously maintained that employees have until the report date to amend their decision which may include changing from a no to a yes. We are actively working with employees so they can make the decision in a timely manner to ensure they are able to take advantage of all available resources. The mandatory report date for relocating employees in Kansas City is Sept. 30, 2019.”

An investigation by the USDA’s Office of Inspector General, published Monday, determined that money already spent on the relocation violated the 2018 spending bill, because USDA did not acquire congressional approval.

USDA’s general counsel argued that the requirement for congressional approval was unconstitutional. In a letter to employees on Wednesday, Scott Hutchins, the USDA deputy undersecretary for research, education and economics, said the department attorney’s opinion is binding.

“No one should be concerned about being accused of, or punished, for violating the Antideficiency Act when they incur and submit requests for reimbursement for relocation costs,” Hutchins wrote. Some USDA employees, he said, have already arrived in Kansas City.

Wexton called for the relocation to be halted immediately. “Secretary Perdue is ignoring his own inspector general, he is ignoring Congress,” she said, “and he is ignoring many of the farmers he supposedly serves.”

MGM Files Lawsuit Against U.S. Department Of Interior Over Third Connecticut Casino,https://www.cardplayer.com,[],,,,https://www.cardplayer.com/poker-news/24171-mgm-files-lawsuit-against-u-s-department-of-interior-over-third-connecticut-casino,"MGM Resorts doesn’t want the two Connecticut Indian Tribes to build a third casino in the state and they are suing the federal government to keep it from happening.

The casino giant filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the U.S. Department of Interior for granting Connecticut’s two tribes approval to build a third casino in East Windsor, just outside of Hartford, and 13 miles south of MGM’s latest casino in Springfield, Mass.

Last March, the DOI approved plans for a joint venture between the Mashantucket Pequot tribe and the Mohegan tribe to build Tribal Winds Casino in East Windsor. Just a couple weeks ago, lawmakers in the state drafted legislation that would allow the two tribes to build a casino in Bridgeport, a city in which MGM had interest in building a casino of their own.

Regardless of which city they try to break ground in, MGM is going to use legal channels to stop it from happening.

According to the Middletown Press, MGM decided to file their lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Washington D.C. instead of making it a constitutional case in the state of Connecticut. The company is arguing that the DOI made an error in the way it approved changes to the pacts between Connecticut and its tribes.

Attorneys for MGM claim that the DOI ‘was only authorized to approve amendments related to casinos on tribal lands or on parcels that are considered in a “land-in-trust,” per the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. The land in East Windsor and in Bridgeport do not fit those requirements.

“The amendments thus confer a statewide, perpetual competitive advantage to the joint venture, MMCT,” The MGM lawsuit states. MMCT is the company name of the tribes’ joint venture.

The proposed legislation that would allow a Bridgeport casino would also allow the tribes to operate sports betting both online and in-person, a market that MGM would certainly like to have access to.

The DOI issued a statement saying that it will not comment on the lawsuit while it is ongoing.

Regardless of the outcome, the lawsuit will likely leave Connecticut as a two-casino state for the foreseeable future as this is likely going to take years to play out in the courtroom."

Senate Republican calls out Trump’s DOJ for not responding to his domestic terrorism questions,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/republican-senate-chairman-slams-trumps-doj-over-domestic-terrorism-non-response-b903f3de5f75/,"Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, is typically a loyal ally of President Donald Trump and his administration. But on Wednesday, he went on Fox News and scolded Trump’s Justice Department and FBI for failing to provide even basic information about a major domestic terrorism threat.

In early May, Johnson and the committee’s top Democrat — Sen. Gary Peters (D-MI) — authored bipartisan letters that were sent to Kevin McAleenan, the acting secretary of Homeland Security, Attorney General William Barr, and FBI Director Christopher Wray. These letters asked for information about domestic terrorism and how each is addressing it. DHS responded, but four months later, the Justice Department and the FBI — which operates within the DOJ — have not.

In a new letter on Monday, Johnson and Peters noted that there have been several domestic terrorism attacks since their first letter. “Since the date of our request, there have been numerous mass attacks, including Virginia Beach, VA; Gilroy, CA; El, Paso, TX; and Dayton, OH… These continued mass attacks make it clear that the federal government has more work to do in preventing domestic terrorism.”

On Tuesday, Johnson took the issue directly to the Trump administration — by raising it on Fox News.

“On May 8th, ranking member Sen. Peters and I sent a letter to the Department of Justice and the FBI, asking them how do they keep track of these domestic terrorist attacks? What kind of resources do they have and what are they devoting to different aspects of this? We got a response from DHS. We haven’t got a response from the FBI or attorney general,” he complained.

“Monday, we asked them to respond. I’m not sure you’ll ever have enough resources in terms of what people will be requesting. This is a serious issue, though. We expect answers out of the FBI director and the attorney general.”

In 2009, the Obama administration’s Department of Homeland Security produced a lengthy report on the risk of right-wing domestic terrorism. Congressional Republicans accused then-Secretary Janet Napolitano of insulting “American citizens who disagree with the direction Washington Democrats are taking our nation” and got the report removed from the DHS website.

In May, Trump was asked whether he saw white nationalism as a rising global threat. “I don’t really, ” he replied."

STEAMBOAT SPRINGS — The Yampa Valley Housing Authority is working toward a new affordable housing project on Steamboat Springs’ west side with the developer Gorman and Co.

The development is planned for a corner lot at the northwest side of the intersection of Lincoln Avenue and the newly built Sunlight Drive on Steamboat’s West End.

While the specifics of how many units will serve what income level hasn’t been determined, current plans for the project call for 84 rental units deed-restricted to Routt County households earning 80% to 120% of area median income with an average income of tenants in the project earning 100% of area median income.

Routt County’s area median income is currently $60,300 for a single-person household and $86,100 for a four-person household.

These income limits would be enforced by a perpetual deed restriction which could not be lifted should the property be foreclosed on.

Kimball Crangle, Gorman’s Colorado market president, said her company had been “talking peripherally” with the Housing Authority for a couple of years. The company responded to a recent request for qualifications from the Housing Authority.

“We started digging into Steamboat to see what you all probably live daily, that there is a housing crisis up here and that affordability for the local workforce is quickly evaporating, if not completely evaporated already,” she said.

Gorman operates in multiple states. In Colorado, the company has developed workforce housing projects in Vail and is in the process of completing a project in Keystone, according to Crangle and the company’s website.

The Housing Authority and Gorman aim to begin construction by May 1, 2020, and to complete the project by 2021.

“We committed to the voters that we were going to build a new project every year, and this is keeping that momentum going and building units for our local workforce and really providing more options for our local workforce, which is really important,” Housing Authority Executive Director Jason Peasley said.

Unlike the Housing Authority’s recent projects, this project would not be financed using the sale of tax credits. This means the Housing Authority will be investing more of its own money, generated by a property tax approved by voters in 2017, to subsidize each unit to undercut market rental prices. The Housing Authority will contribute $1.4 million in capital to the project.

“From a cost standpoint, it’s really no different, but on the sources side, because there are no tax credits, it means we have to target a higher income level,” Peasley said. “With higher incomes, we have more revenue, and we can, therefore, borrow more to help pay for the cost of it. Also, we as the Housing Authority will invest more money per unit.”

Terms of the project will be hashed out under a draft letter of intent that was approved in essence by the Housing Authority board Thursday. With direction from the Housing Authority board, attorneys between the two parties will be hashing out some final sticking points before it is granted final approval by Peasley and the Housing Authority board’s development committee.

Board member Catherine Carson was the sole nay vote against the approval. While she “loved the concept,” she was not comfortable with the mechanism in which the price of rent would be determined within the project.

The Housing Authority is also making progress on its other developments.

Peasley said Alpenglow Village closed Aug. 2 on the sale of its tax credits with Wells Fargo. The complex, located on Pine Grove Road, kicked off vertical construction last month and is expected to begin leasing in spring 2020.

The Housing Authority is also pursuing state tax credits to finance another project that would break ground in 2021.

Peasley said there are currently no waitlists or leasing information available for any of these housing units. Those interested should watch for information about leasing Alpenglow Village in the spring by visiting yvha.org.

“There’s essentially no way to get on a waiting list for that project (Alpenglow Village), and really any of those units, even the project we just agreed to work on,” he said.

George Soros's secret 2016 access to State exposes 'big money' hypocrisy of Democrats,https://thehill.com,[],08-07-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/456619-george-soross-secret-2016-access-to-state-exposes-big-money-hypocrisy-of-democrats,"Liberal mega-donor George Soros made some big bets during the last U.S. presidential election. One was that Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonJake Tapper calls out Trump for sharing 'deranged' and 'insane' conspiracy theory about Epstein death Booker: Trump using same tactics, language as Russians with Epstein conspiracy theory retweet O'Rourke: Trump 'changing the conversation' with retweet of Epstein conspiracy theory MORE would win the presidency. Another was that he could reshape Ukraine’s government to his liking, and that his business empire might find fertile ground in that former Soviet state.

So when Donald Trump’s improbable march to the White House picked up steam in the spring of 2016, Team Soros marched to the top of the State Department to protect some of those investments, according to newly released department memos providing a rare glimpse into the Democratic donor’s extraordinary access to the Obama administration.

Then-Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland received repeated calls, emails and meeting requests from Soros, according to the memos obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the conservative group Citizens United.

On May 25, 2016, for example, Chris Canavan of the Soros Fund Management firm provided Nuland a written briefing under the heading “Russia sovereign bond issue.” At the time, Russian President Vladimir Putin Vladimir Vladimirovich PutinNATO's China problem GOP group targets McConnell over election security bills in new ad George Soros's secret 2016 access to State exposes 'big money' hypocrisy of Democrats MORE’s regime posed a threat to Soros’s vision for Ukraine.

“Toria, here is my take on Russia’s foray into the bond markets this week, based on the market chatter I’ve been able to pick up,” Canavan wrote in an email, released with heavy redactions hiding most of his advice to Nuland.

Canavan worked on the for-profit side of the Soros empire, and his cozy nickname relationship with the top State official responsible for Russia and Ukraine policy speaks volumes about the access Soros was afforded.

Six days later, the nonprofit side of the Soros empire rang the same doorbell. Soros and his top foundation official in Ukraine scored a hastily arranged call with Nuland to discuss European migration policy.

“Many thanks for sorting today’s call on such short notice — much appreciated,” a Soros official wrote Nuland’s aide. “During the call, Mr. Soros promised A/S Nuland he would send her his draft article on migration policy for the New York Review of Books.”

Few people in the world could command the attention of one of America’s busiest, most influential diplomats for a pre-publication read of a column. Soros apparently was one of those few.

A little over a week later, Soros's team reached out again to Nuland, this time seeking to discuss “EU visa liberalization for Ukraine and Georgia” after meeting in Brussels with a top European Union official. According to the emails to State, Soros’s team wanted the U.S. to intervene to get the EU to ease visa rules to help Ukraine, as that country pursued reforms advocated by Soros.

Nuland wrote back, alerting Soros’s top policy adviser on Eurasia, Jeff Goldstein, to a key piece of intelligence: One EU country “has changed its mind” and she was “happy to discuss this further.”

“We are working it. Not sure whether intervention by GS would help,” Nuland answered in response to Soros’s pressure.

Soros is arguably one of the largest, most influential donors of his generation, giving away as much as $1 billion a year to nonprofit and political causes and leaving an indelible imprint on policy positions of liberals worldwide. His reach and influence range from two dozen prosecutors he helped to elect in the United States, to fellows he helped train at the State Department, to global media institutions that he supports to the tune of $26 million annually.

His many admirers in America — including such financial beneficiaries as Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton, as well as many of the 2020 presidential candidates — all advocate to eliminate the corrupting influence of big political money and the access that big donors win inside government. Often, those liberals suggest it’s a Republican problem.

But the 2016 State memos offer a powerful irony: In many ways, Soros is emblematic of the very financial influence and access that liberals seek to eliminate.

People close to Soros told me in interviews that he often had contact with government officials during the Obama years, including a 2010 meeting with Clinton at State. But they acknowledged the flurry with Nuland in spring 2016 was unusual both for its frequency and its intensity.

They said the exchanges were driven by Soros’s concerns about Ukraine’s future, not politics or business.

“George Soros is the founder of an organization that gives away a billion dollars a year to promote democracy and human rights around the world. It is for that reason that people at the State Department speak to him, not because he is a political donor,” top Soros aide Michael Vachon told me.

But a close examination of internal Soros organization documents show a close alignment of his political, business and philanthropic interests, especially in 2016.

Federal election records show Soros was one of the top 10 donors to Clinton’s 2016 election effort, giving a whopping $10.6 million to her campaign and the super PACs supporting it.

And when Soros sought to build U.S. pressure on Ukraine policy in 2016, he turned to Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, as a prelude to Nuland.

“Both the migration crisis and Ukraine are part of his view of Europe as falling apart, and the U.S. as ultimately not doing enough to prevent the political disintegration of its most important ally,” Vachon wrote Podesta in a March 2016 email that U.S. officials say was hacked by Russia and published by WikiLeaks. That email sought a meeting with the Clinton campaign chairman.

Politics and policy intertwined.

Likewise, Soros set out a bold vision in an internal 2014 memo for his Open Society Foundation to help root out corruption in Ukraine and build a “civil society” after the Maidan Revolution ousted the country’s Russia-friendly president. It worked with U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) officials to leverage the so-called Kleptocracy Initiative to fight corruption. The initiative enabled DOJ to prosecute or seek asset forfeitures from foreigners suspected of corruption, even if the crimes didn’t technically occur on U.S. soil.

Such initiatives are noble in principle. But in Ukraine, some targets had political and business implications as well.

For example, one DOJ investigation in 2014 targeted Ukrainian oligarch Dmitri Firtash. He and Soros both have significant energy interests in Europe — and rival plans to rebuild Ukraine. After Firtash’s indictment, Soros’s business announced plans to invest $1 billion in Ukraine.

Since then, significant problems have arisen with the DOJ’s case, thwarting efforts to extradite Firtash to the U.S. for trial.

Arguably, philanthropy and business collided.

On another front, a Ukrainian nonprofit funded in part by Soros was a cheerleader for the discovery of documents in Ukraine during the 2016 election that showed then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort Paul John ManafortDOJ releases notes from official Bruce Ohr's Russia probe interviews George Soros's secret 2016 access to State exposes 'big money' hypocrisy of Democrats Judge dismisses one of two charges against former Obama White House counsel MORE received millions in payments from Ukraine’s Russia-friendly political machine. The revelations led to Manafort’s resignation and eventual prosecution.

This time, philanthropy and politics found common ground for the Clinton-backing Soros.

And when Ukraine’s general prosecutor sought to investigate one of the country's nonprofits partially funded by Soros during 2016, the State Department pressured Ukrainian officials to drop the case.

Politics, philanthropy and governance were all intertwined.

Whatever political persuasion you hold, Soros’s election-year contacts at State speak volumes about the fact that big-money access to those in power is a bipartisan phenomenon.

"Withdrawal of US troops in Syria strengthened ISIS resurgence, DOD watchdog says",https://www.cnbc.com,['Tucker Higgins'],08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/08/withdrawal-of-us-troops-in-syria-strengthened-isis-dod-watchdog-says.html,"A convoy of US forces armoured vehicles drives near the village of Yalanli, on the western outskirts of the northern Syrian city of Manbij, on March 5, 2017.

Syrian forces backed by the United States are struggling to contain ISIS following President Donald Trump's partial withdrawal of U.S. troops from the country, a Defense Department watchdog warned in a report released this week.

The report, produced by the department's office of inspector general, found that between April and June the so-called Islamic State consolidated its power in Iraq and mounted a resurgence in Syria.

Trump announced in December that the U.S. would soon reduce its fighting force in Syria, surprising allies and prompting the departure of then-Defense Secretary James Mattis.

""We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency,"" he wrote in a post on Twitter announcing the decision.

""I defeated 100% [of the] caliphate,"" Trump said during an interview with C-SPAN last month. ""That doesn't mean ISIS doesn't go running around bombing a store and doing what they do, because they're stone cold crazy, but we've done a great job.""

But the report, which largely summarizes the views of the U.S.-led military task force overseeing operations against ISIS, says that the group remains a threat in Iraq and Syria despite the loss of its final stronghold in Syria earlier this year.

The report says that ISIS retains between 14,000 and 18,000 members in Iraq and Syria, including about 3,000 foreign fighters. It also retains an extensive, global social media operation to recruit fighters.

In both countries, ISIS fighters carried out targeted assassinations, ambushes, suicide bombings in public places, and set fire to fields of crops, the report said.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

The insurgency did not carry out conventional attacks or attempt to take back territory, the report said, instead it sought to wreak havoc and decrease support for government institutions.

In Syria, it also began to reestablish ""illicit fundraising capabilities"" which the report likened to ""taxes"" on residents and businesses where it operates, the inspector general found. In Iraq, it was able to establish logistics nodes for coordinating attacks, bolstered by fighters who arrived from Syria following their final territorial defeat in March.

The group is strongest in Syria in the Dayr az Zawr province, parts of Raqqah province, and Homs province near Palmyra, the report said.

The report says the U.S. drawdown, completed in the spring, left American-backed Syrian forces ill-prepared to develop trust with local communities and develop human-based intelligence ""necessary to confront ISIS resurgent cells and insurgent capabilities in Syria.""

""Despite losing its territorial 'caliphate,' the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) solidified its insurgent capabilities in Iraq and was resurging in Syria this quarter,"" the report says.

In one massive camp in Syria, Al Hol, the absence of U.S. troops has left Syrian partners without the ability to provide more than minimal security, leading to the ""uncontested conditions to spread of ISIS ideology.""

""ISIS is likely exploiting the lack of security to enlist new members and re-engage members who have left the battlefield,"" the report says.

The withdrawal also limited the U.S. capacity to track the humanitarian situation at the camp, which is home to 70,000 people, two-thirds of which the International Committee of the Red Cross estimates are children.

The United Nations estimates that 11,000 residents of the camp are relatives of ISIS fighters, and the U.S. military estimates that as many as 45,000 are ISIS supporters.

In the coming months, the U.N. estimates that upward of 30,000 Iraqi residents at al Hol, primarily women and children, will return to Iraq.

Neither the Department of Defense nor the Department of State responded to a request for comment.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday that he had not read the report, The Wall Street Journal reported, but noted that the administration ""is incredibly mindful of the success we've had versus ISIS, and the challenge that it continues to present to the world."""
EPA reauthorizes use of ‘cyanide bombs’ to kill wild animals,https://kfor.com,['Cnn Wire'],08-10-2019,2019,8,https://kfor.com/2019/08/10/epa-reauthorizes-use-of-cyanide-bombs-to-kill-wild-animals/,"× EPA reauthorizes use of ‘cyanide bombs’ to kill wild animals

(CNN) — The US Environmental Protection Agency has begun reauthorizing “cyanide bombs” used as chemical traps to kill predatory animals, despite backlash from environmental groups.

The EPA released its Interim Registration Review Decision from June, announcing that it is moving forward with the reauthorization of M-44s, chemical traps filled with sodium cyanide.

The EPA received over 20,000 letters about the move, it says, but the vast majority did not support the continued registration of the devices.

The devices are used to protect livestock and protected species from predators like coyotes, foxes, and feral dogs. But critics argue that they can harm people and non-predatory animals that may stumble upon them.

That’s what happened in 2017 when a cyanide trap laid by the US Department of Agriculture killed a 14-year-old’s dog in Idaho.

And although the traps are supposed to help protect at-risk species, another USDA cyanide trap killed a wolf in Oregon that had just been taken off the Endangered Species List two years earlier.

“Cyanide traps can’t be used safely by anyone, anywhere,” said Collette Adkins, carnivore conservation director at the nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity, in a statement.

The EPA included some restrictions in its review, such as requiring that all occupants within a half-mile radius be notified of the device’s placement and that they be kept at least 50 feet from public roads or pathways.

But critics say those restrictions aren’t enough.

“While it is encouraging that the EPA is taking at least some minimal action to protect the public from deadly M-44s, updating a few use restrictions — nearly impossible to enforce and commonly ignored — fails to meaningfully address the problem,” Kelly Nokes, a wildlife attorney, said in the Center for Biological Diversity’s statement. “EPA is blatantly ignoring its fundamental duty to protect the public, our pets, and native wildlife from the cruel, lethal impacts of cyanide bombs lurking on our public lands.”

Oregon outlawed M-44 devices and all others that disperse sodium cyanide this year."
Union: Deal with USDA eases impacts of Kansas City moves,https://www.wibw.com,"['Associated Press', 'Bryan Grabauskas']",,,,https://www.wibw.com/content/news/Union-Deal-with-USDA-eases-impacts-of-Kansas-City-moves-532757841.html,"An employees union says it has a deal with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to lessen the burden of moving to the Kansas City area for employees of two agencies.

The American Federation of Government Employees says the agreement allows employees of two USDA research agencies to continue working remotely from the Washington area until Dec. 30. The union says the deal will also give workers who move to Kansas City an incentive payment equal to one month's pay.

The USDA announced plans in June to move almost 550 employees of the Economic Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture by the end of September.

The USDA says the move will bring the agencies closer to farmers and agribusinesses. Critics contend the agencies will be decimated."
Maryland REAL ID Requirements Approved By Homeland Security,https://baltimore.cbslocal.com,[],08-08-2019,2019,8,https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2019/08/08/maryland-real-id-requirements-approved-by-homeland-security/,"



The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has given MDOT MVA the green light on its REAL ID requirements.

The Maryland Department of Transportation Motor Vehicle Administration officially has approval for its compliance with the federal REAL ID requirements, the agency recertified them on Wednesday- making Maryland the first state to achieve that designation.

The recertification affirms that Maryland has all documentation and security procedures in place that are required to make their REAL ID driver’s licenses and identification cards compliant with federal law.

Maryland became one of the first states in the nation to have it certified in 2011.

The REAL ID Act requires all states to recertify periodically. It was passed by Congress after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The law creates standards for secure driver’s licenses and identification cards nationwide.

RELATED COVERAGE:

By October 1, 2020, all Marylanders must have documents on file and be REAL ID-compliant to use a state-issued driver’s license or identification card to board an airplane or enter federal government facilities.

The documents required include a birth certificate or passport, proof of social security and two documents proving Maryland residence.

As of late June, more than half of Maryland drivers are compliant with the REAL ID requirements.

With millions still yet to obtain a REAL ID, the Maryland Department of Transportation Motor Vehicle Administration has extended branch hours and opened additional offices to handle the influx of customers."
