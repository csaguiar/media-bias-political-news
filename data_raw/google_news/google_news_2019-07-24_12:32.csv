Mark Esper Confirmed as Trump’s Defense Secretary,https://www.nytimes.com,['Helene Cooper'],07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/23/us/politics/mark-esper-secretary-defense.html,"Meanwhile, the national security adviser, John R. Bolton, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo — who was a former West Point classmate of Mr. Esper — have largely run national security policy in the months since Mr. Mattis departed. Mr. Esper’s challenge, national security experts said, will be to work to get the Pentagon’s views represented among those strong personalities.

“The protracted period without a permanent defense secretary has created a vacuum,” Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said in an email. “That situation has decreased D.O.D.’s influence on critical matters involving national security and military affairs and limited D.O.D.’s ability to affect important policymaking generally and on specific issues,” especially Iran, China and North Korea.

“The president needs the best advice, particularly on national security, from numerous perspectives, partly as a counterbalance to the apparently outsized recent influence being exercised by Pompeo, Bolton and perhaps others in the White House and Trump’s orbit,” Mr. Tobias said. He said that need “may help explain the unusually bipartisan, overwhelming confirmation vote that Esper secured.”

Indeed, Mr. Esper’s confirmation process was largely fast and smooth, reflecting lawmakers’ eagerness for stability at the Pentagon.

But during his confirmation hearing, some Democrats, including Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, raised questions about Mr. Esper’s ties to the defense industry. Ms. Warren, who is running for president in 2020, in particular was critical of Mr. Esper’s refusal to recuse himself from all matters involving Raytheon once he becomes defense secretary. She voted against his confirmation.

In fact, five of the eight senators — all Democrats — voting against Mr. Esper are presidential aspirants in 2020: Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Kamala Harris of California, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Ms. Warren.

The confirmation of Mr. Esper, who was sworn in later Tuesday, does not end the leadership void at the Pentagon, which still has no permanent deputy secretary of defense. David Norquist, Mr. Trump’s nominee for that job, is scheduled for his own Senate hearing on Wednesday."
Trump blasts decision to let aide accompany Mueller to testimony: 'VERY UNFAIR',https://www.foxnews.com,"['Bradford Betz', 'Bradford Betz Is An Editor For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-mueller-counsel-aide-accompany-testimony-very-unfair,"President Trump on Tuesday blasted the House Judiciary Committee's decision to let former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s top aide on the Russia investigation accompany him during his testimony before House lawmakers on Wednesday.

Mueller, who will testify publicly before the House Judiciary Committee for at least two hours and the House Intelligence Committee another two hours, requested that Aaron Zebley, his former chief of staff and top aide on the Russia probe, be at the witness table during testimony. Fox News is told the Intelligence Committee will swear in Zebley before its hearing.

Trump derided the decision as “unfair” and a “disgrace to our system.”

“Just got back only to hear of a last minute change allowing a Never Trumper attorney to help Robert Mueller with his testimony before Congress tomorrow,” Trump tweeted. “What a disgrace to our system. Never heard of this before. VERY UNFAIR, SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED. A rigged Witch Hunt!”

A source close to Mueller told Fox News, ""Aaron Zebley was the Deputy Special Counsel and had day-to-day oversight of the investigations conducted by the Office. He will accompany Special Counsel Mueller to the Wednesday hearings, as was discussed with the committees more than a week ago.""

COMEY SAYS HE TOLD FBI IT DIDN’T WANT TO ‘SMEAR INNOCENT PEOPLE’ DURING RUSSIA PROBE

Republicans have spoken out against the last-minute change, calling it an “apparent stunt” by Democrats. Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., the Judiciary panel’s top Republican, said the move “shows the lengths Democrats will go to protect a one-sided narrative from a thorough examination by committee Republicans.”

Mueller has also requested that the Justice Department send him a letter telling him to keep his testimony “within the boundaries” of the public version of the Mueller Report released in March, Attorney General William Barr told Fox News.

Back in May, Mueller signaled his disinterest in testifying.

“There has been a discussion about an appearance before Congress. Any testimony from this office would not go beyond our report,” Mueller said. “It contains our findings and analysis, and the reasons for the decisions we made. We chose those words carefully and the work speaks for itself.”

A federal jury on Tuesday convicted Bijan Rafiekian, a former business partner of Michael Flynn, on a pair of foreign-agent felony charges stemming from work the two men did for Turkish interests during the final months of the Trump presidential campaign in 2016.

The verdicts, returned by jurors in Alexandria, Va., after a weeklong trial and only about four hours of deliberation, amount to a belated courtroom victory for special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigated the $600,000 lobbying and public relations contract at the heart of the case and then handed the matter off to other federal prosecutors after Flynn’s guilty plea to a false-statement charge in 2017.

Story Continued Below

Rafiekian, 67, faces up to 15 years in prison on the two felony counts against him: acting as an unregistered foreign agent in the U.S., and conspiracy to violate that law as well as to submit false statements to the Justice Department in a foreign-agent filing. Defendants are typically sentenced in accord with federal sentencing guidelines that result in far less than the maximum.

Flynn, who would go on to serve 24 days as President Donald Trump’s national security adviser, had been expected to be a key witness at Rafiekian’s trial, offering testimony that would incriminate his former partner in a scheme to avoid disclosing that the Flynn Intel Group’s lobbying and public relations effort was actually directed and controlled by Turkish government officials.

Less than three weeks before the trial opened, however, an acrimonious row broke out between prosecutors and Flynn’s new defense attorneys, leading to an abrupt decision to drop Flynn as a witness.

The late shift — which appeared to upend the government’s case — came after prosecutors accused Flynn of retreating from admissions he made as part of his plea deal that he submitted false information to the Justice Department in a belated, March 2017 Foreign Agent Registration Act filing about the Turkey-related work.

Flynn’s lawyers claimed his assertion that he did not recall reading the submission before approving it was consistent with his prior statements, but prosecutors strenuously disagreed.

In Flynn’s absence, prosecutors relied on emails, Skype chats and other witnesses to make their case that the Flynn firm project Rafiekian spearheaded was approved at the highest levels of the Turkish government.

The short-lived research, public relations and lobbying effort focused on building public and government support for a key goal of the Turkish government: getting the U.S. to expel and extradite a dissident Turkish cleric, Fethullah Gulen. Gulen has lived in Pennsylvania for two decades and was blamed by Turkey’s current leadership for a coup attempt in July 2016.

Despite that focus, Flynn and Rafiekian claimed that the project was funded and directed by a private Dutch company owned by a Turkish businessman, Ekim Alptekin. Alptekin was indicted alongside Rafiekian last year but remains overseas.

While Flynn never took the witness stand, his role loomed large during much of the case, including in the defense’s closing arguments on Monday.

“Where is Michael Flynn?” Rafiekian’s defense lawyer Mark MacDougall asked, posting a photo of Flynn on TV screens in the courtroom and calling Flynn “a wholly owned subsidiary of the prosecution.”

While repeatedly casting aspersions on Flynn’s character — often by noting his firing from his White House post — MacDougall did not explicitly accuse Flynn of duping his client or of committing any crime. The defense attorney simply suggested that his absence from the government’s case was deeply suspicious.

The prosecution said the defense’s references to Flynn were an attempt to divert jurors from damaging evidence against Rafiekian, including Skype chats the FBI found on his computers in which Alptekin seemed to get the “green light” for the project from senior Turkish officials.

“Why are we talking about Flynn?” prosecutor Jim Gillis asked before skewering the defense’s argument as: “Don’t look at my guy. … Go look at Flynn. Keep your eye here while I pick your pocket.”

Among the witnesses called by prosecutors was Flynn’s former defense attorney Robert Kelner, who testified that Rafiekian did not tell him about some aspects of the involvement of Turkish officials.

Flynn’s new legal team, led by Sidney Powell, a Dallas attorney and strident Mueller critic, were present throughout the trial.

Following the guilty verdicts, Powell expressed doubts about the government’s case, while insisting that the outcome should not impact Flynn’s sentencing, which remains pending.

“General Flynn has cooperated with the government for two years. Obviously, they did not need his testimony to get a conviction,” Powell said. “The government could not articulate the elements of the offense, nor did it have any evidence to support its own definition of what was ‘material.’ This case is ripe for reversal by the district court or on appeal. It will not withstand scrutiny. In any event, General Flynn fulfilled his cooperation agreement.”

Asked for reaction to the verdicts, Trump‘s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani said: “My interpretation is that the case against Flynn is riddled with so much prosecutorial misconduct that it overtakes everything else.“

Rafiekian, who did not testify in his own defense, was allowed to remain free pending sentencing, which was set for Oct. 18.

Justice Department officials said they hoped the guilty verdicts would send a message about the importance of adhering to U.S. laws requiring those acting for foreign governments to register and report on their activities.

“Rafiekian was held accountable for his actions and found guilty by a jury of his peers,” U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia G. Zachary Terwilliger said. “I want to thank the investigators and prosecutors for their thorough investigation, extensive briefing, and commitment to this case.”

“Today’s verdict should stand as a deterrent to any malign foreign influence that undermines the integrity of our political processes,” Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers said. “Through misrepresentations in his FARA filing, Mr. Rafiekian attempted to deceive the public and influence key leaders on behalf of Turkey. The Department of Justice treats these crimes with the gravity that they deserve.”

The Iranian-American businessman, who was Flynn’s main partner in his short-lived consulting firm, also served as an adviser to the Trump transition team on national security issues. Rafiekian previously served on the board of the Export-Import Bank through Senate-confirmed appointments by President George W. Bush.

Whether the verdicts will stand is unclear. During the trial, U.S. District Court Judge Anthony Trenga indicated that he was giving serious consideration to a defense motion to acquit Rafiekian on the grounds that the prosecution’s evidence was too weak to sustain a conviction.

Trenga still has that motion under advisement and will face new urgings from Rafiekian’s defense attorneys to throw out the jury’s verdicts. After the jury returned its guilty verdicts Tuesday, the judge set a Sept. 5 hearing on that motion.

“Mr. Rafiekian is, of course, disappointed in the verdict,” MacDougall said in a statement, joined by fellow defense attorneys Stacey Mitchell and Bob Trout. “We look forward to being heard by the Court on that date and clearing Mr. Rafiekian of these charges.”

No date has been set for Flynn’s sentencing on the false-statement charge he pleaded guilty to in 2017. The Washington-based judge handling that case has repeatedly put off the sentencing to allow Flynn to complete his work with prosecutors in the Rafiekian case.

It’s unclear how prosecutors’ decision not to call Flynn will affect his ultimate sentence.

Other disclosures at the Rafiekian trial could also impact Flynn’s sentencing, including a startling but cryptic statement that prosecutors issued just before the trial, indicating that the U.S. government has various kinds of undisclosed, classified evidence that the Turkish government reached out to Flynn through Alptekin “because of Michael Flynn’s relationship with an ongoing presidential campaign.”

While Flynn wasn’t charged in the case against his former business partner, prosecutors tried to label him as a co-conspirator in order to win admission of statements he made to Kian during the Turkey-linked project.

It seems possible the judge sentencing Flynn will view the verdicts as confirming that Flynn was effectively on the payroll of the Turkish government while working on Trump’s presidential bid.

Mueller’s team initially recommended that Flynn not receive any prison time. It’s not certain whether they will change that stance, perhaps by arguing that what his lawyers say is his latest version of events related to the Turkey project amounts to a reversal that amounts to a lack of cooperation.

Powell, Flynn’s lawyer, said on Tuesday that the developments should have no impact on Flynn’s sentence."
"Justice Department to Open Broad, New Antitrust Review of Big Tech Companies",https://www.wsj.com,"['Brent Kendall', 'Brent.Kendall Wsj.Com']",,,,https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-to-open-broad-new-antitrust-review-of-big-tech-companies-11563914235,"WASHINGTON—The Justice Department is opening a broad antitrust review into whether dominant technology firms are unlawfully stifling competition, adding a new Washington threat for companies such as Facebook Inc., Google, Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc.

The review is geared toward examining the practices of online platforms that dominate internet search, social media and retail services, the department said, confirming the review shortly after The Wall Street Journal reported it.

The new antitrust inquiry under Attorney General William Barr could ratchet up the already considerable regulatory pressures facing the top U.S. tech firms. The review is designed to go above and beyond recent plans for scrutinizing the tech sector that were crafted by the department and the Federal Trade Commission.

The two agencies, which share antitrust enforcement authority, in recent months worked out which one of them would take the lead on exploring different issues involving the big four tech giants. Those turf agreements caused a stir in the tech industry and rattled investors. Now, the new Justice Department review could amplify the risk, because some of those companies could face antitrust claims from both the Justice Department and the FTC.

The FTC in February created its own task force to monitor competition in the tech sector; that team’s work is ongoing.

The Justice Department will examine issues including how the most dominant tech firms have grown in size and might—and expanded their reach into additional businesses.

The Justice Department also is interested in how Big Tech has leveraged the powers that come with having very large networks of users, the department said.

There is no defined end-goal yet for the Big Tech review other than to understand whether there are antitrust problems that need addressing, but a range of options are on the table, the officials said. The inquiry could eventually lead to more focused investigations of specific company conduct, they said.

The review also presents risks for the companies beyond whether antitrust issues are identified. The department won’t ignore other company practices that may raise concerns about compliance with other laws, officials said.

“Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands,” Justice Department antitrust chief Makan Delrahim said in a statement. “The department’s antitrust review will explore these important issues.”

Representatives for Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon and Apple didn’t respond to requests to comment.

In after-hours trading Tuesday, shares for those four companies were down. Apple was down by about 0.4%, Amazon by about 1.13%, Alphabet by about 0.96%, and Facebook by about 1.65%.

The Big Tech companies have said they are highly innovative firms that create jobs and provide products and services that consumers love. They have said they have rightly won their places atop the tech pyramid and have to compete fiercely to stay there.

The Justice Department already has been preparing to probe whether Alphabet Inc. ’s Google is engaging in unlawful monopolization practices. The Journal earlier reported the department’s plans for that investigation, whose existence hasn’t been confirmed by the agency.

The department’s antitrust division will conduct both reviews; it is unknown if and when the two efforts will intersect. On the broader tech review, the division will work in close coordination with Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, the officials said.

Share Your Thoughts What do you think the Justice Department’s new antitrust inquiry should focus on? Join the conversation below.

The department appears to be hitting the ground running. It recently hosted a private presentation where officials heard from critics of Facebook, including academics, who walked through their concerns about the social-media giant and advocated for its breakup, according to people familiar with that meeting. Tech and antitrust observers believed issues related to Facebook’s dominance were to be handled by the FTC.

Both the FTC and the Justice Department have made clear that they view tech-sector competition issues as a priority. Under agreements brokered in recent months between Mr. Delrahim and FTC Chairman Joseph Simons, the Justice Department obtained clearance to proceed with a probe of whether Google has engaged in illegal monopolization tactics, as well as jurisdiction over Apple for similar issues. The FTC, meanwhile, won for itself the right to explore monopolization questions involving Facebook and Amazon. (The commission already has undertaken a lengthy consumer-protection investigation of Facebook’s privacy practices, and the company has agreed to a $5 billion fine.)

Justice Department officials said those agreements weren’t meant to be open-ended or all-encompassing. But in any case the department isn’t trying to pre-empt the FTC’s work, they said, and suggested the two agencies might explore different tech practices by the same company, as well as different legal theories for possible cases.

The two agencies have been in regular contact at both the leadership and staff levels to coordinate their efforts, according to a person familiar with the discussions.

While the top tech firms were once the darlings of the public, attitudes have shifted as some consumers, and politicians on both the left and the right, have grown uncomfortable with how much power and influence they wield in the economy and society.

Some Democratic presidential candidates have called for the breakup of companies like Google and Facebook, while lawmakers of both parties have sounded alarm bells, though at times for different reasons. Some Republicans have voiced concerns about whether tech companies disfavor conservative voices, claims that industry leaders have denied.

President Trump has escalated his criticisms of Big Tech recently, openly suggesting the U.S. ought to sue Google and Facebook, comments that could hang over the Justice Department’s new efforts.

Aside from Justice Department and FTC scrutiny, a House antitrust subcommittee also is taking a broad look at potential anticompetitive conduct in the tech sector. Executives from Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon all testified before the panel last week.

Seeds for the new Justice Department review were planted in January at Mr. Barr’s confirmation hearing, when he said that he believed antitrust issues in the tech sector were important.

“I don’t think big is necessarily bad, but I think a lot of people wonder how such huge behemoths that now exist in Silicon Valley have taken shape under the nose of the antitrust enforcers,” Mr. Barr told senators. “You can win that place in the marketplace without violating the antitrust laws, but I want to find out more about that dynamic.”

Justice Department officials said they would use the new antitrust review to seek extensive input and information from industry participants, and eventually from the dominant tech firms themselves. It isn’t yet known whether much of the information-gathering will be done on a voluntary basis or if companies eventually could be compelled by the government to turn over materials.

Barr says Mueller asked DOJ to send letter limiting testimony to ‘boundaries' of report,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Jake Gibson', 'Jake Gibson Is A Producer Working At The Fox News Washington Bureau Who Covers Politics', 'Law Enforcement', 'Intelligence Issues.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/barr-mueller-asked-doj-to-send-him-letter-saying-testimony-must-remain-within-boundaries-of-report,"Attorney General Bill Barr told Fox News on Tuesday that it was former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team who asked the Justice Department to send Mueller a letter telling him to keep his upcoming testimony to House lawmakers ""within the boundaries"" of the public version of his Russia probe report.

The letter provoked criticism from Democrats ahead of Wednesday’s highly anticipated hearing, with House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler calling it “incredibly arrogant.” Asked by Fox News why the Monday letter was sent, Barr said Mueller’s staff asked the department for guidance ahead of the hearing.

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TELLS MUELLER HIS HOUSE TESTIMONY 'MUST REMAIN WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES' OF PUBLIC REPORT

“At his press conference, Bob had said that he intended to stick with the public report and not go beyond that,” Barr said in an interview. “And in conversations with the department, his staff was reiterating that that was their position and they asked us for guidance in writing to explain or to tell them [what] our position was. So we responded in writing. The department sent the guidance that they requested.""

Asked directly if it was Mueller who asked for the letter, Barr replied, “Yes.”

The letter, obtained by Fox News on Monday, was signed by Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer.

The letter said, “Should you testify, the Department understands that testimony regarding the work of the Special Counsel's Office will be governed by the terms you outlined on May 29 -- specifically, that the information you discuss during your testimony appears in, and does ‘not go beyond,’ the public version of your March 22, 2019 report to the Attorney General or your May 29 public statement.""

Speaking to Fox News, Barr also hit back at Nadler, who during a CNN interview Tuesday called the letter “incredibly arrogant” for trying to “instruct” Mueller what to say.

“He was misinformed as to the facts,” Barr said.

The attorney general also declined to comment on the Democratic-controlled House holding him and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in criminal contempt over questions having to do with the Trump administration’s proposed citizenship question to the 2020 census.

“Goes with the territory these days,” Barr said.

On Wednesday, Mueller is expected to testify in public before the House Judiciary Committee for two hours or more, followed by another two hours-plus of testimony before the House Intelligence Committee.

Mueller, meanwhile, also has asked that Aaron Zebley, his former chief of staff and his top aide on the Russia investigation, accompany him at the witness table during Wednesday's hearing.

Republicans are opposed to the request. Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the Judiciary panel's top Republican, called the move an ""apparent stunt"" by Democrats. He said it ""shows the lengths Democrats will go to protect a one-sided narrative from a thorough examination by committee Republicans.""

Mueller has only spoken in public once about his investigation – in May, when he signaled his disinterest in testifying, saying, “There has been a discussion about an appearance before Congress. Any testimony from this office would not go beyond our report. It contains our findings and analysis, and the reasons for the decisions we made. We chose those words carefully and the work speaks for itself.”

Still, Democrats – as some in the party push to impeach President Trump – subpoenaed Mueller to testify.

During his press conference in May, Mueller said there “was not sufficient evidence to charge a conspiracy” over whether members of the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russian government during the 2016 presidential election. But he declined to reach a conclusion over whether the president took steps to obstruct his investigation – something Democrats are expected to focus their questions on Wednesday.

Mark Esper sworn in as new secretary of defense,https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-confirms-esper-as-new-secretary-of-defense-in-90-8-vote,"Former Army Lt. Col. Mark Esper was sworn in as the new defense secretary during a brief White House ceremony Tuesday, making him the first permanent Pentagon boss since James Mattis resigned last December.

Esper, who served 10 years on active duty and 11 years in the National Guard and Army Reserve, was Acting Secretary before his nomination, and Patrick Shanahan had been Acting Secretary prior to that.

Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito administered the oath of office.

ESPER GRILLED OVER CONTRACTOR TIES IN HEATED CONFIRMATION HEARING

The Senate had confirmed Esper to the post earlier Tuesday by a vote of 90-8. The no votes included 2020 Democratic presidential candidates Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren.

Warren and Esper had a tense exchange during a confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, when she challenged his refusal to completely recuse himself from any and all matters related to Raytheon, the defense contractor for which he served as a lobbyist before joining the government. Esper said that ethics personnel told him not to fully recuse himself.

Brooklyn resident Arleigh Louison, 53, was arrested by Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) agents who executed a federal search warrant at his office, the press release said.

Louison’s arrest comes less than a week after a federal grand jury returned a 12-count indictment, charging him with presenting false adjustment of status petitions to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services Service Center in St. Albans, Vt.

The Office of the United States Attorney for the District of Vermont, which conducted the probe, said Louison made false statements in connection with Form I-360 petitions for status adjustments under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), a law that enables immigrants to become lawful permanent residents (LPRs) of the U.S. if they were abused by a relative who is a U.S. citizen or LPR.

Louison allegedly submitted false information in the VAWA petitions so petitioners could secure work authorization permits. Last week’s indictment charged that the petitioners – who paid Louison for his services – were not abused as described in the petitions and never discussed abuse with Louison.

The U.S. Department of Justice said on Tuesday that it's opening a broad antitrust review of big tech companies, sending shares of Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook lower in extended trading.

While the DOJ didn't disclose specific company names, it's launching the review based on ""new Washington threats"" from Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal. The agency will examine practices of online platforms that dominate internet search, social media and retail services, the DOJ said in a statement Tuesday.

The move is the strongest by Attorney General William Barr towards Big Tech, which faces increased scrutiny from both political parties because of the expanded market power the companies have and the tremendous amount of consumer data they control. President Trump, a regular critic of Amazon and CEO Jeff Bezos, has claimed that Facebook is biased against conservatives and recently agreed with an assessment by tech investor Peter Thiel that perhaps Google should be investigated for not working with the U.S. government on a cloud project.

The DOJ said in Tuesday's release that it's looking into competition, ""stifled innovation"" and the impact on consumers.

""Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands,"" said Makan Delrahim, assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department's antitrust division, in the statement. ""The Department's antitrust review will explore these important issues.""

Shares of Facebook, Alphabet, and Amazon all fell more than 1% immediately after the announcement. Apple's stock also dropped.

Representatives from Facebook and Apple declined to comment.

In a June interview, Apple CEO Tim Cook said ""I don't think anybody reasonable is gonna come to the conclusion that Apple's a monopoly,"" because ""we don't have a dominant position in any market.""

As voting continued, the Senate overwhelmingly backed Esper, a former lobbyist for weapons maker Raytheon Co., to be President Donald Trump's second confirmed leader of the Pentagon.

Esper, 55, received strong bipartisan support despite some sharp questioning during his confirmation hearing by Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren about his ties to Raytheon and his refusal to extend an ethics commitment he signed in 2017 to avoid decisions involving the company.

Warren, a 2020 presidential hopeful, was the only member of the Senate Armed Services Committee to voice opposition to Esper's confirmation during the hearing.

Raytheon is the third-largest U.S. defense contractor.

There has been no confirmed defense secretary since Jim Mattis resigned in December over policy differences with Trump. Many members of Congress from both parties have urged the Republican president to act urgently to fill the powerful position.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called on members to support Esper as he opened the Senate on Tuesday morning.

""The nominee is beyond qualified. His record of public service is beyond impressive. His commitment to serving our service members if beyond obvious. And the need for a Senate-confirmed secretary of defense is beyond urgent,"" McConnell said.

An Army veteran, Esper had served as a congressional aide and a Pentagon official under Republican President George W. Bush, before working for Raytheon. He has been Army secretary since November 2017.

Trump's previous pick to be secretary of defense, Patrick Shanahan, withdrew from consideration on June 18 after reports emerged of domestic violence in his family.

Mr. Gregg, who moved to the United States to be with his husband, did not meet a five-year residency requirement. His lawyers say that requirement would not have applied if they had been treated as the married couple they are.

For two married United States citizens, “all the law requires is that one of them lived in America for at least one day,” said Aaron Morris, the executive director of Immigration Equality, which has worked on all three lawsuits.

“Marriage is so fundamental to how you define a family,” he said. “To disenfranchise a little girl of citizenship because she has two dads is invidious discrimination that has been struck down time and time again.”

The State Department declined to comment on Tuesday, citing pending litigation. In court documents, the department has argued that the policy does not discriminate and applies to opposite-sex and same-sex couples alike.

But gay couples argue that they are far more likely to be questioned about their conception methods when applying for citizenship. Immigration Equality said that it had heard from at least three dozen families in similar situations since mid-2017; by the organization’s account, most were same-sex couples.

In court documents, the State Department has said that rules for passing down citizenship for children born abroad are important for preventing fraud and ensuring that children born abroad have a sufficient connection to the United States to warrant citizenship."
USDA rule could affect 3.1M food stamp recipients,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/wireStory/usda-rule-affect-31m-food-stamp-recipients-64508284,"About 3.1 million people would lose food stamp benefits under the Trump administration's proposal to tighten automatic eligibility requirements for the food stamp program.

The Agriculture Department said Tuesday that the rule would close ""a loophole"" that enables people receiving only minimal benefits from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program to be eligible automatically for food stamps without undergoing further checks on their income or assets.

""For too long, this loophole has been used to effectively bypass important eligibility guidelines. Too often, states have misused this flexibility without restraint,"" Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement.

The proposed rule is the latest in the Trump administration's efforts to cut back on the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program or SNAP, the official name of the food stamp program. It also has proposed to tighten work requirements for those who receive federal food assistance.

USDA estimates that 1.7 million households — 3.1 million people — ""will not otherwise meet SNAP's income and asset eligibility prerequisites under the proposed rule."" That would result in a net savings of about $9.4 billion over five years.

An unpublished version of the proposed rule acknowledges the impact, saying it ""may also negatively impact food security and reduce the savings rates among those individuals who do not meet the income and resource eligibility requirements for SNAP or the substantial and ongoing requirements for expanded categorical eligibility.""

Democrats in Congress were quick to condemn the proposal.

House Speaker Nancy Pelsoi said it was ""the administration's latest act of staggering callousness"" while Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said he would ""fight to make sure these cuts never become a reality.""

Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., said the administration was trying anew to circumvent Congress and that the effect would be to ""take food away from families, prevent children from getting school meals, and make it harder for states to administer food assistance.""

Congress has rejected previous, similar attempts to change the expanded automatic eligibility provisions, most recently during the farm bill debate in 2018.

Robert Greenstein, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said the proposal could discourage working families with incomes close to the maximum for SNAP participation from seeking more work out of fear that the added wages could make them ineligible for the program.

""The proposed rule would weaken SNAP's role in supporting work while making it harder for families that struggle to get by on low wages to meet their basic needs,"" he said.

About 36 million people participated in SNAP in April 2019, down from more than 38 million a year earlier.

Under current law, states may automatically make people eligible for food stamps, if they meet income and other requirements for TANF. USDA says 43 states have expanded that to include households that it says ""barely participate"" in TANF. The provision is called ""expanded categorical eligibility.""

USDA said the policy has resulted in people receiving food stamps who don't need it and wouldn't qualify under regular program rules.

Ellen Vollinger, legal director of the Food Research & Action Center, said the proposal was troubling and that the government should ""put attention on how to help more people, not undercut supports for them and make their struggle against hunger even harder.""

She said the department didn't seem to address a resulting loss of school meals, which she said the Congressional Budget Office included in its analyses of previous, similar proposals. ""It's another hit on hunger,"" she said.

Under the proposal, to qualify for automatic eligibility, people would have to get at least $50 a month in benefits from TANF for a minimum of six months.

Perdue said the change is necessary for ""preventing abuse of a critical safety net system so those who need food assistance the most are the only ones who receive it.""

The rule, expected to be published in the Federal Register on Wednesday, is open for public comment for 60 days.

Why Mueller is going to get asked about Attorney General William Barr,https://www.vox.com,['Jul'],07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/7/23/20706263/mueller-hearing-bill-barr-testimony-report,"Robert Mueller has never really been the face of his own special counsel investigation.

That role has mostly fallen to others in the Department of Justice: former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, for most of it; Matthew Whitaker, briefly and controversially. And, of course, Attorney General William Barr, who arrived toward the end and steered the public release of the probe’s findings, and the narrative surrounding it.

But on Wednesday, Mueller will (albeit reluctantly) reclaim the spotlight when he appears before two House committees to testify on the findings of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether President Donald Trump obstructed justice.

It’s unlikely Mueller will offer much beyond what’s in his 448-page, partially redacted report (Mueller said as much in May). And, according to the Washington Post, the Justice Department is holding Mueller to that, instructing him “not to go beyond” what’s in the public report.

What’s definitely not in Mueller’s report is how much friction (if any) existed between the Department of Justice — Barr in particular — and Mueller’s team. But lawmakers are very likely going to ask Mueller about just that.

Signs of tension have cropped up here and there since the report’s release, most notably in a letter that Mueller sent to Barr suggesting that the attorney general’s four-page summary of the principal conclusions of the report, released a month before the actual text, did not “fully capture the context, nature, and substance” of the investigation. And then there’s Barr’s own attempts to “reinvestigate the investigators.”

Democrats will almost certainly use the hearings Wednesday to try to uncover any deeper discord between Mueller and Barr, especially since House Democrats have had their own very public battles with the attorney general.

At the same time, it’s likely that Mueller — a seasoned prosecutor who’s no stranger to congressional hearings and who’s made it pretty obvious he wants to stay above politics — is going to do everything he can to keep from being pulled into the squabble.

But there are legitimate questions about how Barr handled the report’s release and his role in downplaying the special counsel’s conclusions.

Since it’s been a while since all of this was in the news, here’s a reminder of what happened to get you caught up ahead of the hearings on Wednesday.

Let’s start with the basics: How does Barr fit into the Mueller investigation?

In March 2017, Trump’s attorney general, Jeff Sessions, recused himself from overseeing the Russia investigation after it emerged he had contacts with Russian officials during the 2016 campaign. That responsibility then fell to the deputy attorney general. Rod Rosenstein, who was confirmed in April, eventually took over. Rosenstein appointed the special counsel in May 2017 after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, and he managed the Mueller probe for most of its duration.

Trump publicly berated Sessions for months for having recused himself, suggesting that he Sessions should have protected him from the probe. (Mueller examines this dynamic in his report, as part of his obstruction inquiry.)

In November 2018, Sessions finally resigned. That temporarily moved the investigation into the hands of then-Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker. Trump nominated Bill Barr, a former attorney general himself, for the permanent job in December 2018.

His nomination was controversial — if confirmed, he’d control the Mueller investigation. And it soon emerged that he’d made statements both publicly and privately questioning the legitimacy of the investigation and the impartiality of Mueller and his team — including an 18-page letter he wrote to Rosenstein arguing that Mueller’s obstruction of justice inquiry into the president was “fatally misconceived”

Barr was confirmed despite these concerns, and in February 2019, he assumed control of the Mueller investigation.

Barr framed the initial narrative around the Mueller report

On March 22, Mueller submitted his final report to the attorney general. And just two days later, Barr released a four-page letter that outlined what he described as the “principal conclusions” of the Mueller report.

According to Barr, those conclusions were: 1) Russia interfered in the 2016 election, and 2) there was no criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. On the question of whether the president obstructed justice during the investigation, Barr said the special counsel did not draw a conclusion one way or the other.

But Barr himself drew a conclusion on that score: In the same letter, he said that he, along with Rosenstein, had determined that the evidence “is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.”

So Barr, not Mueller, is the one who ultimately determined that the president did not obstruct justice. This led the president to triumphantly declare: “total exoneration.”

But, of course, the Mueller report was far more complicated and knotty than Barr’s initial “principal conclusions” — and Mueller, it turns out, objected to Barr’s characterization.

Barr’s strange press conference ahead of the April release of the redacted report

Barr promised to be as transparent as possible in releasing the full report, limiting the redactions to four areas: confidential grand jury material; personal information involving third parties; material related to ongoing investigations; and classified information. (Vox calculated that just about 7.25 percent of the report was redacted — so it doesn’t seem overly blocked out.)

On the day the report was to be released, Barr held a morning press conference in which he tried to positively spin the report’s findings in the president’s favor — before anyone, including the reporters in attendance, had been given the chance to see the full report.

As Vox’s Zack Beauchamp explained, “Barr literally uttered the phrase “no collusion” to describe Mueller’s conclusions — providing a perfect sound bite to play on loop on cable news in the president’s favorite phrasing.” Beauchamp continued:

Barr repeated this and similar talking points multiple times during his prepared statement. He put tremendous effort into explaining why Trump’s behavior during the probe should be seen as justified and in no way constituted obstruction. He even praised the president for providing “unfettered access” to documents and said the White House “fully cooperated” with the investigation, despite Trump’s refusal to submit to an interview with Mueller. At the end, when a reporter asked if it was improper for the attorney general to spin the report to the public before it was released, Barr literally walked off the stage.

The attorney general’s unusually robust defense of the president stuck out even more after the report was made public later that day. The 448-page, partially-redacted report details numerous instances of shady conduct by Trump and his associates both during the campaign and after Trump took office.

As Vox’s Andrew Prokop has written:

Mueller makes clear that his investigation did not establish that there was a conspiracy between Trump associates and the Russian government to interfere with the election. And the special counsel doesn’t say one way or the other whether he thinks President Trump criminally obstructed justice while in office — though he makes clear he thinks the evidence of that is quite concerning. “If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state,” Mueller writes. “We are unable to reach such a judgment.” The report makes several things clear: that the Russian government tried to help Trump win, that the Trump campaign was eager to benefit from hackings targeting Democrats, that Trump’s campaign advisers had a host of ties to Russia, and that President Trump tried again and again to try to impede the Russia investigation.

That’s quite a different picture than the one Barr tried to sell to reporters — and the American people — shortly before the report’s release.

Mueller privately objects to Barr’s portrayal of his report

Mueller publicly stayed silent through all of this. But on the eve of Barr’s May testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee about the Mueller investigation, reports leaked that Mueller had written to Barr a few days after the attorney general released his “principal conclusions” to say that Barr’s description did not fully capture “the context, nature, and substance” of his report.

“There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation,” Mueller wrote in the letter, dated March 27. (The full later was released by the House Judiciary Committee on May 1.)

At the time, the full report had not yet been released, but Mueller urged Barr to at least make public the introductions and executive summaries from the report’s two volumes to correct the record. (Volume I covers Russian interference in the 2016 election and any links between Russian officials and the Trump campaign; Volume II covers Trump’s response to the investigation, meaning it mostly focuses on the question of obstruction of justice.)

Barr did not follow through with Mueller’s initial request, a decision he later defended to the Senate Judiciary Committee, saying he told Mueller he “was not in the business of putting out periodic summaries because a summary would start a whole public debate.” Instead, he said he wanted to work with Mueller’s team to put out the full report as soon as possible. (He also referred to Mueller’s letter as “a bit snitty.”)

This whole back-and-forth drama between Barr and Mueller seemed to further confirm to Barr’s critics that he’d deliberately misrepresented the report’s findings in order to make the president — his boss — look better.

That view grew even stronger when Barr publicly echoed the conspiracy theory that the FBI may have “spied” on the president’s campaign and announced he was launching a sweeping review of how the Russia investigation was conducted.

What all this means for Mueller’s testimony on Wednesday

Democrats and Republicans are likely to have questions for Mueller about his interactions with Barr and the Department of Justice in the weeks leading up to the conclusion of his investigation and the weeks after he filed his report.

There are legitimate issues here. Democrats will likely want to know why Mueller wrapped up the probe when he did, and if Barr (or anyone else) had a say in the timing. But right now there’s absolutely no evidence of such interference.

They’ll also want to hear more from Mueller about how he thinks Barr handled the release of the report. And they’ll almost certainly want to know more about why Mueller didn’t come to a conclusion on obstruction of justice — and what he thought about Barr stepping in to make his own judgment.

Republicans, too, will probably have questions about Mueller and his team’s interactions with the Justice Department — after all, it was just a year ago this week that Republicans were threatening to impeach Rosenstein, who was in charge of the Russia probe at the time, for failing to turn over documents relating to sensitive investigations, including the Russia inquiry.

They’ll want to know about prosecutorial decisions Mueller’s team made, and they’ll almost certainly bring up Mueller’s firing of Peter Strzok, the former FBI agent on Mueller’s team who sent anti-Trump texts to Lisa Page, a Department of Justice lawyer with whom he was having an affair.

And, of course, they’ll want to know more about possible political bias on Mueller’s team more generally. These, too, are critical questions that Mueller should answer, in part because his silence on all of it has allowed those skeptical of the investigation to fuel suspicions about the legitimacy of the investigation.

Given his record of trying to stay above the political fray, it’s unlikely Mueller will indulge either Democrats or Republicans in their quest to score political points from his testimony. But that doesn’t mean they’re not going to try."
Comey's inside man at White House emerges as DOJ inspector general finalizes FISA abuse report,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/comeys-inside-man-at-white-house-emerges-as-doj-inspector-general-finalizes-fisa-abuse-report,"Former FBI Director James Comey had an inside man at the White House, feeding the bureau information about President Trump and his aides in 2017.

Now this individual, who after leaving the government was hired by BuzzFeed to verify parts of British ex-spy Christopher Steele's dossier, may be tied to an investigation into alleged surveillance abuses by the DOJ and the FBI being conducted by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz.

This previously unreported mole in the White House appears in a new report by RealClearInvestigations that explored possible misconduct by Comey for what two U.S. officials described as essentially ""running a covert operation against"" the president even as he was assuring Trump he was not the subject of any investigation.

Anthony Ferrante, a longtime FBI official, worked as a cybersecurity adviser on the National Security Council. Officials said Ferrante was working in the White House even while the FBI held him on reserve status. All the while, he was sharing information about Trump and his aides back to FBI headquarters.

One former National Security Council official said Ferrante's unique position was highly irregular.

“In an unprecedented action, Comey created a new FBI reserve position for Ferrante, enabling him to have an ongoing relationship with the agency, retaining his clearances and enabling him to come back in [to bureau headquarters],” the official said, adding that the NSC division supervisor was ""not allowed to get rid of Ferrante"" and that the arrangement appeared to be ""in direct conflict with the no-contact policy between the White House and the Department of Justice.""

Ferrante left the White House in April 2017, not long before Trump fired Comey as FBI director.

He went on to join FTI Consulting, a business-advising firm headquartered in Washington, D.C. Through this firm, Ferrante was hired by BuzzFeed to investigate the dossier composed by Steele, to try and corroborate the unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia that appear in the research.

Ferrante was replaced in the White House by another FBI official, Jordan Rae Kelly, who signed security logs for Ferrante to enter the White House while he was contracted by BuzzFeed. Kelly left the White House last year and also joined FTI Consulting.

The FBI declined to comment for this report.

The dossier was published by BuzzFeed in January 2017 after reports came out that Comey privately briefed then-President-elect Trump on select allegations from Steele's work at a Trump Tower briefing. This meeting in New York, which came one day after Comey met with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office with some of his top administration officials, is now under scrutiny by Horowitz's team.

In what has become an urgent area of consternation for Republican lawmakers, the FBI relied heavily on Steele's unverified dossier to obtain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants filed to surveil onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. Four FISA warrant applications and renewals were filed from October 2016 through June 2017 against Page. Steele was hired by opposition research firm Fusion GPS and his dossier was funded by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign.

While under contract for BuzzFeed, Ferrante compiled a report that was filed in federal court as part of a lawsuit over the publication of the dossier. He found that internet service providers mentioned in the dossier that were owned by Russian entrepreneur Aleksej Gubarev may have been used by Russian agents to support the hack of the DNC and the campaign chairman of Clinton’s campaign during the 2016 election. Unlike Steele's dossier, Ferrante's report did not directly link Gubarev or his executives to the hacking. “I have no evidence of them actually sitting behind a keyboard,” Ferrante said in a deposition.

It is unclear whether Ferrante is still working for BuzzFeed. A spokesman for the outlet declined to comment on questions from the Washington Examiner about Ferrante. Ferrante did not immediately return an emailed request for comment from the Washington Examiner and a spokeswoman at FTI Consulting declined comment to RealClearInvestigations, as did Comey's attorney.

Horowitz's team has reviewed more than 1 million records and conducted more than 100 interviews, including with Comey and Steele. The information provided by Steele was reportedly interesting or credible enough to justify extending the length of the investigation, which Attorney General William Barr earlier this year had predicted would be complete by May or June.

House Judiciary Committee ranking member Doug Collins said over the weekend he expects the inspector general's report to be released this fall. The RealClearInvestigations report puts a release date sometime in September.

Meanwhile Attorney General William Barr is conducting a review of the origins of the Russia investigation, and he has said he is working very closely with Horowitz. The inspector general can recommend prosecutions, and U.S. Attorney John Durham, whom Barr tasked to lead the review, has the ability to convene a grand jury and to subpoena people outside of the government."
State Department yanks data on U.S. tourists harmed in Jamaica,https://www.freep.com,"['Tresa Baldas', 'Published A.M. Et July']",07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2019/07/23/state-department-american-tourists-jamaica/1796973001/,"CLOSE

At a time when tourism fears have escalated in the Caribbean, the State Department has stopped publishing crime data involving Americans harmed in Jamaica — but it won't say why.

For the first time in seven years, the State Department did not list how many Americans were sexually assaulted, robbed, murdered or kidnapped in Jamaica in its 2019 Crime and Safety Report. That information was previously published in reports that were cited in a 2018 Free Press investigation, which found that sexual assaults of U.S. tourists in Jamaica is an historic and unchecked problem, with an estimated one American raped a month.

That's according to State Department data that was publicly available for seven straight years — until now.

The Free Press, which interviewed numerous U.S. victims who said they were sexually assaulted in Jamaica, including four Michigan tourists, asked the State Department multiple times why the 2019 report omits data involving American crime victims in Jamaica. The agency wouldn't explain, beyond saying: “We do not have any other information to share at this time.""

These are the choke marks that an 18-year-old South African au pair says she suffered after being drugged and raped at a Sandals-owned beaches resort in Jamaica on July 4, 2018. She says Sandals paid her American host family $25,000 and silenced them with a non-disclosure agreement (Photo: South African au pair)

But the State Department did warn in its 2019 report that ""rape and sexual assault are serious problems throughout Jamaica, including at resorts and hotels. The use of date rape drugs is possible, even at private parties and resorts.""

The Jamaica 2019 Crime and Safety Report was released in the wake of a tourism scare involving the Dominican Republic, where 10 American tourist deaths have been reported since May. Several more U.S. tourists have reported becoming severely ill while on vacation there, including a Detroit man who landed in Harper Hospital's ICU following his May vacation to the DR.

Jamaica and the Dominican Republic are among nine Caribbean and Central American destinations that the U.S. State Department has issued Level 2 travel advisories for, citing violence and crime. Level 2 means “Exercise Increased Caution.” The other countries on the Level 2 travel advisory list are: The Bahamas, Belize, Colombia, Cuba, Turks and Caicos, Mexico and Guatemala.

There are four categories of travel advisories: “Level 1: Exercise Normal Precautions”; “Level Two: Exercise Increased Caution”; “Level 3: Reconsider Travel” and “Level 4: Do Not Travel.”

Caribbean destinations that are currently deemed safe for travel — they have no travel advisory — include:

Anguilla, Antigua, Aruba, Barbados, Bonaire

British Virgin Islands

Cayman Islands

Costa Rica, Curaçao, Grenada

French West Indies, which include Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Saint Martin, and Saint Barthélemy.

Saint Kitts and Nevis

Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines

Countries on the “Level 3, Reconsider Travel” list are:

El Salvador

Honduras

Nicaragua

Haiti

Countries on the “Level 4, Do Not Travel” list are:

Venezuela

While the FBI investigates the Dominican Republic deaths, tourism officials there are working feverishly to dispel concerns about travel safety. So are officials in Jamaica, where an island-wide security audit of resorts was ordered in the wake of the Free Press investigation, which detailed the rapes of two Detroit women who were attacked at gunpoint by a Jamaican resort employee last fall.

Jamaica's Minister of Tourism Edmund Bartlett said in early July that the months-long security audit is complete and that his office is reviewing it. Findings have not yet been released.

“The issue of safety and security is very central to us. We will have further discussions with the (Jamaica Hotel and Tourist Association) as it relates to the recommendations, and together we will craft the new architecture in Jamaica,” Bartlett said at a June tourism meeting.

The audit sought to uncover, among other things, non-compliance by resorts regarding safety incidents. It focused on building safety, personnel, security measures, communication devices and security incident history.

Meanwhile, State Department warnings about sexual violence against women tourists in Jamaica continue.

""If you are a victim of a sexual assault, contact the police and the U.S. Embassy in Kingston as soon as possible,"" the State Department states in its 2019 report, reminding victims that Jamaican hotels and resorts ""should assist you with these communications.""

That message highlighted a key finding in the Free Press investigation.

Numerous victims told the Free Press the resorts ignored or downplayed their fears, discouraged them from going to the police, and in some cases silenced them with free travel in exchange for them signing non-disclosure agreements.

The 2019 State Department report also highlighted this finding by the Free Press: tourists who are sexually assaulted in Jamaica feel justice is out of reach. As one mother told the Free Press three years after her daughter was allegedly raped in a laundry room by a resort lifeguard: ""My daughter will never have justice.""

CLOSE The rapes of two Detroit women at a Jamaican resort has highlighted a pervasive problem on the island getaway: sexual assaults are ignored. Tresa Baldas, Detroit Free Press

Four and a half years after the alleged rapes of the girl and her friend, the case is finally going to trial in Jamaica in December. The victims will testify from a location in the U.S.

The State Department warns about such delays.

""Victims of sexual assault in Jamaica should not expect the same assistance routinely offered in the United States,"" the State Department writes in its 2019 report. ""Rape kits are not always available, and victims must often ask for medication to avoid STD transmission and reduce the chances of pregnancy. An offer of counseling is unlikely.""

Police resources are also limited, the government says.

""Law enforcement shortcomings exist in collection of evidence. Prosecution of rape cases moves very slowly,"" the State Department states, adding: ""Victims may need to return to Jamaica during the legal process.""

The 81-year-old Commerce secretary, who has for months endured whispers that he is on the outs, spends much of his time at the White House to try to retain President Donald Trump’s favor, the sources said, leaving his department adrift.

Story Continued Below

He’s hardly the only top Trump official to seek the president’s approval. But department insiders say they’ve rarely seen Commerce so rudderless — and they say Ross’ penchant for managing upward at the expense of his staff is leading to what one plugged-in observer described as “a disaster over there.”

“With our ongoing trade wars and the census looming, Commerce needs functional leadership to be effective, and right now they just don’t have it,” said Theo LeCompte, a former top Commerce official in the Obama administration who speaks often with former colleagues.

One common complaint: Ross, a successful investor before Trump tapped him as secretary of Commerce, isn’t frequently seen in the building talking to employees or rallying them to do good work.

“He’s sort of seen as kind of irrelevant. The morale is very low there because there’s not a lot of confidence in the secretary,” said a former outside adviser to Commerce who is still in touch with many employees at the department. “He’s not respected in the building.”

Ross doesn’t hold routine meetings with senior staffers, according to a person familiar with the department’s inner workings and a former outside adviser — a departure from past practice that one source attributed to the secretary’s lack of stamina.

“Because he tends to fall asleep in meetings, they try not to put him in a position where that could happen so they’re very careful and conscious about how they schedule certain meetings,” said the former outside adviser. “There’s a small window where he’s able to focus and pay attention and not fall asleep.”

A Commerce official disputed that criticsm, saying that Ross has frequent afternoon meetings, including “long” meetings on the census.

“Secretary Ross is a tireless worker who is the sole decision-maker at the department,"" said Commerce press secretary Kevin Manning. ""He routinely works 12-hour days and travels often, with visits to seven countries and eight states in the last three months to advance the president’s agenda.""

Yet top Commerce officials have pushed to not have Ross called to testify at congressional oversight hearings, according to two sources close to the department, because they fear he isn’t up to the task. “There’s a great deal of effort to shield him from testifying ever again,” said one of the sources.

A Commerce official disputed that and said, “He’s obviously going to have to testify again. … You can’t get through the rest of [congressional appropriations] season without testifying again.”

Ross did testify at an oversight hearing on the census for nearly seven hours in March, and emerged through the ordeal generally unscathed. But according to one person familiar with the department, the consensus among the top ranks of the administration was that it would be best to avoid a repeat appearance.

“There was a great deal of concern to not have him testify expressed from the White House,” this person said, characterizing the instructions as: “‘Don’t do this, people. Don’t do this, he’s probably not the right guy to go there.’”

Ross certainly has other reasons to avoid Congress — namely, the heated dispute between Hill Democrats and the administration over adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census.

In April, Ross offered to send aides to testify on his behalf before a House Appropriations subcommittee, an offer the panel’s Democratic chairman, José Serrano, said showed “stunning disrespect.” Serrano’s Republican counterpart, Robert Aderholt, told Reuters that Ross refused to testify out of “concern that this hearing might focus more on political or legal issues than the budget itself.”

“His relationship with the Hill has deteriorated more and more, and he’s just not interested in dealing with the Hill if he can avoid it,” said a person familiar with the department’s internal discussions.

A Commerce official noted that Ross talked to Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) two weeks ago, and held a party two months ago that a number of senators attended. Another Commerce employee observed, “This administration is very hesitant to do oversight in general or to comply with oversight requests in general.”

There are public signs, however, of apparent unease with Ross as a spokesperson for the administration. At an appearance at the White House in mid-July on an announcement on abandoning the citizenship question in the census, the Commerce secretary stood next to Trump the entire time and was one of three people who didn’t speak. Attorney General Bill Barr, on the other hand, spoke at length.

Ross’ relationship with the White House and with Trump was also damaged by stories that came out in the past 18 months showing that he wasn’t as rich as he had claimed and hadn’t fully divested some stock as he had promised, according to the former outside adviser. (The Commerce official disputed that, arguing that the White House has not cared about these issues.)

Ross’s deputies, meanwhile, are coming under fire of their own as tensions rise withini the department.

Political appointees sometimes close doors right in front of career employees to keep them out of meetings, one former Commerce official in touch with former colleagues said.

Meanwhile, “it’s totally infighting among the politicals,” said another person familiar with the department. “It’s just everybody fighting everybody.” In particular, the relationship between Ross’ office and the legislative affairs team is “clearly broken,” this person said.

Charles “Kolo” Rathburn, who had been acting head of legislative affairs, “was unceremoniously let go” and abruptly left earlier in July, according to a person familiar with Commerce and the outside adviser, who said it had to do with issues of professional conduct in the workplace. Another person familiar with Commerce also confirmed his departure.

“He wasn’t allowed to clean out his office,” said one of the people. Rathburn had replaced Mike Platt, who had left in early May.

A Commerce official said Rathburn, who didn’t respond to requests for comment, is working to pass the bar exam and has an offer for a higher-paying position at a law firm if he does.

Ross Branson, who had been deputy assistant secretary of legislative affairs and was Platt’s deputy, also left Commerce on Friday, according to two people familiar with his departure. He had become “collateral damage,” according to one of the people, and was told that he had to look for a new job. He starts on Monday as head of legislative affairs at the Export-Import Bank, a position that a Commerce official described as “definitely a promotion.” Branson and the Ex-Im Bank did not respond to a request for comment.

Much of the tension inside the building has centered on Earl Comstock, who shepherded Ross’ confirmation on Capitol Hill and is one of the secretary’s top lieutenants as the department's policy director.

The disarray inside Commerce is drawing an intervention from chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and other White House officials, who are trying to figure out how to wrest control from Comstock, who increasingly seems to be involved in everything that happens inside the department.

“Things come to a screeching halt because he demands to be the final decision on everything whether it’s an email that goes out to the Hill or a letter to respond to X, Y and Z,” said a person familiar with Commerce.

Comstock, who didn’t respond to requests for comment, has also been at the center of many of the spectrum battles between the Federal Communications Commission and the departments of Transportation, Education, Commerce and NASA and NOAA, according to an administration official. He has “literally been seeding bad intel and bad information to get other people agitated,” said the official.

He also tried to scuttle a joint White House-FCC summit on 5G, the wireless technology, in April by “calling everyone he could 24 hours before the event trying to get it to be canceled,” this person said. Comstock clashed in particular with former National Telecommunications and Information Administration chief David Redl, who left his post abruptly in May.

Critics of Ross’ leadership at Commerce also have a new target of concern: chief of staff Michael Walsh, who is described by some as inexperienced on policy and difficult to work with.

Walsh didn’t respond to a request for comment, but the Commerce official said that he has good relationships throughout the administration and on the Hill and visits the White House frequently. A second person familiar with Commerce also claimed, “People want his job so they’re spreading bad stuff on him.”

The chaos inside the department has had consequences for some employees.

“There’s great frustration among people who really want to use their skills and talents to help this country and are being marginalized by a White House who doesn’t need to ask any questions because it already thinks it has the answers,” said Roger Fisk, a Commerce official in the Obama administration. “All of that expertise is just lying dormant hiding in plain sight.""

"The Justice Department’s surprise 'reveal' of a Big Tech investigation was highly unusual, and it could actually turn out to be good news for the tech giants",https://www.businessinsider.com,['Troy Wolverton'],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.businessinsider.com/doj-unusual-antitrust-announcement-could-be-good-for-big-tech-2019-7,"The US Department of Justice's surprise press release Tuesday of its Big Tech investigation was designed to send a signal to a lot of groups — but tech companies were not really one of them.

The announcement was an unusually public performance by a federal regulator which typically prizes confidentiality in such matters. That's because it was basically a notice, intended particularly to a key figure in Congress, that the Justice Department will now be spearheading the antitrust investigations into the big tech companies, said David Balto, an antitrust lawyer in Washington D.C. with decades of experience working for and with competition regulators officials there.

For tech companies, the DOJs' announcement was if anything, a subtle indication that the government may not come down as hard on them as it might seem, he said.

""This is good news for the companies,"" Balto said.

That may seem a bit ironic, given the substance of the announcement. In its statement, the Justice Department said it would review the market power of the ""leading online platforms"" to see if they have thwarted competition or harmed consumers. The agency vowed to ""seek redress"" if it found violations, essentially threatening to sue the companies.

Read this: The Department of Justice just launched a broad probe into whether big tech companies like Amazon, Facebook, and others illegally harm competition

The announcement came as something of a surprise. Numerous reports have indicated that the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission were starting to look into the competitive practices of the big tech companies. But the agencies had declined to comment on the record for those reports. In fact, federal enforcement agencies rarely acknowledge ongoing investigations into particular people or companies.

The agency is likely responding to political pressure

Unusual as it was, the Justice Department's move didn't come out of nowhere. Political figures on the left and right, including senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders and President Donald Trump, have been calling for increased scrutiny of the market power of the big tech companies and even, in many cases, for breaking them up.

""There is enormous political pressure on the agencies in Washington to be seen as doing something about big tech,"" said Daniel Crane, a professor at the University of Michigan's law school who focuses on antitrust issues. He continued: ""This is their way of responding to the political pressure.""

But Balto thinks there something more going on. Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported that the FTC and the Justice Department had divvied up oversight over the tech giants. Under the agreement, the FTC was to get authority over Facebook and Amazon, while the Department of Justice would oversee Apple and Google parent Alphabet.

The problem with that arrangement was that Mike Lee, who serves as chairman of Senate Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on antitrust, competition policy and consumer rights, objected to it, Balto noted. In an opinion piece published by the Washington Examiner last month, Lee lambasted the idea that the agencies would split oversight duties over the big tech companies. The two agencies risked duplicating efforts and causing a divergence in enforcement, he said.

Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, questions Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as he testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill on September 27, 2018 in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik, Pool/Getty Images

""These investigations will clearly cover much of the same ground,"" Lee said in his op-ed. ""Splitting antitrust investigations of these firms between two agencies,"" he continued, ""is just analytically inefficient.""

The Justice Department is saying it's in charge

Lee's subcommittee was scheduled to hold a hearing on Tuesday with top antitrust regulators in the Trump administration at which he was expected to question them over the decision to split up oversight of the tech companies. That hearing ended up being postponed, but, in Balto's view, the Justice Department's announcement was its way of responding to Lee's concerns by staking out its turf.

""This is really the (Justice Department) saying, 'thank you, it's my football, and I plan to play with it,'"" he said.

The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the Justice Department's review would not pre-empt the investigations already underway by the FTC into the companies under its purview.

Balto says that while the Justice Department may leave some issues to the FTC, Tuesday's announcement indicates that the DOJ is laying claim to all inquiries involving online platform and marketplace issues — the core of the antitrust charges made against the big tech companies. Senator Elizabeth Warren and others have raised concerns about how those companies use their control over their platforms and marketplaces to give their own products and services a leg up over rivals.

""These issues are incredibly complex, time consuming, and really difficult, and to have two agencies looking at the same conduct really didn't make sense,"" Balto said.

Lee's office did not respond to calls or an email seeking comment. Likewise, the Justice Department did not respond to an email seeking comment.

The move could be good news for the tech giants

The news that the Justice Department was opening up its review was seen as a negative sign on Wall Street Tuesday. The big four companies' stock prices all fell following the announcement.

But having the Justice Department take point on antitrust review is actually a good thing for the tech companies, Balto said. The Department of Justice hasn't filed a major suit under the Sherman Antitrust Act since the Microsoft case two decades ago. And the agency actually has fewer legal options when it comes to policing competition than does the FTC, he said.

""I don't think anybody's going to lose any more sleep that this is all with the Justice Department,"" Balto said. ""If anything, they'll feel more comfortable in their legal position.""

For his part, Crane is dubious that anything much will come of the investigations in the near future, regardless of which agency is leading the charge. When it comes to antitrust enforcement, the FTC's track record is not much better than the Department of Justice in recent decades, despite theoretically having enhanced enforcement powers, he said.

The courts have made it difficult for regulators to win antitrust cases, and even when such cases are successful, they tend to take many years to play out. Because of that, there's little chance the big tech companies will be broken up anytime soon, despite the political pressure on them, he said.

""The kind of blockbuster, 'let's break them up' case that is being trumpeted politically, I just don't see that being in the offing,"" Crane said.

White House nixed DHS chief McAleenan Refugee Day border welcome for migrants,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/dhs-chief-mcaleenan-wanted-to-visit-border-and-welcome-migrants-for-refugee-day-white-house-said-no,"The White House communications team and the Department of Homeland Security's acting secretary office engaged in a tense argument last month after acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan proposed traveling down to the U.S.-Mexico border on World Refugee Day to celebrate and welcome migrants, including those who entered illegally, two senior administration officials told the Washington Examiner.

A senior public affairs official at DHS asked the White House in early June for permission to go down to the southern border with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar on June 20. One person identified the official as acting DHS Assistant Secretary of Public Affairs Andrew Meehan.

""The wildly off base proposal was met with immediate concern as not being thought through,"" one official told the Washington Examiner Monday evening.

A second official said the White House was concerned about the ""optics"" if two Cabinet officials were welcoming people who had illegally crossed into the country when President Trump has taken a hard stance against any type of illegal immigration, including against those who are seeking asylum on the southern border.

The DHS official trying to advance McAleenan's proposal refused to accept the White House's decision and ""sparred with"" several members of the White House strategic communications team, including then-director Mercedes Schlapp, over ""multiple contentious phone calls,"" the first source said. The second official said the fight lasted ""weeks.""

""The obvious glaring concern was that the border crisis was about migrants and asylums, not refugees, DHS disagreed,"" the first official wrote in a text, suggesting the the appearance would seem supportive of the people abusing the system instead of legitimate refugees.

The same official said Azar was not supportive of McAleenan's idea and was not planning to go along for the trip. The second official said Azar was on board, but added neither secretary ""understood the ramifications"" of such a trip.

The June 20 World Refugee Day celebration may not have been greenlighted but McAleenan did go to the border on that date. He flew with a Washington Post reporter on Thursday. It's not clear if Azar traveled down separately. An HHS spokeswoman would only say: ""In the past year and a half, Secretary Azar has visited numerous Office of Refugee Resettlement facilities and seen the quality of care provided to unaccompanied alien children.

DHS did not deny that McAleenan's office requested a trip on World Refugee Day and instead shared a schedule of events he took part in while on the border that day.

""On June 20, 2019, Acting Secretary McAleenan hosted the first ladies of Guatemala and Honduras for a tour of the Rio Grande Valley Border Patrol Sector,"" a DHS official wrote in an email Thursday. ""The trip included an overview of how transnational criminal and human smuggling organizations pair adult aliens with children they are not related to with the intent of posing as family units to help secure release into the U.S.""

The day after, June 21, the Washington Post published a story leaking confidential details of a nationwide Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation, which five current and former senior administration officials charged to the Washington Examiner that McAleenan leaked because he did not approve of the raids and sought to sabotage them.

""This is a DHS leadership team who has been at odds with the administration from the beginning. It’s a difference of world view,"" the first official said Monday.

The DHS Office of Inspector General has taken up the formal investigation into the leak of government information in late June, which forced ICE to call off a nationwide operation, the Washington Examiner was first to report.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency’s inspector general will investigate allegations that William L. Wehrum, the agency’s former air quality chief, violated ethics rules when he met with former clients from his days as a lawyer and lobbyist for the oil, gas and coal industries.

The inquiry will look into whether Mr. Wehrum’s efforts at the E.P.A. to weaken climate change and air pollution standards improperly benefited those former clients, a congressional aide said .

At issue are Mr. Wehrum’s ties to the Utility Air Regulatory Group, a coalition of utilities and trade groups that lobbies on behalf of coal-fired power plants, which he represented as a lawyer at his former firm, Hunton & Williams.

That relationship first drew scrutiny last year after Politico reported that the 25 power companies and six trade groups that make up the coalition paid the firm more than $8 million in 2017 just before President Trump appointed Mr. Wehrum. (The law firm is now known as Hunton Andrews Kurth. The Utility Air Regulatory Group announced in May that it would disband after winding down operations.)"

Our aim was to directly estimate the health and longevity impacts of current PM 2.5 concentrations and the benefits of reductions from 1999 to 2015, nationally and at county level, for the entire contemporary population of the contiguous United States. Methods and findings We used vital registration and population data with information on sex, age, cause of death, and county of residence. We used four Bayesian spatiotemporal models, with different adjustments for other determinants of mortality, to directly estimate mortality and life expectancy loss due to current PM 2.5 pollution and the benefits of reductions since 1999, nationally and by county. The covariates included in the adjusted models were per capita income; percentage of population whose family income is below the poverty threshold, who are of Black or African American race, who have graduated from high school, who live in urban areas, and who are unemployed; cumulative smoking; and mean temperature and relative humidity. In the main model, which adjusted for these covariates and for unobserved county characteristics through the use of county-specific random intercepts, PM 2.5 pollution in excess of the lowest observed concentration (2.8 μg/m3) was responsible for an estimated 15,612 deaths (95% credible interval 13,248–17,945) in females and 14,757 deaths (12,617–16,919) in males. These deaths would lower national life expectancy by an estimated 0.15 years (0.13–0.17) for women and 0.13 years (0.11–0.15) for men. The life expectancy loss due to PM 2.5 was largest around Los Angeles and in some southern states such as Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Alabama. At any PM 2.5 concentration, life expectancy loss was, on average, larger in counties with lower income and higher poverty rate than in wealthier counties. Reductions in PM 2.5 since 1999 have lowered mortality in all but 14 counties where PM 2.5 increased slightly. The main limitation of our study, similar to other observational studies, is that it is not guaranteed for the observed associations to be causal. We did not have annual county-level data on other important determinants of mortality, such as healthcare access and quality and diet, but these factors were adjusted for with use of county-specific random intercepts. Conclusions According to our estimates, recent reductions in particulate matter pollution in the USA have resulted in public health benefits. Nonetheless, we estimate that current concentrations are associated with mortality impacts and loss of life expectancy, with larger impacts in counties with lower income and higher poverty rate.

Introduction Clean air policies and innovations in automotive, power generation, and industrial technologies have substantially improved air quality in the United States of America and other high-income countries [1]. These efforts were largely motivated by the evidence on the health hazards of air pollutants, especially fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) [2–7]. Nonetheless, in 2015, nearly 9% of the US population lived in counties with PM 2.5 concentrations above the WHO Air Quality Guideline of 10 μg/m3 [8], and another 89% in counties with concentrations of 5–10 μg/m3 (Fig 1). Recent epidemiological cohorts have observed adverse health impacts of PM 2.5 even at these relatively low concentrations [6,9–12]. These findings indicate that further reducing PM 2.5 is likely to lower mortality, especially from cardiorespiratory diseases, and increase longevity, as did the late 20th-century reductions [1]. Despite this evidence, there is not only resistance to more stringent control of PM 2.5 but also attempts to roll back current standards [13–19]. PPT PowerPoint slide

PM 2.5 , fine particulate matter. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002856.g001 Evidence-based air pollution regulations and policies require quantitative estimates of the health effects of air pollution in the low-concentration range for the contemporary US population, both in terms of deaths averted as a result of past reductions and those avertable if current concentrations are further reduced [20]. Previous estimates of the mortality burden of air pollution mostly extrapolated risk coefficients from epidemiological cohorts to the contemporary US population (see Methods) [21–24]. The only direct analyses of longevity loss due to air pollution focused on a subset of metropolitan areas [1,25], largely before concentrations were at their current relatively low levels, which are the subject of policy debate. Therefore, the fundamental questions of the benefits of current regulations and of further lowering concentrations for preventing deaths and increasing longevity have not been directly answered. In this study, we used publicly available data to directly estimate the number of deaths, by age group and sex, and loss of life expectancy due to current PM 2.5 concentrations in the entire contiguous USA (i.e., excluding Alaska and Hawaii), as well as the benefits of reductions since 1999. We present estimates of averted and avertable deaths and improved longevity nationally as well as at the small-area (county) level, which shows where the current death toll of air pollution is largest and where the health benefits of past controls have been greatest.

Methods Study design Our aim was to quantify, nationally as well as at the small-area (county) level, the current mortality burden of PM 2.5 pollution and the averted mortality as a result of recent PM 2.5 reductions. The most common source of information on the health effects of air pollution exposure is from prospective cohort studies [2–7,10,12]. By design, prospective cohort studies provide information on the risk associated with PM 2.5 in a specific group of participants after a follow-up period, during which other determinants of population health also change. Therefore, estimates of excess mortality and loss of life expectancy due to air pollution in the contemporary population through application of risk estimates from prospective cohorts [6,21] implicitly assume that the magnitude of risk associated with PM 2.5 in the prospective cohort participants is the same as the contemporary general population. A direct approach for measuring the mortality burden of air pollution is to analyse the association of death rates with PM 2.5 concentration across a large number of small-area units, such as counties, appropriately adjusting for other determinants of mortality [1,25–28]. Here, we used four Bayesian spatiotemporal models, with different degrees of adjustment for county characteristics that may also affect mortality, to directly estimate the mortality risk associated with PM 2.5 in US counties from 1999 to 2015. We then used these associations to calculate excess deaths and life expectancy loss associated with current PM 2.5 concentrations, as well as the benefits of reductions since 1999, for all counties in the contiguous USA. The study did not have a protocol or prespecified analysis plan. We began the analysis in 1999 for two reasons: First, reliable data on PM 2.5 throughout the USA became available in 1999, when the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) set up the Federal Method network of PM 2.5 monitors [29]. Second, the USA switched from the ninth revision to the tenth revision of the International Classification of Disease (ICD) system in 1999 [30]. Therefore, the post-1999 data use a consistent system of the assignment of the medical cause of death. Data sources We used data on deaths by sex, age, underlying cause of death, and county of residence from vital registration through the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/dvs_data_release.htm) and on population from the NCHS bridged-race data set (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/bridged_race.htm) from 1999 to 2015. From 1999 to 2015, there were a total of 41.9 million deaths in the contiguous USA; 18.4 million of these deaths were from cardiorespiratory diseases (ICD-10 codes beginning with I and J), for which there is strong evidence of an association with air pollution. Annual average PM 2.5 concentrations were from an integrated geographic regression model detailed elsewhere [31]. In summary, the modelling of PM 2.5 involved the application of a universal kriging approach to monitoring data and hundreds of geographic variables. The number of monitors that informed the estimates ranged from 599 in 1999 to 1,114 in 2002. There were more than 750 monitors for every year from 2000 to 2015. The variables in the model include population, elevation, vegetation, imperviousness, distance to traffic and other emission sources (for example, roads and intersections, railroad, airport, port, large point sources, etc.), and land use and cover (for example, forestland, rangeland, water, urban or built-up land divided into residential, commercial, etc.). The model also included satellite-derived estimates of particle pollution based on optical depth. The satellite-driven estimates help inform large-scale variability due to meteorological factors and regional sources, whereas the emissions and land use and land cover variables inform more localised concentration variability. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation by leaving out some of the monitoring data from the model, which are then compared with model prediction. Annual PM 2.5 concentrations were predicted for all years from 1999 to 2015 at all 2010 census block centroids in the contiguous USA and were aggregated by population-weighting to county level. The PM 2.5 concentrations can be downloaded freely through https://www.caces.us/data. We also gathered publicly available data on other county characteristics that may affect mortality: Per capita income ($), adjusted for inflation using the year 2000 as a baseline, from the CA1 data set from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (https://apps.bea.gov/regional/downloadzip.cfm) (used as log-transformed).

Percentage of population whose family income is below the poverty threshold, from the US Census Bureau’s Small-Area Income and Poverty Estimates data set (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/saipe/data/datasets.All.html).

Percentage of population who are of Black or African American race, through the NCHS bridged-race data set (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/bridged_race.htm).

Education, measured as percentage of population above the age of 25 years who have a high-school diploma or above, from the US Department of Agriculture (https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/county-level-data-sets/download-data/). The data set contained US Decennial Census data for 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000 and American Community Survey 5-year estimates for the period 2011 to 2015. We linearly interpolated between 1990 and 2000 data to estimate the percentage of the population who had graduated from high school for 1999. We similarly estimated values for each county for years from 2001 to 2010 by linearly interpolating between 2000 and 2011 data.

Unemployment, measured as percentage of population who are unemployed, calculated by dividing the number of people who are unemployed—available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (https://www.bls.gov/lau/)—by total county population.

Urbanicity, measured as percentage of population who live in urban areas, from the US Census Bureau’s decennial census data for 2000 and 2010 (https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml). We linearly interpolated between 2000 and 2010 data to estimate the percentage of population living in urban areas for 2001 to 2009. We used data from the year 2000 for 1999, and those from 2010 for 2011 to 2015.

Cumulative smoking, proxied by log-transformed age-standardised lung cancer death rates as in previous population-based analyses [1,32–34]. We calculated lung cancer death rates using the abovementioned deaths on lung cancer (ICD 10 codes C33 and C34) and population. We used lung cancer death rates because when smoking prevalence or intensity change, it is a better measure of the mortality risk than current levels [33]. Further, there are data on lung cancer death rates, but not on smoking prevalence, for every county and analysis year.

Temperature and relative humidity, from ERA-Interim (https://apps.ecmwf.int/datasets/data/interim-full-daily/levtype=sfc/), which combines predictions from a physical model with in situ and satellite measurements [35]. We used gridded 4-times-daily estimates at a resolution of 80 km to generate yearly temperature and relative humidity values by county throughout the analysis period. Units of analysis In 2015, there were 3,108 counties in the contiguous USA. Over time, some counties were merged or split to create new counties. To avoid inconsistent analysis units over time, such counties were combined for the entire analysis period in order to have an unambiguously consistent set of analysis units. This resulted in 3,082 nonoverlapping county units in the contiguous USA with consistent boundaries for the entire analysis period. The populations of these 3,082 counties from 1999 to 2015 ranged from 55 to 10,112,255. In small counties, some age groups had zero population in some years, which makes it impossible to calculate death rates. To avoid zero populations, we recursively merged counties with sex-specific populations smaller than 25,000 in any year with their neighbours until the populations in all sex-year combinations surpassed 25,000 in the newly formed county units. We merged counties without crossing state boundaries or combining urban and rural counties. We determined the urbanicity of each county from the NCHS’s Urban–Rural Classification Scheme for Counties in 2006 (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/urban_rural.htm), which divides counties into six categories—large central metro, large fringe metro, medium metro, small metro, micropolitan, and noncore—based on their population and overlap with metropolitan or micropolitan statistical areas. We considered counties categorised under the first four as urban counties and the last two as rural counties. Using this algorithm, we created a total of 1,339 county units that covered the entire contiguous USA that were used for statistical analyses described below. PM 2.5 concentrations for each of the constituent counties were population-weighted up to the level of the newly formed county units. The median absolute difference in PM 2.5 concentration between the merged counties and their constituents from 1999 to 2015 was 0.28 μg/m3. The sociodemographic, environmental, and mortality characteristics of the merged counties are summarised in Table 1. PPT PowerPoint slide

Summary statistics by percentile of social, environmental, and epidemiological characteristics of the merged county units used in the analysis. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002856.t001 Statistical methods We used four Bayesian spatiotemporal models, with different degrees of adjustment for county characteristics that may also affect mortality, to directly estimate the proportional (percent) increase in county-level age-specific death rates from cardiorespiratory diseases associated with the county’s annual PM 2.5 concentration. The four models had similar structures but differed in the extent of adjustment for county characteristics that may also influence mortality, as described below and shown in Table 2. For a given sex and age group, the number of deaths in each county in each year follows a Poisson distribution: PPT PowerPoint slide

Models used for relating county death rates to PM 2.5 concentrations. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002856.t002 In all four models, log-transformed death rates were modelled as a sum of components that depend on time and air pollution, with some models also including terms for other time-varying county characteristics. In this specification, the coefficient of the PM 2.5 term represents the logarithm of the proportional change in death rate for each unit additional PM 2.5 concentration, akin to proportional hazard models used in analyses of prospective cohorts. All models contained terms to capture the overall level and rate of change of mortality, with α 0 as the common intercept for log-transformed death rates and β 0 the common time slope. Nonlinear trends were captured by a first-order random walk ν year [36]. All models also included a term that relates log-transformed death rate to county PM 2.5 concentration, with the coefficient γ representing the logarithm of the rate ratio per 1 μg/m3 higher concentration. ε county−year is an overdispersion term that captures the variation unaccounted for by other terms in the model and is modelled as . The Unadjusted model had no adjustments for county-level characteristics and quantifies the observed association of county-level death rates with their PM 2.5 concentrations. The Covariate model adjusted for nine time-varying county-level covariates X i−county−year (i = 1…9) (per capita income; percentage of population whose family income is below the poverty threshold, who are of Black or African American race, who have graduated from high school, who live in urban areas, and who are unemployed; a proxy for cumulative smoking; and mean temperature and relative humidity) with associated covariate-specific slopes, θ i . This model is analogous to the approach used by cohort studies, which typically adjust for baseline characteristics. The Covariate-and-county model largely removed systematic variations in death rates and PM 2.5 concentration across counties through the use of county-specific random intercepts (α county ), hence implicitly adjusted for unobserved characteristics that systematically lead to higher or lower pollution and mortality in each county. In this model, the mortality effects of air pollution are mainly inferred through differential changes over time in death rates and PM 2.5 concentrations across counties, similar to the difference-in-difference model used in econometric analyses [1,25]. The Restrictive model included both county-specific random intercepts and random slopes (β county ), hence also implicitly adjusted for (linear) differential change in death rates and PM 2.5 concentrations across counties and relates changes in PM 2.5 concentration to changes in death rates after removing linear trends in mortality and pollution. By design, this model leaves limited spatial or temporal variation in death rates and estimates association with PM 2.5 based only on the mortality residual not explained by linear trends. We included the Restrictive model because not only might level of mortality in a county be affected by unobserved/unmeasured factors, but so might its trend. All county-specific random intercepts and slopes were modelled using a conditional autoregressive (CAR) structure that (empirically) allows for death rates to be more similar across neighbouring counties than those that are further away. We fitted the models using integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA), using the R-INLA software, which offers orders of magnitude of computational efficiency improvement in Bayesian inference compared to traditional MCMC for latent Gaussian models. As in previous work [37], weakly informative hyperpriors of logGamma(1, 0.001) were specified on the logarithm of the precisions of the random effects so that the parameter estimates were data driven. Computer code for the models is available through http://www.globalenvhealth.org/. Each model was applied to county-level cardiorespiratory death rates separately by sex and age group (5-year age groups from birth to 85 years and 85 years and older) because death rates vary by age group and sex, as might their associations with air pollution [38]. From each model, we estimated age-specific proportional increases in death rates (i.e., rate ratios) for each 1 μg/m3 of PM 2.5 (the rate ratios are the exponential of the coefficients of PM 2.5 ). We used the rate ratios from these models to calculate how many cardiorespiratory deaths in each five-year age group would be averted if PM 2.5 concentration in each county were the same as the lowest observed concentration (2.8 μg/m3, in Apache, Arizona). This value is similar to the 2.5–3.5 μg/m3 concentration used by the US EPA as a policy-relevant background level [39]. We conducted a similar analysis to calculate the number of averted deaths and life expectancy gain as a result of PM 2.5 reductions achieved from 1999 to 2015 by calculating the difference in the actual number of deaths in 1999 and those expected if PM 2.5 concentration in each county had been at its 2015 level. In all scenarios, national estimates were obtained by summing the number of averted deaths in each age group across counties. We used a lifetable to convert the estimated reduction in death rates that would be expected from lower concentrations to gain in life expectancy [32,40] at the county as well as national level. Specifically, we used the observed age-specific death rates to calculate life expectancy for each county or merged county unit, using standard lifetable techniques [40]. We calculated life expectancy under the counterfactual scenario of alternative PM 2.5 concentration by subtracting the number of deaths from cardiorespiratory diseases in each age group if PM 2.5 concentrations were at their alternative level from the observed number of deaths [32]. The difference between the observed and counterfactual life expectancy measures the contribution of PM 2.5 pollution to life expectancy loss. In calculating life expectancies, we used the Kannisto–Thatcher method to expand the terminal (85 years and older) age group of the life table [41]. We report national and county results using the Covariate-and-county model as our main results because it fully adjusts for county characteristics through inclusion of covariates and random intercepts without being overly restrictive. To understand the impact of adjustments on our results, we compare national results from the Covariate-and-county model with those of the other three models. Finally, we tested whether, after accounting for differences in PM 2.5 concentration, life expectancy loss depends on county sociodemographic characteristics including per capita income, percentage of population whose family income is below the poverty threshold, percentage who are of Black or African American race, and percentage who have graduated from high school. For this purpose, we used a regression with life expectancy loss in 2015 estimated from the Covariate-and-county model as the dependent variable and PM 2.5 concentration exceeding observed minimum of 2.8 μg/m3 and quintiles of each sociodemographic characteristic as independent variables. We report the difference between the first and fifth quintiles in Results.

Discussion In this direct national analysis of mortality and life expectancy loss due to PM 2.5 pollution, we estimate that current air pollution concentrations, which are relatively low by historical standards and mostly below the current national ambient air quality standard, are associated with a significant health burden after any reasonable control for other local determinants of mortality. The loss of longevity is larger in poorer counties, contributing to nationwide health inequalities. We also find that reductions in air pollution since 1999 have contributed to the longevity gains in the US population, with larger benefits especially in California and some southern states such as Alabama and Georgia, where PM 2.5 declined more than the national average. Two previous direct analyses of longevity loss due to air pollution in the USA focused on a subset of metro areas [1,25], largely before the current low concentrations were achieved, and hence are not directly comparable to our results. One study, using data from approximately 1980 to approximately 2000 from 211 counties in 51 metropolitan areas [1], found a life expectancy effect that was between the estimated effects of our Covariate-and-county and Covariate models. The other, using data from 2000 to 2007 in 545 counties, found a life expectancy effect similar to our Covariate-and-county model [25]. Neither study reported national or county-level life expectancy loss due to current pollution levels. Indirect estimate of life expectancy loss due to PM 2.5 in the USA, with use of pooled hazard ratios from prospective cohort studies, is 0.38 years [24], which is midway between the estimates from our Covariate-and-county and Covariate models. The main strength of our study is making direct estimates of the effects of PM 2.5 pollution on death rates of the contemporary US population, nationally and for all counties or clusters of small counties. We further stratified our results by county sociodemographic characteristics, which reveals the role of air pollution on life expectancy inequalities. We present results using a range of model specifications, which shows how different adjustments for time-varying county-level determinants of mortality influence the estimated effect of air pollution. Finally, and importantly, the data used in our analysis are publicly available, as is the computer code for our statistical models, making our analysis fully transparent and replicable by others. Our analysis also meets the recent requirement of being based on publicly available data sets [16,43]. The main limitation of our study, similar to other observational studies, is that it is not guaranteed for the observed associations to be causal. We did not have annual county-level data on other important determinants of mortality, such as healthcare access and quality and diet. These factors are nonetheless implicitly adjusted for in our Covariate-and-county model. In particular, air pollution is a mixture of different pollutants. Of these, PM 2.5 pollution has been consistently, independently, and coherently related to various diseases affected by air pollution [4,5,44,45]. Nonetheless, other pollutants, which may be partially correlated with PM 2.5 , may also have an effect. For example, the correlation coefficient between PM 2.5 and ozone was 0.55 and between PM 2.5 and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) 0.50 across all county-years in our analysis. Adjustment for ozone in the Covariate-and-county model led to slightly larger rate ratios for PM 2.5 , while adjustment for NO 2 dampened the rate ratios, as also seen in an analysis of the Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort [38]. However, according to the US EPA Integrated Science Assessment, current evidence is considered suggestive but not sufficient for a causal association between NO 2 and cardiovascular mortality [46]; for ozone, the evidence was evaluated as suggestive for total mortality but as limited for cardiovascular mortality [47]. As described in the analysis of the Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort, the impacts of these adjustments may be due to collinearity. Alternatively, it may be the case that some of the spatial variation in particle pollution that was not captured by the integrated geographic regression model is represented by ozone (typically aged or secondary, regional particle pollution) and/or NO 2 (fresh and local particle pollution) [38], even if neither is directly related to cardiovascular mortality. For these reasons, ‘the results of the multi-pollutant models should be interpreted with caution’ [38]. Because the hazardous effects of smoking depend not only on current cigarette use but also on past smoking behaviour, including age at smoking initiation, duration of smoking, and number of cigarettes smoked per day, we used lung cancer death rate as the proxy for the cumulative hazards of smoking in a population. Although lung cancer death rate is a robust proxy for the cumulative hazards of smoking [33,34], it is also affected by air pollution, albeit to a much smaller degree than smoking, and hence its use to control for smoking leads to somewhat conservative estimates of the effect of air pollution. Finally, the modelled PM 2.5 concentrations may have some error, which typically lowers the estimated effect of air pollution towards the null. In summary, public health policy and regulatory efforts in the USA have spurred technological innovations and contributed to reduced air pollution. Although the health benefits of large pollution reductions in major metropolitan areas in the twentieth century [1] are widely acknowledged, there is policy resistance to actions that would further lower the concentration of pollutants such as PM 2.5 , most recently through requirements that constrain the evaluation of health effects of air pollution to publicly available data sets [16,43]. Our direct national analysis of the mortality burden of PM 2.5 pollution, using publicly available data and with a range of analytical models, indicate that current PM 2.5 pollution continues to contribute to mortality and loss of longevity in the USA, with larger harms in poorer counties. Our results suggest that further lowering PM 2.5 pollution is likely to benefit the health of the entire US population, and lower health inequalities.

USDA rule would cut food stamp benefits for 3.1 million,https://www.boston.com,"['Carole Feldman', 'Ap']",07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2019/07/23/usda-rule-could-affect-food-stamp-eligibility-for-3-million,"WASHINGTON (AP) — About 3.1 million people would lose food stamp benefits under the Trump administration’s proposal to tighten automatic eligibility requirements for the food stamp program.

The Agriculture Department said Tuesday that the rule would close “a loophole” that enables people receiving only minimal benefits from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program to be eligible automatically for food stamps without undergoing further checks on their income or assets.

“For too long, this loophole has been used to effectively bypass important eligibility guidelines. Too often, states have misused this flexibility without restraint,” Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement.

The proposed rule is the latest in the Trump administration’s efforts to cut back on the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program or SNAP, the official name of the food stamp program. It also has proposed to tighten work requirements for those who receive federal food assistance.

USDA estimates that 1.7 million households — 3.1 million people — “will not otherwise meet SNAP’s income and asset eligibility prerequisites under the proposed rule.” That would result in a net savings of about $9.4 billion over five years.

An unpublished version of the proposed rule acknowledges the impact, saying it “may also negatively impact food security and reduce the savings rates among those individuals who do not meet the income and resource eligibility requirements for SNAP or the substantial and ongoing requirements for expanded categorical eligibility.”

Democrats in Congress were quick to condemn the proposal.

House Speaker Nancy Pelsoi said it was “the administration’s latest act of staggering callousness” while Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said he would “fight to make sure these cuts never become a reality.”

Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., said the administration was trying anew to circumvent Congress and that the effect would be to “take food away from families, prevent children from getting school meals, and make it harder for states to administer food assistance.”

Congress has rejected previous, similar attempts to change the expanded automatic eligibility provisions, most recently during the farm bill debate in 2018.

Robert Greenstein, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said the proposal could discourage working families with incomes close to the maximum for SNAP participation from seeking more work out of fear that the added wages could make them ineligible for the program.

“The proposed rule would weaken SNAP’s role in supporting work while making it harder for families that struggle to get by on low wages to meet their basic needs,” he said.

About 36 million people participated in SNAP in April 2019, down from more than 38 million a year earlier.

Under current law, states may automatically make people eligible for food stamps, if they meet income and other requirements for TANF. USDA says 43 states have expanded that to include households that it says “barely participate” in TANF. The provision is called “expanded categorical eligibility.”

USDA said the policy has resulted in people receiving food stamps who don’t need it and wouldn’t qualify under regular program rules.

Ellen Vollinger, legal director of the Food Research & Action Center, said the proposal was troubling and that the government should “put attention on how to help more people, not undercut supports for them and make their struggle against hunger even harder.”

She said the department didn’t seem to address a resulting loss of school meals, which she said the Congressional Budget Office included in its analyses of previous, similar proposals. “It’s another hit on hunger,” she said.

Under the proposal, to qualify for automatic eligibility, people would have to get at least $50 a month in benefits from TANF for a minimum of six months.

Perdue said the change is necessary for “preventing abuse of a critical safety net system so those who need food assistance the most are the only ones who receive it.”

The rule, expected to be published in the Federal Register on Wednesday, is open for public comment for 60 days.

The rank hypocrisy of Trump’s treatment of the national debt as president,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Philip Bump', 'National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics', 'July At Pm']",07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/07/23/rank-hypocrisy-trumps-treatment-national-debt-president/,"Exactly eight years to the day before President Trump announced that he would agree to a deal increasing spending and lifting the debt ceiling, Trump decided to highlight President Barack Obama’s budget hypocrisy.

""Increasing America’s debt weakens us domestically and internationally."" - US Senator @BarackObama, 2007 — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 22, 2011

That was what Obama said in 2006, the 2011 version of Trump pointed out — yet here Obama was, overseeing one of the largest expansions of the debt in history! Can you believe it?

In fact, on at least 190 days from 2011 until the 2016 election, Trump complained about the size of the annual deficit or the overall debt, according to a Washington Post analysis of Factba.se’s archive of Trump comments.

Those comments were clustered: A lot as the 2012 election loomed and Trump was boosting Mitt Romney’s presidential candidacy. A lot as the 2016 campaign approached and Trump mentioned the issue frequently to disparage Democratic leadership.



(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)

What’s he done since? Well, he’s added to the debt consistently. Granted, the growth of the national debt has been slower under Trump (in both dollars and percentage) than it was under Obama. But then, Obama was also spending federal money to combat the effects of the recession.



(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)

If we look at the growth of the debt during the last few years of Obama’s presidency, the picture is different. Over the equivalent time period in Obama’s second term compared with Trump’s current one, the two presidents oversaw an accrual of debt that’s about even.



(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)

It’s not just that Trump disparaged the debt when Obama was president. He often did so in ways that hyped his own ability to deal with the problem or disparaged Obama in particularly personal ways. He disparaged Republicans for allowing the debt ceiling to be raised and criticized them for not using the debt ceiling for leverage.

Some examples:

Congress is back.TIME TO CUT, CAP AND BALANCE.There is no revenue problem.The Debt Limit cannot be raised until Obama spending is contained. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 6, 2011

On Monday, Trump agreed to raise the debt limit without “containing” spending.

That, despite having once tweeted this:

I cannot believe the Republicans are extending the debt ceiling—I am a Republican & I am embarrassed! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 23, 2013

He also liked to compare the ballooning debt with Obama’s purported profligacy.

With a record deficit and $15 trillion in debt, @BarackObama is spending $4 million of our money on his Hawaii vacation. Just plain wrong. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 19, 2011

As president, Trump has spent at least $64 million traveling to Mar-a-Lago alone — with debt topping $22 trillion. At another point, he complained about the cost of a $1 million trip taken by Michelle Obama, a figure that’s less than a third of a Mar-a-Lago jaunt.

In an extended tweet, Trump disparaged Obama personally as he mocked the president’s raising of the debt ceiling.

“He is destroying our country: @BarackObama has requested to raise our debt limit to over $16.4Trillion by the end of his first term. @BarackObama himself said he was lazy. For a lazy person he certainly has done a lot of destruction to our country.""

He repeatedly pointed out Obama’s apparent hypocrisy in opposing increases in the debt.

Bush was called ""unpatriotic"" by @BarackObama in '07 for adding $4T to debt http://t.co/j02vneW0 @BarackObama increased it $6T in 3 years. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 16, 2012

Trump has increased it more than $2 trillion in 2½ years.

At one point, he explained to someone on Twitter how long it would take him to fix the debt.

""@AdrianDemers: @realDonaldTrump if you were the President how long would it take for you to erase the U.S. Debt Deficit?"" Not very long! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 24, 2013

At another point, he said that getting the country out of debt would be “easy.” The day before he announced his candidacy for the presidency, another retweet.

""@TimWByrd: DonaldTrump i have so much faith in you that if you ran for president I know your the only one who could get America out of debt — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 14, 2015

During the debt crisis in Greece, Trump predicted that the United States would be next.

“When you hit $24 trillion, and we’re going to be there very soon, because it’s building up very quickly . . . when we hit that $24 trillion number, we become Greece on steroids,” he said in August 2015. “I mean, we have a lot of problems in this country.”

The United States is on pace to hit $24 trillion by the end of 2020.

During the campaign, he offered a lot of ways in which he would reduce the debt, like growth in the economy or expanded energy production. Needless to say, these plans have either not come to fruition or have not reduced the debt significantly.

In May 2014, Trump disparaged the state of the country in terms that would probably have inspired fury if said now by a Democrat in Congress.

Have you ever seen our country look weaker or more pathetic: Snowden, ObamaCare, VA, Russia, jobs, decimated military, debt and so much more — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 29, 2014

Included in his complaints? The debt, then about $5 trillion less than it is now.

At other points, Trump used various statistics to demonstrate just how badly Obama was managing the debt. Given that the debt grew substantially during Obama’s first years in office, Trump generally compares favorably with Obama on these metrics — but in each case, the situation has nonetheless gotten worse, not better.

Hope & Change--since @BarackObama has taken office, the US debt has increased by an average of $64K per taxpayer. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 25, 2012

Based on a figure of 140.9 million taxpayers (what it was in 2016), the debt has increased by $14,700 per taxpayer under Trump.

Trump has been president for about 1.03 percent of our history (using the signing of the Declaration of Independence as a start date) and has accrued 9.4 percent of the total debt.

The figure cited in that article for the total debt accrued by the start of World War II is about $91 billion. There have been four days during Trump’s presidency — Sept. 8, 2017; Oct. 2, 2017; Feb. 9, 2018; and Dec. 31, 2018 — when the debt has increased by more than that amount. Generally, this was a function of the debt limit being increased after a debate on Capitol Hill.

At a campaign event in 2016, Trump announced that “the new debt added under Obama and Clinton would have been enough to pay off all the outstanding student loans in the United States 6 times over.” Since he’s taken office, the increase has been enough to pay off all student debt 1.3 times over.

Then there’s this one.

America's debt officially became 100% of our GDP on @BarackObama's 50th birthday---coincidence? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 4, 2011

Under Trump, it’s never been under that figure.

There are any number of experiments that would be interesting to conduct if one had access to a portal into alternate dimensions. One would be to see how Trump would have responded on Twitter if the United States had elected a Democrat in 2016 and that person had performed in precisely the same way that Trump has as president.

My guess is that he would not be thrilled."

Government confirms probe of major tech companies

The Department of Justice (DOJ) confirmed after market hours today that it is actively reviewing the business activities of the top names in U.S. technology.

In a press release, the DOJ said its goal in this is to ""assess the competitive conditions in the online marketplace in an objective and fair-minded manner and to ensure Americans have access to free markets in which companies compete on the merits to provide services that users want.""

It added, ""If violations of law are identified, the Department will proceed appropriately to seek redress.""

Although the DOJ did not name any companies in particular in its release, speculation is rife that it is specifically interested in Alphabet, Amazon.com, Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), and Apple. For years, all four have faced accusations that they stifle competition and restrict consumer choice.

The DOJ's press release signifies a stronger effort in this regard than had previously been indicated. Meanwhile, a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) push in this direction has already led to a settlement, a roughly $5 billion pact with Facebook over that company's approach to user privacy.

Although shares of the mentioned companies took a hit when the DOJ's press release was made public, they seem to be recovering. For example, Facebook stock is down only 1.5% from its closing price earlier today.

Chipotle Q2 crushes on EPS

Chipotle is one stock that has seen serious ups, downs, and controversies over the past few years. Just now, though, it's one of the top gainers in after-hours trading following the release of its Q2 of fiscal 2019 results after market close.

Those results were particularly encouraging on the bottom line, on which the company posted a non-GAAP (adjusted) profit of just under $113 million ($3.99 per share). That $113 million was a meaty 41% higher on a year-over-year basis. Revenue, meanwhile, rose by 13% to $1.4 billion on the back of same-restaurant sales that improved by 10%.

Chipotle attributed these significant improvements to ""better restaurant operations, more effective marketing, and leveraging our digital make line to grow sales and expand access.""

The company's revenue was broadly in line with analyst expectations. However, these forecasters were expecting only $3.74 in adjusted earnings per share (EPS).

Chipotle updated its comparable-sales guidance. For the whole of fiscal 2019 it now expects high-single-digit growth in the key metric; previously it anticipated that would land in the mid- to high-single-digit range. The company did not provide revenue or net profit estimates.

Investors like those double-digit improvements in fundamentals, and they like that clear earnings beat. They're currently trading the shares up by 3%.

Visa Q3 tops revenue, earnings estimates

In what's becoming so commonplace as to be traditional these days, Visa's (NYSE: V) freshly released quarterly earnings topped analyst projections for both revenue and profitability.

Lindsey Graham says his 'deep dive' investigation of DOJ and FBI will include Papadopoulos testimony,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/lindsey-graham-says-his-deep-dive-investigation-of-doj-and-fbi-will-include-papadopoulos-testimony,"Republican South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said Tuesday that his “deep dive” into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation would include testimony from former Trump campaign associate George Papadopoulos, whose interactions with the mysterious Joseph Mifsud allegedly led to the FBI opening an inquiry into Trump in July 2016.

Papadopoulos was swept up in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, and he ultimately pleaded guilty about lying to investigators.

Graham, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said his committee “will be looking at the counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign.”

“We will call Papadopoulos and we will find out what happened,” Graham promised.

Graham said he would wait until the completion of the investigation by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz into possible abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The allegations of abuse are related to the Justice Department and the FBI using a salacious and unverified dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele to surveil a member of the Trump campaign.

Steele had been hired by the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which itself had been hired by the Clinton campaign and the DNC through the Perkins Come law firm, facts which were not revealed to the FISA Court.

Trump granted Attorney General William Barr broad declassification authority, and Barr selected U.S. Attorney John Durham to be his right-hand man in a separate inquiry into why and how the Justice Department and the FBI launched an investigation into Trump.

“We’ll wait on Mr. Horowitz to do his report about the FISA warrant abuse,” Graham said. “But we’ll take a deep dive into the 2016 surveillance by the FBI and other organizations and campaigns to make sure we know what we’re doing and that there are protocols in place to ensure that we don’t play politics with the law.”

In recent days, Graham has been shedding more light on what his own follow-up investigation is going to look like, saying last week that he had questions for former FBI Director James Comey about his handling of the dossier, for former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe about the importance of the dossier in the FISA applications, and for Papadopoulos about whether he was really trying to make inroads with the Russians.

Papadopoulos pleaded guilty in October 2017 to making false statements to the FBI about his contacts with Mifsud and served just 12 days in federal prison late last year. He is now on supervised release.

""I’m going to deep-dive into how this stuff started,” Graham said last weekend. “How could it go so far if there was no collusion?” Graham said that the probe by the Justice Department and the FBI into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia that began under President Obama was a “politicized investigation.”"

EPA to phase-out Freon in 2020 and replace it with Puron

SIOUX FALLS, SD— There is a change in the air.

Beginning January 1st, the EPA will phase-out the refrigerant R-22, better known as Freon.

Instead, it’ll be replaced by Puron or R410A.

Experts say it’s more environmentally friendly.

“The ozone depletion level of R410A was much less than R22. So, it acted as a refrigerant to replace R22,” said Mark Lamb, service manager for Frisbee’s.

According to Lamb, the air conditioning industry has been preparing for the change for about 5 years.

With R22 being phased out, the price of the refrigerant is going to increase significantly.

“If you have a component built with the R22 system, you’re always going to have to replace R22 back in the system. It’s going to be a much higher cost than R410A,” said Lamb.

In order to tell which refrigerant your air conditioner takes, that can be found on the side of the unit.

Meanwhile, switching to the new system could cost anywhere between $3,000 to $5,000.

But Lamb says that’s still the cheaper route.

Whatever option you choose, you don’t want to mix Freon and Puron.

“At that point, if that did happen and your refrigerants did mix, we would have to take it to a refrigerant recycling company, and they have to actually destroy the refrigerant because they can’t separate,” said Lamb.

If you aren’t sure which refrigerant you have, you should reach out to an HVAC service provider for help."
Justice Department investigating whether Utah A.G.'s Office falsely obtained federal grants,https://www.ksl.com,"['Dennis Romboy', 'Ksl', 'Posted - Jul']",,,,https://www.ksl.com/article/46599809/justice-department-investigating-whether-utah-ags-office-falsely-obtained-federal-grants,"SALT LAKE CITY — The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating whether several state criminal justice agencies, including the Utah Attorney General’s Office, made false statements to obtain federal grants.

The investigation came to light in a recent court filing by the DOJ Office of Inspector General asking a federal judge to force the state to turn over records it has refused to provide.

The DOJ served a subpoena on an assistant Utah attorney general on April 2, but the state has yet to comply, according to documents filed last week in U.S. District Court in Salt Lake City.

“The purpose of the subpoena is to determine whether respondent failed to meet its legal and contractual responsibilities when executing grants with the Department of Justice,” the filing says.

Federal investigators contend the attorney general’s office, Utah Department of Public Safety, Utah Administrative Office of the Courts, Utah Commission on Criminal and Juvenile Justice and Utah Juvenile Justice Services falsely represented job losses due to budget cuts in order to obtain grant funding from 2009 to 2013, according to court documents.

Investigators also allege the state agencies made false certifications of compliance with federal mandates, resulting in them receiving money to which they were not entitled.

In a statement late Monday, the attorney general's office said the case involves conduct that predates Attorney General Sean Reyes and his current leadership team.

“It involves allegations related to numerous state agencies. As part of its constitutional duties, the Utah AGO is representing those agencies in this matter,"" the statement indicated. “The Utah AGO has cooperated with the OIG investigation to the maximum extent allowable under legal and ethical rules and has been following strict orders of this court not to disclose anything publicly.”

“In fact, the federal court overseeing this matter issued an order/gave explicit instructions that our office could not discuss in public/with the media the substantive issues in this case.”

The statement affirmed the attorney general's office does not believe the comment issued Monday was a violation of the instruction not to speak publicly.

The federal court overseeing this matter issued an order/gave explicit instructions that our office could not discuss in public/with the media the substantive issues in this case.

The investigation started in January 2015. Specifically at issue is whether the state supplanted or used federal funds to replace money the state had already appropriated for the same purpose, according to a declaration by Cynthia Roberts, a special agent in the DOJ Inspector General's Office.

Roberts' declaration says the records are needed to ascertain whether the state used the funds appropriately.

The grants came through the DOJ’s Bureau of Justice Assistance and the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, including money for the attorney general’s Internet Crimes Against Children task force. The other state agencies received money from the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program, court documents show.

The federal programs administer grants for state and local governments to reduce violent and drug-related crime, support law enforcement, help crime victims and develop initiatives for juveniles.

The subpoena seeks job creation and retention records, personnel records for workers funded by the grants, documents on hiring and employee transfers and communications regarding complaints, objections inquiries regard job creation retention. It required the state to provide the documents by April 29, but the attorney general’s office “failed to produce a single document,"" the court filing says.

Federal investigators contacted the attorney general’s office “numerous” times by phone and email. The requests were met with promises to produce documents, but no documents have ever been produced, according to the court filing.

The attorney general's office ""repeatedly"" told investigators that various employees were gathering the documents but for some reason were not able to finish the task.

“Because of the importance of the Inspector General’s investigation, the United States requests this court summarily enforce the subpoena,” the filing says.

Using the VA Mission Act to justify raising federal spending levels is bad for veterans and taxpayers,https://thehill.com,[],07-22-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/454156-using-the-va-mission-act-to-justify-raising-federal-spending,"Earlier this month, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin demanding that an additional $22 billion above current federal spending levels be included in any deal to raise the debt limit in order to pay for new private health care options created by the VA MISSION Act - the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care reform law signed by President Donald Trump Donald John Trump5 things to know about Boris Johnson Conservatives erupt in outrage against budget deal Trump says Omar will help him win Minnesota MORE but which was opposed by Pelosi. This requested increase comes in spite of the fact the 2019 VA budget is just under $200 billion under current non-defense spending levels, which is more than double what the VA budget was over a decade ago. The extraordinary increase in the VA budget has far outpaced the growth of patients and beneficiaries and has occurred during a decline in the overall veteran population.

Ensuring veterans get the care and benefits they earned is a critical part of the social contract our country has made with those who put their lives on the line in our defense. It is therefore vital to our national security to have a properly funded VA. But there is a difference between providing the resources the VA needs to accomplish its mission and raising federal budget levels to spend billions more on the VA without a meaningful assessment of whether those additional funds are needed.

Unfortunately, Congress has too often taken the latter approach, to the detriment of veterans and American taxpayers alike.

In 2014, it was revealed that veterans across the country were dying on secret lists while waiting for VA health care. Some ardent defenders of the VA claimed the long wait times for care were a result of lack of funding. But the Obama administration had massively increased the VA’s budget in the previous five years – growing more than $50 billion from 2009 to 2014. In the aftermath of the 2014 scandal, Congress passed and President Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaConservative former NFL player says Trump met with him to discuss 'black America' Using the VA Mission Act to justify raising federal spending levels is bad for veterans and taxpayers Trump struggles to win over voters reaping economic boom MORE signed into law a measure that gave the VA another $15 billion increase. In subsequent years the VA budget would continue to grow, reaching its current level of nearly $200 billion.

Despite the influx of resources, veterans continued to die on wait lists and receive poor quality care. The reason is simple: Congress and prior presidential administrations refused to thoroughly address systemic issues within the VA that wasted money and hindered its health care delivery. They chose the easier path of just writing the VA a bigger check.

For example, as of 2017, most of the VA’s medical facilities were more than 50 years old. Considering the shrinking size and changing demographics of the veteran population, most of these facilities are not in the best locations to provide the best and most convenient care. Many VA hospitals are operating either at significant under-capacity or over-capacity. For primarily political reasons, Congress prevented the VA from shifting infrastructure resources to account for this dynamic. Instead, the agency has been forced to spend billions maintaining aging and underutilized facilities.

Fortunately, the VA MISSION Act included provisions mandating the VA undertake an infrastructure review to ensure that funds for facilities are spent to best serve veterans and not wasted on unnecessary or outdated buildings. Additionally, the law consolidated the VA’s community care programs and greatly expanded health care choice for veterans. Unlike many past efforts effort to reform the VA, the VA MISSION Act took a different approach then just simply spending more money – it fundamentally changed how the VA delivers health care to veterans.

The current overall federal spending levels provide more than enough budgetary flexibility to pay for any additional expenses incurred by the implementation of the VA MISSION Act. Further raising spending levels to provide additional money for the already-funded VA MISSION Act, as Pelosi is demanding, would set a bad precedent while also disincentivizing further reforms within the VA that would reduce waste and improve care for our veterans.

No one wants to shortchange those who sacrificed in service of our country. But as recent history has shown, simply dumping more money into the VA without real reform serves neither our veterans nor taxpayers. With a $22 trillion national debt posing a growing threat to our national security, additional unnecessary spending puts at risk the future of the very country our veterans fought to defend.

Homeland Security’s cuts in counterterrorism programs assailed,https://www.latimes.com,"['Staff Writer', 'David Willman Is A Reporter For The Los Angeles Times Based In Washington']",07-22-2019,2019,7,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2019-07-22/trump-administration-counterterrorism-cutbacks-criticized,"A senior House member said Monday that he will explore legislation to prevent the Department of Homeland Security from diverting funds from critical research and programs on tracking nuclear material that could be used in a terrorist attack.

Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank), who heads the House Intelligence Committee, said that the gutting of programs intended to thwart potential terrorist attacks involving weapons of mass destruction over the last two years was a “dereliction of duty” and has put the nation at greater risk of potential catastrophic attack.

A recently published Times investigative report revealed that multiple WMD-related programs have been cut back sharply or eliminated since 2017 at Homeland Security, which has primary domestic responsibility for helping authorities identify and block chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats.

“Reducing staffing and capabilities to respond to WMD attacks, including nuclear terrorism, is shortsighted at best, and could be devastating in the event of an attack,” Schiff said in a statement.

According to an aide, Schiff is considering a legislative remedy within Homeland Security’s pending congressional appropriation.

Schiff sponsored legislation in 2010 that authorized the creation of the National Technical Nuclear Forensics Center at Homeland Security to strengthen detection and tracing capabilities that might deter a hostile foreign state from slipping radiological or nuclear material to terrorists.

Over the last two years, the center’s leadership has left and its staff has shrunk from about 14 to three, one of multiple shifts and cutbacks in the counterterrorism programs at Homeland Security.

“That the Trump administration is letting that capability wither away ... is a dereliction of duty,” Schiff said in a written statement.

Among the programs affected was an elite Homeland Security “red team,” which previously conducted dozens of drills and assessments each year to help federal, state and local officials detect such potential threats as an improvised nuclear device concealed in a suitcase, or a cargo ship carrying a radiation-spewing dirty bomb.

Another Homeland Security unit had helped lead up to 20 WMD-related training exercises each year with state and local authorities. The unit participated in fewer than 10 such exercises last year and even fewer so far this year.

The department’s International Cooperation Division, which worked closely with foreign counterparts and the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency to track and stop the smuggling of dangerous nuclear materials overseas, has been disbanded.

In an interview Sunday, John Roth, who served as Homeland Security’s inspector general from 2014 to 2017, said that the reported shifts and cutbacks merit congressional scrutiny.

“My recommendation would be rigorous oversight hearings and investigations of what’s going on,” said Roth, a former federal prosecutor and Justice Department official.

The WMD-related cutbacks and shifts have been directed by James F. McDonnell, whom President Trump appointed to successive Homeland Security positions in 2017 and 2018.

McDonnell declined through a spokeswoman to be interviewed about the changes, and Homeland Security did not answer written questions about the matter. The department didn’t respond to a request for comment Monday regarding Schiff’s remarks.

Roth said he believes the WMD-related developments likely stem from turmoil at the top of Homeland Security. Since taking office, Trump has gone through two secretaries of Homeland Security and the department now is led by an acting secretary.

Several other top-level appointive positions at Homeland Security remain unfilled, including the deputy secretary and the undersecretary for management.

“When you have significant vacancies in key leadership positions,” Roth said, “you’re basically going to get people who do whatever they want, and aren’t being held accountable.”

The Times reported that $162.2 million — about 40% of the money Congress appropriated last year for the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office, which McDonnell heads — went unspent. That should be a “huge red flag” to Homeland Security’s most senior leaders, Roth said.

“Every dollar obligated to one component is unavailable to others,” Roth noted. “I would be asking some hard questions.”"
How Mueller deputy Andrew Weissmann's offer to an oligarch could boomerang on DOJ,https://thehill.com,[],07-22-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/454185-how-mueller-deputy-andrew-weissmanns-offer-to-an-oligarch-could-boomerang,"The ink was still drying on special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerThis week: Mueller dominates chaotic week on Capitol Hill Top Republican considered Mueller subpoena to box in Democrats Kamala Harris says her Justice Dept would have 'no choice' but to prosecute Trump for obstruction MORE’s appointment papers when his chief deputy, the famously aggressive and occasionally controversial prosecutor Andrew Weissmann, made a bold but secret overture in early June 2017.

Weissmann quietly reached out to the American lawyers for Ukrainian oligarch Dmitry Firtash with a tempting offer: Give us some dirt on Donald Trump Donald John Trump5 things to know about Boris Johnson Conservatives erupt in outrage against budget deal Trump says Omar will help him win Minnesota MORE in the Russia case, and Team Mueller might make his 2014 U.S. criminal charges go away.

The specifics of the never-before-reported offer were confirmed to me by multiple sources with direct knowledge, as well as in contemporaneous defense memos I read.

ADVERTISEMENT

Two years later, Weissmann’s overture may have far-reaching consequences for the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), here and abroad. His former boss, Mueller, is slated to testify Wednesday before Congress.

The DOJ, Mueller’s office and Weissmann did not immediately respond to emails requesting comment on Monday.

At first blush, one might ask, “What’s the big deal?” It’s not unusual for federal prosecutors to steal a page from Monty Hall’s “Let’s Make a Deal” script during plea negotiations.

But Weissmann’s overture was wrapped with complexity and intrigue far beyond the normal federal case, my sources indicate.

At the time, pressure was building inside the DOJ and the FBI to find smoking-gun evidence against Trump in the Russia case because the Steele dossier — upon which the early surveillance warrants were based — was turning out to be an uncorroborated mess. (“There’s no big there there,” lead FBI agent Pete Strzok texted a few days before Weissmann’s overture.)

Likewise, key evidence that the DOJ used to indict Firtash on corruption charges in 2014 was falling apart. Two central witnesses were in the process of recanting testimony, and a document the FBI portrayed as bribery evidence inside Firtash’s company was exposed as a hypothetical slide from an American consultant’s PowerPoint presentation, according to court records I reviewed.

ADVERTISEMENT

In other words, the DOJ faced potential embarrassment in two high-profile cases when Weissmann made an unsolicited approach on June 4, 2017, that surprised even Firtash’s U.S. legal team.

To some, the offer smacked of being desperately premature. Mueller was appointed just two weeks earlier, did not even have a full staff selected, and was still getting up to speed on the details of the investigation. So why rush to make a deal when the prosecution team still was being selected, some wondered.

Second, Weissmann’s approach was audaciously aggressive, even for a prosecutor with his reputation.

According to a defense memo recounting Weissmann’s contacts, the prosecutor claimed the Mueller team could “resolve the Firtash case” in Chicago and neither the DOJ nor the Chicago U.S. Attorney’s Office “could interfere with or prevent a solution,” including withdrawing all charges. “The complete dropping of the proceedings … was doubtless on the table,” according to the defense memo.

Firtash’s team suspected Weissmann’s claim was exaggerated. While Mueller had full authority to investigate the Russia case, he wasn’t an independent counsel separate of the DOJ but, rather, a special counsel subject to the attorney general’s oversight.

The third red flag came in how much Weissmann communicated to Firstash’s lawyers about his hopes for the Ukrainian oligarch’s testimony.

Prosecutors in plea deals typically ask a defendant for a written proffer of what they can provide in testimony and identify the general topics that might interest them. But Weissmann appeared to go much further in a July 7, 2017, meeting with Firtash’s American lawyers and FBI agents, sharing certain private theories of the nascent special counsel’s investigation into Trump, his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort Paul John ManafortHow Mueller deputy Andrew Weissmann's offer to an oligarch could boomerang on DOJ Ukrainian officials and Giuliani are sharing back-channel campaign information: report Key numbers to know for Mueller's testimony MORE and Russia, according to defense memos.

For example, Firtash’s legal team wrote that Weissmann told them he believed a company called Bayrock, tied to former FBI informant Felix Sater, had “made substantial investments with Donald Trump’s companies” and that prosecutors were looking for dirt on Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner Jared Corey KushnerHow Mueller deputy Andrew Weissmann's offer to an oligarch could boomerang on DOJ Trump talks to Swedish leader about rapper A$AP Rocky, offers to vouch for his bail Trump: 'We already started' talks to get A$AP Rocky home from Sweden MORE.

Weissmann told the Firtash team “he believes that Manafort and his people substantially coordinated their activities with Russians in order to win their work in Ukraine,” according to the defense memos. And the Mueller deputy said he “believed” a Ukrainian group tied to Manafort “was merely a front for illegal criminal activities in Ukraine,” and suggested a “Russian secret service authority” may have been involved in influencing the 2016 U.S. election, the defense memos show.

Weissmann’s private observations and sharing of prosecutor’s theories went beyond what prosecutors normally do in proffer negotiations and risked planting ideas that could lead the witness to craft his testimony, according to legal experts I consulted.

Remarkably, Firtash turned down Weissmann’s plea overtures even though the oligarch has been trapped in Austria for five years, fighting extradition on U.S. charges in Chicago alleging that he engaged in bribery and corruption in India related to a U.S. aerospace deal. He denies the charges.

The oligarch’s defense team told me that Firtash rejected the deal because he didn’t have credible information or evidence on the topics Weissmann outlined.

But now, as Firtash escalates his fight to avoid extradition, the Weissmann overture is being offered to an Austrian court as potential defense evidence that the DOJ’s prosecution is flawed by bogus evidence and political motivations.

In a sealed court filing in Austria earlier this month, Firtash’s legal team compared the DOJ’s 13-year investigation of Firtash to the medieval inquisitions. It cited Weissmann’s overture as evidence of political motivation, saying the prosecutor dangled the “possible cessation of separate criminal proceedings against the applicant if he were prepared to exchange sufficiently incriminating statements for wide-ranging comprehensively political subject areas which included the U.S. President himself as well as the Russian President Vladimir Putin Vladimir Vladimirovich PutinDemocrats, advocacy groups urge Pompeo to abolish new 'unalienable rights' commission How Mueller deputy Andrew Weissmann's offer to an oligarch could boomerang on DOJ Key Merkel ally set to test Trump amid tensions with Europe MORE.”

After years of litigation, the U.S. Justice Department won a ruling in Austria to secure Firtash’s extradition to Chicago. But then his legal team secretly filed new evidence that included the Weissmann overture, and Austrian officials suddenly reversed course last week and ordered a new, lengthy delay in extradition.

That new court filing asserts that two key witnesses, cited by the DOJ in its extradition request as affirming the bribery allegations against Firtash, since have recanted, claiming the FBI grossly misquoted them and pressured them to sign their statements. One witness claims his 2012 statement to the FBI was “prewritten by the U.S. authorities” and contains “relevant inaccuracies in substance,” including that he never used the terms “bribery or bribe payments” as DOJ claimed, according to the Austrian court filing.

That witness also claimed he only signed the 2012 statement because the FBI “exercised undue pressure on him,” including threats to seize his passport and keep him from returning home to India, the memo alleges. That witness recanted his statements the same summer as Weissmann’s overture to Firtash’s team.

Firtash’s lawyers also offered the Austrian court evidence of alleged prosecutorial wrongdoing.

A key document submitted to Austrian authorities to support Firtash’s extradition was portrayed by DOJ as having come from Firtash’s corporate files and purported to show he sanctioned a bribery scheme in India. In fact, the document was created by the McKinsey consulting firm as part of a hypothetical ethics presentation for the Boeing Co. and had no connection to Firtash’s firm.

Moreover, McKinsey claims in an official statement that it had no knowledge of a bribery scheme by Firtash, and the PowerPoint’s use of the phrase “bribery payments” never came from Firtash or his company and were, instead, hypothetical “assumptions by McKinsey about standard business practices in India,” according to the new Austrian court filing.

Firtash’s U.S. legal team told me it alerted Weissmann to DOJ’s false portrayal of the McKinsey document in 2017, but he downplayed the concerns and refused to alert the Austrian court. The document was never withdrawn as evidence, even after the New York Times published a story last December questioning its validity.

“Submitting a false and misleading document to a foreign sovereign and its courts for an extradition decision is not only unethical but also flouts the comity of trust necessary for that process where judicial systems rely only on documents to make that decision,” Firtash’s American legal team wrote in a statement to me. “DOJ’s refusal to rescind the document after being specifically told it is false and misleading is an egregious violation of U.S. and international law.”

Weissmann long has been a favorite target of conservatives, in part because his earlier work as a prosecutor in the Enron case was overturned unanimously by the U.S. Supreme Court because of overly aggressive prosecutorial tactics. Former DOJ official Sidney Powell strongly condemned Weissmann’s past work as a prosecutor in “Licensed to Lie,” a book critical of DOJ’s pressure tactics.

It is now clear that Weissmann’s overture to a Ukrainian oligarch in the summer of 2017 is about to take on new significance in Washington, where Mueller is about to testify, and in Austria, where Firtash’s extradition fight has taken a new twist.

Is your Houston water bill too high? A $2B EPA sewer mandate won’t help.,https://www.houstonchronicle.com,"['Mike Morris', 'City Hall Reporter', 'Houston Chronicle', 'Follow Mike On', 'Http', 'Past Articles This Author', 'Erin Douglas', 'Sergio Chapa', 'Staff Writer', 'James Osborne']",07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Is-your-Houston-water-bill-too-high-A-2B-EPA-14117979.php,"Houston is facing a federal mandate to upgrade its embattled sanitary sewer system, stirring concerns among advocates and civic leaders that the estimated $2 billion bill — and the higher rates required to pay it — could overburden low-income families.

The average city sewer bill already exceeds what the Environmental Protection Agency considers affordable for more than 113,500 Houston families, Houston Public Works and Census Bureau data show. That could rise to more than a quarter of all Houston households if sewer costs increase by 19 percent.

Such a hike is unlikely to happen overnight, but the average city water bill has risen 17 percent in the last six years via annual increases for inflation alone.

Mayor Sylvester Turner has not said how much bills are expected to rise as a result of the consent decree, citing a pending rate study, but repeatedly has said costs will remain “well below” the EPA threshold.

Experts, however, say that guideline — which aims to keep annual sewer charges below 2 percent of the citywide median household income — has been “discredited” in large part because it obscures the burden on poor families.

In Houston, for instance, sewer charges could more than double and still remain below the EPA threshold. That is in part because the city’s rates today are modest: A 2017 American Water Works Association report ranked Houston’s average bills and their affordability roughly in the middle of the nation’s 25 largest cities.

“The intellectual case for using median household income as the exclusive determinant of affordability has collapsed,” said Tracy Mehan, AWWA director of government affairs. “What about the employment rate? What about the 50 percent of the population that’s ignored at median levels?”

Adam Krantz, CEO of the National Association of Clean Water Agencies, of which Houston is a member, agreed.

“There is really very little underpinning that 2 percent,” he said. “That being said, it’s what has driven consent decrees in virtually every major city across the country. This needs to be done on a more sensitive basis in terms of what really is affordable.”

Those critiques from the AWWA, NACWA and the U.S. Conference of Mayors feature prominently in a 2017 report Congress commissioned on the EPA’s affordability guidelines. The report authors recommended the EPA consider all water costs — rather than examining sewer or water costs in a vacuum — and that its criteria “focus on the income of low-income users most vulnerable to rate increases rather than Median Household Income.”

The report has EPA weighing whether to “modernize” its affordability criteria, a spokesman said Monday.

Turner has stressed that Houston residents would be facing far steeper rate hikes if the city had failed to negotiate the EPA down from an earlier proposal that would have required the city to spend $5 billion to curtail its chronic sewer spills.

Public Works Director Carol Haddock echoed that, and said the city secured a 15-year deadline rather than the 10-year schedule the EPA originally had sought in an effort to restrain rising costs for residents.

“As we move into this rate study, we’re going to explore every avenue available to minimize the impact on the most vulnerable in our communities,” Haddock said. “We’re really sensitive to the impact this might have … but we also need everybody to recognize that this is not optional. We cannot choose not to participate.”

Houston’s hundreds of sanitary sewage overflows each year — often caused by cracked, clogged or flooded pipes — contaminate streams in violation of the Clean Water Act, and drew the EPA’s attention nearly a decade ago.

Rather than enforce violations through a court fight, EPA initiated talks in the hopes of producing the “consent decree” now before city council. The agreement lists projects and procedures Houston must use to reduce spills by upgrading pipes, improving maintenance and educating the public on how to avoid clogging the city’s more than 6,200 miles of sewers, 384 lift stations and 39 treatment plants.

The council is scheduled to consider a vote on the decree on Wednesday.

Charles Noble said he expects word of rising water bills to cause residents in his Fontaine-Scenic Woods neighborhood to “act up.”

Most residents in that area of northeast Houston already pay more for sewer service than the EPA considers affordable, Census data show.

And there is evidence families there often must make difficult budgeting choices: More families had their water shut off for lack of payment in the 77016 postal code, where Noble lives, in the last year than anywhere else in the city.

“Housing, health care, all of those are major concerns for people here. Money is just tight all the way around,” said Noble, the area civic club president. “To hear that bills will go up, for people who are on fixed incomes that’s going to be a concern, I’m sure.”

The decree may lead to pipes in 77016 being repaired or cleaned more often, however, as city data show the area also struggles with sewer spills; Noble’s next-door neighbor got a visit from a city crew after reporting a blockage just last week.

Otis Myles, the civic club president in nearby Scenic Woods Plaza, is not optimistic.

“They come in and say, ‘The EPA told us to do it,’ and they never do it and then (rates) go up anyway,” Myles said. “But there’s not too much you can do about them not doing it but complain, and they don’t listen to you complain too much because, well, they own the water company.”

A 2016 Houston Chronicle analysis found that neighborhoods most likely to experience sewer spills were disproportionately home to low-income and minority residents, and 77016 matches that. The area — where 97 percent of residents are black or Hispanic and the median income is a third lower than the citywide figure — tallied the third-highest count of spills from 2009 to 2016.

“Separate and apart from the consent decree, we need to address SSOs (sanitary sewer overflows),” Turner said last week. “And there’s no question many of those SSOs are occurring in low-income, minority neighborhoods.”

Nonprofit leaders have urged the council, which delayed the vote one week to give members time to read the decree, to seek another delay to gather more public input.

“Can you tell us how the poorest communities will not be overburdened by the rate increase?” Iris Gonzalez, director of the Coalition for Environment, Equity, and Resilience (CEER), a group of 24 nonprofits, asked the council last week. “If not, then we’re not ready to vote.”

Gonzalez said Houston must move forward with the agreement, but should invite more public participation to ensure residents better grasp what they will be paying for.

“When we think about communities who are living in poverty,” she said, “it’s difficult to talk about a moderate or minimal rate increase in a vacuum, because it’s going to disrupt the web of vulnerabilities that a family is facing every day.”

Some council members have said they are uncomfortable with the lack of information about future rates, but say rejecting the settlement in favor of a court fight with the EPA seems foolish.

“They’ve got us over a barrel here. It’s not a bad agreement,” Councilman Mike Knox said. “But I think we need to be a little bit more transparent with the public about how much it’s actually going to cost them.”"
Justice Department investigating whether Utah Attorney General's Office falsely obtained federal grants,https://www.deseretnews.com,"['Dennis Romboy', 'Dennis Has Spent The Past Years Covering Government', 'Human Services.', 'Romboy Deseretnews.Com']",07-22-2019,2019,7,https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900080783/utah-attorney-generals-office-false-federal-grants-justice-department-investigation.html,"SALT LAKE CITY — The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating whether several state criminal justice agencies, including the Utah Attorney General’s Office, made false statements to obtain federal grants.

The investigation came to light in a recent court filing by the DOJ Office of Inspector General asking a federal judge to force the state to turn over records it has refused to provide.

The DOJ served a subpoena on an assistant Utah attorney general on April 2, but the state has yet to comply, according to documents filed last week in U.S. District Court in Salt Lake City.

“The purpose of the subpoena is to determine whether respondent failed to meet its legal and contractual responsibilities when executing grants with the Department of Justice,” the filing says.

Federal investigators contend the attorney general’s office, Utah Department of Public Safety, Utah Administrative Office of the Courts, Utah Commission on Criminal and Juvenile Justice and Utah Juvenile Justice Services falsely represented job losses due to budget cuts in order to obtain grant funding from 2009 to 2013, according to court documents.

Investigators also allege the state agencies made false certifications of compliance with federal mandates, resulting in them receiving money to which they were not entitled.

In a statement late Monday, the attorney general's office said the case involves conduct that predates Attorney General Sean Reyes and his current leadership team.

“It involves allegations related to numerous state agencies. As part of its constitutional duties, the Utah AGO is representing those agencies in this matter,"" the statement indicated. “The Utah AGO has cooperated with the OIG investigation to the maximum extent allowable under legal and ethical rules and has been following strict orders of this court not to disclose anything publicly.”

“In fact, the federal court overseeing this matter issued an order/gave explicit instructions that our office could not discuss in public/with the media the substantive issues in this case.”

The statement affirmed the attorney general's office does not believe the comment issued Monday was a violation of the instruction not to speak publicly.

The investigation started in January 2015. Specifically at issue is whether the state supplanted or used federal funds to replace money the state had already appropriated for the same purpose, according to a declaration by Cynthia Roberts, a special agent in the DOJ Inspector General's Office.

Roberts' declaration says the records are needed to ascertain whether the state used the funds appropriately.

The grants came through the DOJ’s Bureau of Justice Assistance and the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, including money for the attorney general’s Internet Crimes Against Children task force. The other state agencies received money from the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program, court documents show.

The federal programs administer grants for state and local governments to reduce violent and drug-related crime, support law enforcement, help crime victims and develop initiatives for juveniles.

The subpoena seeks job creation and retention records, personnel records for workers funded by the grants, documents on hiring and employee transfers and communications regarding complaints, objections inquiries regard job creation retention. It required the state to provide the documents by April 29, but the attorney general’s office “failed to produce a single document,"" the court filing says.

Federal investigators contacted the attorney general’s office “numerous” times by phone and email. The requests were met with promises to produce documents, but no documents have ever been produced, according to the court filing.

The attorney general's office ""repeatedly"" told investigators that various employees were gathering the documents but for some reason were not able to finish the task.

“Because of the importance of the Inspector General’s investigation, the United States requests this court summarily enforce the subpoena,” the filing says."
Austin Housing Authority Buys Private Apartments to Rent to Section 8 Tenants,https://nextcity.org,[],,,,https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/austin-housing-authority-buys-private-apartments-rent-to-section-8-tenants,"“The need for this program far exceeds available resources.”

That was how the Housing Authority of the City of Austin put it when it reopened its waitlist for Housing Choice Vouchers last September for the first time in four years. The Housing Choice Voucher program, which was previously known as Section 8, helps low-income families make up the difference between the cost of rent on the private market and what they’re able to afford. In 2014, the last time the Authority opened the waitlist, it got 20,000 applicants. It whittled them down to 2,500 through a lottery. It was expecting to do the same again last year, randomly selecting another 2,000 applicants just to get in the line for a voucher.

But even when a family gets a voucher, says Michael Gerber, president and CEO of the housing authority, they may find it very difficult to find a landlord who will accept it. As Next City has reported before, Texas landlords are allowed to reject tenants based on their source of income. And like a lot of growing cities, Austin is facing a critical shortage of affordable housing across the board, which is especially acute at the lowest end of the income scale.

“While a housing authority I don’t think has a responsibility for fixing all of [the housing shortage], we certainly feel a responsibility to try to address it as best we can,” Gerber says. “It’s hard to say to that resident, ‘Here’s a housing choice voucher. We know you’re not going to be able to use it.’”

So as part of its effort to make more housing available to voucher holders, the housing authority is continuing to expand a strategy of acquiring housing units on the private market and making some of them affordable for low and moderate-income people. Recently, the housing authority, in partnership with the affordable-housing investment group Community Development Trust, bought a 452-unit apartment complex in Southeast Austin, as the Austin American-Statesman reported. The authority is planning to rent the units to tenants earning no more than 80 percent of median family income, which works out to $48,200 for an individual or $68,800 for a family of four. And it’s planning to market at least 15 percent of the units to voucher holders and tenants receiving assistance through HUD’s Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing program.

The project, called The Bridge at Asher Apartments, is pushing into more valuable real-estate territory than a lot of the Authority’s other projects, Gerber says. It’s adjacent to a growing commercial area, and none of the other properties in that area were accepting housing choice vouchers, according to Gerber. It’s also near high-quality schools, which is why the Kresge Foundation and the National Housing Trust supported the project with a $4 million grant from the HOPE Fund, which helps establish low-income housing near good schools. It’s also a shorter commute to downtown, where the jobs are, Gerber says.

“We’re excited to be there,” Gerber says. “It’s a big property, and it’s a challenging property, but it’s an exciting property for us and it’s getting awfully close to those southern suburbs which are becoming so desirable.”

The Austin Housing Authority recently purchased this property, The Bridge at Asher Apartments, in partnership with Community Development Trust. It will rent the units to families holding Housing Choice Vouchers (also known as Section 8).

Adrianne Todman, CEO of The National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials (NAHRO), which represents housing authorities and community development agencies, says that most public housing authorities currently focus on preserving the public units in their ownership and building new projects with federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credits. The Housing Authority of the City of Austin has done a good job of acting as a proactive housing provider in the city, Todman says.

“Austin is looked at as one of the most innovative agencies in the country, and it has solid leadership,” Todman says.

In many places, Todman says, city leaders have seen public housing and housing authorities as something that’s outside their purview — “something that’s happening over there,” she says. But as affordable housing becomes an issue that is impacting more people in more places at different income levels, some cities are starting to look to their housing authorities as assets, she says. Some housing authorities — like the King County Housing Authority near Seattle — have been able to acquire housing on the private market and convert or preserve it for lower-income residents.

“For most housing authorities, that is not something that they do, but where it’s being done it’s being done really well,” Todman says. “And one of the goals we have at NAHRO is helping other groups learn how to really become a local player.”

In Austin, the city council and the mayor have also brought a productive focus to issues of housing affordability, Gerber says. This past spring, the city council passed a plan called Affordability Unlocked, which creates incentives in the former of greater density and looser regulations for projects that are geared toward tenants earning less than 60 percent of the median income, as Next City has reported. And last fall, voters approved a $250 million bond intended to finance affordable housing construction and preservation. Those programs dovetail with the housing authority’s acquisition strategy, Gerber says. At another project, the authority was able to use the Affordability Unlocked rules to reduce the number of parking spaces to what it believes the residents there will actually need and expand the amount of green space on the site and the size of a connected community center, Gerber says. And it plans to apply for funds from the most recent housing bond, which it has not done in the past, he says.

Many policies in Austin and elsewhere are focused on incentivizing private developers to construct affordable housing. But public housing authorities serve a group of residents whose needs are greater than the market is likely to ever provide, Gerber says. The typical voucher holder in Austin earns less than $13,000 a year, according to Gerber, and the authority disproportionately serves seniors, people with disabilities, families with children, and people transitioning out of homelessness. Acquiring more property will help it find new ways to serve those people, Gerber says.

“We are a piece of the affordability puzzle in Austin,” he says. “We’re trying to do our part.”"
Teacher's union head calls DeVos handling of student loan forgiveness program 'a travesty',https://thehill.com,[],07-23-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/hilltv/rising/454303-teachers-union-head-calls-devos-handling-of-student-loan-forgiveness-program-a-travesty,"The head of the teachers union suing the Department of Education is slamming Secretary Betsy DeVos Elizabeth (Betsy) Dee DeVosThe Hill's Morning Report — Trump applauds two-year budget deal with 0 billion spending hike Democratic senator slams DeVos: 'I think we should send her back' Congress should restore Pell Grant eligibility to incarcerated individuals MORE, calling her mismanagement of the public service student loan forgiveness program a “travesty” and a “betrayal” to millions of Americans.

Randi Weingarten, who is president of the American Federation of Teachers, filed a lawsuit earlier this month against DeVos. The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and is brought by eight union members along with Weingarten and the union itself.

“What Betsy Devos has done is a travesty and a betrayal,” Weingarten, an outspoken critic of the Trump administration’s handing of the program, told Hill.TV on Tuesday.

An Education Department spokesperson declined to comment, but called the lawsuit ""nothing more than the typical political grandstanding from the union.""

The federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program was passed with bipartisan support and signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2007.

The program promises to forgive the remaining balance of federal student loan debt for graduates who have made at least 120 payments and work in a qualifying job for the government or a nonprofit. This includes teachers, firefighters and nurses among other public service workers.

Weingarten emphasized that the current program is in such disarray, that it violates both federal law and the Constitution.

“Why are they not actually saying, ‘wait a second’ — you paid for 10 years, we’re going to find every way to get your loan forgiven,'” she said. “Instead it’s obstacle after obstacle after obstacle.”

According to the Education Department’s own data, only 1 percent of the people who think they've made their 10 years of payments and apply for loan forgiveness are getting approved.

However, in statement to Hill.TV, a department spokesperson maintained that it has sought to improve its internal process and enhanced outreach by providing automated tools on its website to help people better navigate the program. This includes helping borrowers see whether their employer qualifies for the program and whether they are enrolled in an eligible repayment plan.

The spokesperson added that it has also actively encouraged borrowers to submit a form to access their progress in the program annually or when they change jobs.

""The Department is well on its way to bringing the federal student aid programs into the 21st century,"" the spokesperson wrote. ""Through this transformative effort—Next Gen FSA—we’ll, among other things, offer students, parents, and borrowers personalized communications and outreach through their preferred channel.""

Weingarten accused DeVos of trying to help student loan service providers rather than the borrowers themselves. In October, the American Federation of Teacher filed lawsuit against Navient, which is one of the largest federal student loan servicers in the country.

""Navient said in their motion to dismiss that it doesn’t matter what they say to borrowers like people who have taken out student debt because their contract is with the Department of Education,"" she said. ""So they can lie to borrowers and nobody can actually have a remedy — that’s why we’re going after the Department of Education.""

Weingarten added that DeVos isn’t the only one to blame, saying previous administrations could have taken action and made the program more transparent. But she said it's now up to Congress to act.

“At the end of the day, we have to help people who are paying $500 to a $1,000 a month and they want to be teachers, they want to be firefighters, they want to be nurses and so hopefully we can get some relief from the court,” she told Hill.TV. “But at the same time, we need Congress to make this more transparent and make it easier for people to do this.”

This is not the first time Weingarten has criticized the Trump administration over its handling of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.

In an op-ed endorsing presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann WarrenPoll: Biden leads 2020 Democratic field by 15 points, followed by Sanders and Warren Warren introduces bill to cancel student loan debt for millions Democrats, advocacy groups urge Pompeo to abolish new 'unalienable rights' commission MORE’s student loan forgiveness plan, she accused the administration of sabotaging the program.

However, she wrote that she was heartened by Warren’s proposal, saying such a plan would be “transformational.”

""Warren’s student debt and universal free college plan would be transformational — similar to the way the GI Bill completely altered Americans’ access to higher education,"" she said, adding that it is good policy for both working- and middle-class Americans but a step in the right direction for the economy.

USDA wants to close SNAP automatic eligibility loophole,https://www.kcrg.com,['News Staff'],,,,https://www.kcrg.com/content/news/USDA-proposed-to-close-SNAP-automatic-eligibility-loophole-513083421.html,"The USDA on Monday said it's proposing to close a loophole that allows states to make those receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) benefits automatically eligible to participate in the USDA’s SNAP benefits program.

Pixabay / MGN

The proposed rule would limit SNAP/TANF automatic eligibility to households receiving ""substantial, ongoing TANF-funded benefits aimed at helping families move towards self-sufficiency.""

It would fix a loophole that has given SNAP assistance to people who ""clearly don’t need it.""

""In fact, the depth of this specific flexibility has become so egregious that a millionaire living in Minnesota successfully enrolled in the program simply to highlight the waste of taxpayer money,"" the USDA said in a release.

The USDA said the proposal would help save billions of dollars and would make sure benefits are going to those who are most in need.

“For too long, this loophole has been used to effectively bypass important eligibility guidelines. Too often, states have misused this flexibility without restraint,” said U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue. “The American people expect their government to be fair, efficient, and to have integrity – just as they do in their own homes, businesses, and communities. That is why we are changing the rules, preventing abuse of a critical safety net system, so those who need food assistance the most are the only ones who receive it.”

Under the proposal, the USDA said in order for households to be automatically eligible for SNAP, they must receive TANF-funded cash or non-cash benefits valued at a minimum of $50 per month for at least 6 months.

""In addition, non-cash benefits that could convey automatic eligibility would be restricted to subsidized employment, work supports, or childcare,"" the USDA said.

DHS to expand speedy deportations across the country,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Stephen Dinan']",07-22-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jul/22/dhs-expand-speedy-deportations-across-country/,"Homeland Security announced an aggressive new policy Monday to fast-track deportations of recent immigrants caught in the living in the U.S. illegally, looking to expand a tool that’s been used successfully at the border for years.

Expedited removal allows immigration officers to order a deportation without the extensive immigration court proceedings and appeals that accompany other removals. For years, it’s been applied to immigrants caught within 100 miles of the border who illegally entered in recent weeks.

Under the policy, which acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan announced in a notice published online, immigrants who entered illegally within the last two years, and were caught anywhere in the U.S., can face expedited removal.

Mr. McAleenan cast the move in part as a response to the migrant surge, which has overwhelmed his agents at the border, allowing more people to sneak by and into the interior.

“The volume of illegal entries, and the attendant risks to national security and public safety presented by these illegal entries, warrants this immediate implementation of DHS’s full statutory authority over expedited removal,” the secretary wrote.

Immigrant-rights groups, though, vowed lawsuits to try to stop the new policy.

“Under this unlawful plan, immigrants who have lived here for years would be deported with less due process than people get in traffic court,” said Omar Jadwat at the American Civil Liberties Union.

Tens of thousands of immigrants could be subject to expedited removal.

Mr. McAleenan said that could help clear the massive backlog in the immigration courts, since the cases would be decided by immigration officers rather than administrative law judges.

It also means having to hold people in detention at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for a shorter time. The average custody period for someone in full removal proceedings in 2018 was more than 50 days. For expedited removal cases, it was just 11 days.

Expedited removal was part of a 1996 law passed by Congress and signed by then-President Clinton — though it was the Bush administration that set the old rules, applying it to within 100 miles of the border and within the first two weeks of someone illegally crossing.

Steve Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said courts have generally upheld expedited removal powers, finding that they were sufficiently limited by time and geography.

He predicted on Twitter that nationwide expansion “is going to provoke massive relitigation of those claims.”

Mr. McAleenan, in the new notice, said the 100-mile policy ignores some obvious cases where expedited removal would be appropriate. He pointed out that major cities in border states are often more than 100 miles from the border itself — such as Roswell, New Mexico, where 67 immigrants were found living illegally in the U.S. at a stash house earlier this year.

Under expedited removal, the burden is on the target to prove they didn’t enter illegally within the last two years.

Migrants could still apply for asylum or other protections under the same rules that apply at the border for expedited removal, the secretary said.

Still, immigration activists said expanding the policy creates a “show your papers” situation where even U.S. citizens could be snared and struggle to prove their bona fides.

“How are people supposed to prepare for this?” wondered David Leopold, a former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. “This designation contains nothing about how a lawful permanent resident should prepare. Should they be carrying passports and immigration papers at all times? How do we answer the question ‘papers please?’ We don’t know.”

He also said the new policy could also be used by unscrupulous employers who have immigrants living in the U.S. illegally in their workforce. If those workers are unruly, employers can now threaten a call to ICE.

“And among the bad actor employers is Donald Trump at his golf clubs,” Mr. Leopold said, referring to a number of current and former immigrants living in the U.S. illegally who have come forward to say they’d been employed at Trump properties.
