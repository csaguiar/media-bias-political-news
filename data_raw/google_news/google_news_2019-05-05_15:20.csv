Bernie Sanders speaks during a Fox News town hall. | Matt Rourke/AP Photo 2020 elections How the ACLU is setting up Trump for a field day in 2020 The group is deploying hundreds of people to get Democratic candidates on video taking positions on hot-button topics like felon voting.

The debate over allowing the Boston Marathon bomber to vote started with a man named Rick in Muscatine, Iowa.

At a town hall in early April, he reminded Bernie Sanders that prisoners in his home state of Vermont are allowed to vote and asked if that right should be extended nationally. Sanders agreed it should, and before he knew it, he was being asked variations of the question at Fox News and CNN town halls. Sanders’ critics pounced, and the conservative outrage machine kicked into gear, fueled by President Donald Trump.

The chain of events didn't start by accident: It was orchestrated by the American Civil Liberties Union, which is coaching activists like Rick as part of a multi-million dollar, below-the-radar campaign to get the 2020 candidates on record about its civil liberties priorities. In Hanover, N.H., an ACLU-linked voter got Kamala Harris’ commitment to support adding a third-gender marker on federal ID cards. The group is also putting Democratic hopefuls on the spot with sensitive questions about immigration and abortion rights.

Each of the exchanges have been captured on video and posted to YouTube, and the answers largely reflect a Democratic primary field that’s veering further to the left. But the ACLU is making that shift happen far more quickly and visibly than it might have otherwise — to the apparent delight of Trump and his supporters.

In the opening months of the campaign, the organization has trained hundreds of volunteers in early voting states and sent them to more than 150 events where they ask questions around planned topics. To the organizers, the field of more than 20 candidates has a long way to go to meet its demands. But already the effort is forcing some staunch civil liberties and voting rights advocates to grapple with how their priorities are playing out on a large stage.

Sentencing Project Executive Director Marc Mauer, who wrote a Howard Law Journal article in 2011 arguing felony disenfranchisement policies are inherently undemocratic, acknowledged having mixed feelings about the sudden burst of public attention. “I wouldn’t have guessed that it would surface this quickly, and this broadly,” Mauer, who is not part of the ACLU effort, told POLITICO.

“It jump-started the issue, and I’ve seen a lot of support for that position that I wouldn’t have guessed was out there,” Mauer added. “But I would hate to see us have another Willie Horton election where we just get a very distorted discussion of an issue that’s important to democracy, but it’s one of 100 issues that should be debated, not the sole one debated.”

A few weeks after he appeared in Iowa, Sanders said at the CNN town hall he believes the right to vote is inherent in American democracy — “even for terrible people.” Moderator Chris Cuomo — presumably because the debate was held in New Hampshire—had provocatively framed the issue around whether the Boston marathon bomber should be allowed to vote.

“Once you start chipping away and you say, ‘Well, that guy committed a terrible crime, not going to let him vote,’” Sanders said. “‘Well, that person did that. Not going to let that person vote,’ you’re running down a slippery slope.”

Trump seized on Sanders’ answer: “Let the Boston bomber vote — he should be voting, right?” Trump told members of the National Rifle Association last week. “I don’t think so. Let terrorists that are in prison vote, I don’t think so. Can you believe it? But this is where some of these people are coming from.”

Ronald Newman, the ACLU’s national political director, said it isn’t his job to worry about the political firestorm. He held up Sanders’ answer in Iowa as a model of what the group is trying to accomplish: to inject its pet priorities into the political bloodstream and, over time, sway public opinion.

Along with the incarcerated voting ask, the ACLU is also asking candidates for specific proposals to cut the federal prison population by 50 percent; end the use of detainers and reducing reduce immigration detention by 75 percent; and lift the Hyde Amendment and other government bans on insurance coverage of abortion.

In Las Vegas, Castro — who during an earlier stop in Concord, N.H., had already agreed to back phasing out detaining immigrant families seeking asylum or refugee status—said local law enforcement shouldn’t act as pseudo-immigration agents for the federal government.

ACLU staffers and volunteers also have pushed several candidates on ending cash bail and dramatically expanding voting registration opportunities and making Election Day a holiday. Gillibrand and O’Rourke separately agreed to support a third-gender classification at the federal level, joining Harris.

The ACLU plans to spend a total of $30 million in the 2020 cycle. After gathering more videos, officials plan to send questionnaires to the candidates and to invite each of them to meet with people affected by the policies the group is advocating. The ACLU also plans to conduct a voter education drive. “Not only giving them that information but pushing turnout to make sure they take that information with them to the ballot-box,” Newman said.

Despite the early attention, it’s unclear how much the program will register with early state voters. But the ACLU looks intent to execute its plan.

During internal debates over what questions to get Democratic candidate to weigh in on, the ACLU focused on issues that would reveal meaningful distinctions between the candidates. On voting rights for incarcerated people, only Sanders has been unequivocal, while others including Julián Castro and Beto O’Rourke have said they would separate nonviolent offenders.

“That’s something we will continue to push them on,” Newman said of the specificity of the answers coming in.

“If you do give us one of those classic, no-substance, boilerplate responses,” he added, “there’s a 50 percent chance that when you show up at the next coffee shop, you’re going to run into one of our volunteers.”"

Can a Woman Win? 2020 Candidates Offer an Easy Answer: ‘I Have’,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Astead W. Herndon', 'Lisa Lerer']",05-05-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/05/us/politics/women-candidates-2020-election-electability.html,"“The first-blush analysis is inadequate,” Ms. Gillibrand said in an interview. “This is what makes me the best person to take on Trump — electability. Experience. Track record.”

“I’m the most elect ——” she stopped. “I have the type of experience they’re looking for.”

At this early stage of the Democratic presidential primary, much of the discussion among voters has focused on the singular desire of defeating Mr. Trump, and selecting a nominee who’s best suited to that task. But while that line of thinking has largely been associated with well-known veteran male politicians, particularly former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the women running in the historically diverse Democratic field, several of whom have a demonstrated track record of winning over Republican voters, have been telling anyone who will listen that they, too, are equipped to beat the president.

In addition to Ms. Gillibrand, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota has drawn on her electoral success in red counties to position herself as a bridge-builder in increasingly polarized times. And Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts — who soundly defeated a popular Republican incumbent in her first election — has focused recently on addressing concerns that she’s simply an “ideas candidate,” combining her rhetoric about economic inequality with a more explicit pitch on her ability to beat Mr. Trump. (A fourth leading female candidate, Senator Kamala Harris of California, has enjoyed most of her success thus far in Democratic strongholds.)

As they now campaign for president, they are encountering some of the same misogyny that Mrs. Clinton faced when she ran in 2016. They are running up against assumptions voters and pundits have about what presidential leadership looks like, battling a presidential archetype where men are the only touchstones."
Did the NY Times just admit — and defend — Obama’s spying on Trump?,https://nypost.com,"['Michael Goodwin', 'May']",05-04-2019,2019,5,https://nypost.com/2019/05/04/did-the-ny-times-just-admit-and-defend-obamas-spying-on-trump/,"They’ve done it, they’ve finally done it! The New York Times has picked up the scent of the scandalous spying on Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign and is joining the hunt for the truth.

That’s how the president and some supporters reacted after the Times reported the FBI sent a “cloaked investigator” to a London meeting with Trump aide George Papadopoulos in September of 2016. The cheering section saw the story as evidence that, in the aftermath of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report, the facts were forcing even the Gray Lady to abandon its notorious anti-Trump agenda.

If only that were true. In reality, we’ll see pigs fly before we see the Times fully committed to getting to the bottom of what Trump calls ­“Spygate.”

The paper is still defending the dirty tricks of Barack Obama’s White House and its own role in spreading the Russia, Russia, Russia hysteria. It’s a relationship neither side can quit.

Instead of proving the Times is coming to its senses, Friday’s article about the 2016 London meeting is better seen as spin designed to protect deep-state sources feeling the heat. Attorney General Bill Barr’s promise to investigate the investigators spooked them and they are using their favorite media handmaiden to fight back.

The result is a story that takes a “modified limited hangout” approach, where fragments are presented as revelations while the full picture ­remains artfully hidden.

Although the front-page story identifies the investigator as Azra Turk, nowhere do we learn what Turk’s real name is or whom she works for.

The story repeatedly suggests she is an FBI agent, but the fact that it doesn’t say so directly probably means she isn’t. Indeed, one of the story’s three reporters, Adam Goldman, told CNN they called Turk a government investigator “for a reason, and I’m going to leave it at that.”

That’s not journalism. That’s being a deep-state errand boy.

Naturally, all sources are anonymous, identified generally as “people familiar with the operation.” My guess is they include Jim Comey, Andrew McCabe and other dirty cops worried they are in Barr’s crosshairs.

They should worry, especially about Barr’s probe into leaks. There is no question that FBI officials were among the same reporters’ sources all along as the Times painted Trump as a Russian agent.

Which is why Friday’s story assures readers there was nothing amiss in the spying, arguing that the existence of an “operation aimed at a presidential campaign” reveals “the level of alarm inside the FBI” over Russian ­efforts to disrupt the 2016 election.

That’s an odd and extremely biased way to describe the possibly illegal ­effort by the Obama administration to spy on the presidential campaign of the opposition party. Imagine how that sentence would be written if a Republican president spied on a Democratic candidate.

And why are the reporters certain the spying was legitimate and not a plot to stop Trump from being elected? Because their sources say so, making this a powerful example of why the Times was wrong to abolish its standards.

For decades, editors there insisted that sources making pejorative claims must be identified so readers could judge their agenda and credibility. By keeping sources anonymous, the Times keeps readers in the dark.

In this case, that’s the aim.

As for the word “spying,” the paper won’t go there, even as Barr makes a point of using it. The hypocrisy is shameless.

On Adam Goldman’s bio, the Times says he was on an Associated Press team that won a Pulitzer Prize for revealing “the New York Police Department’s Muslim spying programs.”

See, the Times doesn’t like the NYPD, so cops were “spying.” When Obama does it to Trump, it’s an “operation.”

As for Azra Turk, the article merely catches up to what Papadopoulos already revealed. His memoir, “Deep State Target,” was published in March and he was the first to identify her, describing her as a “suggestive” honey pot “showing her curves” as she pumps him for information about whether Trump’s campaign had ties to Russians.

Papadopoulos also makes a key point the Times doesn’t: He believes Turk is with the CIA, which adds a huge dimension to the scandal. Imagine that headline: “Obama’s CIA also spied on Trump.”

Paging John Brennan, your time in the barrel is coming.

Two final points:

The Times first reported the FBI’s 2016 contact with Papadopoulos in May of 2018, when the paper, along with The Washington Post, simultaneously revealed the bureau sent an “informant” to talk to two Trump aides after the agency “received evidence that the pair had suspicious contacts linked to Russia.”

The fact that both papers had the same story reflects that it, like Friday’s piece, was a defensive leak orchestrated by nervous insiders. And no wonder: Trump was tweeting back then that there was “at least one FBI representative implanted, for political purposes, into my campaign.”

In response, the Times essentially admitted it was true, but protected the operation with the ridiculous assertions that “No evidence has emerged that the informant acted improperly” and that the FBI used informants only because agents were “leery of disrupting the presidential campaign again” after the Hillary Clinton e-mail probe.

In other words, they sent a secret informant for Trump’s own good. This is the same FBI that wrote a letter clearing Clinton before she was interviewed.

Curiously, neither the Times nor The Washington Post identified the informant a year ago, but others quickly named him as Stefan Halper, a Cambridge professor with ties to American and British intelligence.

The Times said it was shielding his identity to protect his safety. It also casually added that in his meeting with Papadopoulos, the informant was accompanied by “one of his assistants, a young woman.”

Now the paper says the woman was not an assistant, but rather a “government investigator.”

What did the Times know about Azra Turk and when did it know it? And what else is it hiding about her?

Friday’s story also had a very odd ending. In a dramatically downplayed conclusion, it says Halper “was invited as part of a group of China experts to meet with White House advisers in 2017. Mr. Halper informed the FBI of the invitation but was not provided with any guidance, people familiar with the episode said.”

In plain English, the FBI informant who helped spy on the Trump campaign was unwittingly invited to the White House during Trump’s presidency, and the FBI told him to go but never notified the president.

The story adds that Halper’s group met with trade representative Peter Navarro, who later told Fox radio he felt “duped” by Halper’s betrayal.

Navarro shouldn’t be too hard on himself. The FBI and the CIA duped the nation, and still refuse to come clean about what they did in 2016 and 2017.

As for The New York Times, we shouldn’t expect to find the truth there, either. The former “paper of rec­ord” is protecting those who did the duping and the spying."
Pelosi Warns Democrats: Stay in the Center or Trump May Contest Election Results,https://www.nytimes.com,['Glenn Thrush'],05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/04/us/politics/nancy-pelosi.html,"WASHINGTON — Speaker Nancy Pelosi does not believe President Trump can be removed through impeachment — the only way to do it, she said this week, is to defeat him in 2020 by a margin so “big” he cannot challenge the legitimacy of a Democratic victory.

That is something she worries about.

“We have to inoculate against that, we have to be prepared for that,” Ms. Pelosi said during an interview at the Capitol on Wednesday as she discussed her concern that Mr. Trump would not give up power voluntarily if he lost re-election by a slim margin next year.

Sitting in her office with its panoramic view of the National Mall, Ms. Pelosi — the de facto head of the Democratic Party until a presidential nominee is selected in 2020 — offered Democrats her “coldblooded” plan for decisively ridding themselves of Mr. Trump: Do not get dragged into a protracted impeachment bid that will ultimately get crushed in the Republican-controlled Senate, and do not risk alienating the moderate voters who flocked to the party in 2018 by drifting too far to the left.

“Own the center left, own the mainstream,” Ms. Pelosi, 79, said.

“Our passions were for health care, bigger paychecks, cleaner government — a simple message,” Ms. Pelosi said of the 40-seat Democratic pickup last year that resulted in her second ascent to the speakership. “We did not engage in some of the other exuberances that exist in our party” — a reference to some of the most ambitious plans advocated by the left wing of her party and some 2020 candidates, including “Medicare for all” and the Green New Deal, which she has declined to support."

Kamala Harris asks DOJ IG to probe whether Trump asked Barr to investigate political opponents,https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-doj-ig-bar-trump-political-opponents,"Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., on Friday sent a letter to the Department of Justice’s inspector general demanding he investigates whether the White House had urged Attorney General William Barr to investigate President Trump’s political opponents.

“In response to my questions during the [Senate Judiciary] hearing, Attorney General Barr proved unable or unwilling to state whether he had been directed to open investigations at the request or suggestion of the President or other White House officials -- an alarming response that strikes at the very heart of the rule of law and threatens to undermine the longstanding independence of the Justice Department,” she said in a letter to Inspector General Michael Horowitz.

“I request that the Office of the Inspector General investigate whether the Attorney General has received or acted upon such improper requests,” she said.

The letter comes days after Harris questioned Barr Tuesday at the Senate hearing over details in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia report that noted instances where Trump had either suggested or called for the Department of Justice to investigate Hillary Clinton.

Harris quizzed Barr whether Trump or anyone at the White House had asked him to investigate anyone -- an exchange it detailed in its letter to Horowitz.

In that exchange, Harris asked: “Has the President or anyone at the White House ever asked or suggested that you open an investigation of anyone?”

“I’m trying to grapple with the word ‘suggest.’ I mean, there have been discussions of, of matters out there that, uh—they have not asked me to open an investigation,” Barr said.

When Harris asked if anyone had hinted, suggested or inferred, Barr said he didn’t know. Harris’ letter describes Barr as “unable or unwilling to answer the question.”

“There must be no doubt that the Department of Justice and its leadership stand apart from partisan politics, and resist improper attempts to use the power of federal law enforcement to settle personal scores,” she wrote.

The letter is the latest pushback from Democrats against Barr since the release of the Mueller report. In particular, they have zeroed in on Barr’s handling of the report’s release, alleging that he is biased toward the president in his presentation of the report in his initial four-page summary of its conclusions.

Harris criticized Barr’s decision not to personally review the underlying evidence before concluding that there was not enough evidence to establish that the president had committed obstruction of justice. She joined a number of Democrats saying that Barr should resign.

""This Attorney General lacks all credibility and has I think compromised the American public's ability to believe that he is a purveyor of justice,"" she told reporters after the hearing.

‘My dad died at their hands’: WWII vet fatally injured in VA nursing home,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Donovan Slack', 'Published A.M. Et May']",05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/05/04/veteran-death-after-traumatic-injury-in-va-nursing-home/3402591002/,"CLOSE Surveillance video captured the deadly blow to the head of 91-year-old James “Milt” Ferguson Sr. Specialists say it could have been prevented. USA TODAY

Jim Ferguson wanted answers.

How was his 91-year-old father, who served in the U.S. Navy in World War II, fatally injured in a Veterans Affairs nursing home, the institution Ferguson had entrusted to care for him?

Huddled around a computer monitor with managers at the VA in Des Moines, Iowa, Ferguson watched a hallway surveillance video that depicted a chilling blow to his father's head.

“I lost it,” Ferguson told USA TODAY. “I broke down.”

In the video, James “Milt” Ferguson Sr., who had dementia and was legally blind, appears confused. He opens a hallway door, rolls his wheelchair into another resident’s room, then wheels back out. No staff members are visible. He circles around and heads back into the room.

Halfway through the door, his chair flips over backwards. Milt Ferguson crashes to the floor, landing on the back of his head. Ferguson said he was told the chair was pushed over by the resident in the room, who can't be seen in the video. As staff members rush to assist him, Ferguson is able to turn over and sit up, but the impact causes a massive brain bleed that will kill him within days.

What later would turn the son’s despair into outrage was what he learned about events leading up to his father wheeling around unsupervised last December, and what happened after he smashed into the floor.

“It’s like my dad died at their hands,” Ferguson said.

Serious problems with resident care have occurred in many VA nursing homes across the nation, including the one where Ferguson was being cared for.

USA TODAY reported in March that inspections by a private contractor hired by the VA found deficiencies that caused ""actual harm"" to veterans at more than half of the 99 VA nursing homes reviewed. The inspections found inadequate supervision or hazardous conditions at 53 of them.

In Des Moines – which received the lowest one star out of five in the VA's own ratings, based on surprise inspections – inspectors found managers did not ensure staff treated residents with dignity or followed basic infection-control and prevention measures.

The story of what happened to James Ferguson in Des Moines provides a deeper picture of the care one elderly veteran received. Medical records provided to USA TODAY by his son and legal guardian outline what specialists say was a concerning series of decisions by VA staff, before and after his deadly head injury.

Nine days before, VA caregivers determined Ferguson was a danger to himself and others because his dementia caused him to wander around, agitated. They had him on continuous one-on-one observation with an aide, but took him off the strict monitoring when he entered the VA nursing home. There, staff didn't reinstate the heightened observation, despite his repeatedly straying dangerously into other residents' rooms.

After his injury, staff put him back in his wheelchair but did not report the incident to a supervisor for 40 minutes, the records and surveillance video indicate. Ferguson wasn't transported to an emergency room for two hours after that. Then, it took 2½ hours more to send him to a trauma hospital. The time stamp on the video showed the fall occurred at 3:49 p.m. and it wasn't until just before 9 p.m. that Ferguson was transported to the trauma facility.

'A disaster waiting to happen'

Specialists who reviewed Ferguson's medical records at the request of USA TODAY expressed concern about the quality of his care.

""It was definitely a disaster waiting to happen, and it did,"" said Robyn Grant, director of public policy and advocacy at The National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care, a Washington-based nonprofit advocacy organization.

""I just am really struck by the predictability with his repeated episodes of going into other people's rooms,"" she said. ""They should have had some intervention so they could provide him with adequate supervision and address the wandering.""

Grant said the length of time it took afterward to adequately evaluate and diagnose the severity of his injury and get him to a trauma facility also raises questions. ""What was happening there, in terms of those delays?"" she said.

VA nursing homes: Feds find 'blatant disregard' for veteran safety

Richard Mollot, executive director since 2005 of the Long Term Care Community Coalition, a New York City-based nonprofit advocate of nursing home care improvement, said the shortfalls indicate there was ""very likely"" a lack of skilled or adequately trained staff to meet his needs.

""The point of being in that environment is that you have skilled nursing care and monitoring,"" he said.

Mollot said the reporting delay is particularly concerning. ""How often does this happen that no one's looking at? That's what is so upsetting.""

'All staff acted properly'

A spokesman for the Des Moines VA, Timothy Hippen, said in a statement that a review after the ""untimely death"" concluded ""all staff acted properly.""

""Any time an unexpected death occurs, VA Central Iowa Health Care System reviews its policies and procedures to see if changes are warranted,"" he said. ""We did that here, finding that all staff acted properly.""

In response to questions about the case, national VA spokesman Curt Cashour accused USA TODAY of focusing on ""isolated complaints"" and ""cherry-picking the experiences of a handful of veterans to create the impression of a broad problem.""

Cashour maintained that, overall, VA nursing homes ""compare closely"" with non-VA facilities. More than 40,000 veterans rely on care at the agency’s 134 nursing facilities each year.

USA TODAY reported last year that about 70% of VA nursing homes scored worse than non-VA nursing homes on a majority of quality indicators tracked by the agency, which include rates of infection, serious pain and bed sores.

Hippen declined to respond to detailed questions about Ferguson's case.

""We will not be addressing the specifics of this case publicly, but we have been in direct contact with the veteran’s family to discuss their concerns,"" he said.

Jim Ferguson said he remains upset even though VA officials shared the surveillance video with him and said they were sorry about what happened to his father.

He wants VA staff held accountable. He wants to make sure policies are in place so it doesn't happen to anyone else.

“No one should live their life like that and have what happened to him in the end,” he said. “I want this to be the last person this happens to.”

A gambler called ‘booger’

Even as his dementia worsened, Milt Ferguson flashed glimmers of his younger self.

The former deckhand on the heavy cruiser U.S.S. Pensacola was affectionately known as “booger” at the Des Moines Register, where he worked bundling newspapers for 23 years before retiring in 1995. He loved to play the slots and the horses.

On a note in his medical record, a nurse practitioner wrote: “Patient laughs when his nickname is mentioned.” Jim Ferguson had come for a visit that day, as he did most days. “He was smiling and appeared to be enjoying his son’s company,” the medical record said.

The decision to place him in a nursing home had been a gut-wrenching one, Ferguson said. He had moved in with his parents and cared for them for three years. But in April 2018 his mother died. He said a VA social worker told him his father needed more intensive, round-the-clock care and supervision.

“They made it sound like, well, if he got hurt, I could be charged with a crime,” Ferguson said. “So that’s when I decided to place him in a nursing home.”

‘His dementia was acting up’

Ferguson moved his father to Bishop Drumm Retirement Center, a private facility just outside Des Moines, where his mother worked as a nursing assistant in the Alzheimer’s unit for more than 20 years before retiring.

The center took in Milt Ferguson last August. But three months later, his condition worsened.

""The day before Thanksgiving, I got a call from Bishop Drumm – his dementia was acting up,"" his son said.

He hit two staff members, was “agitated all day” and was “wandering into other residents room(s), causing distress,” a nurse later noted in his medical record. “He is generally ‘sweet’ so this is a departure from his usual behavior.”

Ferguson was taken by ambulance to the Des Moines VA Medical Center, where he was admitted to the acute psychiatry ward. He was put on one-on-one observation with a sitter – an aide tasked with intervening if he lashed out or tried to stray into other patients’ rooms.

They adjusted his medications, and, after a few aggressive outbursts, he appeared calm enough after three weeks to transfer into the VA nursing home on the medical center’s campus.

But there was a catch, a psychiatric nurse wrote in his record: ""Veterans are not put on sitter status over there.""

‘Help me, help me’

After a 22-hour trial period without a sitter, Milt Ferguson moved in to the VA nursing home.

Problems began within hours.

He hardly slept, he hallucinated, he called out ""help me, help me"" over and over again. He was agitated and again, he ""wandered into and out of peers rooms"" day after day, nursing staff wrote in his record.

They gave him medication. Sometimes he calmed down. Sometimes he didn’t.

A psychiatrist was managing his case remotely. According to public records, the doctor worked at a VA facility a few hours away in Lincoln, Nebraska. Through virtual appointments, the psychiatrist advised changes to Ferguson's medication.

On December 19, a week after Ferguson moved in, nursing home staff noted he was still restless and anxious, pacing and screaming and yelling. His care team – psychiatrist, primary care doctor, nursing staff and social workers – met to discuss the case.

The psychiatrist said a review of his records showed ""increased confusion with wandering"" during the past week. The doctor prescribed higher dosages of a mood-stabilizing drug and a sedative. There was no discussion of closer supervision or reinstatement of one-on-one observation, the records show.

“Will ask RN to contact this MD in one week with update,” the psychiatrist wrote.

By then, Ferguson would be dead.

‘A golf ball-sized lump’

On December 20, when two aides rushed to help Milt Ferguson, his head on the floor and legs crumpled to the side, the time stamp on the hallway surveillance video reads 3:49 p.m. But in a report filled out an hour later, a nurse recorded the time of the accident as 4:30 p.m.

His records do not indicate what the staff did with Ferguson during the 41 minutes in between, aside from putting him back in his wheelchair.

By that time, he had a “golf ball-sized lump on the back of his head.” The nurse notified the manager on duty, a nurse practitioner, who wrote at 5:06 p.m. that he had ordered an immediate CT scan of his head.

That didn’t happen until about 6:30 p.m., when Ferguson arrived in the emergency department of the medical center on the Des Moines VA campus, on a bed wheeled by a nursing home aide. The aide said Ferguson had earlier been taken for a CT scan but was uncooperative.

An emergency room doctor quickly had a sedative administered and the scan was completed. By that point, the World War II veteran had a “large bleed” in the back right side of his brain that was so acute, the CT report says his brain had shifted to the left inside his skull.

Sent 'to scanning’

The doctor notified MercyOne Des Moines Medical Center, a trauma hospital, at 7 p.m. For nearly two hours, the doctor tried to keep Ferguson comfortable and his blood pressure under control until an ambulance arrived and took Ferguson to Mercy at 8:55 p.m.

The doctor also kept calling Ferguson’s son, leaving voicemails.

But Jim Ferguson had himself been admitted to a hospital and had provided the VA nursing home with a consent form authorizing staff to contact a close friend if anything happened to his father. That form had been sent ""to scanning” that morning.

When Jim Ferguson retrieved all the voicemails, he rushed to Mercy the next morning.

""He was not responsive. He was laying on his bed, making this horrible noise as they sucked saliva out of his mouth,"" he said. ""I never even got to say any last words to my dad.""

He died the next day.

Specialists who reviewed the case at the request of USA TODAY singled out multiple shortfalls in his care at the VA that may have affected the outcome.

Grant, the policy director at The National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care, said the 22-hour trial of having no sitter was ""not enough time to establish how he was doing.""

When he then acted out day after day, in agitation and confusion, they should not have allowed him to wander into other residents' rooms, she said. Such situations can cause the other residents to lash out in fear or distress and ""lead to an altercation or violence or striking out.""

""One would argue that could have been prevented,"" she said. ""There should have been somebody, somewhere who could have seen that this happened and – particularly when he wheeled himself – to have gone in and intervened, 'Let me help you, let's go to your room.'""

Mollot, the executive director at the Long Term Care Community Coalition, said meeting the standards of care means staff identifies risks and needs and ways to meet them and mitigate them and then does so consistently.

""This is exactly the kind of thing that happens when those standards are not followed,"" he said.

'A safe place'

The spokesman for the Des Moines VA, while declining to answer detailed questions about what happened, said that in general, ""caring for nursing home residents involves balancing patients’ independence with the need for supervision, as appropriate.""

""While tight scrutiny and strict limits on residents’ activities and freedom of movement could possibly lower the risk for adverse events, it would also severely degrade patients’ quality of life, which is precisely what we are trying to preserve for as long as possible,"" he said.

Jim Ferguson still has his father’s wheelchair in the garage. He keeps the sweatshirt his father was wearing when he last used the chair. Ferguson has retained a lawyer, Brad Biren, to help him figure out next steps and how to hold the VA accountable.

“Somebody didn’t watch my dad and let him die,” he said. “It’s supposed to be a safe place.”

DOJ attorneys defend Mueller's ability to investigate Trump in Roger Stone filing,https://www.cnn.com,['Katelyn Polantz'],05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/03/politics/doj-mueller-trump-investigation/index.html,"(CNN) The Justice Department attorneys prosecuting Roger Stone -- who no longer work under special counsel Robert Mueller -- defended the special counsel's investigation of President Donald Trump Friday, saying it inherently did not hamper his ability to lead the country.

The argument came amid a series of filings Friday night in Stone's case, in which prosecutors pushed back on the longtime Trump ally's legal attacks on Mueller and the criminal charges he faces . Stone has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him and asked the court to dismiss them.

""While the Department of Justice's position is that 'the indictment or criminal prosecution of a sitting President would impermissibly undermine the capacity of the executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned functions,' it also takes the position that a criminal investigation during the President's term is permissible,"" the prosecutors wrote.

If the Constitution ""prevented any investigation of a President or his campaign while he was in office, the government could not preserve evidence while memories are fresh and documentary materials are available. Nor, it would seem, could the government conduct an investigation that may clear the President of alleged wrongdoing.""

Collecting evidence while memories were fresh echoes reasoning Mueller wrote into his report regarding the obstruction of justice investigation into the President. The idea of continuing that investigation was one that Attorney General William Barr criticized this week during his Senate testimony

In another court filing Friday, Justice Department lawyers argued that Mueller didn't need to bring an underlying conspiracy case in order to prosecute Stone for lying to Congress and obstruction. This has been an argument that the White House and Barr have also latched on to regarding whether an obstruction case could be brought against the President.

Mueller collected evidence for possible obstruction of justice cases against the President from several moments during his time in office, yet did not make a decision whether to charge him. Instead, Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein decided not to bring a case against Trump, originally citing, among other things, a lack of an underlying conspiracy crime between Trump's campaign and the Russian government in 2016, which Stone has echoed.

Stone also argued that his criminal charges should be before a different judge because they had little to do with a case Mueller brought against several Russians who allegedly hacked the Democratic National Committee. Those Russians, who are military intelligence officers, have not appeared in court in the US or been apprehended.

His case is currently before federal Judge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington, who also handled the criminal proceedings against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who is now in prison.

The Washington-based Justice Department prosecutors -- who have taken over from Mueller on Stone's case -- say that Stone's charges arose out of a common investigation that used similar search warrants, and he allegedly lied to Congress.

""The defendant's false statements were made before a congressional committee investigating, among other things, the criminal conduct alleged in Netyksho,"" the prosecutors argued, referring to a case against Viktor Borisovich Netyksho, the Russian intelligence officer alleged to be in charge of the hacking operation.

""Moreover, the defendant's false statements to the committee concerned matters discussed in the Netyksho indictment,"" prosecutors wrote on Friday. ""The defendant's contention that this case should now be reassigned (to another judge) based on the Special Counsel's report is inconsistent with the plain text of the rule, which does not require that the overlapping activities themselves be criminal or that defendants be charged with the related activities.""

In yet another filing, the Justice Department argued to a federal court why Stone shouldn't have access to the unredacted Mueller report as he prepares for trial.

The Department of Justice previously told the judge at a hearing they would take this position.

Prosecutors argued the unredacted report isn't evidence in Stone's case -- and they're already giving his legal team all the evidence he needs.

""Stone is no more entitled to the unredacted report than he would be to a prosecution or declination memorandum, which are exempt from discovery,"" prosecutors wrote in a new court filing.

Stone's attempt to get the unredacted Mueller report is one of many requests the federal courts are now considering."
'President Barack Obama Boulevard' unveiled in Los Angeles,https://www.foxnews.com,['Louis Casiano'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/los-angeles-renames-stretch-of-road-obama-boulevard,"Former President Barack Obama now has a second stretch of roadway named for him in Los Angeles.

On Saturday, thousands gathered for the renaming of Rodeo Road to ""President Barack Obama Boulevard,"" a 3.5-mile street that runs through the historically black Baldwin Hills-Crenshaw neighborhood.

The former president was not in attendance as onlookers celebrated his legacy at a spot where he held a presidential campaign rally in 2007, the Los Angeles Times reported.

OBAMA TOOK TRUMP'S WIN AS A PERSONAL INSULT, BOOK SAYS

“As we drive through this city and we see past presidents on Adams, on Washington, on Jefferson and now we’ll have one that was in our lifetime, who was a president for everybody: Barack Hussein Obama,” Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said, according to the Times.

Obama Boulevard intersects with “Presidents Row,” a collection of streets named after former presidents George Washington, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson.

The stretch of Rodeo Road -- not to be confused with Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills -- was the second roadway in Los Angeles to be renamed after Obama. Part of Highway 134 near Occidental College – where Obama was briefly enrolled – was renamed last year as President Barack H. Obama Highway.

The former president has been a frequent presence in Southern California in recent years. In a Beverly Hills fundraiser last year, he chided “the other side” of the political divide for being “angry all the time.” In the lead-up to the 2018 midterm elections, he rallied support for Democratic candidates during a speech in Anaheim."

Robert Daigle, the director of DOD’s Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) office, will leave after two years in the role.

“On behalf of the entire Department of Defense, I thank Bob Daigle for his extraordinary service over the past two years,” Shanahan said.

He adds that Daigle and his team “have been key architects of the investment strategies that ensure our military is ready to compete, deter, and win in any high-end fight of the future. These investments have formed the foundation for our Department's FY19 and FY20 strategy-driven budgets, enabling DoD to field new technologies and weapons systems at the speed of relevance.

“We wish Bob and his family all the best in his future endeavors. His strong leadership will be missed across the Department.”

Defense News reported that Daigle is leaving in mid-May to rejoin the private sector.

Daigle had led CAPE since August 2017, overseeing several major decisions, including the move to shutter the USS Truman aircraft carrier — a plan overturned by the Trump administration earlier this week. He also was behind the requirement that the Air Force buy more F-15X fighter aircraft, though service leaders had not asked for them.

His departure adds to the growing number of top positions left empty or filled by individuals in an acting basis, including the secretary and deputy secretary of defense, the Pentagon's chief management officer, the office of the undersecretary of personnel and readiness and the Air Force secretary."
Did the Department of Justice Give the Mueller Letter to the Post to Screw the Times?,https://www.vanityfair.com,"['Joe Pompeo', 'Vanity Fair', 'Bess Levin']",,,,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/05/did-the-department-of-justice-give-the-mueller-letter-to-the-post,"It was a familiar one-two in the age of Trump. On Tuesday, the day before Attorney General William Barr’s Senate testimony, The Washington Post published a staggering scoop, one that’s driven the news ever since: Robert Mueller had written a letter to Barr complaining that his initial summary of the Mueller report “did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance” of the special counsel’s work.

Minutes later, The New York Times published a story with almost precisely the same reporting. “I felt a flashback to the days of 2017 and 2018 when the Times and the Post published dueling scoops the way fighters trade blows,” CNN’s Brian Stelter remarked in his newsletter that night.

The Times and the Post are both well sourced and are often in pursuit of the same stories. In this instance, however, the Times has been left with the distinct impression that the Department of Justice intentionally screwed it by helping its competitor get the scoop. “We’ll certainly be more cautious going forward when we deal with D.O.J.,” a Times reporter familiar with the matter told me. (A D.O.J. official likewise told me the department will do the same when dealing with the Times.)

Here’s what happened, as far as I’ve been able to piece it together from multiple sources with direct knowledge of how things went down: the D.O.J. learned on Sunday that the Times was working on a story about the letter, which Mueller sent to Barr on March 27. The Times believes it was the first news outlet to nail down reporting on the letter and reach out to the D.O.J. On Tuesday, the D.O.J. confirmed the letter not to the Times, but to Devlin Barrett of the Post, and also allowed him to review it. Barrett and Matt Zapotosky broke the story for the Post just after 7 P.M. The Times immediately rushed out a story by Mark Mazzetti and Michael Schmidt, followed by other news outlets. By the next day, Times reporters had heard from contacts within the D.O.J. that the department had wanted “to teach Schmidt a lesson.” Here’s where the plot thickens: It turns out the Post had its first conversations about the letter with the D.O.J. the previous week, and from its perspective, it got the story fair and square.

In recent days, within the club of journalists who report on federal-law enforcement, there’s been a lot of chatter about how the Mueller letter leaked, and depending on who you talk to, the D.O.J. either laid some dark arts on the Times, or played ball with the Post in a respectable way. But the one thing that’s abundantly clear, based on hours of conversations I had about the episode on Friday, is that the tiff has only inflamed tensions between the D.O.J. and at least some of the Times reporters who cover it. (The Times and the D.O.J. declined to comment, as did the Post.)

Even before this, it’s safe to say there was no love lost between the D.O.J. and the Times, which by now has logged a deep backlist of stories—many carrying Schmidt’s byline—that have triggered conniptions at 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, such as last year’s article about Deputy A.G. Rod Rosenstein reportedly suggesting that he might secretly record President Donald Trump, or that piece from April 3 reporting that some members of Mueller’s team thought Barr “failed to adequately portray the findings of their inquiry.” At least one D.O.J. official has communicated to Times reporters that the department believes the Times sits on stories, only to drop them at crucial moments—say, immediately before a high-profile congressional hearing. As a journalist from another news outlet observed, “In general, there’s a lot of bad blood at this point.”

At the same time, the truth is that reporting can be a film-noir activity, filled with horse-trading and dirty tricks and black eyes. As another Times reporter familiar with the situation put it, “If you’re gonna play in this sandbox on a big story, shit like this happens. But the game goes on.”

Senate Democrats missed the point with their questions for William Barr,https://thehill.com,[],05-04-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/442107-senate-democrats-missed-the-point-with-their-questions-for-william-barr,"High profile hearings in Congress often look like a casting call for actors reading a low budget slasher film script. The key is that look of shock and disgust regardless of what the witness answers. The standout performer is Senator Cory Booker, who has mastered that “I Know What You Did Last Summer” look, even when asking the most mundane or mixed questions. He knows that, in this genre, the script is less important than the optics.

Indeed, the hearing with Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrSanders voices support for voting to hold Barr in contempt Schumer: Graham 'has an obligation' to ask Mueller to testify Anticipation builds for Mueller testimony MORE this week seemed, at times, to involve two scripts for two different movies, with Barr reading from the 2000s “Drag Me To Hell” while Senate Democrats read from the 1970s “I Spit On Your Grave.” Senator Mazie Hirono Mazie Keiko HironoSenate Democrats missed the point with their questions for William Barr Hirono electrifies left as Trump antagonist Harris requests probe into if Trump pressured Barr to open investigations MORE did not even stop to listen for his responses before denouncing his failure to answer questions.

This is why both compound and vague questions are generally barred in actual cross examination. Barr looked evasive and uncomfortable, even though he explained that his concern was that conversations clearly did cover possible investigations but he was never asked to open one. The distinction makes for bad television but is a legally important point here.

While I have been critical of Comey, he was absolutely right in his objections to the inquiries from Trump. Past presidents generally avoided meeting alone with FBI directors, much less recklessly pressing them on investigations that touched on political or personal interests.

A demand from the White House for an investigation can raise serious questions of political influence over prosecutorial decisions. However, the line can be blurry. Presidents often call for investigations on issues of national importance. After a police shooting in Ferguson, Missouri, for example, President Obama held a press conference in which he was heralded for announcing that he had ordered the Justice Department and the FBI to both “independently investigate the death of Michael Brown.”

The Justice Department is part of the executive branch, and there is often discussion of the priorities and controversies involved in its investigations. For that very reason, Democrats were not aghast when former Attorney General Eric Holder Eric Himpton HolderSenate Democrats missed the point with their questions for William Barr McConnell: Courts will resolve Trump-Dems subpoena fight House Dems seek to make officials feel the pain MORE publicly proclaimed he was a “wingman” for Obama. Likewise, Democrats applauded Obama when he ordered the Justice Department not to prosecute certain immigration cases. The line that cannot be crossed is the direction or influence of such an investigation.

Anyone can ask the Justice Department to look into allegations of criminal conduct. The Justice Department then makes an independent decision on whether to investigate. This includes members of Congress, who often call upon the Justice Department to investigate individuals despite their interests. Indeed, Harris has repeatedly done so, including calling for the Justice Department inspector general to investigate Barr. There is nothing improper in such a request, even if it has more political than legal merit.

Take the latest request from Senate Democrats for an investigation into Barr and Rosenstein reaching a conclusion on the obstruction evidence after Mueller had refused to do so. They wrote in a letter to the Justice Department inspector general, “It is unclear what statute, regulation, or policy led the attorney general to interject his own conclusion” that the conduct of the president did not amount to obstruction of justice here.

It is a bizarre question since the United States Code says, “All functions of other officers of the Department of Justice and all functions of agencies and employees of the Department of Justice are vested in the attorney general,” with a couple narrow exceptions dealing with administrative judges and prisons. The Justice Department makes the prosecutorial decisions, and the ultimate decision maker here is the attorney general.

What makes the request even more curious is the omission of the more obvious question. Why did Mueller not reach a decision? As I wrote on the day that Barr released his summary of the Mueller report to Congress, it is perfectly incomprehensible that Mueller did not reach a conclusion. After reading his report, his reasons for refusing are even more inscrutable.

The special counsel is mandated to “provide the attorney general with a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions reached by the special counsel.” While the report references the Justice Department policy not to indict a sitting president, nothing suggests that a special counsel cannot reach a conclusion on the evidence of criminal conduct by a president. If there was any doubt on Justice Department policy, it should have been clarified when Barr and Rosenstein, who oversee Mueller, pressed him to reach a conclusion. Barr still cannot explain the rationale for a special counsel not reaching a conclusion.

He is not alone. Democrats have also called for an investigation of what they view as a “lack of impartiality” under the attorney general. Harris expressed surprise that Barr did not personally review the underlying evidence, consisting of millions of documents and records, collected by Mueller before reaching his conclusion on obstruction. What she ignored is that such an independent review would have negated the work by Mueller. As Barr correctly stated, “We accepted the statements in the report as factual record. We did not go underneath it to see whether or not they were accurate.” Democrats presumably would want him to do that instead of substitute his own facts for those of the special counsel.

Harris was not wrong in pressing Barr on any White House pressure to open investigations. However, there is nothing improper with the White House raising priorities and controversies with the attorney general. What raises serious ethical concerns is when those cases directly impact a president or his campaign. An attorney general should push back on anything he or she views as efforts to influence prosecutorial decisions.

Of course, every good slasher film has a sequel, and there are several in the works in this case with the calls for Mueller, Rosenstein, and former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify. Congress has every right to call on these officials, and the suggestion from Trump that he will block McGahn would be entirely unjustified. But if Congress truly wants answers and not just optics, it might try keeping the jump scares to a minimum.

Code Pink refusing to leave Venezuela’s DC embassy as State Dept. slams ‘trespassers’,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Alex Pappas', 'Alex Pappas Is A Politics Reporter At Foxnews.Com. Follow Him On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/code-pink-refusing-to-leave-venezuelas-dc-embassy-as-state-dept-slams-trespassers,"Liberal activists from the anti-war group Code Pink are refusing to leave the abandoned Venezuelan embassy in Washington, vowing to protect the building from a “hostile takeover” as the U.S. State Department labels them “trespassers” and calls on them to leave.

About 50 pro-regime activists have been living inside the building for several weeks in support of embattled socialist President Nicolas Maduro. In recent days, they’ve clashed outside the embassy with supporters of opposition leader Juan Guaido, who has called for a military uprising in Venezuela and has the support of the Trump administration.

VENEZUELANS CLASH WITH PRO-MADURO CODE PINK ACTIVISTS IN TENSE SCENE OUTSIDE DC EMBASSY

“We feel that the elected government and the government that holds power and the government that’s recognized by the United Nations is the Maduro government, and they deserve to have their embassy here,” Code Pink co-founder Medea Benjamin told Fox News in an interview outside the embassy in D.C.'s Georgetown neighborhood, as rain drenched the activists outside. “That’s why we’ve been here.”

The United States and others countries believe Maduro's most recent election was fraudulent and have said he's not the legitimate president of Venezuela. But Benjamin has repeatedly said activists are there to prevent a “hostile takeover” of the embassy. Benjamin said the group has the permission of the Maduro government to stay in the embassy.

A State Department spokesperson in a Thursday statement called for the activists to leave, saying, “Any unauthorized individuals on the property are trespassers.”

“The Venezuelan government, led by interim President Juan Guaido, has legal authority over the Venezuelan Embassy in Washington, D.C.,” the spokesperson said, adding, “We encourage the remaining unauthorized individuals to vacate the building and to conduct any future protest peacefully and through legal means.”

On Tuesday, flag-waving and national-anthem singing demonstrators, many of whom were born in Venezuela, quickly outnumbered those from Code Pink. They gathered outside the embassy to protest Code Pink members' presence, demanding they leave.

“This group – the Code Pink – has taken the embassy,” one pro-Guaido protester, Giuliano Gandullia, 40, told Fox News outside the embassy. “We want to enter. We want to take over. And demonstrate that it belongs to us.”

The gathering of protesters on Tuesday forced city police in Washington to close down 30th Street, as uniformed Secret Service officers stood between the Maduro and Guaido protesters.

But while law enforcement has been on the scene during protests, the activists inside have not been arrested or forced out.

Alaina Gertz, a spokeswoman for the D.C. police, said any police “involvement would be on public space and not diplomatic property.”

A Secret Service spokesman official said the Secret Service Uniformed Division’s Foreign Missions Branch patrols diplomatic locations in Washington’s embassy district, and officers have been on scene to public safety during ongoing demonstrations.

Two Code Pink protesters standing at the door of the embassy this week held a sign that said: “Hands off Venezuela.” Another sign hanging from the building read, “Nicolas Maduro is the president.”

VENEZUELA SEES UNREST AS GUAIDÓ SEEKS POWER

On Thursday afternoon, amid a downpour, Benjamin said the group isn’t afraid of being evicted and wouldn’t contemplate what the activists would do if Maduro leaves the country.

“I think it’s a silly question,” Benjamin said. “Because Maduro is not going to leave.”

Code Pink refers to the group's presence as the “Embassy Civilian Protection Collective” and says the pro-Guaido protesters are stopping new people, food and supplies from getting inside the building. Until recently, the group said, they were enjoying themselves.

“Inside it’s a very good collective – until this very aggressive mob showed up,” Benjamin said. “We were having events every single night. We were doing educational activities. We had over 100 hundred people coming into the events.”

Meanwhile, the pro-Guaido protesters are outside the embassy holding signs like “Venezuela wants Democracy, not another Cuba.” In interviews, these protesters emphasized that they are from Venezuela – unlike many of the Code Pink protesters.

“Those people right there, they’re not Venezuelan. They don’t have a passport. They don’t have our IDs,” said 32-year-old Clemente Pinate, who said he is from the country and came to the United States when he was 12.

The Guaido protesters are using bullhorns to call on Code Pink to the leave the embassy, which was officially closed by Maduro earlier this year.

“We’re here today to denounce the trespassing of Code Pink,” said Carla Bustillos, 39. “This is a property of the people of Venezuela. It’s an asset of the nation, and the nation is now facing a transition -- a transition to democracy.”"
Trump official names former Secret Service head to top DHS post,https://thehill.com,[],05-03-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/442096-trump-official-names-former-secret-service-head-to-top-dhs-post,"Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan has named Randolph “Tex” Alles, the former head of the Secret Service, to a top Homeland Security post.

McAleenan announced Friday that Alles, who stepped down as Secret Service director this week, will take over as acting Deputy Under Secretary for Management at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

ADVERTISEMENT In his role, Alles ""will oversee all aspects of the Department’s management programs, including financial, human capital, information technology, procurement, security, and asset management,"" according to the DHS statement.

The post has been held by Chip Fulghum, who stepped up to fill the position following the departure of Claire Grady. Grady, who served as DHS's acting deputy secretary, resigned last month amid a shakeup at the department.

""Mr. Fulghum has served the men and women of DHS with distinction since first joining in 2012, and we are forever grateful for his service. I wish him the very best in the years ahead,"" McAleenan said in the statement Friday.

The White House announced last month that Alles was being replaced as Secret Service director by James Murray, the former deputy assistant director of the Office of Protective Operations.

Alles departed the agency amid reports that his relationship with Trump had soured for months. Trump reportedly made fun of the Secret Service director’s appearance, calling him “Dumbo” because of his ears.

DOJ Asks Courts To Lighten Up On Qualcomm As It Battles China For 5G Supremacy,https://dailycaller.com,"['Chris White', 'Energy Reporter']",05-03-2019,2019,5,https://dailycaller.com/2019/05/03/doj-qualcomm-technology/,"The Department of Justice wants the legal system to go lenient on Qualcomm as the telecommunications giant wrestles with a Federal Trade Commission lawsuit claiming the company is a monopoly.

“[I]n the event that the court finds liability on any of the FTC’s claims, the court should order additional briefing and hold a hearing on issues related to a remedy,” the DOJ said in a statement of interest filed in a U.S. district court in California. The court should be careful, the DOJ added, noting its concerns that a punishment could affect fifth generation mobile phone development.

“There is a plausible prospect that an overly broad remedy in this case could reduce competition and innovation in markets for 5G technology and downstream applications that rely on that technology,” the DOJ wrote Thursday. “Such an outcome could exceed the appropriate scope of an equitable antitrust remedy. Moreover, it has the distinct potential to harm rather than help competition.”

Officials are not happy with the lawsuit. Representatives with the Department of Defense, for instance, had sit-down discussions with the FTC in March to encourage the agency to stop suing Qualcomm. They argued that financial losses from a court defeat would hamper Qualcomm’s ability to compete with China’s top chip maker, Huawei.

Qualcomm’s legal troubles began in 2017 when Apple started complaining that some of the technology in the telecom’s patent bundle also is in its chips. In short, Qualcomm is getting paid twice for the same technology, Apple argued. The FTC sued Qualcomm in January 2017 as well over the same complicated reason.

Apple licensed Qualcomm’s technology for the iPhone, helping the phone maker break into the wireless industry. The decision allowed Apple to concentrate on making touchscreen computers and helped turn marketing genius Steve Jobs’ project into the most valuable company on Earth. (RELATED: DOD Officials Warn Trump Administration To Stop Hassling Giant 5G Developer)

The companies finally agreed in April to dismiss all litigation stemming from the disagreement, with both companies hammering out a six-year licensing agreement and a multiyear supply agreement. Apple will pay Qualcomm an unspecified amount, according to the companies’ statement.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration is targeting Huawei, one of Qualcomm’s biggest competitors, in a seemingly unrelated matter. The DOD charged the Chinese telecommunications giant in January on several counts of fraud as President Donald Trump applies more pressure on China’s beleaguered economy.

Officials accused executive Meng Wanzhou of bank fraud, wire fraud and violating U.S. sanctions on Iran. Meng, the CFO of Huawei and daughter of the company’s founder, was arrested in December 2018 in Vancouver by the Canadian Justice Department. China warned Canada in December that it faces “severe consequences” if officials don’t release the executive.

Trump continues to press U.S. telecommunications companies to blow past China. “I want 5G, and even 6G, technology in the United States as soon as possible. It is far more powerful, faster, and smarter than the current standard,” the president told his Twitter followers in February.

FTC did not respond to The Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment and Qualcomm refused to make a statement.

White House counsel Emmet Flood derides Mueller report for failing to ‘comply’ with DOJ regulations,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Rowan Scarborough']",05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/may/4/white-house-counsel-emmet-flood-derides-mueller-re/,"The White House is ridiculing Robert Mueller’s Russia report, saying it reads like a law student’s paper while not following the law or regulation for a special counsel.

The criticism comes in an April 19 letter from White House counsel Emmet T. Flood, President Trump’s new point man for the Russia legal battles ahead. Mr. Flood also accused Mr. Mueller’s team of Democratic-donor prosecutors of being political and lashed out at former FBI Director James Comey.

It marked Mr. Flood’s first salvo against the Muller report and signals a tough White House stance against congressional Democrats who are reinvesting Russia and targeting President Trump’s businesses.

“The SCO Report suffers from an extraordinary legal defect: It quite deliberately fails to comply with the requirements of governing law,” Mr. Flood wrote to Attorney General William Barr in a hand-delivered letter.

Mr. Flood said Justice Department regulation calls for the special counsel to do one of two tasks: prosecute or decline.

“The SCO instead produced a prosecutorial curiosity — part ‘truth commission’ report and part law school exam paper,” said Mr. Flood, a veteran of President Bill Clinton’s impeachment.

Mr. Mueller punted to Mr. Barr a decision on whether to find that Mr. Trump obstructed justice. Mr. Barr concluded he did not.

Mr. Muller said he couldn’t conclude that “no criminal conduct occurred.” Mr. Flood said that is not a federal prosecutor’s job.

“In closing its investigation,” Mr. Flood said, quoting the regulation, “the SCO had only one job to ‘provide the Attorney General with a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions reached by the Special Counsel.’ Yet the one thing the SCO was obligated to do is the very thing the SCO — intentionally and unapologetically — refused to do.”

Mr. Flood bluntly accused Mr. Mueller’s staff of politicizing the report when they wrote they couldn’t “exonerate” Mr. Trump.

“The SCO’s inverted-proof standard and ‘exoneration’ statements can be understood only as political statements, issuing from persons (federal prosecutors) who in our system of government are rightly expected never to be political in the performance of their duties,” he said. “The inverted burden of proof knowingly embedded in the SCO’s conclusion shows that the Special Counsel and his staff failed in their duty to act as prosecutors and only as prosecutors.”

Conservatives believe Mr. Mueller’s staff leaked a letter to the news media in which the special counsel criticized Mr. Barr’s four-page outline of the final report. The leak came on the eve of Mr. Barr’s Senate testimony last Wednesday. Mr. Barr later released the entire 448-page report with relatively light redactions.

Mr. Flood noted that Mr. Trump made his entire White House staff available for Mueller questioning, following the advice of then-defense counsel John Dowd.

“With the release of the SCO Report, and despite all of the foregoing, the President has followed through on his consistent promise of transparency,” Mr. Flood said. “He encouraged every White House staffer to cooperate fully with the SCO and, so far as we are aware, all have done so. Voluntary interviewees included the Counsel to the President, two Chiefs of Staff, the Press Secretary and numerous others. In addition , approximately 1.4 million pages of documents were provided to the SCO.”

Mr. Flood warned that the White House may invoke executive privilege in dealing with Democrats’ demands for witnesses and documents.

He harshly criticized Mr. Comey for leaking to the New York Times his memos on his meetings with Mr. Trump with the aim of causing a special counsel appointment, which happened.

“Not so long ago, the idea that a law enforcement official might provide the press with confidential governmental information for the proclaimed purpose of prompting a criminal investigation of an identified individual would have troubled Americans of all political persuasions,” Mr. Flood said. “That the head of our country’s top law enforcement agency has actually done so to the President of the United States should frighten every friend of individual liberty.”

Mr. Mueller’s report did not establish the existence a Trump-Russia conspiracy to interfere in the 2016 election.

Mr. Flood was a partner in the high-powered Williams & Connolly law firm before taking the temporary post of acting-White House counsel in 2018 with the departure of Don McGahn.

A Republican, Mr. Flood advised Mr. Clinton during impeachment and served as a special counsel to President George W. Bush.

William Barr’s Justice Department Just Filed the Most Nakedly Political Brief in the Agency’s History,https://slate.com,['Mark Joseph Stern'],05-02-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/william-barr-doj-obamacare-brief-partisan-hack.html,"Attorney General William Barr testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday in Washington. Win McNamee/Getty Images

On Wednesday afternoon, after Attorney General William Barr finished his truculent and mendacious testimony before the Senate, the Department of Justice filed perhaps the most embarrassing, illogical, and nakedly political brief in the history of the agency. With Barr’s assent, the DOJ argued that the entire Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional because Congress zeroed out the individual mandate’s penalty in 2017. The timing couldn’t be worse. After obliterating his own credibility at the Senate hearing, Barr scorched the Justice Department’s legitimacy, deploying fatuous pseudo-legal arguments to further the Trump administration’s partisan goals. The DOJ will not soon recover from Wednesday’s body blow.

Texas v. United States, the latest assault on the ACA, is built upon a series of sophistries. The case was brought by a coalition of conservative states, led by Texas, which recruited two consultants to serve as plaintiffs. They assert that when Congress reduced the ACA’s penalty to zero dollars, it inadvertently destroyed the whole law—the tax credits, the exchanges, protections for preexisting conditions, Medicaid expansion, everything. According to Texas’ theory, the Supreme Court only upheld the ACA because it interpreted the penalty as a tax. But, they claim, a tax that collects zero dollars is not a true tax. So the individual mandate can no longer be viewed as a tax, rendering it unconstitutional. And because Congress never intended the ACA to function without the individual mandate, the rest of the law must be struck down too.

This leap in logic makes no sense. It is true that taxes typically collect revenue, so perhaps the mandate cannot fairly be called a tax anymore. It could even be true that the zeroed-out penalty is now unconstitutional. But that does not matter, because if the penalty is illegal, it should be severed from the rest of the law. As the Supreme Court recently explained, when one provision of a statute is invalidated, courts should preserve the remainder of the law unless it is “evident” that Congress “would not have enacted those provisions … independently.” In other words, courts that strike down part of a law should not eviscerate the rest of it without evidence that Congress would’ve wanted that extreme result.

Here, congressional intent is about as clear as it can get. In 2017, Congress declined to repeal the entire ACA but chose to zero out the individual mandate’s penalty in the tax bill. By doing so, it declared its belief that the law could function without an operative penalty, a lawful exercise of its legislative powers. But Texas claimed that by amending the ACA, Congress inadvertently demolished it, because the law cannot function without a penalty—even though Congress decided that it could. Thus, according to the plaintiffs, courts should simply sweep aside this legislative intent and invalidate the law top to bottom.

Congressional intent is about as clear as it can get.

In an opinion panned by liberals and conservatives alike, U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor embraced this theory late last year and ruled that the entire ACA is unconstitutional. This view was too militant even for Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ Justice Department, which opted for a compromise position: It alleged that the mandate was unconstitutional but that only a few other provisions must fall with it. This half-measure was still a big deal, because the DOJ urged the courts to kill a centerpiece of the law: its bar on discrimination against people with preexisting conditions. And the DOJ’s brief at the time reflected, as University of Michigan law professor Nicholas Bagley put it, “enormous contempt for the rule of law.” It was, as other scholars noted, “excruciatingly stupid.” But at least the DOJ did not go whole hog, adopting Texas’ radical position that courts should reject Congress’ authority to amend its own law.

Until now. After Barr took control of the DOJ, the agency changed its position and has now told the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that Texas is right—the full ACA is now unconstitutional. With a straight face, the Justice Department argues that, by reducing the mandate to zero dollars, Congress gave Americans a “legal command” to buy health insurance. The Supreme Court has said that such a direct command would be unconstitutional because the mandate could only be justified as a tax. Moreover, the justices who discussed severability said that the ACA cannot function without the mandate. In sum, the DOJ wrote, the mandate is now illegal, it cannot be severed, and so the whole law is unconstitutional.

Where to begin with this lunacy? Start with the DOJ’s framing of the mandate as it stands now. As a factual matter, the ACA currently gives Americans a choice between buying health insurance and paying nothing. There’s no real dispute here; if you forgo insurance, you will suffer no legal consequences. Yet the DOJ interprets the mandate as a “command” that gives Americans “no choice” but to purchase insurance. And its brief insists that Congress created this command in its 2017 tax bill—even though legislators surely knew that the Supreme Court already ruled that such a command would be unconstitutional in 2012’s NFIB v. Sebelius.

It requires willing suspension of disbelief to surmise that by giving Americans a choice not to buy insurance by zeroing out the mandate, Congress actually gave them a “command” to insure themselves. And it taxes credulity to believe that Congress would create this “command” after the Supreme Court stated that such a rule would be unconstitutional.

But imagine for a moment that the DOJ is right—that the Republican-led Congress of 2017 didn’t actually relieve Americans of their duty to buy health insurance but forced them to do so (without any enforcement mechanism). If the courts must strike down this new “legal command,” why should the remainder of the law fall with it? After all, Congress obviously thought the ACA could function without a mandate that raises revenue. To square this circle, the DOJ repeatedly cites the dissent in NFIB, which proclaimed that the mandate could not be severed from the remainder of the law. The Justice Department seems to think that the view of four dissenting justices (in a 2012 case) can override the view of Congress (in 2017 legislation). It appears to have forgotten that a dissent is not law.

The zaniest portion of Wednesday’s brief, however, has to be its effort to salvage the few provisions of the ACA that the current administration likes. It does so by selectively raising the problem of standing. Now, in reality, the individual plaintiffs in this case—two consultants who don’t want to buy health insurance—shouldn’t have standing to sue at all. That requires an injury, and these plaintiffs have none, because they pay no penalty for forgoing insurance. The DOJ casts this problem aside by asserting that they are injured by the “legal command” to insure themselves. And its brief argues that the plaintiffs have standing “to challenge the numerous provisions of the ACA that work together to cause” this injury.

But in a puzzling paragraph, the DOJ adds that the plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge several provisions of the ACA that criminalize health care fraud. Why? The real answer is that the Justice Department is already prosecuting people under these provisions, and those prosecutions would be thwarted if the full law were struck down. But the DOJ avows that while the plaintiffs have standing to challenge almost the entire ACA, they can’t challenge these provisions because they do not “actually injure the individual plaintiffs.” Oh, really? So the rule that insurers not discriminate against people with preexisting conditions, and the tax credits for lower-income Americans, and the expansion of Medicaid in states other than Texas—all these provisions “actually injure” the plaintiffs? But prohibitions on fraud somehow do not? The DOJ makes no effort to defend this evanescent distinction, because it is indefensible.

Barr reportedly opposed adopting this preposterous position but caved to President Donald Trump’s demands. He deserves no credit for his feeble resistance. Barr owns this brief, and it will live on as a testament to his craven lawlessness long after the Supreme Court rejects its casuistry. The Justice Department’s reputation will take years to recover from this nadir, if it ever does. Barr marched his agency to the brink of illegitimacy."
VA Comes Out Against Bills on Medical Marijuana for Veterans,https://www.military.com,['Patricia Kime'],05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.military.com/daily-news/2019/05/02/va-comes-out-against-bills-medical-marijuana-veterans.html,"The Department of Veterans Affairs opposes three legislative proposals that would expand research on medical marijuana at the VA and give veterans access to the drug in states where it is legal.

During a hearing Tuesday on eight VA health-related bills under consideration by Congress, VA officials told House lawmakers that as long as marijuana is illegal under federal law, the department cannot support legislation that promotes its role at the VA.

""[The House Veterans Affairs Committee] can make strong proposals for us to move forward with recommendations of filling out forms and such but, in the end, we need to go back to the [Drug Enforcement Agency] and [Justice Department] for their opinion,"" said Larry Mole, chief consultant for population health at the VA.

Three of the bills before the House Veterans Affairs health subcommittee relate to medical marijuana. One, the Veterans Equal Access Act, H.R. 1647, sponsored by Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Oregon, would allow VA health providers to recommend medical marijuana to their veteran patients and fill out the necessary paperwork for them to enroll in state marijuana programs.

Related content:

Blumenauer, who has introduced the bill in every Congress since 2014, said that, for some veterans, marijuana and cannabis derivatives are lifesavers that keep them from using addictive medications such as opioids to treat post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic pain, seizures and glaucoma. Yet VA health care providers are not allowed to recommend it.

""Opioids steal the lives of 115 Americans every day ... as veterans with PTSD, chronic pain and any number of ailments are looking for relief, lethal opioid overdoses among VA patients are almost twice the national average. We are doing something wrong,"" he said.

Another bill, the VA Medicinal Cannabis Research Act, H.R. 712, would direct the VA to conduct a large-scale clinical trial on the effects of cannabis on conditions such as PTSD and chronic pain.

Bill sponsor Rep. Lou Correa, D-California, said the research would examine the effectiveness of cannabis on various health conditions, as well as delivery methods.

""It's time to do research. It's time for veterans to know what cannabis is good for and what cannabis is not good for,"" Correa said.

A third, the Veterans Cannabis Use for Safe Healing Act, H.R. 2192, would protect veterans' benefits by prohibiting the VA from denying health care and compensation for veterans participating in a state medical marijuana program.

Keita Franklin, the VA's national director of suicide prevention, said that while the department supports medical marijuana research and is currently involved in a trial for treating PTSD, it opposes the bills.

According to Franklin, VA doctors would be subject to criminal prosecution if they recommended medical marijuana or made referrals to state agencies, as specified by DEA guidance.

And Correa's bill, she said, would not follow standard practice in medical research.

""Typically, a smaller early-phase trial would advance our knowledge and the benefits and risks regarding cannabis before moving to the expansive approach described in this legislation,"" she said. ""Any trial involving human subjects must include an evaluation on the risks and the safety, and include the smallest number of participants to avoid putting the subjects at increased risk unnecessarily. For these reasons, we don't support this legislation.""

She added that the third piece of legislation is unnecessary because VA policy states that the department cannot deny benefits based on marijuana use, although VA physicians are allowed to tailor a patient's prescription medications based on whether they are using cannabis.

Veterans advocates who testified expressed varying levels of support for the bills.

Carlos Fuentes, director of national legislative service for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, said the VFW does not support the Veterans Equal Access bill because it doesn't think the VA should recommend unproven medical treatments, nor should it authorize a treatment for a veteran that would require the former service member to get it outside the VA, where they would be responsible for finding a quality product and paying for it.

The VFW does, however, support VA research on cannabis.

""VA's overreliance on opioids to treat chronic pain and other conditions has led to addiction and even deaths. To its credit ... VA has reduced the number of patients to whom it has prescribed opioids by 22 percent. Now, VA must expand research on the efficacy of nontraditional alternatives to opioids,"" Fuentes said.

Joy Ilam, national legislative director for Disabled American Veterans, agreed.

""We want to make sure there is no harm done. Research is the first step in doing that,"" Ilam said.

Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America research director Stephanie Mullen said the IAVA supports cannabis research and access to it.

""It's past time for VA to catch up,"" Mullen said. ""Veterans are suffering from their injuries today.""

Among the other bills and draft bills discussed at the hearing was one that seeks to expand complementary and alternative therapies and treatments at VA medical facilities, and another that would require the VA to report suicides and attempts that occur on VA campuses within a week of them happening.

Franklin said the VA supports both proposals.

"EPA Seeks Public Comment on Use of Monsanto’s Weedkiller, Glyphosate on Oats Used in Foods Marketed to Kids",https://www.ewg.org,[],,,,https://www.ewg.org/release/epa-seeks-public-comment-use-monsanto-s-weedkiller-glyphosate-oats-used-foods-marketed-kids,"WASHINGTON – The Environmental Protection Agency is formally requesting feedback on a petition submitted by EWG and food companies seeking to significantly limit the use of glyphosate, the active ingredient in Bayer/Monsanto’s weedkiller Roundup, on oats that are used to make a wide array of children’s foods, like breakfast bars and cereals.

EPA announced today that it will open up a 30-day public comment period beginning Monday, May 6.

Two rounds of laboratory tests commissioned by EWG found glyphosate in nearly every sample of oat-based cereal and other breakfast products at levels higher than what EWG considers protective for children’s health.

“No parent should worry whether feeding their children healthy oat-based foods will also expose them to a chemical linked to cancer,” said EWG Legislative Director Colin O’Neil.

“If EPA ultimately supports this petition, it could be the beginning of the end for one of the primary sources of glyphosate exposure in the diets of both children and adults,” said O’Neil. “We can be sure that the pesticide/agrichemical lobby won’t sit on the sidelines, though. Over the next month, it will be paramount that EPA hear from as many Americans as possible in order to build the necessary pressure to finally prohibit this needless use of Monsanto’s cancer-causing weedkiller.”

“For far too long, millions of Americans have been getting a dose of this toxic herbicide along with their breakfast,” said EWG Senior Science Advisor for Children’s Environmental Health Olga Naidenko, Ph.D. “If the EPA really cares about children’s health, it should cut off the largest source of glyphosate exposure from foods that children eat daily.”

The EPA’s legal limit on glyphosate residues is 30 parts per million, or ppm. The petition, joined by 18 industry leaders, asks the EPA to set a more protective standard of 0.1 ppm, which was the legal limit in 1993.

Over the past 25 years, the EPA has increased the amount of glyphosate residue allowed on oats 300-fold. The first increase, to 20 ppm, was granted in response to a 1997 petition from Monsanto, when farmers around the world first began using glyphosate widely as a late-season drying agent. It was increased to the current 30 ppm level in 2008.

Since then, scientists have linked glyphosate to cancer, and researchers around the world have called for stricter limits on glyphosate exposures.

In 2015, 17 of the world’s top cancer researchers convened by the International Agency for Research on Cancer reviewed hundreds of studies on glyphosate and voted unanimously to classify the weedkiller as “probably carcinogenic to humans.” In 2017, California added glyphosate to its official list of chemicals known to cause cancer.

A new analysis of glyphosate, released in April by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, gives weight to studies connecting glyphosate and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and recommends monitoring children’s exposure to this toxic weedkiller.

The petition, first filed in September by EWG, now includes MegaFood, Ben & Jerry’s, Stonyfield Organic, MOM’s Organic Market, Nature’s Path, One Degree Organic Foods, National Co+op Grocers, Happy Family Organics, Amy’s Kitchen, Clif Bar & Company, Earth’s Best Organic, GrandyOats, INFRA, KIND Healthy Snacks, Lundberg Family Farms, Organic Valley, Patagonia Provisions and PCC Community Markets.

"Devin Nunes asks CIA, FBI, NSA, and State Department for docs on Joseph Mifsud",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/devin-nunes-asks-cia-fbi-nsa-and-state-department-for-docs-on-joseph-mifsud,"Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., is requesting documents from a slew of federal agencies about Maltese academic Joseph Mifsud, the man who told former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos the Russians had thousands of Hillary Clinton's emails.

The House Intelligence Committee ranking member seeks information about who Mifsud was working for at the time and wrote in a letter that special counsel Robert Mueller “omits any mention of a wide range of contacts Mifsud had with Western political institutions and individuals"" in his report on Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Mifsud, a London-based professor, has long been suspected to have deep ties to Russian intelligence and is an elusive figure that has stayed out of the spotlight in recent years.

Mueller's 448-page report, released last month with redactions, states that Mifsud traveled to Moscow in April 2016, after which he met Papadopoulos in London. It was at this meeting that Mifsud informed Papadopoulos that during his trip he learned that the Russians had “dirt” on Clinton, President Trump's Democratic rival in the 2016 election. Papadopoulos later repeated this claim to Australian diplomat Alexander Downer, who informed the FBI and prompted the original counterintelligence investigation into President Trump's campaign in July 2016.

As part of Mueller’s Russia investigation, Papadopoulos pleaded guilty in October 2017 to making false statements to the FBI about his contacts with Russians and served 12 days in prison late last year.

The special counsel’s sentencing memo to the District Court for the District of Columbia said Papadopoulos hindered the FBI's ability to get to Mifsud. ""The defendant’s lies undermined investigators’ ability to challenge the Professor or potentially detain or arrest him while he was still in the United States. The government understands that the Professor left the United States on February 11, 2017 and he has not returned to the United States since then,"" the memo said.

In his letter, Nunes says it is ""still a mystery how the FBI knew to ask Papadopoulos specifically about Hillary Clinton’s emails"" if the bureau had not spoken with Mifsud.

Nunes asks Central Intelligence Agency Director Gina Haspel, FBI Director Chris Wray, National Security Agency Director Paul Nakasone, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to hand over all documents they have on Mifsud by May 10.

The letter, obtained by Washington Examiner, contains photographic evidence of Mifsud in close proximity to Western officials.

""If he is in fact a Russian agent, it would be one of the biggest intelligence scandals for not only the United States, but also our allies like the Italians and the Brits and others. Because if Mifsud is a Russian agent, he would know all kinds of our intelligence agents throughout the globe,"" Nunes said during an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity."
Interior Dept. Loosens Offshore-Drilling Safety Rules Dating From Deepwater Horizon,https://www.nytimes.com,['Coral Davenport'],05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/climate/offshore-drilling-safety-rollback-deepwater-horizon.html,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Thursday made public its rollback of a major offshore-drilling safety regulation, significantly weakening an Obama-era rule that was put in place after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion in the Gulf of Mexico, which killed 11 people and sent 4.9 million barrels of oil gushing into the sea, causing the worst oil spill in American history.

Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, a former oil lobbyist who was confirmed by the Senate last month to head the agency that oversees the nation’s public lands and waters, announced the plan Thursday afternoon in Port Fourchon, La., the vast industrial hub that serves as the onshore base for most companies that drill in the Gulf of Mexico.

The oil industry praised the move. Environmental groups warned that the rollbacks could pave the way for similar crises to happen again.

The weakened safety rules come as the Trump administration has also sought to vastly expand offshore drilling in the nation’s waters. Last year the Interior Department proposed opening almost the entire United States coastline to drilling, although Mr. Bernhardt recently said the administration may delay those plans while court challenges are addressed."
Trump administration proposal would make it easier to deport immigrants who use public benefits,https://www.cnbc.com,['Tucker Higgins'],05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/03/doj-weighs-making-it-easier-to-deport-immigrants-on-public-benefits.html,"US President Donald Trump tours the border wall between the United States and Mexico in Calexico, California, April 5, 2019.

The Trump administration is considering reversing long-standing policy to make it easier to deport U.S. legal permanent residents who have used public benefits, part of an effort to restrict immigration by low-income people.

A Department of Justice draft regulation, seen by Reuters, dramatically expands the category of people who could be subject to deportation on the grounds that they use benefits.

Currently, those legal permanent residents who are declared to be a ""public charge,"" or primarily dependent on the government for subsistence, can be deported — but in practice, this is very rare.

The draft regulation would use a more expansive definition to include some immigrants who have used an array of public benefits, including cash welfare, food stamps, housing aid, or Medicaid.

While the plan is at an early stage, might not become official government policy, and is likely to attract lawsuits, it is one part of efforts by the Trump administration to restrict legal immigration, in addition to its efforts to reduce illegal immigration to the United States.

The full possible impact is not known, but the change in policy could affect permanent residents — also known as ""green card"" holders — who are legally entitled to use public benefits soon after their arrival in the United States, such as refugees.

A Department of Justice spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

U.S. law allows for the deportation of immigrants who have become ""public charges"" within five years of admission if their reason for seeking help preceded their entry to the United States — for example, if they had a chronic health condition that was not disclosed.

But due to a 1948 ruling, the deportation of immigrants for using public benefits has been strictly limited to cases in which the government has demanded payment for public services, and the person has failed to pay. Immigration lawyers said they have rarely if ever heard of someone being deported for using public benefits.

The draft rule indicates the government would override that precedent to allow for deportation of some permanent residents who have used certain public benefits within five years of admission.

For the plan to go into effect, it would be subject to public comment, after which it could be revised. Attorney General William Barr would then have to sign off on it.

The public benefits in question include Supplemental Security Income (SSI), given to disabled and older people; the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps; Section 8 housing vouchers; many Medicaid benefits; and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), a cash assistance program.

According to federal policy, many permanent residents do not qualify for public benefits unless they have had a green card for five years, making it unlikely they could be targeted for deportation on the basis of ""public charge"" even under the draft rule.

But dozens of states have looser rules — for instance, allowing pregnant women and children who are permanent residents to access Medicaid without a waiting period. And the effort to tighten the rules could affect thousands of immigrant veterans, refugees and asylees, who are eligible to receive many benefits without time restrictions. Active members of the military would not be affected.

Administration officials had earlier indicated that the Justice Department, which oversees U.S. immigration courts, planned to issue a regulation on who can be deported for using public benefits, but its details were not previously known."

Trump’s Justice Department doesn’t understand that four is less than five,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/trump-obamacare-case-texas-fifth-circuit-871aecda0599/,"There is literally no rule more basic to U.S. litigation than the rule of five. The Supreme Court has nine seats. It takes a majority to decide a case. A decision joined by five or more justices is a binding interpretation of the law that controls all other court decisions. An opinion dissenting from such a decision is just someone’s views.

And yet, a pair of briefs filed Wednesday evening by a team of anti-Obamacare lawyers — including one filed by the Trump Justice Department and another filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on behalf of several red states — fails to grasp this rudimentary rule. Both briefs, in a case asking a federal court to repeal the entirety of Obamacare, rely heavily on a dissenting opinion by four of the Supreme Court’s most conservative members. And a dissenting opinion, by definition, is not the law.

The case is Texas v. United States.

Making something of nothing

As originally enacted, the Affordable Care Act’s “individual mandate” required most Americans to either obtain health insurance or pay higher income taxes. The Supreme Court famously upheld this provision of the original, 2010 law as a valid exercise of Congress’ power to tax.

Seven years later, after Congress spent the better part of the year debating plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act in its entirety and failed to enact any one of these plans, Congress passed a tax law which contained a single provision changing the tax penalty for failing to buy insurance to zero dollars. Thus, Congress chose to leave the entire law intact, with the exception that it effectively repealed the individual mandate.

Although the 2017 version of the mandate does nothing — it requires individuals to either carry insurance or pay zero dollars — the Texas plaintiffs claim that it is now unconstitutional on the theory that the Supreme Court upheld it as a tax, but it no longer functions as a tax because it doesn’t collect any tax revenue. That’s a plausible argument, but it should be a purely academic one. Who cares if a provision of the law that literally does nothing is unconstitutional?

Indeed, the fact that the challenged provision does absolutely nothing should be the end of this case. In order to file a federal lawsuit, a plaintiff must have “standing,” meaning that they must be able to show that the law they are challenging injures them in some way. But a zero dollar tax injures no one, so no one has standing to challenge it.

Nevertheless, the Texas plaintiffs ask the courts to ignore this standing requirement and strike down the neutered mandate. Then they seek much, much more.

4 > 5

When a court declares one provision of a larger federal statute unconstitutional, it often must ask whether other, constitutional provisions of the law must fall with it — an inquiry known as “severability.” Severability, by its very nature, is a speculative inquiry. It asks whether Congress would have enacted the constitutional provisions of a law if it had known that the unconstitutional provisions could not take effect.

When engaging in this speculation, moreover, courts must apply a very strong presumption that Congress did not intend for additional provisions to fall. As the Supreme Court explained most recently in Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association, “in order for other . . . provisions to fall it must be ‘evident that [Congress] would not have enacted those provisions which are within its power, independently of [those] which [are] not’”

So Texas is a very easy case, even if you ignore the fact that these plaintiffs lack standing. And even if you concede that the zeroed-out mandate is unconstitutional, we already know what Congress would have done if it had known that the powerless mandate would be struck down. Again, Congress spent the better part of a year debating whether to repeal the Affordable Care Act, ultimately decided not to repeal the law, and then passed a law that canceled just one provision of Obamacare — the individual mandate. That’s conclusive proof that Congress intended to eliminate the mandate while leaving the rest of law intact.

To get around this proof, the Texas plaintiffs and the Trump administration rely heavily on a dissenting opinion penned by four conservative justices in NFIB v. Sebelius, the 2012 decision upholding most of the Affordable Care Act.

In that opinion, the dissenting justices claimed that the original version of the individual mandate — the version that actually did something — is unconstitutional. They then argued that the Affordable Care Act is a carefully balanced machine made up of interlocking regulations, subsidies, and taxes. Remove a major cog in this machine, they argued, and the entire apparatus must fall because each moving part depends on the others.

Texas and the Trump administration argue that this logic should also apply to a decision striking down the zeroed-out, 2017 version of the mandate.

There are more problems with this argument than one can count. The most obvious one is, again, that a dissenting opinion is not the law. Texas’ and the Trump administration’s argument rests on the assumption that four justices are more than five.

Moreover, not only is a dissenting opinion not the law, but a majority of the Supreme Court explicitly rejected the dissent’s argument that the Affordable Care Act is collection of interlocking parts that must stand or fall together. While NFIB left most of the law intact, it did strike down a provision that imposed strict financial consequences on states that rejected Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion.

But NFIB did not hold that, because this one important cog was removed from Obamacare’s machine, the entire law must fall. “We have no way of knowing how many States will accept the terms of the expansion,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the controlling opinion, “but we do not believe Congress would have wanted the whole Act to fall, simply because some may choose not to participate.” The bulk of the law, he noted, “will remain ‘fully operative as a law,’ and will still function in a way ‘consistent with Congress’ basic objectives in enacting the statute.’”

The same logic should apply to Texas. After all, the practical difference between the post-2017 version of the law, which contains a powerless “mandate” that does absolutely nothing, and a different version of the law with the zeroed-out mandate excised, is absolutely nothing. With or without the gelded mandate, the law functions exactly the same. And thus it remains “fully operative as a law” and will “still function in a way ‘consistent with Congress basic objectives'” in enacting the 2017 version of the statute.

And there’s another major problem with Texas and the Trump administration’s reliance on the NFIB dissent. Even if that dissent were the law, it was written in 2012. Murphy was handed down in 2018. Thus, to the extent that the NFIB dissent conflicts with Murphy, it is superseded by Murphy. Courts must uphold the bulk of the Affordable Care Act unless it is “evident” that Congress would not have enacted the bulk of the law without the do-nothing mandate.

The theory behind Texas, in other words, does not have any basis in American law. But the two briefs’ reliance on the NFIB dissent is still revealing. The real premise underlying Texas is that, now that the courts have taken a sharp right turn, dissenting opinions penned by the Supreme Court’s most conservative members should be treated as if they were the law, and the law itself should be ignored.

A least some members of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which will hear Texas in July, appear to agree with this premise — as evidenced by a recent abortion case where the Fifth Circuit defied a recent Supreme Court decision handed down before Justice Anthony Kennedy left the bench. Significantly, Chief Justice Roberts voted to stay the Fifth Circuit’s defiance, signaling to lower courts that they cannot simply ignore the Supreme Court’s decisions.

Texas will be a good test of whether the Fifth Circuit got the message."
Mark Meadows sends criminal referral targeting Nellie Ohr to DOJ,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/mark-meadows-sends-criminal-referral-targeting-nellie-ohr-to-doj,"Nellie Ohr, the wife of Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, is the subject of a criminal referral sent to the Justice Department on Wednesday.

Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., wrote up the referral addressed to Attorney General William Barr, citing concerns that Ohr ""knowingly provided false testimony"" last year to a joint task force of the House Oversight and Judiciary committees that were investigating decisions made by the Justice Department and FBI surrounding the 2016 election.

The Hill reported Meadows, a member of House Oversight, has filed a referral with the Justice Department in the evening Wednesday. The Washington Examiner has not independently confirmed it has been sent and has reached out to Meadows' office.

""During her transcribed interview, Ms. Ohr testified she 'would not have any knowledge of what [was] going on in an ongoing investigation' at DOJ and would not 'have any knowledge of the Department of Justice’s investigations on Russia.' Ms. Ohr also denied she shared her research on Russian organized crime and Donald Trump with individuals outside of Fusion GPS (her employer); her husband, DOJ attorney Bruce Ohr, and Christopher Steele,"" Meadows wrote in the referral.

""However, documents reviewed by our committees raise concerns Ms. Ohr not only had knowledge of an ongoing DOJ investigation, but that she shared information and research on Russian organized crime to assist DOJ, in direct contradiction with her testimony,"" he added.

Ohr conducted research on connections between Russia and President Trump, having been contracted by Fusion GPS, the same opposition research firm behind the infamous Trump dossier. Meadows pointed to emails made public though a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch that show Ohr was in contact with Justice Department officials in 2016.

""For example, in March 2016, DOJ official Lisa Holtyn sent Bruce Ohr an email asking if Nellie would be able to speak with Ivana Nizich and Joe Wheatley to discuss her research as part of an ongoing investigation as she was told 'Nellie might be a great resource.' When Mr. Ohr checked if Nellie would feel comfortable speaking with DOJ, Nellie emailed 'Sure!'"" Meadows said.

""A separate email chain indicates Ms. Ohr shared her research on Russian organized crime in contradiction to her testimony. Specifically, on a separate email chain between Nellie Ohr, Mr. Ohr, Ms. Holtyn, and DOJ officials Joe Wheatley and Ivana Nizich, Ms. Ohr provides the Department of Justice with analysis of Shakro, a Russian mafia boss, and the separatists in the Donbass war,"" he added.

""Taking these communications into account, in addition to other information we have reviewed, Meadows said, ""Ms. Ohr misled the committees when she testified she would not have any knowledge of what was going on in an ongoing DOJ investigation, and that she had not shared her research outside of Fusion GPS, her husband, and Christopher Steele. Truthful witness testimony is crucial to the integrity of investigations conducted by the House of Representatives. Ms. Ohr violated her oath to tell the truth by making demonstrably false statements during her testimony before the Committee. Accordingly, I am referring Nellie Ohr to the Department of Justice for investigation of potential violation(s) of 18 U.S.C.§1001 et seq.""

Ohr testified to the Oversight and Judiciary committees in October. The transcript was made public by Judiciary ranking member Doug Collins in March.

The testimony focused heavily on her time with Fusion GPS and its relationship with the DOJ. Nellie Ohr said she met three times with Christopher Steele, the author of the dossier that contained unverified claims about Russia having compromising information about Trump. The last of those meetings took place on July 30, 2016, a day before the FBI initiated a counterintelligence investigation into links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign. It is believed that FBI agent Peter Strzok, now-infamous for exchanging anti-Trump text messages with a colleague, signed the order that launched the inquiry.

Ohr's husband, Bruce Ohr, acted as an unofficial back channel between the FBI and Steele. He was demoted when it was revealed he met with Steele and Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which commissioned Steele's work. Ohr also told lawmakers his wife shared a thumb drive with him to hand over to the FBI.

The dossier, which contained unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia, has been a subject of concern for GOP lawmakers, particularly for how it was used by the FBI in Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant applications to gain the authority to spy on onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

The FBI suspended its relationship with Steele in October 2016 for unauthorized contact with the media. Despite this, the FBI maintained an unofficial back channel with Steele up to at least November 2017 via Ohr

More criminal referrals from Meadows could be in the works. At an event Tuesday, the congressman said he knows of ""two or three individuals"" tied to Fusion GPS who could be the subject of criminal referrals for lying to Congress."
Russia Says President Trump Initiated Long Phone Call With Putin,http://time.com,['Justin Sink'],,,,http://time.com/5583327/trump-intiated-putin-long-phone-call/,"President Donald Trump initiated a lengthy call with his Russian counterpart on Friday, in which Vladimir Putin urged sanctions relief for North Korea and warned against interference in Venezuela, the Russian embassy in Washington said.

The leaders’ call lasted for 1.5 hours, according to a post on the embassy’s Facebook page, and the pair discussed a “shared commitment to step up dialogue in various areas, including on issues of strategic stability.” White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Friday the leaders spoke for more than an hour.

Trump tweeted about the chat for a second time on Saturday, saying there was “tremendous potential for a good/great relationship with Russia.”

On Friday, Trump told reporters at the White House that Putin had assured him Moscow isn’t seeking to “get involved” in the crisis in Venezuela, despite assertions by the U.S. president’s top national security advisers that the Kremlin is offering critical support to Nicolas Maduro’s regime.

“He is not looking at all to get involved in Venezuela other than he’d like to see something positive happen for Venezuela,” Trump said of Putin. “And I feel the same way.”

The conversation, which Trump went on to describe as “very positive,” appeared to be another example of Trump taking Putin’s claims at face value despite contrary evidence from his own government. Sanders said on Friday that Trump simply was “relaying what President Putin said to him. That’s it.”

The White House national security adviser, John Bolton, and U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo both said earlier this week that the Kremlin talked Maduro out of leaving Venezuela after U.S.-backed opposition leader Juan Guaido attempted to end his regime on May 30 by calling for a military uprising.

In a video message posted Saturday on Twitter, Pompeo said that during an April visit to Cucuta, Colombia, on the Venezuelan border, he’d seen “first hand the misery that Maduro’s created, with the Russians’ and Cubans’ help.”

Russia’s take on Venezuela was that the South American nation has “the right to determine the future of their country” without outside interference, its embassy said. “Attempts to change the government in Caracas by force undermine prospects for a political settlement of the crisis.”

On North Korea, the Russian embassy said Putin and Trump “noted the importance of consistent progress towards denuclearization and achieving long-term normalization on the Korean Peninsula.” Putin briefed Trump about his April 25 meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Vladivostok.

Hours after their talk, North Korea fired numerous short-range projectiles off its eastern coast, according to South Korean authorities, a move seen as Kim’s latest and most provocative signal of frustration over talks with Trump following the pair’s failed summit in Vietnam in February.

Trump said Saturday on Twitter he was confident Kim “does not want to break his promise to me.”

"DOJ calls out Dems for ignoring less-redacted Mueller report, serving subpoena instead",https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-calls-out-dems-mueller-report,"Justice Department officials chided congressional Democrats this week for ignoring a less-redacted version of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia report made available to them, even as they pursue a subpoena for the full document and accuse the department of stonewalling.

The DOJ released a statement hours after Attorney General William Barr had testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee for more than five hours, answering questions about the department’s handling of the report’s release last month. Along with a letter denying access to the completely unredacted report and other files, the statement said that Democrats, including House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., had “refused” so far to review a version of the report with far fewer redactions.

BARR ACCUSES DEMS OF USING CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCESS AS 'POLITICAL WEAPON' AS HEARING TENSIONS FLARE

“The Attorney General also voluntarily released the Special Counsel’s confidential report with minimal redactions to Congress and the public, made an even-less redacted report available to Chairman Nadler and congressional leadership (which they have refused to review), and made himself available to the Committee by volunteering to testify this week,” spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said.

Democrats had objected to Barr’s decision to transmit the report to Congress with redactions, and Nadler has subpoenaed the full report along with underlying materials. But Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd, in the letter to Nadler on Wednesday, said the less-redacted version already available to key members “would permit review of 98.5 percent of the report, including 99.9 percent of Volume II, which discusses the investigation of the President’s actions.”

“Regrettably, before even reviewing the less-redacted version or awaiting the Attorney General’s testimony, you served a subpoena ...” he wrote. “You served such a subpoena knowing that the Department could not lawfully provide the unredacted report, that the Committee lacks any legitimate legislative purpose for seeking the complete investigative files, and that processing your requests would impose a significant burden on the Department.”

One GOP lawmaker said the key section on obstruction in the version that Democrats have ignored contains just four redactions.

Nadler, though, explained Thursday -- at a hearing that Barr was boycotting over the terms of the forum -- that Democrats do not want to see that version because of restrictions placed on viewing it.

He said just a dozen members were allowed to look behind ""some but not all"" of the redactions, provided they agree not to discuss what they see with colleagues and leave notes behind at the DOJ.

“It is urgent that we see the documents we have subpoenaed, but I cannot agree to conditions that prevent me from discussing the full report with my colleagues, that prevent the House from acting on the full report in any meaningful way.”

His counterpart, ranking member Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., fired back that Nadler could always view it and ask for more.

“The chairman won’t even go look at what the attorney general offered him,” he said.

NADLER SLAMS BARR'S DECISION TO SKIP HOUSE HEARING, THREATENS CONTEMPT CITATION

Politico reported Tuesday that only two lawmakers -- Collins and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. -- had viewed the less-redacted version, both of whom said that the changes have no bearing on Mueller’s conclusions. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., was also planning to look at it. Democrats boycotted the less-redacted version, however, saying Barr should provide an unredacted version instead.

Collins, after viewing the report last month, said that the report’s look at the question of potential obstruction “includes only four redactions in total” and reinforces Mueller’s main conclusions that there was no evidence of collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign, and that there was insufficient evidence to bring an obstruction-of-justice charge against President Trump.

By Wednesday evening, however, the controversy had moved to Barr’s scuttled appearance at the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday. Nadler had demanded that Barr be questioned by committee staff instead of lawmakers -- a request that led Barr to decline to show up.

“Congress and the Executive branch are co-equal branches of government, and each have a constitutional obligation to respect and accommodate one another’s legitimate interests. Chairman Nadler’s insistence on having staff question the Attorney General, a Senate-confirmed Cabinet member, is inappropriate,” Kupec said.

That refusal led Democratic Caucus chairman Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., to promise that Democrats ""plan on subpoenaing"" Barr ""if he decides not to show up.""

""He can run but he can’t hide,"" Jeffries said.

Nadler, meanwhile, accused Barr of trying to “blackmail the committee into not following the most effective means of eliciting the information we need.”

""He is terrified of having to face a skilled attorney,” he said.

Although Barr has not yet been subpoenaed to testify, Nadler said contempt citations could be possible down the road not only if the full Mueller report is not released, but also if Barr does not comply with a possible future subpoena.

State Department OKs nearly $6 billion in weapons sales to Gulf allies,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-defense-arms/state-department-oks-nearly-6-billion-in-weapons-sales-to-gulf-allies-idUSKCN1S924P,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has approved a possible $6 billion worth of weapons sales to Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates in three separate packages, the Pentagon said on Friday after notifying Congress of the certification.

The United States depends on allies in the region, including Saudi Arabia, to counter Iranian influence. In April, the U.S. moved ahead with part of a THAAD missile defense system sale to the kingdom.

In one of the notifications sent to Congress on Friday, Bahrain could potentially buy various Patriot missile systems and related support and equipment for an estimated cost of $2.48 billion. That potential Bahraini deal included 36 Patriot MIM-104E Guidance Enhanced Missiles known as GEM-T, an upgrade that can shoot down aircraft and cruise missiles.

In a separate State Department notification sent to Congress, Bahrain was also given the nod for various weapons to support its F-16 Block 70/F-16V aircraft fleet for an estimated cost of $750 million. That package included 32 AIM-9X missiles, 20 AGM-84 Block II Harpoon missiles and 100 GBU-39s which are 250-pound small diameter bombs and other munitions.

In a third State Department notification, the United Arab Emirates was given potential approval for $2.73 billion worth of Patriot missiles and related equipment including 452 Patriot Advanced Capability 3 (PAC-3) Missiles Segment Enhanced (MSE) and related equipment.

The Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified Congress of the possible sale. The notification process alerts Congress that a sale to a foreign country has been approved, but it does not indicate that a contract has been signed or negotiations have concluded.

The principal contractors for the sales were Raytheon Co and Lockheed Martin Co."
Jane Castor at odds with Justice Department over her oversight of Miami police,https://www.tampabay.com,"['Joey Flechas', 'Charles Rabin']",05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2019/05/04/jane-castor-at-odds-with-justice-department-over-her-oversight-of-miami-police/,"The federal agency charged with overseeing use-of-force and training reforms at the Miami police department struck back at the person who has been monitoring those reforms this week, saying it had no intention of ending oversight anytime soon.

Last week, newly-elected Tampa Mayor Jane Castor — a former police chief and the $150-an-hour monitor appointed to oversee the reform of Miami’s policing — said she believed the department had complied with the terms of an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice. They were set in place after a string of deadly police shootings of mostly unarmed black men almost a decade ago.

Miami police quickly agreed with Castor, who was sworn into office this week.

But others criticized both Castor and her recommendation that the agreement be terminated about a year before the March 2020 deadline.

On Thursday, during a meeting of the Citizen Advisory Board, which was created as part of the agreement, a city of Miami employee assigned to the board said he had spoken with Justice Department and that it didn’t agree with Castor’s recommendation.

“It is the Department of Justice’s position that the agreement should not be terminated,” Rodney Jacobs, who investigates police misconduct for the city of Miami, said in a statement. “The independent reviewer has not reported substantial compliance with her quarterly reports and analysis. In the event the reviewer does report that level of compliance, per the agreement the police department must maintain that compliance for one year. “

A Justice Department attorney confirmed DOJ’s position, but wouldn’t comment further. DOJ also declined to answer written questions submitted by the Miami Herald.

PREVIOUS COVERAGE: Miami’s police monitor — new Tampa Mayor Jane Castor — wants to end federal oversight

The rift between Castor and DOJ comes a week after she told Miami leaders she wanted to end the policing agreement a year early because the city had “satisfied all of the requirements of the agreement.” Castor’s comments came two days after she was elected mayor of Tampa.

The agreement between Miami and DOJ was reached three years ago after federal investigators determined that Miami cops had engaged in a pattern of excessive use of deadly force, particularly over a seven-month period almost a decade ago in which police shot and killed seven black men, most of them unarmed. The parties approved the agreement in order to avoid federal courts and costs.

Though members of the advisory board say they are satisfied with the department’s progress on many of the required reforms, they say there is more work to be done. And they said they’re not sure Castor is the right person for the job. During Thursday’s meeting, board members aired frustration with her performance and expressed doubt about her ability to juggle her new mayorship while reviewing police practices and policies in another city.

“How can she continue to do this job?” asked board chairman Justin Pinn.

“I have no confidence in her myself,” added board member Lorena Ramos.

Members lamented about late reports that, in their opinion, lacked depth and didn’t respond to the board’s requests for more analysis. They complained they never received a requested comparison between Miami and other police departments and they said they wanted evidence that the department is pursuing implicit bias training and de-escalation techniques to avoid using force when it’s not necessary.

HISTORIC ELECTION: Jane Castor wins big in Tampa mayor’s race

The board wants the city to negotiate an extension to the agreement so the city has time to hire a new monitor. Members also voted to request that Police Chief Jorge Colina, Mayor Francis Suarez and Castor be present at the next meeting in June to discuss the status of the agreement. If Castor were to exit, both parties would have to agree to a new monitor.

Early on, Castor fell behind schedule in delivering quarterly reports to the Community Advisory Board. On Wednesday, she submitted a report for the last quarter of 2018. The report says there are still two areas related to officer-involved shootings that must be reviewed.

So far, Castor has been paid $154,400.80 for her work, according to the police department.

THE BUZZ: Jane Castor’s historic win captures national spotlight and positions her as Democrats’ ‘rising star’

On Friday, Castor said the agreement stipulates that Miami remain in compliance for a full year before the agreement can be terminated. She said if the Justice Department determines that monitoring should continue and she agreed to do it, she would do so at no cost. She also disagreed that Miami had not yet fully complied with the requirements.

“I felt the Miami police department has reached substantial compliance in all areas of the agreement and they’ve been open and compliant,” the Tampa mayor said Friday.

As for the advisory board asking for an extension and saying that her reports had not been timely or thorough, Castor said she wasn’t sure where that was coming from.

“I’ve been in contact with Justin Pinn. He and I have met just about every time I’ve come down,” Castor said. “It’s the first I’ve heard any concern about the thoroughness of the reports.”

Deputy Miami Police Chief Ron Papier said he continues to believe the city has complied with the DOJ agreement.

“Our position is simple,” Papier said. “We believe the city of Miami police department is in compliance. We’ve done everything that’s been asked of us and will continue to do so.”

Papier said it’s a two-party agreement and that if the Justice Department wishes to keep monitoring the city until the agreement winds down in March of 2020, the department will abide by that agreement. He disagreed with the advisory board’s assessment that the department wasn’t taking the oversight seriously.

“We do take the community advisory board seriously,” said Papier. “Representatives have attended every meeting when asked. I’m not sure what we’re not in compliance with as of now.”

Athens and Griffin fail to make shortlist for USDA agencies,https://www.ajc.com,[],,,,https://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/athens-and-griffin-fail-make-shortlist-for-usda-agencies/gdymfyPnfGuqPs5HdEqy7N/,"Georgia failed to make the shortlist in the headquarters search for two research agencies that the U.S. Department of Agriculture wants to move out of Washington.

In a press release Friday, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced Indiana (multiple sites), the Greater Kansas City area and the Research Triangle region in North Carolina are the department’s top three candidates for the headquarters of the Economic Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture.

St. Louis and Madison, Wis., are listed as alternates.

The failure of Georgia’s two candidates — Athens and Griffin — to make the cut is a blow to a state some observers believed had an inside track to win the two agencies and more than 600 jobs. Perdue is a former governor of Georgia and a former state lawmaker.

“While we would have loved the opportunity to be on USDA’s shortlist, we look forward to connecting with the department and the site selection consultants to hear what we could have done to stay in the process,” said Bert Brantley, the chief operating officer of the state’s Department of Economic Development. “We always want to use these types of projects to get better for the next one that comes along.”

The department said its priorities included low costs of living and operations, workforce quality and access to an international airport.

“Relocation will help ensure USDA is the most effective, most efficient, and most customer-focused agency in the federal government, allowing us to be closer to our stakeholders and move our resources closer to our customers,” Perdue said in the release. “Our commitment to the public and our employees is to continue to be transparent as we proceed with our analysis.”

Though many of Georgia’s GOP congressional members supported the state’s bid, U.S. Rep. Sanford Bishop, D-Albany, tried to block money for the move in spending bills. Bishop is the chairman of a House Appropriations subcommittee with power over USDA funding.

Bishop said Perdue hadn’t produced cost estimates justifying the move, and the congressman raised concerns about a relocation harming morale and the agencies’ objectivity.

The ERS and NIFA conduct and fund agricultural research. Many scientific groups also have panned Perdue’s plans to relocate the agencies.

On Friday, Republican U.S. Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas, the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, applauded the inclusion of the Kansas City area on the department’s shortlist.

“There’s no better place for ERS and NIFA to relocate than Kansas City,” Roberts said in a news release.

Ginnie Mae considering changes to VA loan rules as refinances continue to soar,https://www.housingwire.com,"['Ben Lane Is The Editor For Housingwire. In This Role', 'He Helps Set A Leading Pace For News Coverage Spanning The Issues Driving The U.S. Housing Economy', ""Helps Guide Housingwire'S Overall Direction. Previously"", 'He Worked For Townsquarebuzz', 'A Hyper-Local News Service. He Is A Graduate Of University Of North Texas.']",,,,https://www.housingwire.com/articles/48962-ginnie-mae-considering-changes-to-va-loan-rules-as-refinances-continue-to-soar,"For more than 18 months, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Ginnie Mae, and the Department of Veterans Affairs have been investigating whether certain lenders are aggressively targeting service members and military veterans for quick and potentially risky refinances of their mortgages.

The investigation led to some lenders being booted from Ginnie Mae’s primary mortgage securities platforms, and other lenders being restricted for questionable conduct.

Ginnie Mae even went so far as to issue new rules for VA loan refinances, restricting how soon a loan could be refinanced after its original origination date.

And while Ginnie Mae says that those changes have made a positive impact on its mortgage-backed securities, the agency is also now stating that more changes may be necessary to get the pervasiveness of VA loan refinances under control.

Ginnie Mae on Friday announced that it is seeking input on potential changes to its rules for VA loans. Namely, the agency is considering making more changes to its rule to “address abnormal prepayment patterns in some mortgages pooled in Ginnie Mae MBS that negatively affect MBS pricing.”

Ginnie Mae offers federally insured mortgage bonds for FHA and VA mortgage lenders. And according to the agency, the frequency of refinances, specifically cash-out refinances, is having a negative impact on its mortgage bonds.

Specifically, Ginnie Mae said that some of its securities are not trading where they should be compared to securities issued by Fannie Mae. According to Ginnie Mae, it recently identified “certain adverse trends” in the trading of its securities.

“It’s clear from published analysis and investor commentary that GII MIP securities were believed to be susceptible to refinance activity out of proportion to what should be expected from prevailing economic conditions,” Ginnie Mae said in its request for input.

“Ginnie Mae’s concern, then and now, is that investor trepidation about this activity will negatively impact investor confidence in the performance of the securities and the relative price that they receive in the market,” Ginnie Mae added. “Deterioration in market pricing translates directly into a higher cost of homeownership for the homeowners the Ginnie Mae MBS program is intended to serve.”

Put simply, Ginnie Mae appears to be concerned that investors aren’t as attracted to its mortgage bonds because they prepay to often. MBS investors seek stability, not volatility. They want their payouts over time, when they expect them, at the amounts they expect them to be. If the loans are being prepaid too often, investors don’t get their expected payouts.

And when that happens, investors turn to other options (like Fannie Mae bonds apparently) for their expected returns.

Ginnie Mae appears to have a problem with that.

The bottom line, according to Ginnie Mae, is that the previous actions it took towards its bond programs had “moderate success” in decreasing the “refinance spikes” that seem to not make sense given market conditions, but the agency appears to not believe that its controls are “sufficient” enough yet.

“Non-correlated VA refinance activity continues to be evident, and the extent to which it is a focus of analysts and investors is unhealthy for Ginnie Mae’s ability to fulfill its mission,” Ginnie Mae.

One of the main issues, according to Ginnie Mae, is a rise in VA cash-out refinances, as detailed earlier this year by CoreLogic.

According to CoreLogic, last year, of all refinances on government-backed loans offered by the FHA and VA, 76% were cash-outs – the highest share in the 20 years that this data has been collected.

More than 106,000 cash-out refis were backed by the government in 2018, more than twice as may as there were in 2014.

Ginnie Mae previously attributed the overall surge to its toughened standards for VA refis, but those rules don’t apply to cash-outs, a loophole that it was predicted Ginnie Mae would address.

And now, Ginnie Mae is considering making more changes.

“Ginnie Mae is confronting a situation in which the GII MIP, because of the combination of greater volume of VA loans and present-day borrowing/lending practices, is being utilized to support short-term consumer financing for veterans to a greater degree than has previously been the case,” Ginnie Mae said.

Therefore, Ginnie Mae said that it is considering changing its rules to “excluding from (or restricting within) the GII MIP loan type categories that can be expected to prepay at significantly higher rates from the loan types whose performance is better correlated with market trends and the intended purpose of the GII MIP securities.”

More directly, the agency said that it may exclude or restrict VA cash-out refinances in excess of 90% loan-to-value ratio from being include in multi-issuer pools.

Beyond that, Ginnie Mae said it may consider offering single-issue custom securities, basically separating the lenders that appear to be refinancing more often; creating a new mortgage bond offering specifically designed to include “shorter duration loan type categories;” and other changes.

"Miami police should continue to be monitored, DOJ says",https://www.miamiherald.com,['Octavio Jones'],,,,https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article229983224.html,"Jane Castor, elected mayor of Tampa last week, is recommending that the U.S. Department of Justice find that the Miami Police Department has completed the reforms required under an agreement with the federal agency. For three years, Castor has been monitoring the police department’s compliance. Tampa Bay Times

The federal agency charged with overseeing use-of-force and training reforms at the Miami police department struck back at the person who has been monitoring those reforms this week, saying it had no intention of ending oversight anytime soon.

Last week, newly elected Tampa Mayor Jane Castor — a former police chief and the $150-an-hour monitor appointed to oversee the reform of Miami’s policing — said she believed the department had complied with the terms of an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice. They were set in place after a string of deadly police shootings of mostly unarmed black men almost a decade ago.

Miami police quickly agreed with Castor, who was sworn into office this week.

But others criticized both Castor and her recommendation that the agreement be terminated about a year before the March 2020 deadline.





On Thursday, during a meeting of the Community Advisory Board, which was created as part of the agreement, a city of Miami employee assigned to the board said he had spoken with the Justice Department and that it didn’t agree with Castor’s recommendation.

“It is the Department of Justice’s position that the agreement should not be terminated,” Rodney Jacobs, who investigates police misconduct for the city of Miami, said in a statement. “The independent reviewer has not reported substantial compliance with her quarterly reports and analysis. In the event the reviewer does report that level of compliance, per the agreement the police department must maintain that compliance for one year.“

A Justice Department attorney confirmed DOJ’s position, but wouldn’t comment further. DOJ also declined to answer written questions submitted by the Miami Herald.

The rift between Castor and DOJ comes a week after she told Miami leaders she wanted to end the policing agreement a year early because the city had “satisfied all of the requirements of the agreement.” Castor’s comments came two days after she was elected mayor of Tampa.

The agreement between Miami and DOJ was reached three years ago after federal investigators determined that Miami cops had engaged in a pattern of excessive use of deadly force, particularly over a seven-month period almost a decade ago in which police shot and killed seven black men, most of them unarmed. The parties approved the agreement in order to avoid federal courts and costs.

Though members of the citizen advisory board say they are satisfied with the department’s progress on many of the required reforms, they say there is more work to be done. And they said they’re not sure Castor is the right person for the job. During Thursday’s meeting, board members aired frustration over her performance and expressed doubt about her ability to juggle her new mayorship while reviewing police practices and policies in another city.

The Community Advisory Board, created to oversee police reforms under an agreement between the city of Miami and the U.S. Department of Justice, believes oversight should continue for at least another year. Board chairman Justin Pinn, center, echoed fellow board members in saying there is more work to be done. Joey Flechas jflechas@miamiherald.com

“How can she continue to do this job?” asked board chairman Justin Pinn.

“I have no confidence in her myself,” added board member Lorena Ramos.

Members lamented about late reports that, in their opinion, lacked depth and didn’t respond to the board’s requests for more analysis. They complained that they never received a requested comparison between Miami and other police departments and they said they wanted evidence that the department is pursuing implicit bias training and de-escalation techniques to avoid using force when it’s not necessary.

The board wants the city to negotiate an extension to the agreement so the city has time to hire a new monitor. Members also voted to request that Police Chief Jorge Colina, Mayor Francis Suarez and Castor be present at the next meeting in June to discuss the status of the agreement. If Castor were to exit, both the city and DOJ would have to agree to a new monitor.





Early on, Castor fell behind schedule in delivering quarterly reports to the Community Advisory Board. On Wednesday, she submitted a report for the last quarter of 2018. The report says there are still two areas related to officer-involved shootings that must be reviewed.

So far, Castor has been paid $154,400.80 for her work, according to the police department.

On Friday, Castor said the agreement stipulates that Miami remain in compliance for a full year before the agreement can be terminated. She said if the Justice Department determines that monitoring should continue and she agreed to do it, she would do so at no cost. She also disagreed that Miami had not yet fully complied with the requirements.

“I felt the Miami police department has reached substantial compliance in all areas of the agreement and they’ve been open and compliant,” the Tampa mayor said Friday.

As for the advisory board asking for an extension and saying that her reports had not been timely or thorough, Castor said she wasn’t sure where that was coming from.

“I’ve been in contact with Justin Pinn. He and I have met just about every time I’ve come down,” Castor said. “It’s the first I’ve heard any concern about the thoroughness of the reports.”

Deputy Miami Police Chief Ron Papier said he continues to believe the city has complied with the DOJ agreement.

“Our position is simple,” Papier said. “We believe the city of Miami police department is in compliance. We’ve done everything that’s been asked of us and will continue to do so.”

Papier said it’s a two-party agreement and that if the Justice Department wishes to keep monitoring the city until the agreement winds down in March of 2020, the department will abide by that agreement. He disagreed with the advisory board’s assessment that the department wasn’t taking the oversight seriously.

“We do take the community advisory board seriously,” said Papier. “Representatives have attended every meeting when asked. I’m not sure what we’re not in compliance with as of now.”"
4 decades separate 2020's presidential candidates.

Age is one of the biggest differences in the 2020 presidential race.

More than a generation separates the oldest and youngest candidates on the Democratic side. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard are 40 years younger than Sen. Bernie Sanders and 39 years younger than former Vice President Joe Biden.

On the Republican side, President Donald Trump, the oldest first-term president, and former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld would also be in their mid-70s on Inauguration Day.

Of course, age has little to do with a president’s success. John F. Kennedy (the youngest president) and Ronald Reagan (the oldest) rank among the top 15 of U.S. presidents, according to Siena College's annual poll.

Reagan, in his early 70s, famously deflected a question about his age during his 1984 re-election campaign against 56-year-old Walter Mondale: ""I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.""

Still, age is a lens that colors our view of the world. Buttigieg and Gabbard were about 7 when the modern internet was born; Biden and Sanders were born during World War II and lived through a handful of other wars and conflicts.

Our timeline gives you a sense of just how wide the gap is between the Democratic and Republican candidates.

REUTERS/Brian Snyder

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government will have to stop borrowing money between July and December if Washington doesn’t agree to raise a legal restriction on public debt, the Treasury Department said on Wednesday.

Hitting that so-called “debt ceiling” could trigger a U.S. default on its debt and an immediate recession, a risk that has become a regular facet of U.S. politics over the last decade.

The current debt limit was set in March. Treasury has been able to continue borrowing from investors by using accounting measures such as limiting government payments to public sector retirement funds.

“Treasury expects that the extraordinary measures will be exhausted sometime in the second half of 2019,” Treasury Deputy Assistant Secretary Brian Smith said in a statement announcing the department’s quarterly debt issuance plans.

Wall Street also sees Treasury exhausting its borrowing authority in the third or fourth quarter, according to the minutes of a meeting of a Treasury advisory committee of financiers.

The debt ceiling is already affecting how the government funds itself. Issuance of Treasury bills - short-term debt - is expected to gradually decline over the second quarter due to debt ceiling constraints, Smith said.

Treasury said it was holding issuance size steady for auctions of debt coupons during the third quarter, and that it anticipates no changes in the following three-month period either."
"Obamacare ‘must be struck down,’ Justice Department tells court",https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Tom Howell Jr.']",05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/may/1/obamacare-must-be-struck-down-justice-department-t/,"A Texas judge “correctly held” that Obamacare’s individual mandate to hold insurance is inseparable from the rest of the law, the Trump administration told an appeals court Wednesday in arguing the entire program must fall.

The Justice Department’s brief solidified President Trump’s support for a lawsuit that could decimate his predecessor’s signature health program, even though Republicans haven’t reached consensus on a replacement.

It’s also a change of heart.

Administration lawyers once took a limited view of the state-driven challenge, saying a narrow slice of Obamacare should be struck after Congress decided to zero out the penalty for shirking insurance as part of the GOP tax overhaul.

They changed course after the lower court sided with state Republicans who say the tweak made the entire program unconstitutional, including its protections for sicker Americans, subsidies for private coverage and sweeping expansion of Medicaid in dozens of states.

“In the district court, the Department of Justice took the position that the remainder of the ACA was severable, but upon further consideration and review of the district court’s opinion, it is the position of the United States that the balance of the ACA also is inseverable and must be struck down,” Justice attorneys wrote to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.

If upheld on appeal, the case would force Washington to revisit health reform. Yet any decision that wipes away Obamacare’s sweeping benefits could politically injure the GOP in the middle of the 2020 campaign.

Despite that risk, red states that filed the lawsuit in 2018 urged the appeals court to affirm the Texas ruling from December.

“The district court correctly recognized all this in declaring the ACA unlawful in its entirety,” the states said in their own brief Wednesday. “The Department of Justice now agrees — and so too should this court.”

Blue-state attorneys general and House Democrats are fighting back in the appellate courts. They say the challenge before the Fifth Circuit is misguided, because Congress intentionally left the rest of Obamacare alone when it attacked the individual mandate.

They also stress the potential consequences of striking down the entire law, since millions gained coverage under its most popular provisions.

For his part, Mr. Trump thinks the Supreme Court will strike down Obamacare in the end.

He recently said it would clear the way for the GOP to repeal and replace the law after their embarrassing failure in 2017.

Senate GOP leaders said they have no intention of revisiting the issue, however — for one thing, Democrats control the House. That forced the president back off from his nascent push and punt a repeal vote until after the 2020 elections.

Some Democrats are looking beyond Obamacare and proposing a sweeping, government-run plan known as single-payer health care or “Medicare for All,” citing the nearly 30 million who remain uninsured despite the 2010 law.

The Congressional Budget Office on Wednesday released a laundry list of complexities for drafters of a single-payer plan to consider, such as government’s role in administering the plan and funding it, who would be eligible for coverage and whether enrollees must pay a share of costs.

Architects of the system would also have to figure out whether private insurers could exist alongside the government plan, or if they’d be relegated to covering things like cosmetic surgery.

“Establishing a single-payer system would be a major undertaking that would involve substantial changes in the sources and extent of coverage, provider payment rates, and financing methods of health care in the United States,” the CBO wrote.

Homeland Security to launch pilot program of DNA testing at border,https://www.foxnews.com,['Samuel Chamberlain'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/homeland-security-to-launch-pilot-program-of-dna-testing-at-border,"Migrants attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border with children will be asked to submit to a voluntary DNA test in order to prove they are related, Department of Homeland Security (DHS), officials said Wednesday.

The officials said the pilot program could be set up as soon as next week, but did not specify at which locations the tests would take place so as ""not to change the flow of people"" approaching the southern border.

Individuals who consent to the DNA test will be asked to swab their cheeks and those of the children with them before presenting the evidence to officials from DHS or Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The DHS officials said the testing would take an average of two hours to complete, after which the genetic data is to be destroyed and won't be used as evidence in any criminal case.

Information from the tests will be used to investigate individuals suspected of human trafficking, identity theft and other crimes. The officials added that someone claiming to be a child's legal guardian will have to provide supporting documentation.

""This pilot is by no means a silver bullet for these investigations,"" a DHS official said Wednesday. ""Trained professionals will continue to rely on a myriad of data inputs and their experience to determine whether a group presenting as a family unit is a fraud based on law enforcement observations, documentary evidence or other intelligence.""

Last month, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said the Border Patrol had identified more than 3,100 parents and children accused of making ""fraudulent claims"" between April 2018 and March of this year. That number coincides with a surge of border crossings by family units.

The Border Patrol says it made about 66,000 apprehensions of people crossing the border illegally in February, including 36,000 parents and children, a monthly high. ICE officials said that since Dec. 21 it had released 107,000 family members while they await court dates. The agency also says it has identified 101 possible instances of fraudulent families since April 18 and determined one-third were fraudulent

The fiscal year ending Oct. 1, 2018, saw more than 107,000 family units apprehended at the southwestern border, a 42 percent increase from the previous year, when more than 75,000 were apprehended. Since Oct. 1, ICE says it has uncovered more than 1,000 cases of fraudulent families and referred 45 cases for prosecution. The fraud could also include the use of false birth certificates or documents, and adults accused of fraud aren't necessarily prosecuted for it; some are prosecuted for illegal entry or other crimes.

Homeland Security officials have also warned of ""child recycling,"" cases where they say children allowed into the U.S. were smuggled back into Central America to be paired up again with other adults in fake families — something they say is impossible to catch without fingerprints or other biometric data.

But the department hasn't identified anyone arrested in such a scheme or released data on how many such schemes have been uncovered. Advocates say they're worried that in the name of stopping fraud, agents might take personal information from children that could be used against them later.

"Senators question whether Interior watchdog, solicitor nominees can handle mounting scandals",https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/interior-scandals-trump-bernhardt-koch-e022d03abd43/,"Senators questioned two senior Interior Department nominees Thursday about their ability to fairly and independently do their work while the Interior secretary and several top officials are under investigation for potential ethics violations.

Daniel Jorjani, a former Koch adviser, would oversee legal, ethical, and public records decisions as solicitor. Mark Greenblatt would be responsible for probing these decisions as inspector general, head of the department’s internal watchdog.

These are among “the most important” roles at the Interior Department due to their oversight responsibilities, said Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV), ranking member on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, adding they must both be willing “to speak truth to power.”

The nominees, however, have come under scrutiny regarding concerns about Jorjani’s potential conflicts of interest along with questions about both Jorjani and Greenblatt’s ability to hold officials to account.

As inspector general, Greenblatt — an attorney who previously worked at the Commerce Department’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) — would be responsible for investigating allegations of ethics violations by Secretary David Bernhardt, including allegations that he failed to disclose controversial meetings on his public calendar.

There are also six other senior officials who are under investigation for potentially violating their ethics pledges due to interactions with former employers and clients.

In response to a question by Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI) regarding yet another scandal — the reported suppression of documents related to a Fish and Wildlife Service study on the impact of pesticides on endangered species — Greenblatt said, “I have zero intent of walking in the door and shutting down that investigation or any matter in front of the OIG.”

Testifying alongside Greenblatt on Thursday was Jorjani, a man who will likely be among those investigated by Greenblatt due to his role as acting solicitor since May 2017.

“The grotesque scandals at the Interior Department, in effect, are going to be part of an especially bizarre twist this morning,” Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) said as he began his questioning. “Jorjani believes he deserves an ethics promotion,” yet his work coincided with “a blizzard of ethical lapses by [former Secretary] Mr. Ryan Zinke.”

“Next to him is Greenblatt,” who is nominated to “a job charged with being a key line of defense against corruption,” Wyden continued.

Prior to his time at the Interior Department, Jorjani worked as a former adviser to Charles Koch as well as general counsel at Freedom Partners, a nonprofit funded by Charles and his brother David. The billionaire petrochemical brothers are well-known for funding climate science denial.

But as Hirono noted, the biography submitted by Jorjani to the committee failed to mention his years working for the Kochs. “It’s hard to imagine this did not impact your opinions [issued in favor of oil and gas at Interior],” she argued.

In his current role, Jorjani is facing a number of legal challenges, including his opinion issued in favor of narrowing of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to remove an Obama-era interpretation that allowed federal officials to prosecute energy companies that accidentally kill birds in the course of their business activities.

He also approved the release of mineral leases to a company planning a copper-nickel mine near Minnesota’s Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.

Both of these decisions were seen as victories for extractive industries.

Thursday’s hearing also provided an opportunity to question Jorjani about his work under the scandal-ridden former secretary, Ryan Zinke.

Jorjani boasted about having “successfully protected” Interior political appointees from facing investigations, according to a March 2017 email to colleagues, telling them it was their job to do the same for Zinke. “At the end of the day our job is to protect the Secretary,” he wrote.

In response to multiple questions on Thursday about this email, Jorjani claimed that he was speaking about protecting the secretary from the misuse of taxpayer money “and poor judgement” by another Interior official.

But Wyden countered that, instead, the responsibility should be “protecting the best interest of the American people before those of the secretary or special interests.”

Jorjani came under further scrutiny during the hearing for his role in overseeing Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. Right before stepping down, Zinke quietly issued a secretarial order giving Jorjani authority to oversee all FOIA requests at the department. A surge in requests, along with increased litigation and subsequent delays, were reasons given for the change. Jorjani would continue overseeing FOIA requests in the new role if confirmed.

Critics, however, have expressed concern that putting a political appointee in charge of public records requests gives the Trump administration greater power to withhold information from the public.

Given all of these issues, Wyden pressed Greenblatt on what specific steps he would take to “maintain your independence” while “someone like Mr. Jorjani is attempting to interfere with your work?”

“I have no problem making referrals over to the Department of Justice… I’ll have DOJ on speed dial if I need to,” Greenblatt replied, asserting he’d “follow the evidence wherever it goes.”

The committee must vote on both nominations before they advance to the Senate floor, where they will likely be confirmed by the Republican-controlled chamber."
Trump’s Labor Department weighed in on gig workers’ rights.,https://www.vox.com,['May'],05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/5/1/18525459/gig-economy-labor-department-trump-uber-lyft-doordash-taskrabbit,"Approximately 57 million people in the US do some sort of work in the gig economy. Some of them drive cars for Uber and Lyft, deliver groceries for Instacart and Doordash, walk dogs for Wag and Rover, clean houses through Task Rabbit and Handy, and manage apartment properties on Airbnb.

The market has grown quickly over the past few years, bringing in as much as $864 billion annually, according to some estimates. And with it, there’s been a lot of talk about the rights of these workers. They’ve been fighting for fair treatment for a while now; since they’re considered contractors, they don’t get benefits like insurance, worker’s comp, or paid vacation. Sociologists, labor experts, and economists have all weighed in on the issue, largely agreeing that gig workers deserve the same fair treatment as regular employees.

On April 29, the United States Labor Department offered its own interpretation on the matter. After a lawyer working for an unnamed cleaning company reached out to clarify how gig workers should be classified, the department responded in a letter that’s since been posted online. In the letter, the Labor Department said it classifies gig workers as contractors, not employees:

“Based on the facts you provide in your letter, it appears that the service providers who use your client’s virtual marketplace are independent contractors. Your client provides a referral service. As such, it does not receive services from service providers, but empowers service providers to provide services to end-market consumers.”

The letter could have huge implications for the future of the gig economy. It essentially renders gig workers exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act, a law written in 1938 that guarantees overtime pay and a minimum wage to many who work more than 40 hours.

It’s caused plenty of disagreement. On Monday, the National Employment Law Project tweeted that the letter essentially allows gig economy companies to “underpay and overwork” this class of workers.

DOL opinion letter attempts to allow an unnamed #GigEconomy company to underpay and overwork its workers by misclassifying them as independent contractors. But if workers have all the restrictions of employees, they should get the protections. https://t.co/b6m5NFlFaF — NELP (@NelpNews) April 29, 2019

So what’s the department’s logic? It reasoned that, because the unnamed cleaning company doesn’t pay for professional certification, licensing, or let workers expense products, they should clearly be seen as contractors. It also points out that since workers don’t have set hours or shifts, they should be free to “pursue any and all external opportunities at their leisure,” which means that the company should not be seen as the main party responsible for them.

This type of reasoning is pretty different from how the Labor Department under Barack Obama’s administration viewed the gig economy. In 2015, for example, it issued a new interpretation of the word “employ,” writing that the administration believes “most workers” should be included in the FSLA. Obama’s Labor Department called on Uber and Lyft to reconsider how they classify their workers, pointing out that one crucial detail in the debate of contractor versus employee was whether the workers are “integral,” and that drivers were, indeed, integral to Uber and Lyft.

This opinion, though, has all but been abandoned by the Trump administration, as the New York Times points out. Trump’s Labor Department largely tossed Obama’s favorable interpretations of gig workers in favor of Silicon Valley.

The Labor Department’s letter does not necessarily represent the law; the opinion currently only applies to the unnamed cleaning company that had written to the agency. But as Reuters notes, though, it “can be presented in court to boost claims by plaintiffs or defendants in cases involving similar issues.”

Public opinion can work in favor of these workers’ rights, however. Back in February, for example, grocery delivery app users were outraged to learn about allegations of tipping theft at Instacart and DoorDash, and vowed to stop using these services. This response led Instacart to revamp its tipping policy. Uber and Lyft, too, have responded to public pressure, and agreed in December 2018 to pay drivers in New York City a minimum wage of $17.22 an hour. So even if the current administration isn’t on the side of gig workers, outside pressure could still result in change.

Justice Department offers first arguments to strike down ObamaCare,https://thehill.com,[],05-02-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/441760-justice-department-offers-first-arguments-to-strike-down-obamacare,"The Justice Department on Wednesday made its first full argument in federal court that the Affordable Care Act in its entirety “should not be allowed to remain in effect,” according to CNN.

In the filing in the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Assistant Attorney General Joseph Hunt reportedly said the Trump administration has abandoned its earlier position that parts of the law could remain in effect even if its individual mandate were thrown out.

“[P]icking and choosing which provisions to invalidate,"" Hunt wrote, would undermine Congressional authority and the law should instead be struck down entirely, according to CNN.

""Allowing some of the reforms to go into effect without others with which they are inextricably linked would not be giving effect to the statute but rewriting it, which is the prerogative of Congress rather than the courts,"" he added, according to the news outlet.

The government wants the court to strike down the Affordable Care Act’s “guaranteed issue” and “community rating” provisions, which prevent coverage discrimination based on preexisting conditions, as well as provisions unrelated to the individual mandate, such as Medicaid eligibility expansion. The Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that states could choose to opt out of the Medicaid expansion provision.

The Justice Department Suddenly Changed Its Mind About the Constitution to Defend Trump’s Businesses,http://time.com,['Kathleen Clark'],,,,http://time.com/5581308/trump-emoluments-justice-department/,"When Justice Department lawyers introduce themselves in court, they proclaim a specific affiliation: “I represent the United States.” That’s because the Justice Department has the responsibility by statute to represent the interests of the nation. That obligation to act on behalf of the nation has also motivated the Department’s legal advice on a question central to the integrity of our democracy — until now. Recent arguments show that the Department is putting President Trump’s interests before the nation’s.

For more than 150 years, the Department interpreted the Constitution’s “emoluments” clause to protect the government from the corrupting influence of foreign powers through gifts, emoluments and titles. The Department has issued more than 50 legal opinions declaring that the clause prohibits important federal officials from accepting anything of value — even token gifts — from such powers, unless Congress consents.

The prohibitions went further. Engineers and scientists who work for the federal government are prohibited from accepting any benefit (including consulting fees or travel reimbursement) that comes from a foreign government. The Department even prohibited a part-time federal employee who was also a partner in a law firm from accepting any money from the firm’s legal work for foreign governments, even though he had not worked on those cases, because “the partnership would in effect be a conduit” for foreign governments. When it interpreted this constitutional clause, the Department explicitly examined whether the particular payment “would raise the kind of concern [i.e.,] the potential for ‘corruption and foreign influence’… that motivated the Framers in enacting the constitutional prohibition.” At every turn, the Justice Department was on the lookout to ensure that federal officials did not accept direct or indirect foreign government payments.

But starting two years ago, the Department veered away from this long track record. In response to three lawsuits filed by an anti-corruption group, Democratic members of Congress and, jointly, the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia, the Department chose to defend President Trump’s ability to receive money from foreign governments instead of defending the republic. (On April 30, a U.S. District Judge ruled that the Congressional Democrats’ case can move forward.)

Trump’s personal lawyers have argued that the emoluments clause allows Trump — and all federal officials — to accept unlimited amounts of money from foreign governments, as long as those payments are in the form of commercial transactions with a business owned by the federal official. Contradicting its entire history, the Department adopted Trump’s lawyers’ argument, contending that the emoluments clause only prohibits compensation in exchange for a “personal service in his capacity as [an] officeholder” — in other words, a bribe.

Under this new interpretation of the emoluments clause, the government’s engineers and scientists would still be prohibited from accepting travel reimbursements from a foreign government, but any federal official who owns a company may accept unlimited amounts of money from foreign governments through commercial transactions. In effect, the Justice Department now claims that our founders only wanted to prohibit officials from receiving a second salary from a foreign government.

Foreign governments appear to be falling over themselves to spend money at Trump properties. Saudi Arabia’s lobbyists spend lavishly at Trump’s hotels in Washington, D.C., and New York City. Bookings at Trump’s Chicago hotel from Saudi Arabia have more than doubled since 2016, while bookings from Qatar have increased 17 times over the same period. The governments of Kuwait, Malaysia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain and the Philippines host multiple events at Trump properties, with the Philippines ambassador acknowledging that such spending is “a statement that we have a good relationship with this president.”

Trump wants to personally benefit from foreign government payments, and therefore seeks a narrow interpretation of the emoluments clause. He has a right to advocate for that narrow interpretation, but it is his personal attorneys — not the Justice Department — that should make such arguments. While we do not know the exact source of this new logic, Trump’s Justice Department is effectively acting as if it is a private law firm. Government employees are supposed to act in the public interest, not anyone’s personal interest. This is a fundamental principle of government ethics. If Justice Department lawyers are going to say that they “represent the United States,” they better have the interests of the country — not the financial interests of the President — at heart.

Once upon a time, the director of policy planning for the State Department was a pretty prestigious job. George Kennan, he of the “Long Telegram” and “Sources of Soviet Conduct” fame, was the first director. Some of the others — Paul Nitze, Bob Bowie, Walt Rostow, Dennis A. Ross, James Steinberg, Richard Haass, Anne-Marie Slaughter — have been among the more distinguished foreign policy thinkers in this country. A strong director of policy planning can serve as a vital adjunct to the secretary of state and act as a reminder about the nation’s strategic interests. A good policy planning director is adept at avoiding trivia, distinguishing the important from the urgent, and acting as a check against an administration’s worst impulses.

Brian Hook, the director of policy planning under Rex Tillerson, was granted a tremendous amount of authority but stumbled badly. He was a relative neophyte attempting to counsel a complete neophyte on the ins and outs of the job. He did ... poorly.

When Mike Pompeo came on, he hired Kiron Skinner to run policy planning. In contrast to Hook, she has thought about this stuff for a while. She has the academic credentials and publishing record one would expect for that job. She is also an African American woman, a rarity in the upper echelons of the Trump administration (particularly in the diplomatic corps).

Since coming on in September of last year, however, Skinner has made some odd statements. She penned a Wall Street Journal op-ed last December that made it clear she had written Mike Pompeo’s badly received Brussels speech that caricatured multilateralism beyond all recognition. In the op-ed, she claimed that “the Trump administration is acting to preserve a just, transparent, and free world of sovereign states,” which sounds way too close to Vladimir Putin’s notion of “sovereign democracy” for my comfort.

On Monday, she sat down with Slaughter to chat about the Trump administration’s grand strategy at the New America Foundation. The New Yorker’s Masha Gessen attended and found it unnerving:

A large part of Skinner’s job is listening to what the President says and trying to make sense of it. She said as much. “The president provides the hunches and instincts,” she said, “and it’s my job, and that of Secretary Pompeo, to turn those hunches and instincts into hypotheses.” She called the hypotheses the “Trump Doctrine” and the “Pompeo Corollary.” Slaughter, logically, asked what the Trump Doctrine was. “That’s a tough one,” Skinner responded, without a hint of irony. “It is, in a kind of broad way, a set of pillars that address 21st-century realities.” The pillars were: the “return to national sovereignty”; national interest; reciprocity in international relations and trade; “burden sharing,” particularly in defense; and “new regional partnerships” for what she described as “particular crises.”

Skinner’s comments unnerved Gessen for the same reason that her WSJ op-ed unnerved me: “I had heard the isolationism and destruction of Putin’s rule be framed in phrases such as ‘sovereign democracy’ and in a lot of other plausible-sounding policy gobbledygook that served to rob every word of familiar meaning.”

To be fair, however, Skinner did say some things that were a lot of things, but decidedly not gobbledygook. The Washington Examiner’s Joel Gehrke reported on that element of Skinner’s comments, in which she was described as leading an effort to develop a concept of U.S.-China relations akin to what Kennan did for the Soviet Union:

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s team is developing a strategy for China based on the idea of “a fight with a really different civilization” for the first time in American history.... “The Soviet Union and that competition, in a way it was a fight within the Western family,” Skinner said, noting Karl Marx’s indebtedness to Western political ideas. “It’s the first time that we will have a great power competitor that is not Caucasian.”.... Skinner suggested that human rights arguments might not be as useful against China as they were against the Soviet Union, which was weakened by a 1975 agreement that allowed Soviet dissidents to cooperate indirectly with Western powers to advocate for “the rights of emigration and religious freedom,” according to the State Department. “It was a really important Western concept that opened the door really to undermine the Soviet Union, a totalitarian state, on human rights principles,” she said. “That’s not really possible with China.”

So there’s a lot going on in just those few paragraphs. Because I was just handed a whole bunch of final papers to grade, I have grading on the brain right now. Here’s how I would grade Skinner if she had made an oral presentation like this one for my Art and Science of Statecraft class:

Kiron,

You observe, correctly, that Donald Trump has forced the foreign policy community to revisit “first principles.” And what you said to Slaughter was certainly consistent with the key components of the Trump’s administration’s National Security Strategy, which prioritizes great power competition as the priority for the United States going forward. Furthermore, although controversial, your implicit use of Huntington’s “clash of civilizations” frame does get at one aspect of the Chinese challenge: to Beijing, this is not about a rise to great power status, it is a return to that status, consistent with its civilizational history.

That said, there are some real flaws with your oral defense. For one thing, your claim that China represents the first non-Caucasian great power competitor to the United States is factually incorrect, unless the Germans really did bomb Pearl Harbor. For another thing, why in the name of all that is holy would you make a racial distinction with respect to the great powers?! If you want to say that China is Confucian, or based on a different set of civilizational principles than the United States, sure, give it a try. Why say “not Caucasian”?! Does this mean India or Japan or South Korea should also be approached differently, because they are not white civilizations?! Why use race as your unit of analysis?

Furthermore, if you are going to use a Huntingtonian frame, you should know that he treated Russia as “Orthodox” and therefore distinct from Western civilization. Sure, the Soviet Union incorporated the very Western thought of Karl Marx, but last I checked — hold on a sec — yep, I just checked again and it turns out that China’s ruling party is also totally into Marx! Why is China so different?

Finally, I am very unclear as to why China’s civilization renders it less vulnerable to human rights treaties than the Soviet Union. If you recall, conservatives really disliked the Helsinki Final Act when it was actually negotiated, and it caught many of them by surprise that it helped inspire the Charter 77 movement and other acts of dissidence. It is not like China has no history of dissident appeals to Western liberal values (see here and here). Furthermore, you should be familiar with works by Iain Johnston, or Stacie Goddard, or Rosemary Foot and Andrew Walter, that discuss how China’s participation in Western institutions has had an impact on its self-perception.

There are perfectly valid reasons for the Trump administration to prioritize China as a strategic threat. This is one of the few Trump statements that generates bipartisan support. If you are trying to articulate a “Sources of Chinese Conduct” essay, however, it would be a very good idea to get beyond the fact that China is not a country filled with Caucasians. In fact, maybe just disregard the race angle altogether. It inflames far more than it illuminates.

Kennan could write “Sources of Soviet Conduct” because he was a longstanding expert on Soviet politics. Your comments on China suggest you could use a few old Asia hands to help with some tutoring. You clearly have a lot more work to do to persuade me that American grand strategy isn’t doomed.

ACLU sues Homeland Security to stop feds from moving immigrant detainees far from Orange County,http://www.ocregister.com,"['Roxana Kopetman', 'Roxana Kopetman Is A Staff Writer At The Orange County Register.']",05-02-2019,2019,5,http://www.ocregister.com/aclu-hopes-lawsuit-will-prevent-feds-from-sending-immigrant-detainees-out-of-state,"Ubaldo Arroyo, who has lived most of his life in Orange County, is being held as an undocumented detainee at the James A. Musick Detention Facility in Irvine, unsure where he will be sent following the Orange County Sheriff’s announcement that it will no longer house detainees while their deportation cases are pending.

Bashir Abdi Wabare, a Somalian who arrived last December seeking asylum, faces similar uncertainties. He is imprisoned at the Theo Lacy Detention Facility near Orange.

On behalf of Arroyo, Wabare and other immigrants detained in Orange County, the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California filed a class-action lawsuit Thursday against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and others seeking to halt the transfer of detainees to far-away locations, where detainees would face hurdles in talking with attorneys and seeing their families.

The ACLU also plans to file a request for a preliminary injunction to stop any transfers pending a trial unless the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency will commit to refrain from transferring detainees outside of Southern California, said Sameer Ahmed, a UCLA senior staff attorney.

ICE officials declined to comment on the pending litigation.

Orange County Sheriff Dan Barnes announced on March 27 that his department would end its contract with ICE to house up to 958 civilian immigrant detainees. Barnes said the move would help the department better focus on the mental health and substance abuse needs of its general inmate population as his agency works to upgrade existing facilities and build a new Musick detention center.

Immigrant-rights advocates immediately expressed concern about the fate of the civilian immigrant detainees – which at the time numbered around 700 – and asked that they be released as they go through the immigration court process.

At the time of the Sheriff’s announcement, ICE issued a statement saying that Orange County’s move “will negatively impact local ICE operations” and detainees will likely be moved to far-off locations, making family and attorney visits much harder.

Since then, the number of immigrant detainees in Orange County has decreased and ICE has not said where they are being transferred. Some have been transferred to Adelanto, immigrant-rights advocates said. As of Thursday, May 2, the number had dropped to 404, according to a Sheriff’s spokeswoman.

According to the lawsuit, an ICE deportation officer told an attorney with the Immigrant Defenders Law Center on April 18 that immigrants at Theo Lacy would be sent to northern California, Florida and other states. The only exceptions would be immigrant detainees who have mental disabilities and fall under a 2013 class-action case; those detainees would be transferred to the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in San Bernardino, according to the lawsuit filed in federal court in Santa Ana. Defendants in the suit include the departments of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as well as two Orange County Sheriff’s captains at the Theo Lacy and Musick facilities, among others.

“ICE’s decision to transfer immigrants thousands of miles away from their lawyers and families violates the Constitution and ICE’s own policies,” Ahmed said.

It would make it difficult, if not impossible, to build cases if the detainees are cut off from their attorneys and families, according to Ahmed and representatives from two other legal organizations participating in the suit, the Public Law Center in Santa Ana and Public Counsel in Los Angeles. The transfers would, among other things, violate the federal Immigration and Nationality Act and ICE’s own policies, according to the lawsuit.

The ACLU lawsuit reiterates the request made by immigrant-rights advocates since Barnes’ announcement: that ICE release immigrant detainees on parole or bond, and that detainees who cannot be released be transferred to Adelanto.

The plaintiffs are a mix of new arrivals seeking asylum and long-time locals, including: Jorge Poroj, a permanent legal resident from Los Angeles who faces possible deportation following a criminal conviction; David Blea, of Thousand Oaks, whose family includes five U.S.-born children; and Sergio Jonathan Moreno, of El Monte, who is married to a U.S. citizen and has a daughter born here.

Other plaintiffs include asylum seekers from Honduras and the African countries of Eritrea and Cameroon."
Schiff refers Blackwater founder Prince to DOJ over alleged false statements to Congress,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/schiff-refers-blackwater-founder-erik-prince-to-doj-over-alleged-false-statements-to-congress,"House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., formally referred Blackwater founder Erik Prince to the Justice Department for a criminal investigation over whether Prince lied to the panel about a 2016 meeting in the Seychelles islands with a Russian banker tied to Vladimir Putin.

In a statement, the committee said it had “identified at least six categories of materially false statements” Prince made about the meeting with Kirill Dmitriev when he appeared before the committee in November 2017.

In a letter to Attorney General William Barr, Schiff said Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials “strongly indicates that Erik Prince knowingly and willfully provided materially false testimony,” which Schiff argued “hindered the Committee’s ability to fully understand and examine foreign efforts to undermine our political process and national security, develop appropriate legislative and policy remedies to counter future malign influence operations targeting campaigns and presidential transitions, and inform the American public, as appropriate.”

SCHIFF HEDGES ON TRUMP IMPEACHMENT, SAYS INSTEAD, 'VOTE HIS A-- OUT OF OFFICE'

“I do believe that there is very strong evidence that he willingly misled the committee and willingly made false statements to the committee,” Schiff told The Washington Post’s Bob Costa during a panel event earlier Tuesday.

“The evidence is so weighty that the Justice Department needs to consider this. His testimony, which I can discuss because it is public record, was that his meeting in Seychelles with this Russian banker [Dmitriev] was purely by chance. He just happened to go to Seychelles for about a day and have a chance meeting with the Russian banker.”

Prince, the founder of the private military contractor Blackwater, and the brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, testified in 2017 that the meeting with the Russian banker was a chance encounter. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report revealed that the meeting was set up ahead of time.

“We know from the Mueller report that this was not a chance meeting,” Schiff said Tuesday. “We know there were communications after he returned.”

Schiff added that Prince had “discussions” with former White House adviser Steve Bannon about the meeting before he left, and “communications” after he returned from the meeting, a claim the lawmaker said was contradicted by the Mueller report.

SCHIFF REFUSES TO BACK DOWN ON CLAIMS AGAINST TRUMP, SAYS HE HAS NO REGRETS

“Somehow, mysteriously, magically, the communications between Prince and Bannon have apparently fled their devices,” Schiff said. “In very material ways, I think the evidence strongly suggests that he willingly misled our committee and the Justice Department needs to consider whether there’s a prosecutable case.”

Schiff added that when Bannon appeared before his committee, he “refused to answer almost all of our questions.”

“He said he was not answering questions because the White House asked him not to,” Schiff said.

Schiff was also asked whether his panel felt that President Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., or his son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner gave false testimony.

“I don’t want to comment on any others. We have reached the point of ripeness with Prince’s testimony that we feel it appropriate to refer it,” Schiff said. “I don’t want to comment on any others.”

Schiff’s comments come in the midst of a heated battle between Congress and the White House over subpoenas for former and current officials to testify before House committees leading sweeping Trump-focused probes. Schiff’s panel is currently investigating the president’s finances.

"Plan to move USDA jobs, possibly to Georgia, pits Perdue against ally",https://www.ajc.com,[],,,,https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/plan-move-usda-jobs-possibly-georgia-pits-perdue-against-ally/cVzwBZ6sQOhlAvvIg51IZJ/,"Leaders in dozens of states covet the headquarters of the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture for their 600-plus high-paying jobs and expected spinoff investments from vendors. Some observers think, because Perdue was governor of Georgia, the two Peach State cities have an inside track against the 66 other locations still in contention.

But standing in the way is U.S. Rep. Sanford Bishop, D-Albany, one of Perdue’s longtime allies who holds a key post in the new Democratic-controlled House.

The political friction threatens to throw a kink into Georgia’s pitch as Perdue angles for a decision this summer.

In his 26 years on Capitol Hill, Bishop has honed a reputation for steering federal dollars to his poor, largely rural southwest Georgia district. But Bishop panned Perdue’s proposal to move the agencies out of Washington, calling it “a bad idea” that would harm morale and potentially hamper the agencies’ objectivity.

And Bishop hasn’t shied from wielding his position as chairman of a powerful House subcommittee to try to block the move using Congress’ power of the purse.

“It does not make any sense and it seems to be a solution in search of a problem,” Bishop told Perdue at a recent budget hearing.

Perdue says shifting the bulk of the agencies’ employees out of Washington will help cut costs and bolster the department’s relationship with farmers. Even though he’s made overtures to Bishop in recent months, Perdue suggested he could circumvent Congress entirely.

“Congressman Bishop … is one of the ones we want to satisfy,” Perdue said during a recent stop at a USDA facility in Newnan. “We’ve been trying to be very patient with his people. If you’ve got questions, please let us address them and we’ll tell you the why, what, when, how that we’ve proceeded in this.”

The spat has created an awkward public rift between two powerful Georgians whose friendship dates to their days as Democrats entering the state Senate together in 1991. It’s also put Bishop at odds with other members of Georgia’s congressional delegation, many of whom support relocating the agencies.

State economic development officials, meanwhile, find themselves in a bind. They view Bishop as a friend in Washington, and they need his support for other issues such as Hurricane Michael relief. But they also desperately want the new headquarters and quietly hope the dust settles.

Bert Brantley, the chief operating officer for the state Department of Economic Development and an aide to Perdue when he was governor, steered clear of the political controversy. Instead, Brantley touted the potential for spinoff jobs and the chance to attract companies wanting to serve the USDA.

He pointed to the U.S. Army Cyber Command, scheduled to relocate from Maryland to Fort Gordon near Augusta next year and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as two federal headquarters — albeit on larger scales — that have become a boon to their communities.

“We are hopeful that all of our delegation and political leaders see the benefit of a project like this coming to Georgia,” Brantley said of the USDA facilities. “We completely understand and respect everyone’s differing perspective.”

‘No hard data’

Bishop holds immense power over Perdue as chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee that writes spending bills for the Department of Agriculture. The two are chummy and have generally been in sync on major policy issues.

Over the past two years, Perdue has put his stamp on the USDA, taking the first steps to reorganize several chunks of a massive bureaucracy and the 100,000-person department he oversees. Still, his announcement in August about wanting to move the ERS and NIFA — which conduct and fund agricultural research — reportedly caught many of his own staff members off guard.

Cutting costs and moving researchers closer to the field, Perdue said, “will help us fulfill our informal motto to ‘Do right and feed everyone.’ ”

The move infuriated Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee, who said they were blindsided and didn’t receive a cost-benefit analysis from the USDA.

In a swipe at Perdue, Bishop called it “ironic” that the proposed move of two research agencies had “no hard data supporting it.”

A top Perdue adviser testified that analysis will be released closer to when the USDA picks the winning city. The search, which started with 136 expressions of interest from 35 states, was recently narrowed to 68 cities, including Athens and Griffin. Another cut is pending.

Both of Georgia’s candidates rely heavily on the University of Georgia, a land-grant university and agricultural powerhouse. Airport access is a critical need outlined by the USDA, and both sites are within about an hour of Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, depending on traffic.

Brantley, the Georgia economic development official, said Griffin and Athens check all the boxes of the USDA’s criteria, including low costs for operations and living, easier commutes than the D.C. metro area and high quality of life.

For Bishop, “it’s not a question of parochial interest,” he told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Quality of life

Republican members of Georgia’s delegation largely support the state’s bids.

“We believe relocating ERS and NIFA would build upon USDA’s capacity and improve the agency’s ability to recruit top talent from universities across the nation while being closer to rural America and reducing taxpayer expenditures,” 32 GOP House members, including U.S. Reps. Austin Scott of Tifton and Rick Allen of Evans, wrote in March.

Bishop’s four Georgia Democratic colleagues, meanwhile, are publicly sidestepping the fight.

Scientific groups including the American Statistical Association, the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges and the Union of Concerned Scientists, support Bishop. They fear a relocation would undermine the quality of the agencies’ work.

“If it’s such a good idea and (Perdue) has some real reasons, why wouldn’t he share them and build a coalition of people that support it?” said Gale Buchanan, a former USDA official and onetime dean of UGA’s College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences who opposes the relocation. “Getting Congress on board, to me, would be a step in the right direction.”

Bishop tried to block the move earlier this year in a must-pass spending bill, though the provision was eventually watered down.

The USDA hired the consulting firm Ernst & Young to evaluate sites, and Perdue said he’s committed to conducting “a very transparent and professional” search.

Though Perdue said he’s willing to work with Congress, he said he’d take unilateral action if necessary.

“I do believe I have the legal authority to do this (within the powers of) the executive branch,” Perdue said, “but I would love to do it with Congress’ blessings.”

The USDA’s internal watchdog is currently reviewing whether that is indeed the case and if Perdue followed proper relocation procedures.

In a recent hearing, Bishop said Perdue’s plan would hurt morale in agencies already battered by staff departures and proposals for deep budget cuts. Keeping ERS and NIFA staff near other federal research agencies, he said, would help them meet their mission.

John Boyd, a site selection consultant in New Jersey, called government agency relocations “the next frontier of headquarters attraction.”

Modern communications and air travel lessen the need for government to be centrally located, Boyd said.

Many real estate interests want the federal government to move some functions out of the Washington area because office space is so expensive. Amazon recently selected a site in Northern Virginia for its second headquarters, a move that’s only going to make office space and talent even pricier, Boyd said.

The sprawling USDA could be a prime candidate for other relocations. It’s also something that could draw support from Republicans and rural Democrats, Boyd said.

For his part, Bishop said the tiff hasn’t harmed his relationship with Perdue. The two recently appeared together at an event at Fort Valley State University.

“Reasonable minds can disagree,” he said.

As for whether Perdue has the authority to circumvent Congress, the longtime appropriator was more tart.

“Well, maybe he does,” Bishop said, “but he has to have money to spend to do it.”
