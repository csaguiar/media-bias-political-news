"Trump claims Baltimore residents 'thanking' him for taking on Cummings, exposing 'corruption'",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-claims-baltimore-residents-thanking-him-for-taking-on-cummings-exposing-corruption,"President Trump on Tuesday said the people of Baltimore, specifically in African-American communities, are calling and “thanking” him for exposing the “corruption” in Baltimore, amid the days-long controversy surrounding his criticisms of the city and its Democratic leadership.

The president has been locked in a feud with Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., for days after he called Baltimore—which is in Cummings’ district—a “disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess.”

TRUMP SAYS BERNIE SANDERS SHOULD ALSO BE LABELED 'RACIST' FOR CALLING BALTIMORE A 'THIRD WORLD COUNTRY'

Trump, before departing the White House for Jamestown, Va. Tuesday, was asked whether he felt he was “hurting” himself with his comments about Baltimore. The president scoffed that he was, instead, “helping” himself.

“I think I’m helping myself because I’m pointing out the corruption in Baltimore,” Trump responded. “The White House and myself have received more phone calls from the people of Baltimore and other cities thanking me.”

“Those people are living in hell from Baltimore—they’re largely African-American. They really appreciate what I’m doing and they’ve let me know it. They really appreciate it,” Trump continued, touting that unemployment for African-Americans has been “the lowest in the history of our country” under his administration.

“What I’ve done for African-Americans, I would say no president has done,” Trump said, describing the administration’s successful criminal justice reform. “They are so happy about what I’ve been able to do in Baltimore and other Democrat corrupt cities…They are so thankful they called me and said finally somebody is telling the truth.”

The president went on to say that he feels “so sorry” for the people of Baltimore, and that “if they ask me, we will get involved.”

He added: “African-American people love the job I’m doing because I’m working for them—not the politicians.”

TRUMP RAMPS UP WAR OF WORDS WITH CUMMINGS, CALLS HIM A 'RACIST'

The Baltimore controversy came after Cummings criticized border patrol officials during a House Oversight Committee hearing last week. Trump, over the weekend, claimed that conditions in Baltimore were “more dangerous” than those at the border, and said that “no human being would ever want to live there.”

Democrats immediately rallied to Cummings’ side, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who was born in Baltimore, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and accused Trump of being a racist.

On Monday, Rev. Al Sharpton, an MSNBC host, joined the conversation, tweeting that he would travel to Baltimore to address Trump’s remarks and “bi-partisan outrage in the black community” over them. Trump fired back, calling Sharpton a “con man.”

“I am the least racist person of anyone,” Trump said Tuesday. “Al Sharpton is a racist.”

Trump then went on to suggest that Cummings, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, review the conditions and corruption in the city.

“Cummings should take his oversight committee and take them down to Baltimore and study the billions and billions of dollars that’s been stolen,” Trump said. “They ought to take that beautiful waste of an oversight committee and take a look at Baltimore and other Democratic-run cities.”

Cummings’ committee, though, is leading several Trump-focused investigations—including one into the security clearance process at the White House, and one into Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner’s use of private email accounts while conducting official administration business."
House GOP fears retirement wave will lead to tsunami,https://thehill.com,[],07-30-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/455201-house-gop-fears-retirement-wave-will-lead-to-tsunami,"House Republicans plotting to win back their majority in Congress fear they are on the brink of a massive wave of retirements that could force them to play defense in a high-stakes presidential election year.

Three House Republicans said last week they would not seek another term next year, catching party strategists off guard. Those announcements came earlier than in a typical election cycle, when members who are ready to hang up their voting cards usually wait until after the August recess or after the Christmas break.

Republicans in Congress strategizing to win back the House say the rush to the exits reflects the depressing reality of life in the minority and a pessimistic view of the GOP’s chances of regaining the majority.

“We are in the minority. That is never much fun in the House,” said one senior Republican member of Congress, who asked for anonymity to provide a candid assessment. “The odds are against us retaking the majority.”

Transitioning from the all-powerful majority to the back-bench minority can refocus one’s outlook on public service, said Tom Davis, a former Virginia congressman who ran the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC).

“Moving from the majority to the minority changes your mindset about why am I here, am I getting things done,” Davis said. “It’s a very frustrating life for some of these members right now. There’s been no pay raise for 11 years. You’ve got to maintain two households.”

The job of serving in Congress itself has changed in recent years. Members of Congress now routinely skip town hall meetings to avoid being confronted by angry constituents, they are frequently asked to defend President Trump Donald John TrumpProfessor installs seesaws across US-Mexico border to form connection 'on both sides' What the world can expect from the Boris Johnson government Marianne Williamson: I am not a 'wacky new-age nutcase' MORE’s Twitter habits and the House Republican Conference is increasingly influenced by a small group of hard-right conservatives.

“Serving in the era of Trump has few rewards. He has made an already hostile political environment worse. Every day there is some indefensible tweet or comment to defend or explain. It is exhausting and often embarrassing,” the member of Congress said. Even if Republicans were to win back the majority, “our edge would be narrow which means we would live under the tyranny of the Freedom Caucus. Frankly I wonder if this conference is capable of governing.”

Republican strategists say they are bracing for a new wave of exits after members check in with their families over the August recess. Two dozen Republicans won their reelection bids in 2018 by fewer than 5 percentage points; another 25 won by fewer than 10 points.

“There are going to be a lot more [retirements] to come,” said one consultant who works for House Republicans. “Between people finding themselves having to actually work hard for the first time in their long, lazy careers and members who came in in the majority and now hate life in the minority, it's just getting started.”

Olson won election to his final term by just 5 percentage points in 2018, and Democrats have signaled that districts like his, in the rapidly growing Houston suburbs, are their prime targets.

Private polling shows a close race between state Sen. Dan Bishop (R) and Iraq War veteran Dan McCready (D).

“Expect more [retirements] if Republicans lose NC-09,” said another Republican strategist involved in House races.

History argues against House Republicans’ chances of winning back their majority in a presidential year. The last time a party lost the majority in a midterm only to win it back two years later came in 1948, when Harry Truman won election to a full term and carried the House with him.

No party has gone from the minority to the majority in a presidential election year since Republicans won a narrow majority in 1952, the year Dwight Eisenhower won the presidency.

More immediate historical precedent suggests Republicans might fall even farther into the minority. President Trump’s approval ratings remain mired in the 40s, and some Republicans in Congress quietly worry he is headed for defeat next year. Others are simply tired of being asked to answer for every tweet.

“It’s way too early to tell what the [political] dynamic will be, but Trump doesn’t seem to be adding to the equation at this point. He’s doing a lot with his base, but he needs to get beyond that base,” Davis said. “President Trump promised to be a change agent, and he is. He’s torn up the old rule book, and a lot of members aren’t used to playing by these rules.”

Davis said the political climate would weigh on members’ minds as they contemplate their futures.

“Nobody,” he said, “wants to go out the hard way.”"

In the case of Donald Trump vs. the U.S. Federal Reserve, the president of the United States is likely to secure a winning verdict this week.

Central bank officials are expected to cut interest rates for the first time since the global financial crisis not because Trump demanded it. Instead, they will move in part because the president’s bruising trade policy has helped fuel a global manufacturing slowdown and injected deep uncertainty into executive suites around the world.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell won’t directly say it directly after his meetings Tuesday and Wednesday. But the central bank will reverse course at least in part to save the Trump economy from Trump.

“There is just no question that Powell has been 'Trumped' here,” said Ed Yardeni, president and chief investment strategist of Yardeni Research Inc. “Just read Powell’s comments during his recent congressional testimony and trade comes up eight times in the context of weighing on the global economy. All Trump had to do was keep up geopolitical trade uncertainty for a while and he’d get the Fed to cut rates.”

Trump continued to hammer away at the Fed in public comments and tweets on Monday, arguing that a series of rate hikes over the last three years slowed what would otherwise be a much faster economy.

“The Fed ‘raised’ way too early and way too much,” Trump tweeted. “Their quantitative tightening was another big mistake. While our Country is doing very well, the potential wealth creation that was missed, especially when measured against our debt, is staggering.”

The Fed “raised” way too early and way too much. Their quantitative tightening was another big mistake. While our Country is doing very well, the potential wealth creation that was missed, especially when measured against our debt, is staggering. We are competing with other..... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2019

But the data does not really support his argument. Interest rates, adjusted for inflation, remain historically low. And consumer spending, which is where higher rates might slow things down, remains the dominant engine of growth. It is on the corporate investment side — where the 2017 tax cut was supposed to unleash a wave of growth — where conditions have stalled.

The U.S. GDP report out last week showed growth slowing to a 2.1 percent pace in the second quarter from 3.1 percent in the first. Most of the gains came from consumer spending, which rose a strong 4.3 percent. Business investment declined by 0.6 percent, the first such drop since the first quarter of 2016. Exports, a key metric for Trump’s promise to reinvigorate American manufacturing, plunged by 5.2 percent and imports rose, increasing the trade deficit.

Trump administration officials say the president is taking a longer-term view of trade relationships and hopes to eventually win concessions from China on important issues including forced technology transfer and intellectual property theft.

They also contend the Fed went too far in rate hikes. National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said in a recent interview that the Fed should make an ""insurance"" cut in rates to prevent any slowdown and give the tax cuts more time to work.

Meanwhile, signs of a declining manufacturing sector in the U.S. and abroad continue to pile up. The J.P. Morgan Global Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index, or PMI, reading recently moved into contraction territory for the first time since 2012. Of the 30 nations issuing a PMI report for June, 18 registered a contraction including China, Japan, the UK and Germany.

In the United States, the Institute for Supply Management index for manufacturing dropped for a third straight month in June to 51.7, still indicating expansion but at the weakest level since October 2016, before the trade battles began. Fresh manufacturing data for the U.S. and China will come out later this week.

Job growth in manufacturing companies has also slowed from 22,000 new jobs per month last year to 8,000 per month this year. The Fed said earlier this month that U.S. industrial production was technically in recession, meaning two straight quarters of contraction.

Powell on multiple occasions has cited concerns that trade fights were hurting growth and denting confidence, while being careful not to antagonize Trump directly.

“What we’re seeing is business fixed investment … it’s really slowed down now,” Powell said in congressional testimony earlier this month. “There’s no perfect way to identify these things, but we do connect that to trade policy uncertainty and also uncertainty on global growth, weaker manufacturing around the world.”

The Fed has made clear that trade tensions loom large in its worries about risks to the economy. Company investments in long-term projects like factories and technology picked up during the first half of 2018 in the wake of corporate tax cuts, but those investments have faded much faster than expected.

The central bank’s business contacts tell the Fed they aren’t sure where to put their money because they’re not sure where tariffs might show up next.

“If you’re a manufacturing company in our economy, of any size, chances are pretty good that your supply chain goes across national borders,” Powell said in his testimony. “That supply chain is really part of how you do business, and you just assume that it’s working and you can focus on your clients. When your supply chain is called into question — we hear this a lot from businesses — when it’s called into question, you pull back.”

Powell said trade uncertainty “spiked” in May. Though he didn’t explain why, that coincides with the president’s threat to put tariffs on Mexico over the ongoing migration crisis. Trump's tweet on Mexico spooked investors because it threw the future of the renegotiated NAFTA deal into doubt and raised the possibility of retaliatory tariffs from the U.S.’s third-largest trading partner.

The central bank has also quantified the direct impacts of the trade battles, though those are less a factor in the growth picture. In its semiannual monetary policy report to Congress earlier this month, the central bank estimated that new tariffs might have lowered U.S. imports by roughly $70 billion.

The impact of Trump’s trade wars are starting to weighing on some corporate earnings like those of equipment maker Caterpillar, Apple and chip-maker Nvidia, among others. Economists fear it could get worse.

“Trump’s trade policies are starting to show up in corporate balance sheets,” said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at consulting firm RSM. “In the third quarter you’d expect to see profit-margin compression across a wider array of earnings reports and the consumer will feel it, which could cause a pullback in consumption. That’s where the problem is for the White House.”

Businesses are also becoming less bullish about future growth, in part because they are uncertain how they will be impacted by tariff policy. The National Association for Business Economics on Monday reported that in its latest survey, members said they believed growth will slow and corporate sales and profits will decline this year.

Inside the survey, 56 percent of goods-producing firms said they had altered supply chains in response to trade policy and 38 percent said they’d delayed investments.

The Fed will likely step into this slowdown scenario on Wednesday with a rate cut of at least a quarter point and perhaps as much as a half a point. Trump already predicted on Monday that whatever it does will not be enough for him.

....countries that know how to play the game against the U.S. That’s actually why the E.U. was formed....and for China, until now, the U.S. has been “easy pickens.” The Fed has made all of the wrong moves. A small rate cut is not enough, but we will win anyway! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2019

Economists, meanwhile, question whether a Fed rate cut will do very much to alter the economic picture. Part of the Fed’s rationale for a cut is that the inflation central banks feared would arrive with the jobless rate at historic lows has not arrived. In that sense, the pivot to cuts will be a big win for progressives who have long argued for Powell and the central bank to allow the economy to run hotter.

But with borrowing costs still very low, it’s not likely to change underlying corporate behavior, which may only respond to a more certain policy environment.

“The biggest risk to growth for the economy is the uncertainty as to where economic policy is headed,” said Steven Ricchiuto, chief U.S. economist at Mizuho Securities USA. “And it’s not as if the Fed can fix some of these problems related to uncertainty caused by the administration and these global-related issues.”

There is also some fear that the Fed cutting interest rates will keep investors searching for investments that offer a higher rate of return. These so called “high yield” investments include lower-grade corporate debt and high-risk loans that have risen in volume in recent years and could create significant problems if a sharper slowdown forces defaults.

“The lack of credit is not the problem in the global economy,” Yardeni said. “Central bankers are convinced they can fix problems, when in fact they can’t. And the reach for yield is starting to get borderline insane with the lack of covenants in bonds and loans. I’m starting to get a little feeling of deja vu all over again.”"

Buzz60

WASHINGTON – After two-and-a-half weeks of racially polarizing shots at his opponents, President Donald Trump said Tuesday he is looking forward to two nights of Democratic debates at which his tweets on Baltimore and minority members of Congress will likely be addressed.

""I think I'm helping myself,"" Trump told reporters while defending his recent attacks on African-American and Hispanic lawmakers, claiming he is pointing out ""the tremendous corruption"" in cities like Baltimore.

""I am the least racist person there is anywhere in the world,"" Trump claimed.

Democratic presidential candidates gathering in Detroit argue Trump is stoking racial resentments, and are likely to assail his views during debates on Tuesday and Wednesday nights.

On Saturday, Trump targeted Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., when he described Baltimore, part of which is in Cummings' district, as ""a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess."" He also claimed that ""no human would want to live there"" and that the district is ""far worse and more dangerous"" than conditions on the U.S. southern border with Mexico.

Telling reporters ""I am watching"" the debates, Trump said he sees former Vice President Joe Biden as the favorite for the nomination to oppose him in the fall of 2020.

""I think he'll limp across the line,"" he said.

Trump and Baltimore: Pelosi denounces Trump's 'racist attacks' on Rep. Elijah Cummings and Baltimore

On Monday, Biden said ""the fact that President Trump continues to use the power of the presidency to unleash racist attacks on the people he serves is despicable.""

Trump maintained his attacks on Baltimore on Tuesday, saying it has ""been very badly mishandled for many years ... The people are living in hell in Baltimore."" He also claimed he would visit Baltimore ""at the right time.""

Baltimore Mayor Bernard ""Jack"" Young described Trump's attacks on his city, including a series of tweets in recent days, as ""racist” bids for votes.

“We do have our problems, but we are no different than any other American city,” Young, a Democrat, told USA TODAY. “I just think the president should focus more on America as a place where we can live as one nation, not divided by race.”

'Help us':Baltimore Mayor Jack Young fires back at Donald Trump over tweets, blames feds

Trump spoke with reporters en route to a speech in Jamestown, Va., to mark the 400th Anniversary of the First Representative Legislative Assembly.

The Democratic debates in Detroit come amid weeks of racial tensions sparked by Trump.

First came a July 14 tweet attacking members of the ""Squad,"" a group of four women lawmakers of color who have criticized Trump on various issues. He said they should ""go back"" to where they came from, although all are U.S. citizens.

At a July 17 rally in Greenville, N.C., Trump supporters chanted ""send her back"" in reference to Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., who came to the United States as a child refugee from Somalia.

This past weekend, Trump expanded his attack to include Cummings, an African-American and a committee chairman who is seeking financial records from Trump and members of his family. Trump said the Maryland congressman ""should start doing some oversight on Baltimore.""

In other comments, Trump:

- Defended his new nominee for director of national intelligence, Republican Rep. John Ratcliffe of Texas. Democrats say Ratcliffe, a former U.S. attorney, is not qualified for the job and has claimed experience in terrorism prosecutions that he actually lacks.

Trump said that Ratcliffe, who would replace Dan Coats if confirmed by the Senate, is “a very talented guy.”

- Assailed a Washington Post column that described Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., as a ""Russian asset"" for opposing federal election security legislation.

""I think the Washington Post is a Russian asset,"" Trump said.

- Again criticized the Federal Reserve, saying its expected interest rate cut this week is too little, too late.

""The Fed is often wrong,"" Trump said.

- Expressed skepticism about renewed negotiations with China on a new trade agreement with the United States. He also said the Chinese are balking at concessions because they hope Trump will lose to the Democratic nominee in the 2020 election.

""They would just love if I got defeated,"" the president said. ""They’ll pray that Trump loses.”

A decision issued Monday by Attorney General William Barr will restrict the ability of migrants to claim asylum based on their family relations.

In a precedent-setting immigration court opinion, Barr said that simply being part of a nuclear family targeted for persecution doesn’t qualify as a “particular social group” eligible for asylum in the United States.

Story Continued Below

“The fact that a criminal group — such as a drug cartel, gang, or guerrilla force — targets a group of people does not, standing alone, transform those people into a particular social group,” the attorney general wrote.

President Donald Trump has sought to restrict access to asylum, which his administration views as a magnet that draws migrants north from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Former Attorney General Jeff Sessionsissued a similar immigration court decision in June 2018 that blocked asylum for victims of domestic violence and gang violence, a move that drew condemnation from pro-migrant advocates. A federal judge based in Washington, D.C., blocked key parts of a policy related to the decision six months later.

Barr’s ruling will guide future decisions in the immigration courts, which are not part of the federal judiciary and fall under the purview of the Justice Department. Barr highlighted that authority in the ruling Monday, saying “the attorney general has primary responsibility for construing and applying provisions in the immigration laws.”

To receive asylum in the U.S., applicants must prove they faced persecution in their home countries based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group.

Barr’s decision Monday will limit the ability of a familial relationship to qualify as “membership in a particular social group.“ The number of asylum seekers who could be affected each year was not immediately clear.

The attorney general issued the decision in a case that involved a deported Mexican immigrant who claimed drug cartel members had targeted him because they wanted to sell drugs in his father’s Mexico City store.

The Board of Immigration Appeals found that the man’s relationship with his father qualified as a “particular social group,” but ultimately denied the asylum request because the man could not prove he was persecuted over the relationship.

Barr found that being part of a family meets the standard for asylum only when the family is “socially distinct in the eyes of its society.”

Immigration law advocates said the decision defied the precedents of at least two federal appeals courts, which have held that targeting based on family membership can qualify an immigrant for asylum.

“The family provides ‘a prototypical example of a particular social group,’” the Richmond-based 4th Circuitwrote in 2011, quoting an earlier case from the San Francisco-based 9th Circuit.

“It's a significant declaration of power from the A.G. and one that will hopefully take a beating in court,” Aaron Reichlin-Melnick of the American Immigration Council said on Twitter.

The DOJ asylum move is only the latest policy change to limit asylum.

Trump announced Friday that his administration had struck a deal with Guatemala that would require asylum seekers passing through that nation to first seek protections there.

The asylum agreement came after a San Francisco-based federal judge temporarily blocked a Trump regulation that barred asylum seekers who passed through other nations en route to the southwest border.

US Defense Dept. to Experiment With Blockchain-Based Security,https://cointelegraph.com,"['Max Boddy', 'Crypto Fan', 'Masao Akimoto', 'Mystellar Org']",07-30-2019,2019,7,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-defense-dept-to-experiment-with-blockchain-based-security,"The United States Department of Defense (DoD) is pursuing blockchain solutions for cybersecurity as part of its digital modernization strategy.

The DoD released plans for blockchain tech in its four-year roadmap on July 12, entitled “DoD Digital Modernization Strategy: DoD Information Resource Management Strategic Plan FY19–23.”

According to the report, the DoD’s research branch, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), is currently engaged in at least two exploratory blockchain projects focused on cybersecurity.

First, DARPA is experimenting with blockchain in order to construct a new — or improved — communication and transaction platform. Stated intentions for this platform include communications between units and headquarters as well as between intelligence officers and the Pentagon.

Second, DARPA is attempting to create an “unhackable code” with blockchain technology, citing blockchain’s ability to gather intel on bad actors who attempt to hack into databases.

DARPA’s blockchain workshop

As reported by Cointelegraph, DARPA previously announced plans to host a two-day blockchain workshop in February. DARPA was particularly keen on examining permissionless consensus protocols. The organization also noted that there were potentially valuable use cases for blockchain in data storage, saying:

“Technologies for distributed consensus protocols have been revolutionized by their prominent role in cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies. These technologies have dramatic implications for the security and resilience of critical data storage and computation tasks, including for the Department of Defense.”

In December 2018, DoD officials examined how blockchain technology could help emergencies responses in disaster situations in a presentation hosted by the Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support’s Continuous Process Improvement."

“I find this appalling and I find it immoral,” said John “Mac” Stipanovich, a veteran GOP operative in Florida and a frequent Trump critic. “But I cannot state with any degree of confidence that it is bad politics for this particular man.”

Stipanovich added, “The assumption is that these dog whistles — more like ‘dog bullhorns,' really — are going to appeal to white working class voters who feel threatened by the demographic changes in the country.”

Those voters were the bedrock of Trump’s surprise 2016 victory, helping him narrowly win crucial states such as Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.

But the question is whether Trump’s embrace of ever-more polarizing rhetoric — especially on race, the rawest sore in American public life — will turn off softer supporters.

Democrats insist that if Trump’s strategy is not only “base-first” but “base-only,” he is in serious trouble.

“It’s one of the things that has driven me crazy since 2016,” said Democratic strategist Mark Longabaugh. “This crazy preoccupation on the part of the media with ‘his base, his base, his base.’ …You have to win both the base and other voters. You have to win those who will split their tickets as well as mobilizing your supporters.”

Longabaugh added, “I just can’t believe he wins back the presidency with 45 percent of the vote.”

Trump’s most recent attacks come in the wake of a fusillade against the four progressive Democratic congresswomen known as “The Squad.” Trump tweeted that the quartet should “go back” to where they came from.

None of the congresswomen is white, which led Trump to face widespread accusations of racism, including from some members of his own party.

Trump and his defenders adamantly deny any racist intent, and argue that he is held to a different standard than other politicians.

On Monday, Trump alluded on Twitter to 2015 comments from Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersPoll: Beto O'Rourke leads 2020 Democrats in Texas by 3 points, followed by Biden Coalition to air anti-Medicare for All ads during Democratic debates Marianne Williamson: I am not a 'wacky new-age nutcase' MORE (I-Vt.), in which the left-wing senator compared parts of Baltimore to “a third world country.”

Trump omitted the context, however. Sanders, who is in the midst of another White House bid, was referring to wealth inequalities within the city.

“My style is to talk about what unites us, not what divides us,” Hurd said. “I think that is something that’s better, long run, and also is more helpful when it comes to trying to win elections.”

Many Republicans in Washington sing from a similar song-sheet when it comes to the nature of Trump’s attacks.

In particular, they worry that Republicans fighting to win seats in competitive states or districts are weighed down by having to answer for the president’s latest incendiary remarks.

Trump’s approval ratings remain remarkably low given that he is presiding over a booming economy.

There are also some signs that Trump’s approach could turn off parts of the traditional Republican coalition.

Last week, pollster Stan Greenberg released focus group results that appeared to show white working class women recoiling at parts of Trump’s rhetoric even as white working class men were broadly supportive.

Trump loyalists will dismiss those results because they come from a Democratic pollster who was conducting the focus groups on behalf of a labor union, the American Federation of Teachers.

Some Republicans are also quick to suggest that the media and Democrats are exaggerating the likely effect of Trump’s current tactics.

“There is a long time between now and 2020, so I am loath to say any one thing, especially any series of tweets, is going to affect the outcome,” said Matt Gorman, a former communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee.

Some figures on the left agree — to a point.

They fear that Trump is creating a distraction that will pit working class whites against their non-white peers. And they worry about Democrats getting sucked into that game, rather than outlining an agenda for helping less affluent Americans of all races.

Cornel West, the prominent academic and a Sanders supporter, told The Hill that Trump should be called out for his rhetoric, but that it should not be the sole focus.

“He’s a racist. Say it one time and move on. Or ask, how do your policies, Mr. Trump, speak to the precious citizens of color in Baltimore?”

“I don’t see his anti-poverty program or his policy for clean air,” West added.

“Trump does this — plays this game of distraction — and we lose sight of where his priorities are. And where ours are.”

Bobby Scott says the US Department of Agriculture concealed data showing that its recent proposed changes to the food stamp program could result in more than 500,000 low-income students losing free meals.

In a letter to Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue , Scott, a Virginia Democrat who's the chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor, writes that the impact on school meal eligibility was not included in the Trump administration's formal proposal revising who qualifies for the food stamp program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

Scott writes that ""the proposed rule will impact not only SNAP eligibility, but will also affect children's eligibility for school meal programs."" The program, Scott noted, ""allows schools to provide free meals to all students in high-poverty communities.""

The congressman writes that his committee's staff learned about the impact on school lunches in a phone briefing with USDA staff and requested that the department revise its proposal to include the estimate and restart the 60-day comment period.

He notes the USDA is required by law to include ""relevant scientific and technical findings"" in proposed rules and says the effect on school meals is an ""important technical finding that must be made public.""

Border Patrol tried to fire him for lying about gun incident. Now he's Trump’s DHS spokesman,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/border-patrol-tried-to-fire-him-for-making-stuff-up-now-he-is-the-dhs-spokesman,"The top Homeland Security spokesman, brought in to serve last month by acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan, is a former Border Patrol agent whom U.S. Customs and Border Protection once attempted to fire for faking a crime against himself, according to three CBP officials with first-hand knowledge of the incident and a fourth who is also aware of it.

DHS acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of Media Operations Jose “Lu” Maheda was terminated by Border Patrol a year into his service during the 1990s. Since then, as one official put it, he has “failed up,” getting his job back and eventually becoming a regional Border Patrol spokesman. And now he is the top spokesman for the 240,000-person department because of his connection to McAleenan.

“The guy’s a proven liar and can’t testify in court and yet he’s a spokesman for DHS,” charged one CBP official who worked with Maheda at the time of the incident. “He is 100% a McAleenan sycophant.”

Under the 1972 Giglio v. United States decision, a witness whose integrity has been called into question cannot testify in court.

While working at the Border Patrol station in Nogales, Arizona during his first year on the job in 1996, Maheda left his loaded gun on the front seat of his work vehicle and set out on foot.

“While he was out — and unbeknownst to him — a supervisor came across the car and saw the” firearm, the official said. “He [Maheda] had failed to secure it, and it was just laying there, and that’s when the supervisor saw it and was like, ‘Oh my gosh, I’ve got to get this out of here.’ So the supervisor pulled the gun out. When Lu got back to the vehicle, he saw the shotgun was missing and didn’t realize the supervisor had taken it. So what he did was, he bust the window out, then went back and reported the shotgun stolen.”

A second official who worked with Maheda at the time confirmed the set of events, as did a third.

“He had a longarm go missing from his Border Patrol four-wheel drive so he busted the window out and made a notification that it was stolen, when it was in fact that an agent had just played a joke on him when he left his door unlocked,” said the third person, who also worked in Tucson at the time.

“There was no squirming out of that one. They had him dead to right,” the first official said.

Another source, a union official with secondhand knowledge of the incident, said the supervisor took the gun out of the vehicle to “safeguard” it, not as a joke. Maheda “broke the window and reported it was stolen,” he said.

While DHS does not comment on specific employee personnel actions, a DHS official provided the following information.

""Over 20 years ago, we can confirm that there was an allegation and subsequent full investigation,"" the official said. ""The employee was afforded due process and since then, the employee has had an exemplary record being promoted throughout the ranks without ill effect.""

Maheda was served termination paperwork a day after the incident. He fought the termination with the help of the National Border Patrol Council and kept his job on what the union official described as a “technicality” because he was issued a termination notice on the last day of routine year-long probation period.

The third official with first-hand knowledge of the incident said the move to provide him the termination paperwork the day after may have been intentional because it gave him a way to fight the decision, since the letter should have been served immediately.

“There were all these rumors that his brother, who was a BORTAC (Border Patrol Tactical Unit) agent that was very well thought of — that somebody may have been looking out for the family with that clerical mistake,” the official said.

At the time, Border Patrol agents in their first year could be fired for any reason without being able to appeal the decision or respond to the chief patrol agent’s concerns. A union representative at the time “argued that he was technically no longer on probation because his regular shift had ended before they fired him” and therefore the probation period was technically up, and was able to get an arbitrator to agree, according to the first CBP official. Maheda was reinstated and went to work for the union.

At a certain point in his career at DHS, Maheda began to have ""direct interface"" with McAleenan, who would eventually promote him to his current position.

The third official said Maheda was reprimanded during his work for the internal Border Patrol headquarters division during the 2000s for having “abused travel all over the country basically to install flat screen TVs.”

“He got transferred out of that branch during a bottom-up review that was done by the Border Patrol headquarters staff, led by then Operations Chief Kevin Oaks,” said this source said.

""The United States Border Patrol often conducts reviews and assessments of programs and personnel assignments. During Chief Kevin Oaks’ tenure, the United States Border Patrol restructured several programs and divisions within the Headquarters element, resulting reassignments of multiple personnel and program responsibilities,"" the DHS official said.

The first official described Maheda's promotions as ""one of those things you just keep scratching your head"" over.

“The Department is proud to include a member of the United States Border Patrol within the Department’s Office of Public Affairs,"" said Andrew Meehan, Acting Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs. ""Border Patrol agents have a unique and first-hand knowledge of the impact of the crisis on the southern border and continue to provide thoughtful guidance on how to communicate those challenges to the public.”"
US Defense Department to Develop Blockchain Cybersecurity Shield,https://www.coindesk.com,[],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.coindesk.com/us-department-of-defense-is-developing-a-blockchain-cybersecurity-shield,"The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) is looking to forge a blockchain cybersecurity shield.

In a report published on July 12 titled Digital Modernization Strategy, the DoD outlined several ways to advance the nation’s digital defenses. This includes the integration of cloud and quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and improved communications through distributed ledgers.

In fact, DARPA, the research wing of the Department is already experimenting with the technology “to create a more efficient, robust, and secure platform,” to secure messaging and process transactions, reports Decrypt.

Specifically, blockchain may be deployed between units and headquarters as well as intelligence officers and the Pentagon. As part of the Digital Identity Management program, the agency may also issue a digital token that authenticates an agent’s identity.

The DoD is also experimenting with the technology to facilitate the creation of an unhackable code to secure its databases.

As part of the second Cryptographic Modernization program, in effect since 2000, the Department is replacing old hardware and cryptographic systems to meet the challenges of the improved computing power of the nation’s adversaries.

Citing the trustless, transparent, and immutable attributes of blockchain the Department writes:

“Blockchain networks not only reduce the probability of compromise, but also impose significantly greater costs on an adversary to achieve it.”

The shift from “low value to high-value work” is also part of the DoDs’ Big Data Platform (BDP), which will handle petabytes of data involved in a number of cross-agency projects. The platform “provides the ability to perform aggregation, correlation, historical trending,” and may perform pattern recognition to “predict attacks.”

"Trump's trip to his Turnberry resort cost the State Department at least $233K, review finds",https://www.cnn.com,['Jennifer Hansler'],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/29/politics/trump-turnberry-resort-cost-state-department-oig/index.html,"(CNN) The State Department spent at least $233,732 on President Donald Trump's July 2018 trip to his Turnberry resort in Scotland, according to a letter from the department's inspector general obtained by CNN.

The July 22 letter from Inspector General Steve Linick to Democratic Sens. Tom Carper of Delaware and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland details only the costs that were paid by the State Department and not reimbursed. Among the costs were more than $42,000 in overtime, more than $111,000 in hotels, more than $28,000 in rental cars and more than $51,000 in temporary duty costs, according to the letter.

The OIG review was not able to determine how much the resort gained in profit from the visit. The State Department spent $728 on three rooms for two nights at the Trump-owned property. According to the letter, the department said they were used by the US ambassador to the United Kingdom, his wife and his chief of protocol. The department said that the Trump Turnberry's rate was ""the lowest of all the hotels being utilized for this VIP visit"" and offered ""a fair and reasonable rate to the Government,"" according to document cited in the letter.

The Hill was the first to report on Linick's letter.

The State Department OIG review was prompted by a call for investigation made by the three Democratic lawmakers shortly after the President's trip. They also requested an inquiry from the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General. The department OIG did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment Monday.

Homeland Security to Issue Hacking Alert for Small Planes,https://ktla.com,['Associated Press'],07-30-2019,2019,7,https://ktla.com/2019/07/30/homeland-security-to-issue-hacking-alert-for-small-planes/,"The Department of Homeland Security plans to issue a security alert Tuesday for small planes, warning that modern flight systems are vulnerable to hacking if someone manages to gain physical access to the aircraft.

An alert from the DHS critical infrastructure computer emergency response team recommends that plane owners ensure they restrict unauthorized physical access to their aircraft until the industry develops safeguards to address the issue, which was discovered by a Boston-based cybersecurity company and reported to the federal government.

Most airports have security in place to restrict unauthorized access and there is no evidence that anyone has exploited the vulnerability. But a DHS official told The Associated Press that the agency independently confirmed the security flaw with outside partners and a national research laboratory, and decided it was necessary to issue the warning.

The cybersecurity firm, Rapid7, found that an attacker could potentially disrupt electronic messages transmitted across a small plane’s network, for example by attaching a small device to its wiring, that would affect aircraft systems.

Engine readings, compass data, altitude and other readings “could all be manipulated to provide false measurements to the pilot,” according to the DHS alert obtained in advance by AP.

The warning reflects the fact that aircraft systems are increasingly reliant on networked communications systems, much like modern cars. The auto industry has already taken steps to address similar concerns after researchers exposed vulnerabilities.

The Rapid7 report focused only on small aircraft because their systems are easier for researchers to acquire. Large aircraft frequently use more complex systems and must meet additional security requirements. The DHS alert does not apply to older small planes with mechanical control systems.

But Patrick Kiley, Rapid7’s lead researcher on the issue, said an attacker could exploit the vulnerability with access to a plane or by bypassing airport security.

“Someone with five minutes and a set of lock picks can gain access (or) there’s easily access through the engine compartment,” Kiley said.

Jeffrey Troy, president of the Aviation Information Sharing and Analysis Center, an industry organization for cybersecurity information, said there is a need to improve the security in networked operating systems but emphasized that the hack depends on bypassing physical security controls mandated by law.

With access, “you have hundreds of possibilities to disrupt any system or part of an aircraft,” Troy said.

The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement that a scenario where someone has unrestricted physical access is unlikely, but the report is also “an important reminder to remain vigilant” about physical and cybersecurity aircraft procedures.

Aviation cybersecurity has been an issue of growing concern around the world.

In March, the U.S. Department of Transportation’s inspector general found that the FAA had “not completed a comprehensive, strategy policy framework to identify and mitigate cybersecurity risks.” The FAA agreed and said it would look to have a plan in place by the end of September.

The UN’s body for aviation proposed its first strategy for securing civil aviation from hackers that’s expected to go before the General Assembly in September, said Pete Cooper, an ex-Royal Air Force fast jet pilot and cyber operations officer who advises the aviation industry.

The vulnerability disclosure report is the product of nearly two years of work by Rapid7. After their researchers assessed the flaw, the company alerted DHS. Tuesday’s DHS alert recommends manufacturers review how they implement these open electronics systems known as “the CAN bus” to limit a hacker’s ability to perform such an attack.

The CAN bus functions like a small plane’s central nervous system. Targeting it could allow an attacker to stealthily hijack a pilot’s instrument readings or even take control of the plane, according to the Rapid7 report obtained by The AP.

“CAN bus is completely insecure,” said Chris King, a cybersecurity expert who has worked on vulnerability analysis of large-scale systems. “It was never designed to be in an adversarial environment, (so there’s) no validation” that what the system is being told to do is coming from a legitimate source.

Only a few years ago, most auto manufacturers used the open CAN bus system in their cars. But after researchers publicly demonstrated how they could be hacked, auto manufacturers added on layers of security, like putting critical functions on separate networks that are harder to access externally.

The disclosure highlights issues in the automotive and aviation industries about whether a software vulnerability should be treated like a safety defect — with its potential for costly manufacturer recalls and implied liability — and what responsibility manufacturers should have in ensuring their products are hardened against such attacks. The vulnerability also highlights the reality that it’s becoming increasingly difficult to separate cybersecurity from security overall.

“A lot of aviation folks don’t see the overlap between information security, cybersecurity, of an aircraft, and safety,” said Beau Woods, a cyber safety innovation fellow with the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank. “They see them as distinct things.”

The CAN bus networking scheme was developed in the 1980s and is extremely popular for use in boats, drones, spacecraft, planes and cars — all areas where there’s more noise interference and it’s advantageous to have less wiring. It’s actually increasingly used in airplanes today due to the ease and cost of implementation, Kiley said.

Given that airplanes have a longer manufacturing cycle, “what we’re trying to do is get out ahead of this.”

The report didn’t name the vendors Rapid7 tested, but the company alerted them over a year ago, the report states."
Anti-Tech Wave Grows with New Justice Department Antitrust Efforts,https://reason.com,"[""Andrea O'Sullivan"", 'Zuri Davis', 'Alex Muresianu', 'Elizabeth Nolan Brown', 'J.D. Tuccille', 'Shikha Dalmia', 'Jacob Sullum']",07-30-2019,2019,7,https://reason.com/2019/07/30/anti-tech-wave-grows-with-new-justice-department-antitrust-efforts/,"The U.S. is moving against big tech in a big way. Last week, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced a broad antitrust investigation into whether unnamed technology companies have engaged in anti-competitive activities. This is in addition to DOJ's joint antitrust efforts with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC); DOJ is tackling Apple and Google, while the FTC has Amazon and Facebook. The FTC formed a separate task force to monitor competition in the technology industry earlier this year. Oh yeah, and the House Judiciary Committee is sniffing around for Silicon Valley shenanigans, too.

So far, the DOJ has not named names. Since ""search, social media, and some retail services online"" were specifically mentioned, it's a good bet that Google, Facebook, and Amazon are among the targets. We can probably throw in the Apple App Store, as well.

We also don't know whether the investigations will be voluntary, or if DOJ will exert authority to compel discovery on heretofore unknown dirty deeds. So it's hard to say exactly what DOJ has up its sleeves.

But if the Trump administration's posture towards big tech is any indication, we should expect a fairly aggressive examination of possible anti-competitive actions.

During his nomination hearing, Attorney General Robert Barr stated that he wondered ""how such huge behemoths that now exist in Silicon Valley have taken shape under the nose of the antitrust enforcers"" and advocated for ""vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws to preserve competition."" In particular, Barr worries that large platforms enjoy network effects so substantial that ""particular sectors could essentially be subsumed into these networks.""

The writing was always on the Facebook Wall. It's true that until fairly recently, most technology companies had something of a neon halo about them. We used and enjoyed social media platforms every day, those harmless and amusing outlets for comradery and cat-posting. Amazon gave us great cheap junk, Apple had the coolest products. Google gave us, well, everything else.

But how the mighty fall. After a few bonkers elections and a mass awakening to just how all those ""free"" services make money, America now calls for tech companies' heads.

It's an illustration of general U.S. attitudes to antitrust. On paper, enforcers like the DOJ and FTC are only supposed to intervene when a firm restricts output and raises prices, or when it possesses an ""essential facility"" available nowhere else. In other words, officials should get involved where consumers are demonstrably harmed, as gauged by measurable economic outcomes like price increases or output restriction.

In practice, however, many call for firms to be broken up anytime we feel they are getting too big. We forget today, but at one point, the hot talk in tech was that MySpace and AOL were due for the antitrust treatment. Today, these names do not conjure images of anti-competitive activity because they were successfully competed against—by Facebook and Google. Yet their actions remain the same.

Under the ""market structure"" conception of antitrust, it's not so much about protecting consumers as it is about protecting competition—that is to say, protecting current and future competitors.

It's hard to argue, for instance, that Windows users were harmed by the free Internet Explorer browser that came preinstalled on their computers. Microsoft's aggressive behind-the-scenes campaign to convince vendors to snub alternative browsers didn't really affect user experience. If you wanted a different browser, you could just use IE to download another browser. But competitors like Netscape clearly were harmed by such structural defaults, which is why DOJ eventually intervened.

Microsoft was big and seemed unassailable. Of course, it wasn't, but not along the dimensions over which '90s antitrust regulators so agonized. The fall came, to regulators at least, out of nowhere: Apple's streamlined strategy and the open source operating system Linux dealt major blows to Microsoft's seemingly untouchable positions in the personal computing (hello, iPhone) and server markets. Browsers were the wrong battle—dirty as the fight may have been for poor Netscape—and today Microsoft browsers are considered a bit of a joke.

In a similar way, successes spelled trouble for tech titans. It was only a matter of time until they got big enough and unpopular enough to draw antitrust scrutiny. It's almost tautological: The most competitive companies in hindsight become the most ""anti-competitive."" (Is there a major company who got there by playing nice?) You can always find something to point to as an unfair and unbreakable barrier to competition.

It doesn't sound great to say you are breaking up firms to benefit other companies. Today, aggressive antitrust enforcement is couched in terms of ""innovation."" It's not that we are shoring up businesses that couldn't keep up. We are taking down today's titans so that they little guys can get a crack at them. With more breathing room, tomorrow's paradigm shifts can sooner take flight today. Some go so far as to claim that without the DOJ's antitrust case tying up Microsoft, Google would have never taken off.

The Justice Department's statements on their investigations hew to this new conception of antitrust as a harbinger of tomorrow's innovation. Its press release singles out practices that have ""reduced competition"" and ""stifled innovation"" for scrutiny. Last on that list, by the way, are activities that ""otherwise harmed consumers.""

We'll have to wait and see what the DOJ will dig up as evidence of anti-competitive behaviors. Perhaps they will discover some truly heinous deeds. Or maybe something fairly benign will be touted as proof that online platforms' gains were ill-gotten, or that their very size is on its face is bad for competition. After all, antitrust regulators will want to come up with something.

They walk a fine line. It's not hard to imagine scenarios where actions that are bad for competitors are also bad for consumers. Let's say Microsoft's browsers blocked users from downloading alternative options. That would clearly limit choice and competition, and would probably stall browser innovation as well. But it's not always the case that what makes competitors' jobs harder makes consumers' lives worse. Regulators should keep the distinctions clear.

The big guys are ready for a fight, and their lawyers are surely fashioning preemptive rebuttals to defend their most notorious business practices from antitrust affronts. It's how the game is played.

Should we expect these antitrust efforts to do much for innovation?

Former public defender: DOJ plan to resume federal executions a 'recipe for problems',https://thehill.com,[],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/hilltv/rising/455140-former-public-defender-trumps-plan-to-resume-federal-executions-is-recipe-for-problems,"Former public defender Robert Dunham on Monday said that the Trump administration’s plan to resume federal executions after nearly two decades is a “recipe for problems,” saying that such a move could catch some authorities unprepared if anything goes wrong.

“What we’ve seen is that there’s been 15 years of no executions,” Dunham, now the executive director of the nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center, said in an appearance on Hill.TV.

“Now you’re going to carry out five executions in the span of five weeks, three executions in the span of five days with personnel that have not carried out any executions at all,” he continued. “That particular compressed schedule if it goes forward is a recipe for problems.”

Dunham explained that federal authorities carrying out the executions need to be properly trained.

“These are going to be the first executions, so you know they’re going to be legal challenges — they frequently go on until the last minute and so you’ve got potentially unprepared personnel facing a situation that none of them has faced in a period of 15 years,” he told Hill.TV.

The Justice Department announced last week that it plans to reinstate the federal death penalty, beginning with the executions of death-row inmates later this year. All five of the inmates that Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrFormer public defender: DOJ plan to resume federal executions a 'recipe for problems' The death penalty is racially biased, fiscally irresponsible and very inaccurate Trump starts another day with Cummings attack: '25 years of all talk, no action!' MORE named in his release were convicted for the murders of children.

“The Justice Department upholds the rule of law — and we owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system,” Barr’s statement read in part.

Dunham, meanwhile, cast doubt over whether the executions, which are scheduled for December 2019 and January 2020, will actually move forward.

“In the statement last week, Attorney General Barr said he was directing the bureau of prisons to adopt a new protocol, which is going to be a single drug — pentobarbital — the same drug that’s used in Texas and Georgia and Missouri,” he said.

“But the difficulty as a legal matter is you can’t say this is our new protocol, you have to go through the rule-making process,” he added.

Dunham said this compressed system doesn’t allow for “meaningful consideration” for ensuring whether the drugs were obtained legally by a drug company with the appropriate health and safety records.

“If you’re going to have a death penalty — the ultimate in the law — I think it’s critical that we follow the law,” he told Hill.TV.

Barr's announcement comes as the number of executions in the U.S. has declined over the last decade.

According to a report by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, the number of death-row inmates had fallen for the 17th consecutive year in 2017.

It also comes amid concerns about whether capital punishment disproportionately impacts African Americans. Dunham said there is still a disproportionate number of people of color who are on death rows around the country, saying this discrimination generally happens in two stages.

“The first is who gets capitally prosecuted — what kind of case and there we see a ‘victim preference if you will’ and that’s where you get the argument that black lives don’t matter because you are much more likely to be capitally prosecuted if you’ve committed an offense against a white person and particularly against a white woman.”

"For Two Weeks, Soybean Crop Shows No Progress, USDA Says",https://www.agriculture.com,[],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.agriculture.com/news/crops/for-two-weeks-soybean-crop-shows-no-progress-usda-says,"DES MOINES, Iowa -- The U.S. corn and soybean crops conditions barely changed from a week ago, according to the USDA’s weekly Crop Progress Report released Monday.

The data came in about the same as the trade expected.

Corn

In 2019, the U.S. farmers planted 91.7 million acres of corn, according to the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). That equates to roughly 69 million football fields of corn and 3% above last year's acreage, according to NASS estimates.

The overall condition of the corn crop is rated at 58% good to excellent in the top 18 corn producing states, compared to 57% a week ago.

The USDA pegged 58% of the corn crop was in the silk stage, compared with a 83% five-year average.

Also, 13% of the corn has entered the dough stage vs. a 23% five-year average.



Soybeans

The nation’s crop is rated 54% good/excellent, equal to a week ago.

Also, 57% of the soybean crop is blooming vs. a 79% five-year average.

The USDA pegged the amount of soybeans setting pods at 21%, well below a five-year average of 45%.



Wheat

The U.S. winter wheat harvest is 75% complete vs. a 79% five-year average.

Meanwhile, the U.S. spring wheat crop is rated as 76% good to excellent, equal to last week’s rating."

The $100 million civil suit, which the Department of Justice filed in the Northern District of California, targets BTC-e for offering services to US residents without abiding by US financial regulations, including declining to register with FinCEN as a Money Services Business, failing to establish anti-money laundering procedures as stipulated under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), and failing to report suspicious activities.

From the complaint:

“At no point in time did BTC-e have any AML policies or procedures, let alone an effective program for detecting and preventing suspicious transactions. To the contrary, BTC-e’s lax policies encouraged persons engaged in criminal activity to use its services, and BTC-e became the virtual currency exchange of choice for criminals looking to launder their illegal proceeds.”

FinCEN had levied $88.6 million in penalties against BTC-e and $12 million in penalties against Vinnik, and the DOJ says that the lawsuit intends to “enforce” those fines.

Justice Department appeals court order blocking asylum restrictions,https://www.cnn.com,['Priscilla Alvarez'],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/29/politics/asylum-rule-appeal/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Trump administration appealed a ruling in California blocking its new asylum restrictions to a federal appeals court Monday.

Last week, a federal judge in California late blocked the Trump administration's new asylum rule dramatically limiting the ability of Central American migrants to claim asylum if they enter the US by land through Mexico.

The administration also filed an emergency motion in the Northern District Court of California to allow the asylum restrictions to go into effect while the appeal to the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals plays out. The Justice Department asked Judge Jon Tigar to decide whether he would stay his order blocking the rule by Friday.

The move puts yet another of President Donald Trump's immigration policies before the 9th Circuit, which has ruled against some of the President's policies.

The ruling from Tigar, a Barack Obama nominee, came the same day that a federal judge in Washington, DC, an appointee of President Donald Trump, had declined to block the rule. Tigar's decision, which affects the entire country, took precedence.

Papadopoulos wants DOJ to examine $10K given to him by CIA or FBI,https://nypost.com,['July'],07-28-2019,2019,7,https://nypost.com/2019/07/28/papadopoulos-wants-doj-to-examine-10k-given-to-him-by-cia-or-fbi/,"Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos on Sunday said he is returning to Greece to get $10,000 given to him as part of a CIA or FBI setup to entrap him – and he now wants the Department of Justice to examine the cash.

Papadopoulos said he was given the money in Israel during the summer of 2017 from a guy he believes was a spy but turned the moolah over to his attorney for safekeeping in Greece.

“A man named Charles Tawil gave me this money under very suspicious circumstances. A simple Google search about this individual will reveal he was a CIA or State Department asset in South Africa during the ’90s and 2000s. I think around the time when Bob Mueller was the director of the FBI,” he told “Sunday Morning Futures” on Fox News.

Papadopoulos, who served 12 days in federal prison for lying to investigators about contacts with Russian-connected officials during the 2016 campaign, said he has a theory about why he was given the cash.

“The money, I gave it to my attorney in Greece because I felt it was given to me under very suspicious circumstances. And upon coming back to the United States I had about seven or eight FBI agents rummaging through my luggage looking for money,” he told Mario Bartiromo.

He believes it was part of a setup by the FBI or the special counsel Robert Mueller’s office to “bring a [Foreign Agent Registration Act] violation against me.”

He wants Attorney General William Barr and DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz to take a close look at the paper trail.

“Because I still have the bills and I think they are marked,” Papadopoulos said. “These bills that are still in Athens right now must be examined by the investigators because I think they are marked and they’re going to go all the way back to DOJ, under the previous FBI under Comey, and even the Mueller team.”

“If the Mueller team is going around entrapping campaign associates and Trump associates, the way they did to me — I am sure it wasn’t just me they did it to — it’s going to open up a massive can of worms,” he added.

Papadopoulos met with Joseph Misfud, a Maltese professor in London in early 2016 in London.

Misfud told him months before the Wikileaks published Hillary Clinton and Democratic National Committee emails that the Russians had dirt on the Democratic candidates.

Papadopoulos told Australian diplomat John Downer about Misfud’s assertions, and Downer forwarded the information to the FBI."
AT&T reels in $984M contract with Department of Justice,https://www.fiercetelecom.com,['Mike Robuck'],,,,https://www.fiercetelecom.com/telecom/at-t-reels-984-million-contract-department-justice,"AT&T announced on Monday that it has reeled in a 15-year, $984 million contract with the U.S. Department of Justice.

The deal serves as the long-term foundation for the Department of Justice's network and technology upgrades. The fully managed portfolio of solutions from AT&T includes IP voice, data, security, cloud access and professional services.

Contracts from the General Services Administration's Enterprise Infrastructure Solutions (EIS) program have become a lucrative source for service providers such as AT&T and CenturyLink. EIS gives federal agencies the flexibility and agility to migrate to modern communications and IT services that meet government security standards. Earlier this year, CenturyLink announced it was the first supplier to receive authority to operate under the EIS program.

RELATED: CenturyLink garners authority to operate under GSA's EIS program

EIS is GSA's 15-year, $50 billion program that was designed to award various contracts to vendors that help federal agencies to buy and update their IT and telecommunications infrastructure services.

Under the new contract, AT&T will offer the DoJ network function virtualization (NFV), SD-WAN, managed IP voice services and cloud connectivity across the major cloud providers and other capabilities.

AT&T was the incumbent providing DoJ data services under the predecessor procurement program known as “Networx.” The incumbents that were providing voice services to the DoJ under the Networx program were Verizon and CenturyLink.

In the transition to EIS, AT&T will continue to provide data services and adds managed IP voice services. Work on the new contract is underway, according to a spokesman.

The new AT&T solutions will help simplify cloud adoption across 43 component organizations and support the DoJ's Joint Cloud Optimized Trusted Internet Connection Service (JCOTS), which will accelerate the path for DoJ to access multiple cloud environments.

The services and applications will be used across the Justice Department's more than 120,000 employees that are spread across more than 2,100 locations.

The deal also includes access to the AT&T mobility network and FirstNet, which is the nationwide, dedicated communications platform purpose-built for public safety and first responders. As of early May, AT&T FirstNet had more than 600,000 connections, according to a story by FierceWireless.

Acting DHS boss McAleenan praises Supreme Court 'victory' sanctioning use of Pentagon funds for border wall,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Frank Miles', 'Frank Miles Is A Reporter', 'Editor Covering Geopolitics', 'Military', 'Crime', 'Technology', 'Sports For Foxnews.Com. His Email Is Frank.Miles Foxnews.Com.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/kevin-mcaleenan-dhs-supreme-court-victory-pentagon-funds-border-wall,"Kevin McAleenan, the acting Homeland Security secretary, told Fox News on Sunday it's a “big victory” that the Supreme Court cleared the way for the Trump administration to tap billions of dollars in Pentagon funds to build sections of a border wall with Mexico.

“There was a big victory at the Supreme Court to allow the Department of Defense to move forward with that $2.5 billion to really accelerate the progress on the wall, and kind of double what we're doing with the congressionally appropriated funding, which is going well, as you noted up to 54 miles since we talked,” he told Maria Bartiromo on “Sunday Morning Futures.”

The court’s five conservative justices gave the administration the green light on Friday to begin work on four contracts it has awarded using Defense Department money. Lower courts had frozen funding for the projects while a lawsuit over the money proceeded. The court’s four liberal justices wouldn’t have allowed construction to start.

The Supreme Court’s action reversed the decision of a trial court, which initially froze the funds in May, and an appeals court, which kept that freeze in place earlier this month. The freeze had prevented the government from tapping approximately $2.5 billion in Pentagon money to replace existing sections of barrier in Arizona, California and New Mexico with more robust fencing.

The case in which the Supreme Court ruled began after the 35-day partial government shutdown that started in December of last year. The shutdown ended in February after Congress approved approximately $1.4 billion in border wall funding, but the amount was far less than the $5.7 billion Presiden Trump was seeking. The president then declared a national emergency to take cash from other government accounts to use to construct sections of wall.

KIDNAPPED AUSTRIAN TRIATHLETE SWEET-TALKS CAPTOR INTO LETTING HER GO: REPORT

The money Trump identified included $3.6 billion from military construction funds, $2.5 billion in Defense Department money and $600 million from the Treasury Department’s asset forfeiture fund.

The case before the Supreme Court involved just the $2.5 billion in Defense Department funds, which the administration said would be used to build more than 100 miles of fencing.

One project would replace 46 miles of barrier in New Mexico for $789 million. Another would replace 63 miles in Arizona for $646 million. The other two projects in California and Arizona were smaller.

The other funds were not at issue in the case. The Treasury Department funds so far have survived legal challenges, and Customs and Border Protection has earmarked the money for work in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley but has not yet awarded contracts. Transfer of the $3.6 billion in military construction funds was awaiting approval from the defense secretary.

McAleenan told Bartiromo that “building every day down there in the border … that's already providing significant new operational capability, and helping us control some high traffic areas of the border.”

He said that he did believe the situation at the border has been improving by “almost every measure,” but the only way to eradicate the immigration crisis completely would be through congressional action.

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — When President Donald Trump drew widespread condemnation for describing a majority-black congressional district as a ""rat and rodent infested mess"" and for tweets targeting four Democratic congresswomen of color, it was not the first time a U.S. president attracted such attention.

Throughout American history, presidents have uttered comments, issued decisions and made public and private moves that critics said were racist, either at the time or in later generations. The presidents did so both before taking office and during their time in the White House.

Many of the early presidents, George Washington to Zachary Taylor, owned black slaves and held power when African Americans, Native Americans and Latinos did not have the right to vote or serve on juries and could be refused service in public accommodations. They often repeated commonly held racist views, even when challenged by scholars or civil rights leaders.

Before he became the nation's third president, Thomas Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Independence that ""all men are created equal."" But in his only book, ""Notes on the State of Virginia,"" published in 1785, the future president expressed a series of beliefs about African Americans that would be seen today as racist.

This Feb. 17, 2016 file photo shows statue of Thomas Jefferson greeting visitors in the main lobby of the Jefferson Hotel in Richmond, Va. (Photo: Steve Helber, AP)

He wrote that blacks were cursed with ""a very strong and disagreeable odor"" and were incapable of producing art and poetry. And though he said he believed slavery was immoral, he owned slaves and, historians say, carried on a sexual relationship with at least one of them, Sally Hemings. If every black slave were ever freed, he wrote, they should be deported since he believed blacks and whites could not live together peacefully.

Andrew Jackson, the nation's seventh president, was also a slaveholder from the South. Before he became president, he offered in an 1804 advertisement $50 for the return of a runaway slave and $10 extra ""for every hundred lashes any person will give him, to the amount of 300."" In Jon Meacham's 2008 book ""American Lion: Andrew Jackson and the White House,"" Meacham wrote that Jackson owned around 150 slaves and freed none in his will.

As president, Jackson allowed his postmaster general to let Southerners seize anti-slavery publications in direct violation of the First Amendment. He called the abolitionist pamphlets urging black equality ""unconstitutional and wicked.""

Jackson is widely vilified today among Native Americans for his role in forcibly removing indigenous people from their land, especially for the Trail of Tears. The removal of the Cherokee people from Georgia led to thousands of deaths.

Trump attacks Elijah Cummings: Says Baltimore district 'far worse' than border

""The philanthropist will rejoice that the remnant of that ill-fated race has been at length placed beyond the reach of injury or oppression,"" Jackson said in his farewell address.

The Virginia-born Woodrow Wilson worked to keep blacks out of Princeton University while serving as that school's president. When he became president of the U.S., the Democrat refused to reverse the segregation of civil service, though he had won the White House with the support for some African American men.

In 1915, Wilson sparked outrage by screening the racist film ""The Birth of a Nation"" at the White House. The silent movie was the retelling of Reconstruction through the eyes of the Ku Klux Klan. The movie portrayed the KKK as heroes and African Americans as uncivilized.

""No explanation or apology followed"" after the screening, Patty O'Toole wrote in ""The Moralist: Woodrow Wilson and the World He Made.""

In this 1916 file photo, President Woodrow Wilson throws out the first ball at a baseball game in Washington. (Photo: AP)

Wilson appeared oblivious during the ""Red Summer"" of 1919 — a time when communities across the country saw white mobs attack African Americans, resulting in hundreds of deaths. He spoke out against lynching but did not use the federal government's resources to stop the violence.

Democrat Lyndon Johnson assumed the presidency in 1963 after the assassination of John F. Kennedy and sought to push a civil rights bill amid demonstrations by African Americans. Johnson famously convinced skeptical lawmakers to support the measure and gave a passionate speech about his days as a teacher in Mexican American schools to urge Congress to pass the Voting Rights Act.

But according to tapes of his private conversations, Johnson routinely used racist epithets to describe African Americans and some blacks he appointed to key positions.

His successor, Republican Richard Nixon, also regularly used racist epithets while in office in private conversations.

""We're going to (place) more of these little Negro bastards on the welfare rolls at $2,400 a family,"" Nixon once said about what he saw as lax work requirements. Nixon also made derogatory remarks about Jews, Mexican Americans, Italian Americans and Irish Americans.

New timeline emerges for DOJ inspector general report on FISA abuse,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-27-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/new-timeline-emerges-for-doj-inspector-general-report-on-fisa-abuse,"A new timeline has emerged in recent days for Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigation into alleged surveillance abuses by the DOJ and the FBI.

Whereas Attorney General William Barr predicted earlier this year that the watchdog's investigation would be finished by May or early June, now lawmakers are pointing to the early fall.

Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, told Maria Bartiromo on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures that he “expects that report later this fall.”

His colleague John Ratcliffe, who has spoken to Horowitz, gave a more specific target. The Texas congressman told Fox News' Bret Baier on Wednesday, ""I think that we will get the IG's report probably sometime right after Labor Day."" Labor Day is Sept. 2.

Further solidifying the prediction was a RealClearInvestigations report about former FBI Director James Comey having an inside man at the White House, feeding the bureau information about President Trump and his aides in 2017. That report also set a release date sometime in September.

The delay in Horowitz's work was reportedly due to his team's two-day meeting with Steele in person in London in early June, during President Trump’s state visit to the United Kingdom. Investigators found Steele's information credible enough to warrant extending their investigation.

Horowitz launched an investigation in March 2018 into whether the FBI and the Justice Department filing of four Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications and renewals beginning in October 2016 to surveil former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page was an abuse of the FISA process. The applications relied heavily upon the unverified dossier compiled by Steele, who was hired by Fusion GPS. The opposition research firm was hired by Marc Elias of the Perkins Coie law firm at the behest of the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. Steele's Democratic benefactors were not revealed to the FISA Court.

Meanwhile Barr's ""investigation into the investigators"" is underway, and the attorney general has said he is working very closely with Horowitz. The inspector general can recommend prosecutions, and U.S. Attorney John Durham, whom Barr tasked to lead the review, has the ability to convene a grand jury and subpoena people outside of the government. Beyond that, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, has promised a ""deep dive"" into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation after Horowitz completes his work.

Stay tuned to the Washington Examiner this weekend for closer look at what to expect from Horowitz's report."

T-Mobile and Sprint merger approved by Justice Department,https://www.theverge.com,['Jul'],07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/26/6646158/t-mobile-sprint-merger-justice-department-approves-26-billion-fcc,"The United States Justice Department has approved the $26 billion merger deal between T-Mobile and Sprint. After over a year in regulatory limbo, the merger received the green light from the last federal agency to hold out, with the Federal Communications Commission already signaling that it will approve the deal.

The Justice Department finally approved the deal after Dish reached an agreement with the carriers to acquire Boost Mobile, Virgin Mobile, Sprint’s prepaid business, and “certain” spectrum assets. This will position Dish as the replacement fourth major US carrier that will be lost once T-Mobile and Sprint merge. The two companies will be required to provide at least 20,000 cell sites and hundreds of retail locations to Dish, and the satellite TV provider will also get unfettered access to T-Mobile’s network for seven years as it works to build out a mobile network of its own using the newly acquired assets and spectrum that Dish has held on to for years. Dish has publicly remained silent on its plans throughout this entire process, but that is likely to change starting today.

“We are expanding output significantly”

“With this merger and accompanying divestiture, we are expanding output significantly by ensuring that large amount of currently unused or underused spectrum are made available to American consumers in the form of high quality 5G networks,” Makan Delrahim, assistant attorney general of the DOJ’s antitrust division, said.

T-Mobile and Sprint announced their intention to merge last April, claiming that their combined assets would make them a more viable competitor to AT&T and Verizon. The companies said they would be able to lower prices for consumers and more quickly deploy next-generation 5G networks across the country, which are arguments that have faced harsh criticism from consumer advocates and some experts.

Both the FCC and the Justice Department are required to approve the deal before it can move forward. The deal is likely to be approved by the FCC, although the official vote has yet to take place. In May, FCC chairman Ajit Pai announced that he would be voting to approve the deal after the companies made new promises to provide greater wireless and broadband access to rural areas.

“In light of the significant commitments made by T-Mobile and Sprint as well as the facts in the record to date, I believe that this transaction is in the public interest and intend to recommend to my colleagues that the FCC approve it,” Pai said. “This is a unique opportunity to speed up the deployment of 5G throughout the United States and bring much faster mobile broadband to rural Americans. We should seize this opportunity.”

T-Mobile and Dish will also be required to support e-sim technology to make switching carriers easier in hopes of spurring competition.

“This is a unique opportunity to speed up the deployment of 5G”

Shortly after Pai’s comments, the other two Republican commissioners voiced support for the deal as well, despite never seeing any documents related to the new promises. At a congressional hearing last month, commissioners Brendan Carr and Mike O’Rielly confirmed that they had yet to see the specifics of the agreement.

T-Mobile’s connections to the Trump administration have come under heightened scrutiny as the deal has progressed. In March, The Washington Post reported that the company had spent over $195,000 at the Trump Hotel in Washington, DC while lobbying for the merger.

Congress has held a number of hearings on the proposed merger, with many top Democrats (and even presidential candidates) criticizing it for shrinking the US’s major wireless carrier pool down from four to three providers. Lawmakers like Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Cory Booker (D-NJ) all signed letters to Pai and Delrahim, citing threats to market competition that could harm the US’s ability to lead in 5G.

“The best way to achieve the goal of high-quality, affordable, nationwide 5G is through competitive markets,” the senators wrote. “This merger moves us further away from the sort of competition we need to accomplish this aim. It will lead to excessive consolidation and undermine innovation.”

T-Mobile and Sprint’s main counterargument to those concerns was a proposed deal selling off Boost Mobile and a portion of their combined wireless spectrum. Dish will acquire the assets, a move that could supercharge the network into replacing the two companies as the fourth major carrier. Charter and Altice were also reportedly bidding for the spectrum, but Dish became the winner for both the spectrum and the additional assets.

T-Mobile has sought to merge with other major carriers in the past. In 2011, AT&T said that it would purchase T-Mobile for $39 billion, but a few months after the announcement, the DOJ nixed the deal. In 2012, T-Mobile reached an agreement with MetroPCS to take over the smaller company. The Sprint acquisition is now the company’s largest successful purchase.

The merger has one more hurdle to cross before the companies get the all-clear to finalize. Last month, over a dozen state attorneys general filed a multistate lawsuit to block the deal, headed by New York Attorney General Letitia James and California AG Xavier Becerra. “When it comes to corporate power, bigger isn’t always better,” James said. “The T-Mobile and Sprint merger would not only cause irreparable harm to mobile subscribers nationwide by cutting access to affordable, reliable wireless service for millions of Americans.”

In today’s announcement from the Justice Department, five states have agreed to settle including Nebraska, Kansas, Ohio, Oklahoma, and South Dakota. New York and California are still pushing the lawsuit opposing the deal.

“We intend to be prepared to go to trial to fight for a fair, competitive, and equitable marketplace for consumers nationwide,” Becerra said.

Now that the DOJ has approved the deal, T-Mobile and Sprint can move ahead. But if the states’ suit wins out in the end, the whole deal will have to be unwound."
DOJ’s Russia probe review focusing on 'smoking gun' tapes of meeting with Trump aide: sources,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dojs-russia-probe-review-focusing-on-tapes-of-talks-with-trump-aide-sources,"The Justice Department’s internal review of the Russia investigation is zeroing in on transcripts of recordings made by at least one government source who met with former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos overseas in 2016, specifically looking at why certain ""exculpatory"" material from them was not presented in subsequent applications for surveillance warrants, according to two sources familiar with the review.

The sources also said the review is taking a closer look at the actual start date of the original FBI investigation into potential collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians, as some allege the probe began earlier than thought. Both components are considered key in the review currently being led by Attorney General Bill Barr and U.S. Attorney from Connecticut John Durham -- an effort sure to draw more attention in the coming weeks and months now that Robert Mueller's testimony is in the rearview.

REPUBLICANS CONFRONT MUELLER WITH ALLEGATIONS OF DOUBLE STANDARD IN RUSSIA PROBE

The recordings in question pertain to conversations between government sources and Papadopoulos, which were memorialized in transcripts. One source told Fox News that Barr and Durham are reviewing why the material was left out of applications to surveil another former Trump campaign aide, Carter Page.

“I think it’s the smoking gun,” the source said.

“These recordings have exculpatory evidence,” the other source added. “It is standard tradecraft to record conversations with someone like Papadopoulos—especially when they are overseas and there are no restrictions.”

Prior to the 2016 presidential election, Papadopoulos met with Maltese professor Joseph Mifsud in London, who told him that the Russians had dirt in the form of emails that could damage Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Papadopoulos then told Australian diplomat Alexander Downer of the new information. Downer reported Papadopoulos’ comments to him to the FBI.

A source told Fox News that the ""exculpatory evidence"" included in the transcripts is Papadopoulos denying having any contact with the Russians to obtain the supposed ""dirt"" on Clinton.

But Papadopoulos did not only meet with Mifsud and Downer while overseas. He met with Cambridge professor and longtime FBI informant Stefan Halper and his female associate, who went under the alias Azra Turk. Papadopoulos told Fox News that he saw Turk three times in London: once over drinks, once over dinner and once with Halper. He also told Fox News back in May that he always suspected he was being recorded. Further, he tweeted during the Mueller testimony about ""recordings"" of his meeting with Downer.

It is unclear, at this point, which of these individuals may have recorded conversations with Papadopoulos.

Former Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., now a Fox News contributor, first signaled the existence of transcripts of secretly recorded conversations between FBI informants and Papadopoulos earlier this year.

“If the bureau’s going to send in an informant, the informant’s going to be wired, and if the bureau is monitoring telephone calls, there’s going to be a transcript of that,” Gowdy said in May on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures,” acknowledging he was aware of the files and suggesting they included exculpatory information.

TREY GOWDY: SECRET FBI TRANSCRIPTS FROM RUSSIA PROBE COULD BE 'GAME-CHANGER'

“Some of us have been fortunate enough to know whether or not those transcripts exist. But they haven’t been made public, and I think one, in particular ... has the potential to actually persuade people,"" he continued. “Very little in this Russia probe I’m afraid is going to persuade people who hate Trump or love Trump. But there is some information in these transcripts that has the potential to be a game-changer if it’s ever made public.”

The transcripts are currently classified, according to sources, but under President Trump’s move in May to approve declassification of documents related to the surveillance of his campaign during the 2016 election, Barr will likely have access to those documents in a declassified format.

A source told Fox News that without the declassification order signed by Trump, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats was not going to give anyone access to the files—over concerns for protecting sources and methods. But another source told Fox News in May that Coats, along with CIA Director Gina Haspel and FBI Director Chris Wray, are all working “collaboratively” with Barr and Durham on the review.

Barr and Durham are also trying to pinpoint the actual “start date” of the investigation, according to a source.

It has been widely reported, at this point, that the investigation was officially opened by former FBI senior counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok on July 31, 2016, after Downer shared the information that Papadopoulos was told the Russians had “dirt” on Clinton. But some suggest the probe began before that date.

On Wednesday, House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., challenged former Special Counsel Mueller over when the investigation started.

""The FBI claims the counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign began on July 31, 2016, but in fact, it began before that,"" Nunes said. ""In June 2016, before the investigation was officially opened, Trump campaign associates Carter Page and Stephen Miller were invited to attend a symposium at Cambridge University in July 2016. Your office, however, did not investigate who was responsible for inviting these Trump associates to the symposium.""

Mueller replied: ""Those areas...I'm going to stay away from.""

Meanwhile, Papadopoulos said that in May 2016, he was approached by two U.S. military officials based in the U.S. Embassy in London—Gregory Baker and Terrence Dudley. He told Fox News they were questioning him about his ties in the Middle East and Trump's relationship with Russia.

“Both wanted to ingratiate themselves in campaign via myself,” Papadopoulos tweeted last year.

It is unclear at this point what, if any, involvement Baker and Dudley had in collecting intelligence related to the Trump campaign. Both Baker and Dudley disputed Papadopoulos’ tweet, and reportedly said they reached out to him out of curiosity.

The president, his surrogates and Republicans on Capitol Hill since the start of the Mueller investigation have called for a separate probe into the Russia investigation's beginnings. Barr earlier this year assigned Durham to probe “all intelligence collection activities” related to the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election.

The Barr-Durham review is likely to draw more attention following Mueller’s highly anticipated testimony on Capitol Hill. Republicans sought to focus their questioning on the origins of the Russia investigation under then-Director James Comey's FBI—a topic Mueller repeatedly said was “out of his purview” due to the ongoing investigation being led by the Justice Department. Another review is being conducted by the DOJ inspector general.

“Maybe a better course of action is to figure out how the false accusations started,” Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said Wednesday. “Here’s the good news—that’s exactly what Bill Barr is doing and thank goodness for that.”"

Textile Waste Has Surged 811% Since the '60s According to the EPA,https://www.highsnobiety.com,"['Isabelle Hore-Thorburn', 'Weekend Staff Writer']",07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/textile-waste-increase-epa-report/,"According to data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), textile waste has increased by 811 percent between 1960 and 2015. The majority of this waste is made up of municipal solid waste (MSW). MSW encompasses discarded clothing, as well as small furniture, carpets, tires, and footwear.

The EPA calculated that in 2015, clothing and footwear produced 11.9 million tons of waste and 4.5 percent of total MSW. Decades of data gathering evidence a dramatic increase in textile waste, which grew from 1.76 million tons in 1960 to more than 16 million tons in 2015.

Jackie King, executive director of Secondary Materials and Recycled Textiles (SMART), told Supply Chain Dive that the problem has worsened significantly in the last decade. She explained that “a lot of the ‘fast fashion’ clothing is not very well made and might not last through more than a few washes before ending up in the landfill.”

In a letter signed by 13 Democrats who visited Customs and Border Patrol processing centers near the border last week, the senators list 18 actions the agency should take immediately that they say would ensure humane treatment of migrant children and result in better oversight of the facilities.

CBP processing centers have been scrutinized as migrants, including children, have been held in sub par conditions far longer than the 72-hour limit with reports of abuse and mistreatment.

The senators are asking acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan and acting Commissioner of CBP, Mark Morgan, to respond to their request by Thursday and provide a telephone briefing by Aug. 10 with an update on if the requests are being addressed.

Among the senators' requests: improve the water quality at the McAllen Border Patrol Station; provide schedules to Congress indicating that migrants can make phone calls, eat, take showers and brush their teeth; darken rooms so children can sleep.

The letter notes that the senators want to know if the migrants can report claims of abuse and what type of medical and psychological care the migrants have access to, and if DHW will support additional independent monitoring of facilities.

Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., is the highest ranking member of Congress to visit the border. He and 12 other Democratic senators visited the Border Patrol processing facility in McAllen, as well as processing centers Donna and Ursula, also in Texas.

""The searing accounts about the conditions endured by migrant families are true. We saw overcrowding. We heard migrants tell us that they were unable to brush their teeth, shower, call their families, or access feminine hygiene products,"" Schumer said on the Senate floor earlier this week. ""We saw children in soiled clothing, caged and expressionless — heartbreaking, thousand-mile stares on the faces of toddlers…where smiles and laughter should have been.""

The letter notes that a July inspector general report instructed DHS to ""take immediate steps to alleviate dangerous overcrowding and prolonged detention of children and adults.""

Aaron Hull, head of the Border Patrol's El Paso Sector, will be reassigned to Detroit on Monday, according to documents obtained by NBC News.

How can $2 million in U.S. EPA Trash-Free grants curb the Great Lakes plastic problem?,https://www.cleveland.com,"['Laura Johnston', 'Ljohnston Cleveland.Com']",07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.cleveland.com/news/2019/07/how-can-2-million-in-us-epa-trash-free-grants-curb-the-great-lakes-plastic-problem.html,"CLEVELAND, Ohio – How can $2 million in U.S. EPA grants clean up the plastic-plagued Great Lakes?

Local environmental groups – including Surfrider, Alliance for the Great Lakes and Drink Local. Drink Tap – are interested in applying for grants, announced this month as part of the annual $300 million Great Lakes Restoration Initiative.

But some experts say the money will do little to solve the problem of 22 million pounds of plastic dumped into the Great Lakes each year.

The only real solution is to stop making more plastic, said Sherri A. Mason, sustainability coordinator at Penn State University’s Behrend campus.

“It’s money and I appreciate money being put toward anything,” Mason said. “If you really want to solve this problem, you don’t focus on removing the trash... That’s a Band-aid on a gaping wound when really what we need are stitches.”

The EPA plans to release details in October. A spokeswoman said the cleanup and preventing of all marine and shoreline trash will be eligible for grants up to $500,000 and that plastics will likely be an important component of many applications.

“This first-of-its-kind trash-focused grant program is yet another example of progress being made under the GLRI,” said EPA Region 5 Administrator Cathy Stepp. “Thanks to this funding, a number of Great Lakes communities can receive a meaningful assist in removing trash and litter from beaches, shorelines and waterways where cleanup projects are sorely needed.”

Erin Huber, director of Drink Local. Drink Tap, hopes the grants reward efforts to “stop creating the trash in the first place.”

Since 2010, Drink Local volunteers have picked up 6,681 pounds of trash from Cleveland beaches.

“Clean ups, though we do them, are a last resort,” Huber said. “I worry that this grant might be a shiny thing to take our attention away from real issues - unsustainable consumption, unsustainable plastic (aka fossil fuel) use.”

How big is the problem?

Lake Erie has 46,000 pieces of plastic per square kilometer, rivaling the dirtiest part of the world’s oceans, Mason said in the 2018 State of the Great Lakes speech at the City Club of Cleveland.

The earth adds about 300 million tons of plastic every year.

Nearly half of it is packaging.

About 10 percent is recycled -- a number that won’t likely increase since plastic is so cheap to manufacture.

About 10 percent ends up in waterways.

Much of it -- including fast-food straws, cigar tips and plastic bottle caps -- comes flushed from city streets throughout the watershed, down storm drains and into the lake, according to a Rochester Institute of Technology study. The trash washes up on shore, making up about 80 percent of the litter on beaches.

Winds and currents usually push the trash to the east and southern shores of each Great Lake.

In 2018, more than 14,300 volunteers worked with the Alliance for the Great Lakes at 900 beach clean ups, over all five Great Lakes, collecting 35,600 pounds of trash. About 87 percent of that trash was plastic.

“We see a litter issue on a lot of beaches,” Alliance spokeswoman Jennifer Caddick said. “It’s going to have to be a bigger solution than just beach clean ups.”

What are people doing already?

Local governments and businesses have taken their own actions.

In May, Cuyahoga County Council voted 8-3 to enact a plastic bag ban, the first in Ohio, in part to keep plastic out of the lake. County Councilwoman Sunny Simon, who pushed for years for the ban, said county residents use 320 million plastic bags each year. The Republican-dominated state legislature, though, may ban the bag ban.

Many Northeast Ohio restaurants have eliminated plastic straws and have switched Styrofoam take-out containers for biodegradable options.

What else could we do?

Grants could pay for all sorts of projects and programs.

Take the invention of Thomas Zung, a distinguished senior fellow at Stanford University, who won Cleveland Water Alliance’s ErieHack competition in June with a geodesic dome that collects trash from storm sewer outflows. A crane then empties and dumps the trash.

Zung and his team of Cleveland college students, won $40,000 for the idea from Erie Hack. He plans to apply for a Trash-Free grant, too.

Tim Hoellein, an assistant professor of biology at Loyola University Chicago, who studies trash in the Great Lakes, plans to apply for a grant to boost his research, which includes analyzing data from Alliance for the Great Lakes clean ups. The number of cigarette butts, one of the top items found on beaches, has dropped over the last 15 years.

“There’s some room for optimism,” Hoellein said. “A suite of public policies can have a positive outcome over the long term.”

Hoellein appreciates the Trump administration’s spotlight on the trash problem. So far, he said, garbage is not a political issue. Everyone, regardless of party, can see it.

(That said, the Trump campaign is selling packs of plastic straws labeled “Make straws great again.” Plastic straws account for about 1 percent of the plastic in the oceans, according to Stanford Center for Ocean Solutions.)

What’s the problem with trash?

Cleaning it up costs cities money. Its ugliness may detour tourism. There are public health concerns with people exposed to diapers, needles or tampons, plus wildlife problems for fish and birds who eat it or get entangled in it.

Hoellein’s team has analyzed 250 fish, 95 percent of which have plastic in their stomach. The plastic may be as small as a microfiber from a fleece jacket that washed off in the laundry. “But it’s almost universally there,” he said.

Lake lovers hope the federal focus on trash will help reverse the trash flow.

Said the Alliance’s Cleveland office outreach coordinator, Destinee Henton: “I applaud the EPA for their commitment to cleaning up our most precious natural resource.”

Treasury pick Monica Crowley spread Obama smears: 'Can he be both loyal to Islam and loyal to the United States?',https://www.cnn.com,"['Andrew Kaczynski', 'Nathan Mcdermott']",07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/25/politics/kfile-monica-crowley/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump's pick for the top spokeswoman job at the Treasury Department repeatedly spread conspiracy theories that suggested then-President Barack Obama was secretly a Muslim who was sympathetic to America's enemies.

Crowley also endorsed a story claiming Obama was an ""Islamic community organizer"" trying to conform the United States to Sharia law and claimed conspiracy theories about Obama's birth certificate were ""legitimate concerns."" During Obama's presidency, Trump was one of the most prominent voices pushing the so-called birther conspiracy theories questioning Obama's birthplace. When he was seeking the presidency himself and under continual questioning, Trump finally admitted that Obama was born in the US but offered no apologies or explanation for the years he spent sowing doubt about Obama's origins.

Crowley, formerly a syndicated radio host, columnist and Fox News contributor, was originally chosen by Trump in December 2016 to be the senior director of strategic communications for the National Security Council. She withdrew herself from consideration for that position after CNN's KFile team uncovered extensive plagiarism in her book and doctoral thesis.

Crowley did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the Treasury Department also did not respond to a request for comment.

Suggested Obama was a Muslim

Writing on her blog in August 2010 , Crowley blasted Obama for supporting the right to build an Islamic community center and mosque in lower Manhattan. Some conservatives seized on the issue making it a flash-point and objecting to, at times using highly inflammatory rhetoric, building a mosque so close to the site of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

Crowley wrote that Obama had loyalties to Islam and questioned if he could support both Islam and the United States.

""Maybe politics didn't have anything to do with it, but Islam certainly did. And does. Obama was born to a Muslim father, which under Islam automatically made him a Muslim. He says he converted to Christianity as an adult, which under Islam makes him an apostate,"" wrote Crowley. ""He grew up in Indonesia, which is the most populous Muslim nation on earth. His stepfather was also a Muslim. He was steeped in Islam throughout his formative years, so it should come as no surprise that he has loyalties to Islam. During the 2008 campaign, he even slipped and claimed that the United States has '57' states, instead of 50. The number of Muslim states in the Organization of the Islamic Conference is 57.""

""It may not come as a shock that he appears loyal to Islam. The question is: can he be both loyal to Islam and loyal to the United States?"" she added.

Crowley added, ""How could he....support the enemy?""

Called birther conspiracy theories legitimate

Writing in a blog post in April 2011 after the release of Obama's long-form birth certificate, Crowley praised Donald Trump for questioning Obama's citizenship and called concerns about the birth certificate legitimate.

""If the birth certificate were never a big deal, why did No Drama Obama wait nearly 3 years before releasing it? Why endure and stoke all of the drama? To make those raising legitimate concerns about his origins and policies look like kooks? Maybe,"" wrote Crowley.

""For over 2 1/2 years, questions have been raised about Obama's origins and background,"" she added. ""He was never properly vetted by an adoring press corps, so outstanding concerns existed about his birth certificate (the long-form of which he had never released), where he grew up, his family's religious background, his parents' political beliefs, how he got into top schools such as Columbia and Harvard Law, how he paid for his education, what his grades were, etc. The questions were and are legitimate, and yet were never fully answered. In fact, anyone daring to ask them was painted as a fringe moron at best and racist at worst.""

In 2011, Hawaiian officials, at Obama's request, released the long form of his birth certificate. It indicated that he had, indeed, been born in Hawaii. Conspiracy theorists continue to allege the document was a forgery.

Said Obama was on the side of terrorists

Writing a bout the Obama administration in June 2013 , Crowley said it looked the Muslim Brotherhood was dictating American foreign policy.

""The Muslim Brotherhood is a sworn enemy of the United States. In Obama, they have found an ally. What does that say about Obama? I'm sure you can figure that one out,"" she wrote. ""What it says about America's national security is that it looks increasingly like it's being dictated BY that sworn enemy.""

Writing in a January 2009 blog post, Crowley singled out Obama for using his full name at his swearing in (presidents typically are sworn in using their full names) and decisions related to banning the use of torture and closing of the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention center as actions that raised questions about the president's sympathies.

""Barack Obama insisted on being sworn in as president with his full name, Barack Hussein Obama. One of his very first things he did as president was to order the closure of the terrorist detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,"" she wrote, without noting that Obama had campaigned on this issue, the facility had been a top concern for human rights defenders. ""The two things he did along with that was to order a halt to the prosecutions of terrorist suspects there, including the mastermind of the September 11th attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and other top al Qaeda terrorists, like Ramzi Binalshibh. He also issued an order against the use of enhanced interrogation tactics on such terrorists, including waterboarding.

""Now comes word that he is granting his first formal television interview as president to Al-Arabiya,"" she added. ""Tells you where his head is, and possibly, his sympathies. Just sayin'.""

""The administration, with Obama as Islamic community organizer, is not only placating Muslims and, in particular, our Islamic enemies; it is conforming US policy to Islam and Sharia,"" reads the column.

""Obama's actions may, however, actually betray a more nefarious strategy: do as little as politically possible so as to foment chaos across the region, all to the benefit of his seeming policy ""companions"" dedicated to promoting Sharia and Islamic statehood- the Muslim Brotherhood and the Islamic Republic of Iran- while defanging the US's best ally in the region, Israel. Despite public pressure, resist confronting ISIS/ISIL and Bashar Assad in any truly meaningful way and turn his back on the Christian genocide exploding across the region. In addition, flood the US with Muslim immigrants while keeping it bound to foreign oil despite remarkable innovations at home that can render it virtually energy independent."""
DOJ’s tech probe needs to be mindful of corporate harassment,https://nypost.com,"['Jonathon Trugman', 'July']",07-28-2019,2019,7,https://nypost.com/2019/07/28/dojs-tech-probe-needs-to-be-mindful-of-corporate-harassment/,"The Department of Justice last week launched a wide-ranging antitrust review to determine if the largest technology companies are, or have been, stifling competition.

The four that are reported to be most focused on — Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google — account for almost a million high-paying jobs with good benefits, and are massive contributors to this year’s strong projected 2.5 percent-plus GDP growth rate.

Facebook, Google, Amazon and Snap all reported earnings last week. Aside from Amazon’s — affected by a big investment in faster delivery — they were pretty impressive. (Apple reports this week.) So people clearly are using these platforms to conduct commerce and communication.

There are always unintended consequences of big government trying to wrestle with an industry. The DOJ needs to be mindful of that, and not return to the Obama days of excess corporate harassment.

While the privacy issues are real and absolutely need to continue to be addressed, the anticompetitive aspect seems to me rather nonsensical.

Silicon Valley’s growth machine is one of the bright lights of the economy, not only in the US, but globally.

So I like the way the FTC handled the Facebook settlement announced on Wednesday. Facebook agreed to pay a $5 billion penalty due to the privacy issues and the use of people’s data, as happened in the Cambridge Analytica fiasco.

Those who say that’s not enough money don’t get it. It’s not about the money, it’s about the behavior. The FTC, by requiring Zuckerberg’s certification that its newly-agreed-to privacy rules are adhered to, found a great way to truly address any issues going forward without inhibiting growth and innovation.

These companies don’t stifle competition; they finance and foster it!

Let’s not give China or any other advanced economies a technological advantage by hampering our own geniuses and shooting ourselves in the foot."
Attorney General William Barr orders first federal executions in nearly two decades,https://www.cnbc.com,['Tucker Higgins'],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/25/william-barr-orders-first-federal-executions-in-nearly-two-decades.html,"The federal government will resume executing death row inmates after nearly two decades without doing so, the Department of Justice announced Thursday.

Attorney General William Barr directed the Bureau of Prisons to schedule the executions of five inmates convicted of murder and other crimes. The executions have been scheduled for December 2019 and January 2020.

The department also announced a new execution protocol, replacing the three-drug cocktail previously used in federal executions with the single drug, pentobarbital.

The last federal execution was carried out in 2003. There are 62 individuals on federal death row, according to a tracker maintained by the Death Penalty Information Center.

The Supreme Court outlawed state and federal death penalty laws in the 1972 decision Furman v. Georgia. The ruling invalidated the laws then on the books, but did not outlaw the death penalty under all circumstances, leading states and the federal government to draft new legislation.

The federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988, and expanded by Congress in 1994. No federal executions took place, however, until 2001, according to to the Bureau of Prisons website.

""Congress has expressly authorized the death penalty through legislation adopted by the people's representatives in both houses of Congress and signed by the President,"" Barr said in a statement. ""Under Administrations of both parties, the Department of Justice has sought the death penalty against the worst criminals, including these five murderers, each of whom was convicted by a jury of his peers after a full and fair proceeding."""
EPA now involved in giant trash pile investigation,https://www.wsav.com,['Andrew Davis'],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://www.wsav.com/news/epa-now-involved-in-giant-trash-pile-investigation/,"RIDEGLAND, S.C. (WSAV) – Health officials have called in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to help understand and investigate a giant debris pile in Ridgeland.

The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) tells News 3 it’s working with Jasper County, S.C. Emergency Management Division and the EPA to determine the best path forward for the response to the fire.

Last week, the day after WSAV first reported on the pile, business owners in the area witnessed heavy smoke and an even stronger smell coming from the heap of debris.

DHEC says their priority is the protection of public health.

The agency has an air sensor for fine particulate matter, which is the size consistent with smoke particles, in the area. The sensor provides concentration data every 15 minutes. Click here for real-time data from the air sensor.

So far, that air sensor has not picked up unsafe levels of particulate in the air, according to DHEC.

Carina Curel lives next door to the Able Contracting business and 65-foot pile. She’s not buying that.

“There’s more to it. There has to be if we are feeling like we are feeling, there’s more in that air. I feel exposed to something dangerous, it’s not something good, its dangerous and we are breathing it,” said Curel. “We have headaches, we can’t breathe, my mom is on oxygen. It’s like a daily struggle to say are we going to have a good fresh air day.”

DHEC says in general, smoke from an uncontrolled fire (e.g. campfire, wildfire or other types of fire) can result in increased amounts of particulates and other chemicals in the air. This can be a nuisance even for healthy people, but it can also make some pre-existing health conditions, like asthma and some heart or lung conditions, worse.

DHEC is encouraging anyone who experiences symptoms to seek advice from their normal health care provider.

If smoke is visible, even if the source of the smoke is not, DHEC recommends following these precautions:

Avoid spending extended amounts of time in smoky conditions.

Don’t walk, run, do yard work or participate in outdoor activities on days when smoke is visible at ground level.

People who have trouble breathing, experience an increase in coughing episodes, or have tightness in their chest should seek medical attention from their doctor or health care provider.

People with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or emphysema are more likely than others to have these symptoms and should, when possible, not stay in smoky environments for long periods of time.

Jasper County Fire now has a truck stationed at the site and water lines down and ready for the next time firefighters have to come in. They have been on the scene a half dozen times or more in the past two weeks.

DHEC calls these types of fires “complex,” saying they will likely continue to burn even when flames are not visible on the surface.

Because the facility continues to burn, DHEC has asked the EPA to assist with air, soil and water sampling to characterize site conditions. The data generated will be used to determine the path forward.

Curel hopes that path is right out of her neighborhood for all that smelly debris.

“I hope he gets shut down and all that stuff gets hauled out fo there, every drop of it,” she said. “That means I could get my life back in order.”"

U.S. Satellite Operators Urge Commerce Department to Revise Proposed Commercial Remote Sensing Regulations,https://finance.yahoo.com,[],07-29-2019,2019,7,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-satellite-operators-urge-commerce-090000762.html,"WESTMINSTER, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

Proposed regulations would be a step backward for U.S. industry, giving foreign firms a competitive advantage

U.S. satellite operators Maxar Technologies (MAXR) (MAXR.TO), Planet Labs, HawkEye 360, BlackSky Global and Spire Global today urged the U.S. Department of Commerce to revise its proposed commercial remote sensing regulations, which as drafted would put U.S. firms at a significant disadvantage in the global marketplace.

Maxar, Planet, HawkEye 360, BlackSky Global and Spire Global recently submitted a joint response to the Commerce Department’s Notice of Proposed Rulemaking objecting to the newly proposed rules. While U.S. satellite operators appreciate the Department’s recognition of the risk to American leadership in space that comes from overly burdensome regulation, the proposed regulations would undermine U.S. competitiveness, impair U.S. innovation and deter investment in the U.S. commercial space industry. Commenters urged the Commerce Department to significantly revise the proposed regulations to take a more narrowly tailored approach to ensure the pressing need for continued U.S. leadership in commercial space is more appropriately balanced with other regulatory interests.

The U.S. commercial space industry provides critical products and services that support disaster and humanitarian crisis response, national and global security interests and enhance the location-enabled services that billions of people around the world use every day. Addressing the lack of transparency, operational uncertainty and institutionalized delays that impair the ability of the U.S. industry to bring innovative products and services to market should be the primary focus of the Commerce Department’s efforts. For example, license requests to bring new commercial satellite imagery capabilities to market can take years to approve, operators have little visibility into the decision-making process and operating licenses are subject to retroactive modifications after investment has already been made and systems are operating. By failing to address these issues, the proposed regulations put at risk continued U.S. leadership in the global commercial space industry, including the satellite imagery market, which is alone projected to reach $3 billion by 2020.

“The U.S. commercial space industry needs smart regulations that promote innovation, encourage competitiveness and bolster national security, and unfortunately the Commerce Department’s draft regulations fall far short of these goals,” said Dr. Walter Scott, Maxar CTO. “Maxar, Planet, HawkEye 360, BlackSky Global and Spire Global urge U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and the National Space Council to intervene and ensure that new regulations allow American space firms to continue to lead in this dynamic global industry.”

“The draft regulations represent a three-decade step backward,” said Robbie Schingler, Planet’s Co-founder. “This is cold water thrown onto a thriving ecosystem with rapidly changing space architectures, many new entrants and novel business models. We strongly urge regulators to take a strategic view and create a forward-leaning environment that opens up near-Earth space to efficient, secure and trusted commercial enterprise. Building new industries bolsters American competitiveness and grows the economy, which fuels national security. Should this rule progress without significant modification, it will represent a direct threat to 21st century U.S. national security.”
