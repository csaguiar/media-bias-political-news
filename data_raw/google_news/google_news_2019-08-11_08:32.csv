Trump Shares Unfounded Fringe Theory About Epstein and Clintons,https://www.nytimes.com,['Michael Crowley'],08-10-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/10/us/politics/trump-epstein-conspiracy-theories.html,"The pair of retweets come on a day when Mr. Trump expressed outrage on Twitter over what he called “dishonest” and “inaccurate” coverage of his presidency by the news media, including The New York Times. Mr. Trump insisted that reports that several survivors of the mass shooting in El Paso last weekend had refused to see him when he visited their hospital on Wednesday were false, but provided no evidence.

Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Clinton had been friendly with Mr. Epstein but broke ties with him many years ago. In a July statement, Mr. Ureña, Mr. Clinton’s spokesman, said that the former president had taken several trips with Mr. Epstein on his private plane in 2002 and 2003 but that the men had not spoken in more than a decade. Mr. Clinton “knows nothing about the terrible crimes” of which Mr. Epstein has been accused and, in one case, had been sentenced, the statement said.

Even before Mr. Trump weighed in on the subject, Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said on Twitter that while scrutiny of Mr. Epstein’s death was warranted, “the immediate rush to spread conspiracy theories about someone on the ‘other side’ of partisan divide having him killed illustrates why our society is so vulnerable to foreign disinformation & influence efforts.”

Earlier Saturday, one of the president’s senior appointees at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Lynne Patton, posted a headline about Mr. Epstein’s death on Instagram, perpetuating a debunked right-wing narrative. Including the comment, “Hillary’d!!” she also referred to Vincent Foster, the Clinton White House counsel who died by suicide in 1994 — a crucial episode in the unfounded theory tying the Clintons to allegedly suspicious deaths.

Adding to the extraordinary nature of Mr. Trump’s retweets was the fact that Mr. Clinton is a former president. American presidents have traditionally treated their predecessors and successors with pronounced respect, even when they are from different parties or ran bitter campaigns against one another. But after defeating Mrs. Clinton in a 2016 campaign during which he suggested he might imprison her, Mr. Trump has repeatedly ridiculed and taunted both Clintons.

Tweeting on another subject earlier in the day, Mr. Trump seemed to criticize joint United States military exercises with South Korea that have enraged North Korea, calling them “ridiculous and expensive.” The president said that the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, had offered him “a small apology” for that country’s recent short-range missile tests, which violate United Nations resolutions but which Mr. Trump has brushed off. “I look forward to seeing Kim Jong Un in the not too distant future!” he wrote."

"Trump blasts 'wacko comedian' Bill Maher on Twitter, alleges he lied about El Paso visit",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Sam Dorman', 'Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News. You Can Follow Him On Facebook']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-blasts-maher-twitter-el-paso,"President Trump had strong words for comedian Bill Maher, who Trump accused Saturday of making ""sooo many"" false statements.

""Got to see, by accident, wacko comedian Bill Maher’s show - So many lies,"" Trump tweeted.

Trump specifically objected to Maher's claim that survivors of last week's mass shooting in El Paso, Texas refused to meet with the president when he visited the city on Wednesday.

BILL MAHER FINDS ALLY IN NBC NEWS' RICHARD ENGEL IN 'HOPING' US ECONOMY SLIDES TO OUST TRUMP

According to the El Paso Times, at least five patients refused to meet with Trump on Wednesday. Three others were unable due to their poor condition or a language barrier.

The Times reported that Trump met with family members of three survivors ""for nearly two hours after most objected to seeing him."" The following day, Maher joked in a tweet that patients who were asked if they wanted to meet the president said ""el paso.""



Maher has previously predicted that Trump will win re-election in 2020 barring an economic recession, a prospect the comedian openly rooted for on his HBO show ""Real Time"" last week.

When a guest reminded Maher of the job losses that would result from a recession, Maher answered: ""I know, but it's worth it.""

Trump responded to that prediction Saturday, and added that Maher would pay a much higher tax rate if he lost his bid for reelection.

""He is right about one thing, though,"" Trump tweeted. ""I will win again in 2020. Otherwise, he pays 95% in taxes!""

Trump also addressed Maher's claim that he was taking a vacation and not being very productive as president. ""Said I was on vacation. Wrong! Long planned fix up of W.H., stay here rather than ... cause big disruption by going to Manhattan. Working almost all of the time, including evenings. Don’t have to be in W.H. to do that."""
"Attorney general 'appalled' over Epstein's death, announces investigation",https://www.cnn.com,['Veronica Stracqualursi'],08-10-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/10/politics/bill-barr-jeffrey-epstein-justice-department-investigation/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Justice Department's inspector general is opening an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of multimillionaire financier and accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, Attorney General William Barr announced on Saturday.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons confirmed Epstein's death, saying he was found unresponsive in his cell on Saturday at New York's Metropolitan Correctional Center around 6:30 a.m. ET. The bureau's release called it ""an apparent suicide,"" and said the FBI is investigating. Two law enforcement sources told CNN that Epstein died by suicide.

Barr said he was ""appalled"" to learn of Epstein's death while in federal custody awaiting trial.

""I was appalled to learn that Jeffrey Epstein was found dead early this morning from an apparent suicide while in federal custody. Mr. Epstein's death raises serious questions that must be answered,"" Barr said in a statement. ""In addition to the FBI's investigation, I have consulted with the Inspector General who is opening an investigation into the circumstances of Mr. Epstein's death.""

Epstein had been jailed since early July, when he pleaded not guilty to charges by New York federal prosecutors after an indictment accused him of sex trafficking dozens of underage girls, some as young as 14 years old.

Trump administration says it won't approve Roundup cancer-warning labels,https://www.cbsnews.com,[],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/roundup-labels-trump-administration-says-it-wont-approve-glyphosate-warning-labels/,"The Trump administration has told companies not to warn customers about products that contain glyphosate, a decision targeted at a California regulation that requires labels to warn consumers that the Roundup ingredient is potentially cancer-causing.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says it will no longer approve labels warning glyphosate is known to cause cancer. The chemical, marketed as a weed killer by Monsanto under the brand Roundup, is currently the focus of lawsuits from thousands of consumers alleging it caused their cancers.

Such labels are ""irresponsible,"" EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a statement. He cited the EPA's conclusions that the chemical doesn't represent a cancer risk.

The decision from the EPA highlights the growing debate over the safety of glyphosate, with scientific research often reaching contradictory conclusions. The World Health Organization's cancer agency has said that the chemical is ""possibly carcinogenic to humans,"" yet on the other side of the debate are studies that refute reports of glyphosate's risks, such as a long-term study of agricultural workers that didn't find a link between Roundup and cancer.

Since Bayer bought Roundup maker Monsanto in June 2018, the company has lost lost three high-profile court cases that alleged the chemical caused cancer.

""It is critical that federal regulatory agencies like EPA relay to consumers accurate, scientific based information about risks that pesticides may pose to them,"" Wheeler said in the statement. ""EPA's notification to glyphosate registrants is an important step to ensuring the information shared with the public on a federal pesticide label is correct and not misleading.""

California's law

California requires warning labels on glyphosate products because the International Agency for Research on Cancer has said it is ""probably carcinogenic.""

Monsanto has sued to block California's warning label requirements. A federal judge blocked California from enforcing the labels while the lawsuit continues."
EPA drops protection for wild salmon Alaska Bristol Bay,https://www.cnn.com,"['Scott Bronstein', 'Curt Devine', 'Drew Griffin', 'Ashley Hackett']",08-09-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/09/us/epa-alaska-pebble-mine-salmon-invs/index.html,"(CNN) The Environmental Protection Agency told staff scientists that it was no longer opposing a controversial Alaska mining project that could devastate one of the world's most valuable wild salmon fisheries just one day after President Trump met with Alaska's governor, CNN has learned.

The EPA publicly announced the reversal July 30, but EPA staff sources tell CNN that they were informed of the decision a month earlier, during a hastily arranged video conference after Trump's meeting with Gov. Mike Dunleavy. The governor, a supporter of the project, emerged from that meeting saying the president assured him that he's ""doing everything he can to work with us on our mining concerns.""

The news came as a ""total shock"" to some top EPA scientists who were planning to oppose the project on environmental grounds, according to sources. Those sources asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution.

The copper-and-gold mine planned near Bristol Bay, Alaska, known as Pebble Mine, was blocked by the Obama administration's EPA after scientists found that the mine would cause ""complete loss of"" the bay's fish habitat.

EPA insiders tell CNN that the timing of the agency's internal announcement suggests Trump was personally involved in the decision.

Dunleavy met with Trump aboard Air Force One on June 26, as the President's plane was on the tarmac in Alaska. The President had stopped there on his way to the G20 summit in Japan.

A controversial mining project in Bristol Bay, Alaska, that was all but killed by the Obama administration is now moving forward under President Trump's EPA.

Four EPA sources with knowledge of the decision told CNN that senior agency officials in Washington summoned scientists and other staffers to an internal videoconference on June 27, the day after the Trump-Dunleavy meeting, to inform them of the agency's reversal. The details of that meeting are not on any official EPA calendar and have not previously been reported.

Those sources said the decision disregards the standard assessment process under the Clean Water Act, cutting scientists out of the process.

The EPA's new position on the project is the latest development in a decade-long battle that has pitted environmentalists, Alaskan Natives and the fishing industry against pro-mining interests in Alaska.

In 2014, the project was halted because an EPA study found that it would cause ""complete loss of fish habitat due to elimination, dewatering, and fragmentation of streams, wetlands, and other aquatic resources"" in some areas of Bristol Bay. The agency invoked a rarely used provision of the Clean Water Act that works like a veto, effectively banning mining on the site.

Some current and former EPA officials say the decision to remove the Clean Water Act restriction ignores scientific evidence. The decision follows a series of regulatory rollbacks and political appointments within the Trump administration's EPA that have been criticized by former EPA administrators as favoring industry interests over the environment.

Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy met with President Trump aboard Air Force One on June 26.

The June 26 meeting between Trump and Dunleavy marked the fourth time the two had met since December.

Dunleavy has publicly supported the mining project and wrote a letter to Trump in March protesting the EPA's prior handling of the matter. He had dinner with Tom Collier, the CEO of Pebble Limited Partnership, the project's developer, in February and spoke to him on the phone in May, according to copies of Dunleavy's calendar reviewed by CNN. A member of Dunleavy's administration used to work on the Pebble project in public relations.

In response to CNN's question about whether Dunleavy asked Trump to direct the EPA to lift the restriction during the June meeting, Dunleavy's press secretary said the two discussed mining and a public land order, but he declined to provide specifics of the conversation.

Dunleavy said in a statement, ""This project, like all projects, should be scrutinized and examined under a fair and rigorous permitting process prescribed by law. That was not the case under the EPA's unprecedented preemptive veto.""

Neither the White House nor the EPA responded to CNN's question on whether the White House directed the EPA to lift the restriction on the mine.

The same day Trump and Dunleavy met in June, the EPA publicly announced that it would begin reconsidering whether to withdraw the Clean Water Act restriction on the Pebble Mine. EPA scientists and staff believed that they would then have weeks or months to reassess previous findings and potentially permanently stop the project, according to the sources.

Instead, immediately after Trump met with Dunleavy, EPA officials received an invitation from EPA headquarters to attend the video conference the next day, June 27.

During that video conference, EPA General Counsel Matthew Leopold said that a decision had been made to lift the restriction on the Pebble Mine proposal and that no further consideration of the matter was needed, sources said.

""I was dumbfounded,"" an EPA insider said. ""We were basically told we weren't going to examine anything. We were told to get out of the way and just make it happen.""

Leopold took over EPA responsibility for the Pebble Mine proposal since EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler, who previously worked for a law firm that provided services to Pebble, recused himself.

When CNN first asked about the June 27 meeting, EPA spokesman Michael Abboud said that Leopold told him he did not attend any meeting involving Pebble on that day, and therefore any announcement at any such meeting would lack authority.

After CNN told the EPA on Friday that evidence showed that Leopold organized and attended the June 27 meeting, Abboud contradicted his prior statement and said Leopold participated in an internal meeting that day to discuss an EPA memo as well as comment letters related to the project. Abboud said an EPA regional office decided to withdraw from the restriction on July 30.

The Bristol Bay watershed is one of the world's most valuable wild salmon fisheries.

This is the second time the EPA under the Trump administration has sought to remove the Clean Water Act restriction and clear the way for the Pebble Mine project.

In 2017, as CNN previously reported , top EPA officials directed staff to withdraw that protection and allow the project to move forward. That decision was made within hours of a meeting between then-EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and Pebble CEO Collier. However, in January 2018, Pruitt flip-flopped and announced that the protections would stay in place as the EPA gathered more information. The EPA said at the time that the Pebble project could still apply for a permit, but ""their permit application must clear a high bar, because EPA believes the risk to Bristol Bay may be unacceptable.""

When the EPA publicly announced the decision to withdraw from the Obama-era restriction on July 30, the EPA's Chris Hladick, an administrator who presides over Alaska, said the preemptive veto that previously blocked the project ""does not account for the full record and does not grapple with differing conclusions"" about the mine's potential environmental impacts.

EPA spokesman Abboud said in a statement to CNN, ""The previous administration's preemptive veto of this project, without a permit even being submitted, was a departure from regular order and the Trump administration is seeking a return to the correct process.""

Abboud added that the decision to withdraw the restriction does not guarantee that the mine will receive a permit but said the EPA will now focus on the permit-review process.

Pebble Limited Partnership praised the decision in a news release last week that said the EPA's previous objections to the project were based on ""'hypothetical mining scenarios' prepared by EPA itself, and assessed in an 'alleged' scientific study."" The company also said that its most recent permit application has a ""substantially smaller development footprint and enhanced environmental safeguards"" and that the project would employ about 2,000 people in Alaska.

The company's CEO, Collier, also ""expressly thanked Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy for his leadership in encouraging EPA to withdraw"" its earlier decision.

Christine Todd Whitman, who served as an Environmental Protection Agency administrator during the George W. Bush administration, said the EPA's decision to lift the restriction on the mine before the agency's scientists fully reviewed the matter could violate the Clean Water Act.

""It's politics trumping policy and good science,"" said Whitman, who in 2017 joined two other former EPA administrators who served under Republican presidents in opposing the mine due to its estimated environmental impacts. ""If this goes forward now with all the holes and the insufficiencies ... there'll be a lawsuit, no question about that.""

Bristol Bay-area tribes have protested the mine and say it would not only harm the environment, it would ruin their way of life.

""If that mine gets put in, it would ... completely devastate our region,"" said Gayla Hoseth, second chief of the Curyung Tribal Council and a Bristol Bay Native Association director. ""It would not only kill our resources, but it would kill us culturally."""
Chinese reports on U.S. diplomat in Hong Kong 'have gone from irresponsible to dangerous': State Department,https://www.reuters.com,"['David Brunnstrom', 'Min Read']",08-10-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-protests-usa/chinese-reports-on-u-s-diplomat-in-hong-kong-have-gone-from-irresponsible-to-dangerous-state-department-idUSKCN1UZ2HK,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Official Chinese media reports about a U.S. diplomat who met with student leaders of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement “have gone from irresponsible to dangerous” and must stop, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said on Friday.

“Chinese authorities know full well, our accredited consular personnel are just doing their jobs, just like diplomats from every other country,” Ortagus added in a tweet.

She did not elaborate on the nature of the reports, but said: “This must stop.”

On Thursday, Ortagus called China a “thuggish regime” for disclosing photographs and personal details of the diplomat, identified by a Hong Kong newspaper as Julie Eadeh of the U.S. consulate’s political section.

“I don’t think that leaking an American diplomat’s private information, pictures, names of their children — I don’t think that is a formal protest ... That is not how a responsible nation would behave,” she told a briefing.

The Hong Kong office of China’s Foreign Ministry on Thursday asked the United States to explain reports in Communist Party-controlled media that U.S. diplomats were in contact with student leaders of protests that have convulsed Hong Kong for nine weeks.

The denunciations from the State Department are unusually sharp and have come as tensions between Washington and Beijing surge over an expanding trade war and military rivalry in the western Pacific, among other disputes.

The Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao published a photograph it said showed Eadeh talking with student leaders in the lobby of a luxury hotel. It appeared under the headline “Foreign Forces Intervene”.

The State Department has not identified the diplomat and has not elaborated on what kinds of private information or children’s details were disclosed.

In subsequent tweets on Friday, Ortagus said “foreign diplomats in the United States, including Chinese ones, enjoy open access to all elements of American politics, civil society, academia, and business.”

“China has a long record of broken commitments; it’s their duty under the Vienna Conventions, to which China is a party, to treat our diplomats and consular officers with due respect and take all appropriate steps to prevent any attack on their person, freedom or dignity,” she said.

China has accused foreign powers, particularly the United States, of fomenting the demonstrations in Hong Kong.

Earlier on Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he was not ready to make a deal with China and even called a September round of trade talks into question, reviving concerns in financial markets that the bilateral dispute is unlikely to end anytime soon."

EPA won't approve warning labels for Roundup chemical,https://www.statesman.com,['The Associated Press'],08-09-2019,2019,8,https://www.statesman.com/zz/news/20190809/epa-wont-approve-warning-labels-for-roundup-chemical/1,"The Trump administration says it won't approve warning labels for products that contain glyphosate, a move aimed at California as it fights one of the world's largest agriculture companies about the potentially cancer-causing chemical.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. — The Trump administration says it won't approve warning labels for products that contain glyphosate, a move aimed at California as it fights one of the world's largest agriculture companies about the potentially cancer-causing chemical.

California requires warning labels on glyphosate products — widely known as the weed killer Roundup — because the International Agency for Research on Cancer has said it is ""probably carcinogenic.""

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency disagrees, saying its research shows the chemical poses no risks to public health. California has not enforced the warning label for glyphosate because Monsanto, the company that makes Roundup, sued and a federal judge temporarily blocked the warning labels last year until the lawsuit could be resolved.

""It is irresponsible to require labels on products that are inaccurate when EPA knows the product does not pose a cancer risk,"" EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a statement. ""We will not allow California's flawed program to dictate federal policy.""

California's Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act, approved by voters in 1986, requires the government to publish a list of chemicals known to cause cancer, as determined by a variety of outside groups that include the EPA and IARC. The law also requires companies to warn customers about those chemicals.

California regulators have twice concluded glyphosate did not pose a cancer risk for drinking water. But in 2015, the IARC classified the chemical as ""probably carcinogenic,"" triggering a warning label under California law.

Federal law regulates how pesticides are used and how they are labeled. States can impose their own requirements, but they can't be weaker than the federal law, according to Brett Hartl, government affairs director for the Center for Biological Diversity.

Hartl said it is unusual for the EPA to tell a state it can't go beyond the federal requirements.

""It's a little bit sad the EPA is the biggest cheerleader and defender of glyphosate,"" Hartl said. ""It's the Environmental Protection Agency, not the pesticide protection agency.""

In a letter to companies explaining its decision, Michael L. Goodis, director of EPA's registration division in its Office of Pesticide Programs, said the agency considers labels warning glyphosate to cause cancer to ""constitute a false and misleading statement,"" which is prohibited by federal law.

Chandra Lord, a representative for Monsanto's parent company Bayer AG, said the EPA's announcement ""is fully consistent with the science-based conclusions reached by the agency and leading health regulators worldwide for more than four decades.""

""Glyphosate is not carcinogenic,"" Lord said.

An estimated 13,000 plaintiffs have pending lawsuits against Monsanto concerning glyphosate. Three of those cases went to trial in California, and juries awarded damages in each case, although judges later reduced the amounts.

In May, a jury ordered Monsanto to pay a California couple $2.055 billion after a trial where they blamed the company's product for caused their cancers. Last month , a judge reduced that award to $87 million."
EPA reauthorizes use of ‘cyanide bombs’ to kill wild animals,https://nypost.com,['August'],08-09-2019,2019,8,https://nypost.com/2019/08/09/epa-reauthorizes-use-of-cyanide-bombs-to-kill-wild-animals/,"The Trump administration has reauthorized the use of controversial traps dubbed “cyanide bombs” to kill coyotes, foxes and other animals across the US.

The Environmental Protection Agency announced this week that it would allow, on an interim basis, the use of M-44 devices, which trap wildlife with bait before spraying sodium cyanide into their mouths, according to CBS News.

The spring-loaded devices, which have killed more than wild animals since they were first introduced in the 1960s, have been blasted as inhumane.

“Cyanide traps can’t be used safely by anyone, anywhere,” said Collette Adkins, carnivore conservation director at the Center for Biological Diversity.

“While the EPA added some restrictions, these deadly devices have caused too much harm to remain in use. We need a permanent nationwide ban to protect people, pets and imperiled wildlife from this poison,” she said.

The EPA has updated its rules to include some restrictions on the use of the devices, including banning their placement within 100 feet of a public road or pathway, increased from 50 feet. Warning signs also must be placed within 15 feet of each device, decreased from 25 feet.

A final decision on the use of the M-44s is expected to come down after 2021.

In 2017, a child was temporarily blinded and three pet dogs killed in two incidents involving the use of M-44s in Idaho and Wyoming, the BBC reported.

Canyon Mansfield’s family successfully sued the US government for $150,000 last year. One of the devices had been placed near their property in Pocatello, Idaho, and his dog triggered the device, The Guardian reported.

The EPA allows use of the devices by Wildlife Services, the animal-killing program of the US Department of Agriculture — and also authorizes their use by state agencies in South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, New Mexico and Texas.

Last year, Wildlife Services got rid of over 1.5 million native animals — from beavers to black bears, wolves, ducks and owls, primarily for the benefit of private farmers and ranchers, according to The Guardian. About 6,500 of them were killed by M-44s.

At the end of last year, the EPA proposed the renewed use of sodium cyanide, allowing time for public comment until March, CBS News reported.

More than 99.9 percent of the comments urged the agency to ban M-44s, according to the Center for Biological Diversity and Western Environmental Law Center.

“The overwhelming majority of comments from the general public, including the more than 20,000 letters from the write-in campaign, did not support the continued registration of sodium cyanide predacide uses (M-44 devices),” the EPA wrote in its proposal."
Trump's DOJ hid shocking report on growing terror threat from white supremacists,https://www.salon.com,[],08-09-2019,2019,8,https://www.salon.com/2019/08/09/trumps-doj-hid-shocking-report-on-growing-terror-threat-from-white-supremacists/,"The Justice Department suppressed a report showing that suspected white supremacists were responsible for all race-based domestic terror incidents last year.

The report by New Jersey’s Office of Homeland Security Preparedness was distributed throughout DHS and to federal agencies like the FBI earlier this year before it was obtained by Yahoo News. The document includes data Congress has sought from the Trump administration but the Justice Department has been “unable or unwilling” to provide.

The report shows that 25 of 46 suspects in 32 domestic terrorism incidents were identified as white supremacists. The 25 suspected white supremacist suspects were responsible for all “race-based” incidents while others were deemed “anti-government extremists” and “single-issue extremists.”

“This map reflects 32 domestic terrorist attacks, disrupted plots, threats of violence, and weapons stockpiling by individuals with a radical political or social agenda who lack direction or influence from foreign terrorist organizations in 2018,” the report said.

The map and data in the document were circulated through the DOJ and law enforcement agencies in April, which is around the time that the Senate Judiciary Committee requested the DOJ provide data showing the number of white supremacists involved in domestic terrorism.

Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., told Yahoo News that the committee still has not received the data.

“I’m troubled by the lack of transparency, given that we haven’t received this critical information after several requests to the FBI and DOJ,” Booker said. “They cannot and should not remain silent in the face of such a dangerous threat.”

An aide to Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., who also sits on the committee, told the outlet that the DOJ and FBI both told the panel they were “unable or unwilling to provide precise data on white supremacist terrorism, and neither agency has responded to our repeated follow-up questions since the briefing.”

The request to the DOJ came after the Trump administration consolidated 11 categories it used to identify domestic terrorism to four. One of the categories was a catch-all “racially-motivated violent extremism.”

“This new category inappropriately combines incidents involving white supremacists and so-called ‘Black identity extremists,’ a fabricated term based on a faulty assessment of a small number of isolated incidents,” the committee’s Democrats said in a letter to Attorney General Bill Barr and FBI Director Christopher Wray. The letter said the senators were “deeply concerned that this reclassification downplays the significance of the white supremacist threat.”

The letter also noted that the senators were not provided with data they had requested at earlier hearings and briefings.

Durbin’s aide accused the Trump administration of trying to make it more difficult to track violence by white supremacists by obscuring it under the “race-based extremists” label.

“The Trump administration’s irresponsible decision to stop tracking white supremacist incidents as a separate category of domestic terrorism obfuscates the extent of this threat,” Durbin’s aide told Yahoo News. “This highlights the problem with not specifically tracking white supremacist attacks. If we do not understand the scope of this problem, we cannot effectively combat it.”

Obfuscation appears to be the game plan. Asked what he would do to combat white supremacy on Wednesday, Trump both-sided the issue like he did after Charlottesville. “I don’t like it,” he said,” whether it’s white supremacy, whether it’s any other kind of supremacy. Whether it’s antifa.”

It isn’t just rhetoric. The Trump administration has taken numerous steps to roll back efforts to combat white supremacist groups while pushing for increased legal action against Antifa by labeling them a terrorist group.

Under Trump, the Department of Homeland Security has redirected resources away from fighting far-right and white supremacist groups. The Los Angeles Times reported that DHS had slashed its office handling domestic terrorism from $21 million and 41 full-time or contracted employees to just $2.6 million and 10 full-time employees in 2017.

The Trump administration also declined to renew an Obama administration Countering Violent Extremism Grant Program and canceled the only grant specifically aimed at combating white supremacism. Since Trump took over, 85 percent of the DHS “Countering Violent Extremism” have instead targeted Muslims and other minority groups, according to an analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice.

“While white supremacy is not a new phenomenon in America, it’s incredibly troubling the way the movement has been emboldened,” Sen. Booker told Yahoo News, “and the administration’s efforts to obfuscate the data on these terrorist incidents simply defies logic.”"
"State Department official on leave after civil rights group accuses him of being involved in white nationalist movement, source says",https://www.cnn.com,['Jennifer Hansler'],08-09-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/09/politics/matthew-gebert-splc/index.html,"(CNN) A State Department official has been placed on administrative leave after being linked to a white nationalist group in a report by a civil rights organization, a source tells CNN.

Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff have been briefed by the State Department on the case of Matthew Gebert, a foreign affairs officer in the department's Bureau of Energy Resources, after he was identified by the Southern Poverty Law Center's Hatewatch initiative on Wednesday, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN on Friday. One of the sources said the committee was learning about the facts of the situation and why he had been placed on leave.

In an extensive report released Wednesday, Hatewatch alleged that Gebert ""oversaw the Washington, D.C.-area chapter of a white nationalist organization, hosted white nationalists at his home and published white nationalist propaganda online."" According to the report, Gebert used a pseudonym to express ""a desire to build a country for whites only.""

""That's all that we need. We need a country founded for white people with a nuclear deterrent.

EPA defies California rules over Monsanto Roundup,https://www.upi.com,[],08-10-2019,2019,8,https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/08/10/EPA-defies-California-rules-over-Monsanto-Roundup/4571565463730/,"The Environmental Protection Agency told companies Thursday they would not approve labels which abide by California requirements to warn customers that glyphosate in Monsanto Roundup has been linked to cancer. File Photo by Bill Greenblatt/UPI | License Photo

Aug. 10 (UPI) -- The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has defied California regulators by no longer approving labels claiming Monsanto Roundup is known to cause cancer.

The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment has listed glyphosate, a chemical compound-base for Monsanto Roundup herbicide weed killer, as causing cancer since July 2017. Furthermore, glyphosate was added to the state's Proposition 65 list, which requires businesses to warn customers about chemicals known to cause cancer.

The EPA defied that regulation Thursday by saying it will no longer approve product labels claiming glyphosate is known to cause cancer.

""It is irresponsible to require labels on products that are inaccurate when EPA knows the product does not post a cancer risk,"" the EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a statement.

""It is critical that federal regulatory agencies like EPA relay to consumers accurate, scientific based information about risks that pesticides may pose to them. EPA's notification to glyphosate registrants is an important step to ensuring the information shared with the public on a federal pesticide label is correct and not misleading.""

The EPA added that California's listing of glyphosate on the state's Proposition 65 list is based on the International Agency on the Research for Cancer classifying it as ""probably carcinogenic to humans."" However, EPA's independent evaluation found that glyphosate is ""not likely to be carcinogenic to humans,"" and the agency said that its data set was ""more extensive and relevant.""

The EPA action rejects the idea that the weed killer is likely to pose a cancer risk despite rulings against Bayer-owned Monsanto in California earlier this year resulting in tens of millions of dollars in awards to sick clients, and amid the the world's best-selling herbicide facing more than 13,000 suits nationwide.

Among the rulings so far, was a $2 billion award to a couple diagnosed with cancer after using Roundup for decades, which was later cut down to $86.7 million in a subsequent ruling. Another case involved an $80 million award to a California man whose cancer the jury found was likely linked to the herbicide.

California jurors also awarded $289 million to a man last year who testified that two years after he was soaked with the product in an accident as a groundskeeper for a school district near San Francisco, he was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma despite wearing protective clothing and face mask."
USDA eases relocation timeline as researchers flee agency,https://thehill.com,[],08-09-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/456921-usda-eases-relocation-timeline-as-researchers-flee-agency,"The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reversed course late Friday, agreeing to key union demands as nearly two-thirds of its research staff will leave the agency rather than move to new headquarters in the Kansas City area.

The announcement follows a tumultuous few weeks at the USDA where employees were given a month to decide if they would uproot from D.C. by Sept. 30 or lose their jobs that same day.

Employees at both the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) — two of the major research wings within USDA — unionized in the wake of the agency’s relocation plans and the USDA has been heavily criticized by lawmakers for the short timeline and chaos surrounding the decision.

The Friday contract will allow employees who agreed to relocate to telework through the end of the year, including the option to extend the time period.

Employees who make the move will also be given a bonus equal to one month’s pay “to help compensate for the loss of income incurred by employees moving from the higher wage D.C. area,” according to a press release from the American Federation of Government Employees, the union representing the USDA employees.

USDA office move may have broken law, watchdog says MORE in July.

Two-thirds of the staff at the two agencies told USDA they would forfeit their job rather than move to Kansas City in a plan many say is politically motivated and poorly organized.

“Moving these researchers out of Washington puts them out of earshot from policymakers. A lot of the research that scientists and economists do at [the USDA] has policy implications, and members of Congress need this information and need to have face-to-face meetings with these researchers,” Rebecca Boehm, with the Union of Concerned Scientists, told The Hill when the move was first announced.

“It keeps science out of the policymaking process. And we’ve seen many times that this administration doesn’t like facts or research that isn’t convenient or [is] an impediment to their agenda, so I think moving them away helps accomplish that,” she added.

Democrats have repeatedly questioned the wisdom of the move.

Those outside of political circles have also questioned the planned relocation and whether it’s entirely legal. A Tuesday report from USDA’s Office of Inspector General said the decision may have violated the law.

The USDA’s general counsel, Stephen Vaden, has argued that the department is not bound by laws requiring it to secure congressional approval to spend the money to relocate, claiming the law in question is unconstitutional.

The inspector general’s report counters that Vaden's claim is “not consistent with prior positions taken by the Department.”

“To reach management decision on this recommendation and to ensure consistent treatment going forward, the Department needs to communicate, in writing, this change of interpretation to USDA leaders at the Sub-Cabinet and Agency levels,” the report states.

The USDA did not respond to a request for comment.

State Department employee linked to white supremacy placed on leave,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-10-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/state-department-employee-linked-to-white-supremacy-placed-on-leave-report,"A State Department official is reportedly on administrative leave after being linked to a white nationalist group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

The SPLC published a report on Wednesday alleging Bureau of Energy Resources foreign affairs officer Matthew Gebert uses the alias ""Coach Finstock"" to advocate for white supremacy and white nationalism on social media and other places.

The State Department has placed Gebert on leave while it investigates the allegations made in the SPLC report, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN on Friday.

""[Whites] need a country of our own with nukes, and we will retake this thing lickety split,"" a man identified as Coach Finstock said on a white nationalist podcast in May 2018. ""That's all that we need. We need a country founded for white people with a nuclear deterrent. And you watch how the world trembles.""

Gebert held white nationalist parties at his Virginia home, according to the SPLC. The left-wing civil rights group deduced that Gebert operates under the pseudonym ""Coach Finstock"" through a review of the Coach Finstock handle’s history on social media.

The SPLC has made false accusations of bigotry and radicalism in the past. In 2018, the SPLC publicly apologized to Maajid Nawaz, a former Islamic radical the group included in its ""Field Guide to Anti-Muslim Extremists."" The SPLC also paid Nawaz a $3.375 million settlement."
"Trump's EPA grants 31 small refinery waivers from biofuel laws, angering corn lobby",https://www.reuters.com,"['Humeyra Pamuk', 'Min Read']",08-10-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-ethanol-epa/trumps-epa-grants-31-small-refinery-waivers-from-biofuel-laws-angering-corn-lobby-idUSKCN1UZ2AV,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has granted 31 small refinery biofuel waivers for 2018 on Friday, infuriating the ethanol and corn producers who blamed the Trump administration for bailing out the oil industry when U.S. farmers were suffering due to trade tariffs and low prices.

FILE PHOTO: AltEn LLC ethanol plant is seen in Mead, Nebraska, U.S., March 21, 2019. REUTERS/Humeyra Pamuk/File Photo

The waivers from the country’s biofuel laws were fewer than previous year’s and marked an increase in the number of petitions rejected, but the EPA’s decision was still unlikely to satisfy the powerful U.S. corn lobby which wants a broad retrenchment of the biofuel waiver program it blames for undercutting ethanol demand.

“At a time when ethanol plants in the Heartland are being mothballed and jobs are being lost, it is unfathomable and utterly reprehensible that the Trump administration would dole out more unwarranted waivers to prosperous petroleum refiners,” said RFA President and Chief Executive Geoff Cooper said in a statement.

Small Refinery Exemptions are available to small U.S. refineries that can prove they are in financial strife, and the waivers free them from their obligation under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) to blend biofuels like ethanol into their gasoline or purchase credits from others that do.

Since Trump took office, the EPA has more than quadrupled the number of waivers it has granted to refiners, saving the oil industry hundreds of millions of dollars, corn growers, who claim the move threatens ethanol demand. Refiners dismiss the argument.

The agency rejected six of the applications, while three were declared withdrawn, according to the EPA website.

The RFS was enacted more than a decade ago to help farmers and reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil. The waiver program, however, has emerged as a battlefield between the rivaling oil and corn industries.

American farmers, a key constituency for Trump as he eyes re-election in 2020, have been among the most hurt by his trade war with China, a key buyer of U.S. farm exports before the dispute began.

Iowa Renewable Fuels Association (IRFA) Executive Director Monte Shaw called EPA’s decision “devastating.”

“With this action, President Trump has destroyed over a billion gallons of biofuel demand and broken his promise to Iowa voters to protect the RFS,” Shaw said.

Trump’s EPA granted 35 of the 37 applications it received for the 2017 year, including for refineries owned by companies like Exxon Mobil and Chevron Corp, and billionaire investor Carl Icahn, vastly expanding the program.

Both the oil and corn industries have been awaiting the 2018 decisions for months.

Those decisions had been ready in June, industry sources told Reuters, but Trump intervened after a trip to Iowa where he heard angry feedback from farmers about the waiver program. He ordered members of his Cabinet to review the waiver program based on those complaints.

The EPA, the Agriculture Department and the Department of Energy have been in discussions about the program since, but no reform proposal has emerged. Sources briefed on the matter have said the oil lobby appears to have garnered support for a mostly-unchanged waiver program.

Renewable fuel (D6) credits for 2019 last traded on Friday at about 11 cents each, down from 20 cents on Thursday, traders said, following news of the looming waiver decisions.

The EPA also said it was going to look at ways to boost growth to natural gas, flexible fuel vehicles and E85 fuels, a blend with higher level of ethanol, which is a move aimed to ease potential wrath of the corn lobby and farmers."
FBI used Steele dossier in FISAs despite knowing about flaws and bias,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-09-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/fbi-used-steele-dossier-in-fisas-despite-knowing-about-flaws-and-bias,"Newly released FBI notes from interviews with Justice Department official Bruce Ohr about British ex-spy Christopher Steele show the bureau continued using Steele’s unverified and flawed dossier despite warnings about Steele’s biases.

The heavily redacted documents, produced by the DOJ following a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch, offered a glimpse into Ohr’s role as an unofficial conduit between Steele and the FBI and detailed some of the clear warning signs about the credibility of Steele’s allegations, including skepticism from State Department official Kathleen Kavalec, who met with Steele prior to the election. The notes even suggest Ohr believed some of Steele’s allegations might be Russian conspiracy theories. Steele's dossier was used in Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications to obtain surveillance against Trump campaign associate Carter Page.

The notes show Ohr continued communicating with Steele and passing that info along to the bureau months, after the FBI officially cut Steele off as a confidential human source following the discovery he had been improperly providing information to journalists while working with them. And the records also show the key role played by Glenn Simpson, the founder of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS which had hired Steele, in encouraging Steele to talk to the media.

The redacted FISA documents released in 2018 show the DOJ and FBI made extensive use of Steele’s dossier, which included a series of salacious and unverified allegations regarding Trump and Russia, in order to obtain surveillance through the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court against former Trump campaign associate Carter Page. Steele put his research together in 2016 at the behest of Fusion GPS, which had been hired by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee through the Perkins Coie law firm. Steele receiving Democratic funding was never revealed to the court.

Following a November 2016 meeting with Ohr, the interviewing FBI agents wrote that Ohr told them Steele “was desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being the U.S. President.” Ohr said he believed Steele “wanted to blunt or foil the Kremlin’s plans.” Steele’s explicit motivations were also not made clear to the FISA Court.

Agents noted in November 2016 that Ohr said Steele told him “the FSB [Russia’s state security service] had Trump over a barrel,” and in mid-December, Trump lawyer Michael Cohen “is the go-between Russia and Trump campaign” and replaced former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and aide Carter Page in that role. Steele also claimed at the time “Cohen may have attended a meeting in Prague, possibly in September, regarding the Trump campaign and the Russians.”

Special counsel Robert Mueller’s report said it did not establish any criminal coordination or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia and further noted Cohen had never been to Prague.

Ohr told agents in November 2016 he “never believed” Steele was “making up information or shading it” and that he believed Steele was just passing along what his sources in Russia were telling him, but added “that doesn’t make that story true.” And Ohr raised the specter of possible Russian disinformation, noting “there are always Russian conspiracy theories that come from the Kremlin” and providing a redacted example.

By January 2017, some FBI agents trying to verify the dossier’s allegations had reportedly concluded some of the dossier’s contents may have been based upon rumors and hearsay passed from source to source and originated as Russian disinformation. Former CIA Moscow station chief Daniel Hoffman told the Washington Examiner the dossier was ""likely FSB disinformation.""

Agents said in a series of notes from December 2016 that Ohr told them Simpson from Fusion GPS “directed” Steele to speak to press “as that was what Simpson was paying [Steele] to do.” Michael Isikoff, the chief investigative correspondent for Yahoo News whose September 2016 news article based on the dossier was used to bolster the FISA applications, later said the media should have shown more skepticism over Steele's dossier, which he described as ""thirdhand stuff."" Steele also passed along information to numerous other media outlets.

Agents also noted in December 2016 that Ohr told them his wife Nellie was hired by Simpson to work for Fusion GPS during the presidential election, and Ohr provided the FBI with all the work his wife conducted for Simpson.

Agents further wrote in February 2017 that Ohr reminded them that Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec spoke with Steele several times prior to the presidential election. Steele met Kavalec 10 days before the first FISA application was submitted, and he admitted to her that he was encouraged by his client to get his research out before the 2016 election. Kavalec notated the conversation, also finding glaring flaws with some of Steele’s claims, and passed her findings along to the FBI. It is not yet known if the FBI took her skepticism into consideration.

DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz has been investigating allegations of FISA abuse since March 2018, and his report is expected to be released around Labor Day."
"EPA plans to downgrade Denver, northern Colorado to 'serious' violator of clean air rules",https://www.thedenverchannel.com,[],08-09-2019,2019,8,https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/epa-plans-to-downgrade-denver-northern-colorado-to-serious-violator-of-clean-air-rules,"DENVER (AP) — Denver and northern Colorado's urban corridor failed to meet federal ozone pollution standards, and the state will have to come up with a new plan to clean up the air, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Thursday.

The move was expected after Democratic Gov. Jared Polis said in March the state would no longer ask for an exemption from the standards by claiming some of the pollution was drifting from China and elsewhere, rather than being created in Colorado.

The EPA said it plans to downgrade Denver and eight other counties in northern Colorado from ""moderate"" to ""serious."" The classifications refer to how far out of compliance the area is with agency standards.

In addition to Denver, the area includes Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Douglas, Jefferson, Larimer and Weld counties.

Colorado is already working on steps to reduce pollution, including writing new rules for the oil and gas industry and encouraging more electric cars, said Jill Hunsaker Ryan, director of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.

""Whether Colorado is classified as moderate or serious doesn't affect our commitment to doing what is necessary, as swiftly as possible, to make sure every Coloradan has clean air to breathe,"" Ryan said in a written statement.

Ground-level ozone, the main component of smog, can aggravate asthma and contribute to early deaths from respiratory disease. Ozone is created from pollution emitted by vehicles, industries, solvents and other sources.

Denver and the northern Front Range have struggled to meet EPA ozone standards since at least 2004.

States can lose some federal highway funding if they don't come up with a plan to correct ozone violations. The EPA says states are not penalized for violating the standards, but only for not developing an agency-approved plan to improve.

Thursday's announcement by the EPA opens a 30-day period for the public to comment on the agency's plan to downgrade the area's status. A public hearing is scheduled for Sept. 6.

""One of the first acts of our administration was to withdraw the waiver request for ozone non attainment to stop sugar-coating the bad state of our air quality. Seniors and kids have been affected the most by our smog this summer,"" Polis said in a statement. ""Moving to 'serious' status finally helps us stop sweeping our air quality crisis under the rug and gives us additional tools to move urgently to make our air cleaner."""
White House rebuffed attempts by DHS to make combating domestic terrorism a higher priority,https://www.cnn.com,"['Jake Tapper', 'Anchor', 'Chief Washington Correspondent']",08-07-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/07/politics/white-house-domestic-terrorism/index.html,"Washington (CNN) White House officials rebuffed efforts by their colleagues at the Department of Homeland Security for more than a year to make combating domestic terror threats, such as those from white supremacists, a greater priority as specifically spelled out in the National Counterterrorism Strategy, current and former senior administration officials as well as other sources close to the Trump administration tell CNN.

""Homeland Security officials battled the White House for more than a year to get them to focus more on domestic terrorism,"" one senior source close to the Trump administration tells CNN. ""The White House wanted to focus only on the jihadist threat which, while serious, ignored the reality that racial supremacist violence was rising fast here at home. They had major ideological blinders on.""

The National Counterterrorism Strategy , issued last fall, states that ""Radical Islamist terrorists remain the primary transnational terrorist threat to the United States and its vital national interests,"" which few experts dispute. What seems glaring to these officials is the minimizing of the threat of domestic terrorism, which they say was on their radar as a growing problem.

""Ultimately the White House just added one paragraph about domestic terrorism as a throw-away line,"" a senior source involved in the discussion told CNN. That paragraph mentions ""other forms of violent extremism, such as racially motivated extremism, animal rights extremism, environmental extremism, sovereign citizen extremism, and militia extremism."" It made no mention of white supremacists. (A separate paragraph in the report mentions investigating domestic terrorists with connections to overseas terrorists, but that does not seem to be a reference to white supremacists.)

The document mentions that domestic terrorism is on the rise, but the subject is only briefly addressed, all the more stark given that FBI Director Christopher Wray's July testimony that there have been almost as many domestic terror arrests in the first three quarters of the fiscal year -- about 100 -- as there have been arrests connected to international terror. Wray noted that the majority of the domestic terrorism cases were motivated by some version of white supremacist violence, adding that the FBI takes the threat ""extremely seriously.""

The State Department has put on leave an employee of its energy bureau after reports that he has been an active member of a white supremacist group for more than five years, two sources familiar with the situation said on Thursday.

Matthew Gebert, a foreign affairs officer for the department’s Bureau of Energy Resources, was linked to the Washington D.C.-area chapter of a white supremacist organization and published racist propaganda online, according to a report published Wednesday by the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate speech.

Story Continued Below

In a May 2018 episode of a white nationalist podcast, Gebert, speaking under a pseudonym, called for white people to establish “a country of our own with nukes, and we will retake this thing lickety split,” according to the SPLC report.

“We need a country founded for white people with a nuclear deterrent. And you watch how the world trembles,” the report quoted him saying.

Attempts to contact Gebert were unsuccessful. Twitter accounts that SPLC described in its report as belonging to Gebert and that have posted anti-Semitic and pro-Nazi messages were deleted as of Wednesday afternoon.

A State Department spokesperson did not reply to questions about Gebert‘s employment status.

“The Department of State cannot comment on personnel issues but is committed to providing an inclusive workplace,” a department spokesperson said.

Gebert started working at the bureau as a career employee in 2013, according to a posting in the George Washington alumni magazine the SPLC cited. He worked on energy issues involving Pakistan and India during his time there, former co-workers told POLITICO.

Former State Department officials expressed surprise that security screenings had not flagged Gebert’s involvement with the hate groups. Gebert would have undergone a routine screening before starting his position and another at his five-year work anniversary, said Amos Hochstein, who served as special envoy and coordinator for the State Department’s international energy affairs from 2014 to 2017 and was Gebert’s boss.

“It is inconceivable he got security clearance twice,” Hochstein told POLITICO. “If Gebert was Muslim or a person of color, it would have been caught. Neo-Nazis are not all shaved heads and tattoos, they are hiding in plain sight. I'm horrified Gebert worked for me at the State Department.“

A State Department spokesman did not respond to questions about the department’s security clearance practices.

EPA seeks to limit states leveraging Clean Water Act to block pipelines,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Valerie Richardson']",08-10-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/aug/10/epa-seeks-limit-states-leveraging-clean-water-act-/,"After years of fighting pipeline projects, New England was hit with an energy crunch during the 2018 polar vortex, driving up prices and forcing the region to import liquefied natural gas from Russia, even though the United States is awash in natural gas.

Now the Trump administration has declared: Enough.

The Environmental Protection Agency announced Friday a proposed rule to streamline the approval process under the Clean Water Act by updating Section 401, which has been leveraged by blue states seeking to stall and block pipelines and terminals.

“Under President Trump, the United States has become the number one oil and gas energy producer in the world, while at the same time continuing to improve our air quality,” said EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler. “Our proposal is intended to help ensure that states adhere to the statutory language and intent of Clean Water Act.”

Mr. Wheeler’s announcement, issued at the summer meeting of the National Association of Manufacturers, comes with environmentalists seeking to plug the hydraulic-fracturing boom by stopping the pipelines that transport oil and natural gas from formations like the Bakken in North Dakota and Permian in Pennsylvania to population centers nationwide.

Fracking foes scored a victory in May when New York regulators rejected the Williams pipeline, despite warnings from utilities that the decision could result in shortages, rate hikes, and moratoriums on additional users.

Meanwhile, Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee, a 2020 Democratic presidential contender, has been sued over a proposed coal export terminal blocked by state regulators.

“Too often, the vaguely worded Section 401 has been used as an excuse to block critical infrastructure and trade projects,” said NAM president Jay Timmons. “By setting clear guidelines, the EPA is empowering manufacturers to invest in our people and communities with confidence and to work with state leaders to protect our water and environment.”

This rule making would accelerate and promote energy infrastructure to benefit communities while ensuring the protection of our waterways. https://t.co/dh2qoCBrXs pic.twitter.com/GELDxdcsvd — U.S. EPA (@EPA) August 9, 2019



Under the CWA’s Section 401, states and tribes are permitted to assess federally approved infrastructure projects within their borders, but the provision, which has not been updated in 50 years, has led to “confusion and unnecessary delays for infrastructure projects,” said the EPA.

The proposed rule requires states to limit their Section 401 reviews to “considerations of water quality,” and do so “within a reasonable period of time, which shall not exceed one year,” as reported by Reuters.

The Sierra Club countered that the draft rule would “drastically undermine the bedrock protections set forth in the Clean Water Act” by limiting the states to assessing point-source discharges, instead of “all potential sources of pollution.”

“This attack on one of our most fundamental clean water protections seeks to severely limit states’ ability to protect their water, at a time when climate change, water scarcity, and pollution make access to clean water more important than ever,” said Sierra Club President Michael Brune.

The Natural Resources Defense Council’s Jon Devine said the draft rule would “leave states and tribes at the mercy of project developers and federal agencies that couldn’t care less about protecting water resources.”

Meanwhile, business groups cheered the proposed changes, saying that opponents have long abused the evaluation process by dredging up objections beyond the act’s scope.

“Congress never intended for Governors to use the Clean Water Act as a political tool to block projects for reasons unrelated to clean water,” said Christopher Guith, acting president of the U.S. Chamber’s Global Energy Institute. “We support EPA’s new rule to prevent more abuse, facilitate construction of necessary energy infrastructure, and continue economic growth.”

Today at @namcma’s conference, @EPAAWheeler announced @EPA’s proposal to streamline permit approval processes. This is a win for manufacturers. By providing clear guidelines, the EPA is helping manufacturers invest in our communities with confidence. https://t.co/v8thgV6kRr — Jay Timmons (@JayTimmonsNAM) August 9, 2019



Don Santa, president of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America, said states have a role to play in the environmental review process, but that “some states have viewed Section 401 as a means of determining which interstate pipeline projects are in the public interest and which are not.”

“EPA’s draft rule is necessary to restore efficient and consistent implementation of Section 401 reviews,” Mr. Santa said. “We welcome today’s action to clarify the discrete roles of federal, state and tribal authorities throughout the Section 401 review process.”

The proposed rule, subject to a 60-day comment period after being published in the Federal Register, follows Mr. Trump’s executive order in April to “accelerate and promote the construction of pipelines and other important energy infrastructure,” the EPA said.

DOJ Official Behind Failed Census Citizenship Question To Leave Department,https://www.npr.org,['Hansi Lo Wang'],08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.npr.org/2019/08/08/749573662/doj-official-behind-failed-census-citizenship-question-to-leave-department,"DOJ Official Behind Failed Census Citizenship Question To Leave Department

Enlarge this image toggle caption Steve Helber/AP Steve Helber/AP

Updated at 9:48 p.m. ET

John Gore, the main Justice Department official behind the Trump administration's failed push to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, is set to leave the department Friday.

A person familiar with the matter tells NPR Gore plans to spend time with his family while he is ""discerning next steps.""

Gore, who has been serving as the principal deputy assistant attorney general for the DOJ's Civil Rights Division, is among the administration officials currently facing allegations of providing false testimony and concealing evidence as part of the lawsuits over the citizenship question. In a recent court filing, Gore denied the claims made by advocacy groups represented by the ACLU, New York Civil Liberties Union and the Arnold & Porter.

Gore did not immediately respond to an email and a phone call requesting comment.

A partner at the law firm Jones Day before he joined the administration in 2017, Gore previously led the Civil Rights Division as its acting head. He ghostwrote the Justice Department letter to the Census Bureau that formally requested a citizenship question, which three federal courts have permanently blocked from 2020 census forms.

That letter, which was sent to the bureau in December 2017, claimed the administration wanted to add the question to the census in order to better protect the voting rights of racial minorities — a justification that a majority of the Supreme Court found to appear ""contrived"" and three lower courts have dismissed as a sham.

Pressed by plaintiffs' attorney Dale Ho of the ACLU during a deposition this past October, Gore testified that including the question is ""not necessary"" for enforcing the Voting Rights Act.

Earlier last year, Gore was criticized by both Democratic and Republican lawmakers for failing to appear at a House Oversight committee hearing after he was invited to testify about the DOJ's request for a citizenship question. When he finally showed up at a follow-up hearing, he refused to answer lawmakers' questions beyond information that was publicly available.

Gore did later provide a written response to a question from Rep. Jimmy Gomez, a Democratic committee member from California, about the confidentiality of census responses. Current federal law prohibits the Census Bureau from sharing information identifying individuals until 72 years after the information is collected, and the data cannot be used against individuals.

An internal email released as part of the citizenship question lawsuits later showed that Gore and his staff crafted an intentionally vague response after discussing that the sharing of individuals' census information with law enforcement and national security officers may ""come up later for renewed debate."""
EPA proposes downgrading Denver and northern Front Range to “serious” violator of air quality standards,https://www.denverpost.com,"['Jessica Seaman', 'Jessica Seaman Covers Health For The Denver Post. A Native Of North Carolina', 'Jessica Joined The Post After Stints As A Reporter In Greensboro', 'North Carolina', 'Little Rock', 'Arkansas. She Is A Graduate Of Unc-Chapel Hill.']",08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.denverpost.com/2019/08/08/colorado-air-quality-violations-epa/,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced Thursday that it wants to reclassify the region encompassing Denver and the northern Front Range as a “serious” violator of federal health standards after ozone levels failed to meet air quality standards.

The move, which will require public comment, was expected as Gov. Jared Polis earlier this year directed state air officials to not pursue an exemption that would have reduced Colorado’s responsibility under the federal Clean Air Act.

The Denver region has been classified as a “moderate” violator of ozone standards since 2016. That region, as classified by the EPA, includes Denver, Greeley, Fort Collins and Loveland.

“We recognize how vital it is for the department to act and assertively reduce ozone pollution in the Denver Metro/North Front Range area — as well as throughout Colorado,” said Jill Hunsaker Ryan, executive director of the state health department, in a statement.

“With the backing of the state legislature and governor, we are moving forward on developing strategies to reduce emissions from oil and gas facilities, electrify the vehicle fleet and look for other ways to reduce pollutants that cause ozone.”

The EPA is making its decision to reclassify the Denver area based on air quality data collected between 2015 and 2017. The new designation will require new measures to be implemented to reduce emissions, according to a news release.

When Polis opted to forgo an exemption, he ordered work to reduce pollution in the state through measures that include using electric vehicles, adopting renewable energy and reducing oil and gas emissions.

Polis, in a statement, said his administration didn’t seek the exemption because it was time “to stop sugar-coating the bad state of our air quality.”

“Seniors and kids have been affected the most by our smog this summer,” he said. “Moving to ‘serious’ status finally helps us stop sweeping our air quality crisis under the rug and gives us additional tools to move urgently to make our air cleaner.”

The move comes as air quality in the Front Range has worsened in recent years, including as oil and gas companies have expanded in Colorado, causing ozone readings to exceed the 2008 health standards.

Other sources of ozone air pollution include cars and pollution from other states and countries. In Colorado, some air pollution has come from China, possibly from coal-burning power plants.

Ozone affects lung tissue and can aggravate diseases such as asthma and chronic bronchitis, and it can cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, according to the EPA.

“EPA is proposing this action as required by the Clean Air Act,” said Gregory Sopkin, EPA Regional Administrator, in a statement. “We will continue to support the state as they revise plans and implement new measures that will reduce ozone-forming emissions across the many sources contributing to air quality impairment along Colorado’s Front Range.”

The agency will be accepting public comments on the proposal for 30 days starting Aug. 15. It will also hold a public hearing at its office in Denver on Sept. 6, the news release said."

There are times when retired Staff Sgt. Matt Lammers doesn't look like he needs anyone's help — like when he was competing, and winning, races at the Department of Defense Warrior Games in Tampa, Fla., this summer.

""We don't like to say the word 'can't' in our family,"" says Matt, who lost both his legs above the knee and his left arm to an explosion during his second deployment to Iraq in 2007.

Then he goes on to list all the things he just can't do without help from his wife, Alicia.

""She helps me shower. ... She helps me transfer in my wheelchair, drives me to my appointments,"" says Matt, while on a break between events at the games. ""I'd honestly say, not to be smart, but the question is, What she doesn't do?""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Eve Edelheit for NPR Eve Edelheit for NPR

Matt won medals at the games in Tampa for sitting volleyball, swimming and indoor rowing. At the end of the games, the U.S. Army gave him the ""heart of the team"" award. But he and his wife almost didn't attend, because they were short on cash to make the trip after Alicia was cut from the Department of Veterans Affairs' caregiver program last December because Matt had not ""consistently engaged in treatment,"" according to a letter from the VA. Alicia had been Matt's official caregiver for most of eight years.

""It felt like a stab in the back, like what I do is not worth it in their opinion, like I'm not part of their team like I thought I was,"" she says.

Uneven standards and implementation

The VA program provides support and a stipend to caregivers for post-Sept. 11 veterans, usually a wife or parent. It got going in 2011 and was instantly popular among vets as recognition of the billions of dollars worth of labor performed by family members for disabled veterans through the decades. The program was prepared for only a small number of applications and was overwhelmed by the tens of thousands of veterans who applied.

Almost from the start, that meant problems with uneven standards and implementation around the United States. NPR has reported on hundreds of caregivers being arbitrarily cut from the program; so has the Government Accountability Office and the VA's inspector general. Twice in two years, the VA has frozen the process of discharging people from the caregiver program, most recently last Dec. 20.

""It is essential that we get this right,"" VA Secretary Robert Wilkie said at the time. ""This affects one of our most vulnerable veteran populations, and we need to make sure we have consistency on how we process and evaluate benefit applications across VA.""

Unfortunately for Matt and Alicia, that freeze came six days after a letter from the VA in Fayetteville, N.C., on Dec. 14.

""I got a letter saying that I was out of the program because the veteran hasn't shown any progress since 2011,"" said Alicia. ""I asked them, 'What do you mean by progress?' ""

That question is at the heart of a fundamental problem with the way the VA caregiver program was created. Originally it was intended as a temporary intervention.

""Well, amputations and paralysis are permanent conditions,"" says Sherman Gillums, a former Marine who is paraplegic. ""It's not about recovery. It's about sustaining your life. Even if they're cut off from the program, they're still needing that care.""

Gillums is with the group AMVETS, but he's also on the VA's caregiver advisory committee. He's concerned that the VA needs to change the ""recovery based"" model now, before a planned expansion to older vets that could double or even triple the number of caregivers enrolled. And he says the program should be permanent for catastrophically injured vets such as Matt.

""No significant improvement""

Not that Matt's case is without its complications. Besides his missing limbs, Matt has PTSD and brain injuries.

""Not just the physical but the mental disabilities too — that is very challenging. It's every day. It's a constant change,"" says Alicia.

She says that's why the VA's assessment that Matt hasn't improved hurt. He's doing better now than he has in years. He has struggled in the past with drug abuse and even ended up homeless. He has been abusive to his wife and others, sometimes physically.

""He has progress daily,"" says Alicia. ""But sometimes he has bad days or weeks. ... Life is like that.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Eve Edelheit for NPR Eve Edelheit for NPR

The Fayetteville VA told the couple in the Dec. 14 letter that ""there has been no significant improvement"" since Matt entered the program in 2011 and that he ""has not consistently engaged in treatment.""

In response to a query from NPR, the Fayetteville VA said that for Matt, the program ""was no longer in his best interest. He refused to follow his care plan, seriously endangering his health and that of those around him.""

The VA was alluding to his abusive behavior in the past. But Alicia says she has stuck with him through that.

""I'm not leaving. I'm still with him, and I'm still gonna do what I do,"" she says. ""I still have to help him. I still have to drive him. I still have to take him to appointments. I'm still gonna do this if you pay me or not.""

The VA also reached out to the couple and encouraged them to follow the VA's care plan and then reapply for the caregiver program in six months. They say they will, but Matt says he's still stung by the assessment that he hasn't made progress since 2011.

""All three of my limbs are still amputated, as they were June, 10 June 2007. Those have not grown back,"" says Matt. ""I wouldn't change anything for the world. I'm not complaining. I don't get hung up on injuries, but what they exactly expect from us triple amputees, single amputees, paras ... I don't, I can't really comprehend that."""

State Department foreign service officer resigns in blistering criticism of Trump,https://www.cnn.com,['Jennifer Hansler'],08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/08/politics/fso-resigns-washington-post-op-ed/index.html,"(CNN) A foreign service officer resigned from the State Department effective Thursday, writing in a blistering op-ed in The Washington Post that he could no longer serve in ""The Complacent State,"" particularly in the wake of the El Paso mass shooting.

Chuck Park wrote in the op-ed that during his almost 10 years in the foreign service he ""worked to spread what (he) believed were American values: freedom, fairness and tolerance.""

""But more and more I found myself in a defensive stance, struggling to explain to foreign peoples the blatant contradictions at home,"" he wrote.

Park said that after the election of President Donald Trump, he had remained ""complacent"" and had ""let career perks silence (his) conscience.""

""I let free housing, the countdown to a pension and the prestige of representing a powerful nation overseas distract me from ideals that once seemed so clear to me. I can't do that anymore,"" Park wrote.

""My son, born in El Paso on the American side of that same Rio Grande where the bodies of Óscar Alberto Martínez Ramírez and his daughter were discovered, in the same city where 22 people were just killed by a gunman whose purported 'manifesto' echoed the inflammatory language of our President, turned 7 this month. I can no longer justify to him, or to myself, my complicity in the actions of this administration. That's why I choose to resign,"" he said.

In an email to CNN, Park clarified that he made the decision to resign before the El Paso shooting, ""though it certainly reaffirmed it.""

Writing in the Post, Park noted that he has not seen an ""organized resistance from within"" to the Trump presidency, but rather ""The Complacent State.""

""Among my colleagues at the State Department, I have met neither the unsung hero nor the cunning villain of Deep State lore,"" he wrote.

""One thing I agree with the conspiracy theorists about: The Deep State, if it did exist, would be wrong,"" he said, noting that foreign service officers pledge to serve at the pleasure of the President -- or else they should quit.

Park told CNN that the reception to the piece has been ""almost uniformly positive"" with ""some mea culpas from personal friends still in the service; some offers of support as I transition to whatever is next.""

Asked why he chose to highlight his resignation in such a public way, Park said, ""I meant the piece more as allocution than a call to action or challenge to people in a similar situation, though most have read it as the latter.""

""Though we are keeping the metaphorical lights on, we are not the heroes that some make us out to be. The real 'resistance' must come from American voters in 2020,"" he said.

Park's cutting public rebuke is the latest by a former diplomat of the sitting President.

John Feeley, the former US ambassador to Panama, retired in March 2018. He wrote in The Washington Post that he made his decision shortly after the deadly rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, noting ""The President's failure to condemn the white supremacists and neo-Nazis who provoked the violence made me realize that my values were not his values.""

""I resigned because the traditional core values of the United States, as manifested in the President's National Security Strategy and his foreign policies, have been warped and betrayed. I could no longer represent him personally and remain faithful to my beliefs about what makes America truly great,"" Feeley wrote.

Roberta Jacobson, who resigned as US ambassador to Mexico in May 2018, told NPR shortly after that Trump's ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policies were ""draconian and frankly un-American.""

She said ""part of the impetus"" for her departure ""was the increasing difficulty I had in trying to defend some of these policies and in trying to work with a Mexican government that was quite keen to work with us, only to see that sort of blown up periodically by tweets or rallies about the wall or about, you know, characterizing Mexicans, which was not what I experienced.""

Jacobson also penned a New York Times op-ed later that year detailing the ""disorder"" of working under the Trump administration and warning of deteriorating trust between Mexico and the US.

James Melville stepped down as US ambassador to Estonia in 2018 because he ""could no longer support President Trump's policies and rhetoric regarding NATO, our European allies and Russia."""
EPA Won’t Approve Labels That Say Roundup Chemical Causes Cancer,https://www.usnews.com,[],08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2019-08-08/epa-wont-approve-labels-that-say-roundup-weed-killer-chemical-glyphosate-causes-cancer,"Product labels that link glyphosate, the main active ingredient in the herbicide Roundup, to cancer will not be approved by the EPA, the agency announced Thursday. The Associated Press

The Environmental Protection Agency announced Thursday that it will not approve labels on products containing glyphosate that link the chemical to cancer.

The move is directed at California. In 2017, the state declared the chemical, which is the main active ingredient in the weed killer Roundup, a carcinogen. Roundup producer Monsanto challenged the ruling in federal court, and a judge has temporarily blocked the state from requiring the labels as the lawsuit continues.

Dated Aug. 7, the new guidance from EPA to companies registered to sell the chemical says that California's labels would ""constitute a false and misleading statement"" and that the agency will no longer approve labels that contain the state's warning.

""We will not allow California's flawed program to dictate federal policy,"" EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a statement.

The agency said the move is based on its own findings that show that glyphosate does not pose a public risk when used as directed.

But the World Health Organization's cancer agency previously determined that glyphosate is likely to cause cancer, prompting California to list the chemical in Proposition 65 , its right-to-know law that provides residents with warnings about cancer-causing chemicals.

The EPA's announcement is a win for Monsanto and its parent company, Bayer AG, which have found a haven in the agency but not in the courts."
Hundreds of USDA employees to be removed from their jobs in September,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Ben Guarino', 'Reporter Covering The Practice', 'Culture Of Science', 'Ben Guarino Is A Reporter For The Washington Post S Science Section.

The Agriculture Department is preparing to issue hundreds of termination letters to employees who have not agreed to move from the District of Columbia to Kansas City. The notices, arriving sooner than some workers and their supporters expected, will accelerate a controversial relocation process that has already stripped two USDA agencies of key research staff.

Last summer, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced he would relocate the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which manages a $1.7 billion portfolio of scientific grants, and the Economic Research Service, an influential federal statistical agency. The agencies rent office space in Southwest Washington near the waterfront.

In June 2019, Perdue declared the Kansas City region as the site of the new offices. USDA’s cost-benefit analysis suggests the move will save taxpayers $300 million over 15 years. The department has not said whether the employees will work in Kansas or Missouri; instead, it has set aside temporary office space for staff in its Beacon Complex in Missouri.

On June 13, USDA sent reassignment letters giving workers until 11:59 p.m. on July 15 to respond. Those who declined or who did not respond would lose their jobs, the letter warned.

The American Federation of Government Employees Local 3403, the union that represents the agencies, requested an extension for the deadline. Given the 900-mile distance from Washington to Kansas City and the uncertainty around which state to move to, the union considered 30 days insufficient time for employees to make a commitment.

In a phone call with Sen. Christopher Van Hollen (D-Md.) on July 14, Perdue told the senator the deadline would be extended until Sept. 30, according to the senator’s description of the call.

Two days later, Van Hollen and 18 other Democratic members of Congress wrote a letter to Perdue to confirm the Sept. 30 deadline. Also that day, USDA announced that 250 USDA employees, two-thirds of those reassigned, declined to relocate and would lose their jobs.

Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney recently praised the USDA attrition as a way to “drain the swamp.”

On July 17, Rep. Jennifer Wexton (D-Va.) wrote a letter to Perdue asking why he had not yet responded to the extension request. “We have heard from numerous federal workers who have requested personal extensions to this July 15 deadline, yet none has been approved,” Wexton wrote. “One such extension request would allow a current employee undergoing chemotherapy to continue their treatment with their trusted team of physicians.”

In a letter to Van Hollen in late July, the secretary said the July 15 deadline was final but that the department would evaluate employee extensions on a case-by-case basis.

Perdue never replied to Wexton’s letter, the congresswoman said in a statement to The Post on Wednesday. The department also “failed to respond to the employees who made requests for extension — yet they are able to issue termination letters to hundreds of dedicated public servants,” she added. On Tuesday, USDA notified the union that employees would soon begin receiving the termination letters.

A draft termination letter obtained by The Washington Post, whose authenticity was confirmed by two USDA employees and Wexton’s office, states that employees will be fired Sept. 27.

USDA did not respond to questions from The Post. The department provided a statement: “While USDA did not extend the notification deadline of July 15, we have continuously maintained that employees have until the report date to amend their decision which may include changing from a no to a yes. We are actively working with employees so they can make the decision in a timely manner to ensure they are able to take advantage of all available resources. The mandatory report date for relocating employees in Kansas City is Sept. 30, 2019.”

An investigation by the USDA’s Office of Inspector General, published Monday, determined that money already spent on the relocation violated the 2018 spending bill, because USDA did not acquire congressional approval.

USDA’s general counsel argued that the requirement for congressional approval was unconstitutional. In a letter to employees on Wednesday, Scott Hutchins, the USDA deputy undersecretary for research, education and economics, said the department attorney’s opinion is binding.

“No one should be concerned about being accused of, or punished, for violating the Antideficiency Act when they incur and submit requests for reimbursement for relocation costs,” Hutchins wrote. Some USDA employees, he said, have already arrived in Kansas City.

Wexton called for the relocation to be halted immediately. “Secretary Perdue is ignoring his own inspector general, he is ignoring Congress,” she said, “and he is ignoring many of the farmers he supposedly serves.”

All Eyes on the Aug. 12 USDA Reports,https://www.agweb.com,[],,,,https://www.agweb.com/article/all-eyes-aug-12-usda-reports,"The countdown is on. On Monday, Aug. 12, USDA will release its monthly Crop Production and World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE). This year’s August reports will include more information than ever before, including the resurvey announced in June, satellite data and, for the first time ever, FSA acreage certification information.

This report has the potential to be a market mover and hold several surprises, market analysts say.

“There is no question that the upcoming reports are critical as they should technically set the baseline for production that should have been set six weeks ago, and as such, holds the potential to generate quite a bit of excitement either higher or lower next week,” says Dan Hueber, general manager of The Hueber Report.

Hueber has one big prediction for Monday: “We will experience 30 seconds to a minute of market insanity when the figures are released.”

“Of course, there is a lot of talk about this report,” says Joe Vaclavik, founder and president of Standard Grain. “A lot of people think the USDA will provide us with more clarity in regard to the production situation for corn and soybeans.”

Vaclavik says USDA should provide some certainty around the acreage situation, based on the extensive resurvey it did in July. But yields remain a huge question market.

“I think will continue to be debated through harvest,” he adds. “In any year, it is difficult to predict yields in August. This year, the crop is very late, and maturity is lagging, along with enormous variability.”

Heading into the report, analysts expect a decline in planted and harvested corn acres and a rise in soybean acres, reports Kevin McNew, chief economist at Farmer's Business Network. That’s based on the Reuters pre-survey poll of analysts.

For corn, the average estimate for planted acres is 88 million acres. That’s 3.1 million acres lower than the July WASDE. Harvested acres are pegged at 80 million acres, which is 3.4 million acres lower than the July estimates.

Corn yields are predicted to be 164.9 bu. per acre, which is down 1.1 bu. from July.

For soybeans, the average estimate for planted acres is 81 million acres, which is up 1 million acres from the July WASDE. Harvested acres are predicted to be 79.9 million acres, which is up around 0.6 million acres form July.

Soybean yields are predicted to be 47.6 bu. per acre, which is down 0.9 bu. from July.

“At FBN, we believe that the range of estimates for corn planted, harvested acres and the yield number was large,” McNew adds. “We believe that given the range of estimates for 2019/20 corn production the August WASDE can contain surprises. For soybeans the range of production related estimates was much narrower suggesting that a general directional consensus on the direction of the 2019/20 crop.”

Majority of employees report 'hostile work environment' created by St. Pete housing agency CEO,https://www.tampabay.com,"[""Christopher O'Donnell""]",08-09-2019,2019,8,https://www.tampabay.com/breaking-news/majority-of-employees-report-hostile-work-environment-created-by-st-pete-housing-agency-ceo-20190809/,"ST. PETERSBURG — The St. Petersburg Housing Authority is hiring an outside investigator to look into employee reports of a hostile work environment ""orchestrated"" by agency CEO Tony Love.

The complaints from a majority of staffers at every level emerged during a review of the troubled agency conducted by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Even though the review is ongoing, HUD officials felt it necessary to warn the Housing Authority's governing board that the treatment of staffers is putting the agency at significant legal risk.

""A topic that was consistent from the majority of the staff at every level was 'hostile work environment,' "" Elis Wilson-Henri, HUD public housing regional director for the southeast, wrote in an email to Housing Authority board members.

He has ordered the board to respond with a proposed plan to investigate and deal with the allegations.

Board Chairwoman Stephanie Owens said the housing authority has contracted with law firm Saxon Gilmore to hire an outside investigator. Its senior partner, Ricardo Gilmore, already serves as special counsel to several housing authorities, including Tampa's.

""We’re very concerned,"" Owens said. ""We take those types of allegations very seriously and recognize the importance of taking immediate action and that’s what we’ve done.""

The investigation could be another setback for Love, who has faced criticism after a series of missteps including charging a board member for public records and a Tampa Bay Times investigation that revealed he lived rent-free for nine months in an apartment designated for low-income families.

It also may detract from his recent success in winning coveted tax credits from the state to help refinance the redevelopment of Jordan Park. The credits were awarded last week by the Florida Housing Finance Corp. They can be sold to companies to raise funds for the public housing project's redevelopment.

Housing Authority spokesman Michelle Ligon said neither Love nor the agency would comment until the HUD review is complete.

Complaints about Love's management style, particularly of female employees, has emerged as a problem before.

In 2016, at least two senior staff complained about his treatment of women in anonymous questionnaires they were asked to fill out as part of Love's first evaluation as CEO.

That prompted board members to insist that Love work with Massachusetts housing consultant Leo Dauwer on his people skills, for which Dauwer's firm was paid $3,600.

In a five-hour meeting with the consultant, Love acknowledged he “screamed’’ at staffers and on one occasion made them do non-agency work for him.

But complaints have continued this year. In February, one was filed with human resources by Robin Adams, the authority's asset management officer. She reported needing counseling to deal with the “extreme stress” and anxiety caused by Love, who is paid $157,000 annually to run the agency.

“Mr. Love has consistently verbally abused, harassed and degraded me and other senior staff members, especially female staff members, through one-way interrogations, baseless chastising, insults and bullying,” she wrote. Some six months after the complaint was filed, it was still pending.

HUD decided to conduct a review of the Housing Authority after it used agency funds to sue Mayor Rick Kriseman and the City of St. Petersburg when council members voted to remove three board members for lax oversight. The board members removed from office were staunch allies of Love.

The agency's lawsuit argued that charges of misconduct and neglect of duty cited to justify removal were a ""pretext"" so Kriseman can appoint commissioners who will fire Love.

A judge dismissed the lawsuit, leaving the Housing Authority with at least $27,000 in legal fees.

Wilson-Henri, the HUD official, also told board members in his email that its review has raised some concerns about the Housing Authority's spending. It did not provide any examples.

Still, board members voted at a special meeting earlier this week to lower the threshold for agency spending without prior board approval from $150,000 to $20,000.

""This gives the board closer and more tight checks and balances,"" Owens said.

EPA reauthorizes use of ‘cyanide bombs’ to kill wild animals,https://kfor.com,['Cnn Wire'],08-10-2019,2019,8,https://kfor.com/2019/08/10/epa-reauthorizes-use-of-cyanide-bombs-to-kill-wild-animals/,"× EPA reauthorizes use of ‘cyanide bombs’ to kill wild animals

(CNN) — The US Environmental Protection Agency has begun reauthorizing “cyanide bombs” used as chemical traps to kill predatory animals, despite backlash from environmental groups.

The EPA released its Interim Registration Review Decision from June, announcing that it is moving forward with the reauthorization of M-44s, chemical traps filled with sodium cyanide.

The EPA received over 20,000 letters about the move, it says, but the vast majority did not support the continued registration of the devices.

The devices are used to protect livestock and protected species from predators like coyotes, foxes, and feral dogs. But critics argue that they can harm people and non-predatory animals that may stumble upon them.

That’s what happened in 2017 when a cyanide trap laid by the US Department of Agriculture killed a 14-year-old’s dog in Idaho.

And although the traps are supposed to help protect at-risk species, another USDA cyanide trap killed a wolf in Oregon that had just been taken off the Endangered Species List two years earlier.

“Cyanide traps can’t be used safely by anyone, anywhere,” said Collette Adkins, carnivore conservation director at the nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity, in a statement.

The EPA included some restrictions in its review, such as requiring that all occupants within a half-mile radius be notified of the device’s placement and that they be kept at least 50 feet from public roads or pathways.

But critics say those restrictions aren’t enough.

“While it is encouraging that the EPA is taking at least some minimal action to protect the public from deadly M-44s, updating a few use restrictions — nearly impossible to enforce and commonly ignored — fails to meaningfully address the problem,” Kelly Nokes, a wildlife attorney, said in the Center for Biological Diversity’s statement. “EPA is blatantly ignoring its fundamental duty to protect the public, our pets, and native wildlife from the cruel, lethal impacts of cyanide bombs lurking on our public lands.”

Oregon outlawed M-44 devices and all others that disperse sodium cyanide this year."
MGM Files Lawsuit Against U.S. Department Of Interior Over Third Connecticut Casino,https://www.cardplayer.com,[],,,,https://www.cardplayer.com/poker-news/24171-mgm-files-lawsuit-against-u-s-department-of-interior-over-third-connecticut-casino,"MGM Resorts doesn’t want the two Connecticut Indian Tribes to build a third casino in the state and they are suing the federal government to keep it from happening.

The casino giant filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the U.S. Department of Interior for granting Connecticut’s two tribes approval to build a third casino in East Windsor, just outside of Hartford, and 13 miles south of MGM’s latest casino in Springfield, Mass.

Last March, the DOI approved plans for a joint venture between the Mashantucket Pequot tribe and the Mohegan tribe to build Tribal Winds Casino in East Windsor. Just a couple weeks ago, lawmakers in the state drafted legislation that would allow the two tribes to build a casino in Bridgeport, a city in which MGM had interest in building a casino of their own.

Regardless of which city they try to break ground in, MGM is going to use legal channels to stop it from happening.

According to the Middletown Press, MGM decided to file their lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Washington D.C. instead of making it a constitutional case in the state of Connecticut. The company is arguing that the DOI made an error in the way it approved changes to the pacts between Connecticut and its tribes.

Attorneys for MGM claim that the DOI ‘was only authorized to approve amendments related to casinos on tribal lands or on parcels that are considered in a “land-in-trust,” per the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. The land in East Windsor and in Bridgeport do not fit those requirements.

“The amendments thus confer a statewide, perpetual competitive advantage to the joint venture, MMCT,” The MGM lawsuit states. MMCT is the company name of the tribes’ joint venture.

The proposed legislation that would allow a Bridgeport casino would also allow the tribes to operate sports betting both online and in-person, a market that MGM would certainly like to have access to.

The DOI issued a statement saying that it will not comment on the lawsuit while it is ongoing.

Regardless of the outcome, the lawsuit will likely leave Connecticut as a two-casino state for the foreseeable future as this is likely going to take years to play out in the courtroom."
"Kevin McAleenan prepared to resign in June, felt undermined by subordinates",https://www.cnn.com,"['Geneva Sands', 'Priscilla Alvarez', 'Pamela Brown', 'Jeremy Diamond']",08-08-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/08/politics/mcaleenan-immigration-hardliners-white-house/index.html,"Washington (CNN) On Friday, June 21, acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan went to the White House prepared to resign.

Days earlier, President Donald Trump had issued a vague threat to deport ""millions"" of undocumented immigrants, providing few details of the effort and surprising officials within his own administration. McAleenan was concerned that the operation was half-baked and too far-reaching in scope. And he felt undermined by subordinate immigration hardliners who had a direct line to the President over the issue that Trump cares most about, two sources familiar with the matter said.

Then-acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Mark Morgan had begun hyping an upcoming operation targeting undocumented migrant families for deportation and was speaking directly with the President about it, according to a source familiar with the situation.

Arriving at the White House, McAleenan met with the acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and his deputy Emma Doyle, to make his case. The raids, he said, would anger Democrats and jeopardize the administration's request for emergency funding for the border; they should be conducted in phases rather than all at once; and he argued the department needed more time to build out the proper messaging, said a former senior administration official.

On June 22, Trump suspended the operation, citing objections from Democratic lawmakers. But it's not clear Democratic objections drove his decision and sources said Trump's decision to postpone the operation allayed McAleenan's concerns that his advice as the DHS chief was not being heeded. And, days later, Congress passed the $4.5 billion emergency border funding bill that McAleenan thought the ICE raids could undermine.

Immigration hardliners accused McAleenan, without direct evidence, of leaking details of the ICE operation, charges he has denied. The operation targeting 2,000 families ordered removed by an immigration judge eventually took place a month later, but fell short of its goal -- resulting in the arrest of 35 migrants

The episode put into view the tensions within the Department of Homeland Security and the rocky relationship between McAleenan and the White House. McAleenan, who has been increasingly surrounded by Trump loyalists and immigration hardliners, has at times been frustrated that some officials go around him, as he has grappled for control of the department, multiple administration officials tell CNN.

McAleenan took over in April after Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was pushed out of her role at the urging of White House senior adviser and immigration hardliner Stephen Miller. McAleenan, who was commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, had the backing of the President's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner.

But while Trump elevated McAleenan, he still sees the acting secretary -- a career official who served under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama -- as having an allegiance to the previous administration.

In a meeting with congressional Democrats about the government shutdown earlier this year, the President referred to McAleenan, then at CBP, as an ""Obama guy,"" Axios first reported in April.

McAleenan served under the former president, eventually rising through the ranks to the highest-ranking career position at Customs and Border Protection.

The President often still makes comments that McAleenan should go talk to Democrats since he knows how to deal with them, according to a source.

The relationship, however, runs hot and cold based on the numbers of migrants crossing the border and headlines the President doesn't like, sources tell CNN.

Deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley praised McAleenan in a statement after this story published.

""In just a short time at the helm of DHS, Acting Secretary McAleenan has already substantially reduced illegal border-crossings, greatly expanded regional burden sharing, advanced vitally-important regulations, and significantly boosted the rapid removal and return of illegal aliens -- despite relentless obstruction from activist far-left judges and belligerently open-borders Democrat Lawmakers,"" Gidley said in a statement.

Four months into the role, McAleenan has had to navigate a migration crisis at the southern border and a White House that has shunned the traditional policy processes, all while leading the third largest federal department in the wake of a purge that left DHS and many of its component agencies without permanent leadership.

""It's arguably the most politically-charged job in government right now,"" said a senior DHS official about the acting secretary role.

In recent months, the three main immigration components in DHS have had a change in leadership -- Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and US Citizenship and Immigration Services. The President's decision to swap out leadership appeared to be motivated by his desire to go in a ""tougher direction,"" as he once said, amid a swell of migrants arriving at the US-Mexico border.

Trump's personnel choices have, on occasion, have had ideological conflicts with McAleenan. In addition to Morgan, Ken Cuccinelli, an immigration hardliner and former Virginia state attorney general, took over as acting head of US Citizenship and Immigration Services in June.

The White House, led by Mulvaney, previously looked into replacing McAleenan with Cuccinelli, who's been a public face on television on the President's policies, as acting secretary. A senior administration official said that option is no longer being considered.

A White House official told CNN that the ""President expects the acting secretary to continue his work"" on ""many additional policy changes,"" regulations, and foreign cooperative agreements.

However, McAleenan isn't expected to be offered the permanent secretary position, according to sources.

""There's still some apprehension. Everyone is waiting for the other shoe to drop,"" said a DHS official about concerns over more leadership changes to come.

Trump told Fox News in June that McAleenan was ""doing a nice job,"" when asked about whether he will nominate him for the permanent secretary role.

""McAleenan, he is doing a very nice job. We're going to see. I've got to get used to him because it's a very important thing to me, the border. We need strong people at the border. And if people aren't strong, they're not going to do a good job.""

Despite the uncertainty that an acting role brings, multiple current and former DHS officials have praised McAleenan's depth of knowledge, operational experience and leadership.

""I think it's really hard being acting,"" said a former official. ""He is taking, if you will, taking the bull by the horns and spent his time doing the job.""

Trump focuses on numbers

US-Mexico border apprehension numbers are particularly important to Trump, who reviews the numbers at the beginning of each month and views them as a barometer of the situation along the southern border, according to administration officials.

Under his tenure as acting secretary, border apprehensions continued to soar to their highest level in a decade -- more than 130,000 -- before falling 20% in June and 24% in July , a drop that McAleenan attributes in part to a recent agreement with Mexico on immigration enforcement.

The numbers continue to go down for now, according to a source familiar with the trajectory, though they still exceed levels a year ago.

The White House has taken a retaliatory approach to immigration, rolling out policies that seek to discourage those who journey to the US-Mexico border. In March, the US announced it was cutting off aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, which the President accused of having ""set up"" migrant caravans for entry into the US.

McAleenan, who has been a proponent of regional investment in Central America, was not supportive of the move to freeze aid to the Northern Triangle, according to a former administration official.

During a visit to Guatemala at the end of May, McAleenan told CNN Trump was looking for investments that have a return on US interests, including the ability to address the causes of migration. The ""key measure"" of success is whether aid leads to a halt of migration to the US, he said.

""I think there's some very valid aid efforts that are ongoing but we got to assess them all carefully and make sure we're making the right investments,"" he said.

The architect at the core of the administration's immigration policies is White House senior adviser Miller, who had a hand in the purge within DHS earlier this year.

""I don't think anybody that works in the [immigration enforcement] space is eager to participate with him,"" said a former administration official, referring to Miller.

But McAleenan ""understands what Stephen's role is,"" the official added. Still, the two have clashed over Miller's attempts to make personnel changes within DHS, like placing Morgan into the role of acting CBP chief, according to a source familiar with the disagreement.

But McAleenan has forged a relationship with Kushner, the President's son-in-law, according to current and former administration officials, who released a proposal to reform the country's immigration system earlier this year.

During White House meetings, ""you could tell"" they had a ""close working relationship,"" said a former official.

A department roiled by turnover

Since assuming the acting secretary role, McAleenan has focused almost all of his public attention on immigration issues, while running a department that is also responsible for terrorism prevention, election security and natural disaster response. The acting secretary recently canceled a trip to London to travel to Guatemala to work on a new asylum deal that would return most migrants to Guatemala if they did not try to seek asylum there before journeying to the US.

At the end of July, Trump, standing behind McAleenan announced the asylum deal in the Oval Office.

The tension within the department's leadership ranks has become evident over time amid conflicting immigration views.

""The clash of those two views has caused a dysfunctional relationship within the leadership"" at the department, said the source, referring to diverging views on immigration enforcement. ""How do you repair the working relationships between the White House, and the [DHS] components? That seems ambitious, 'they are pretty frayed.'""

Morgan, who clashed with McAleenan over the raids, has since moved to Customs and Border Protection as acting commissioner, replacing John Sanders.

Sanders left the administration in part over concerns about the administration's rhetoric on ICE deportations, after the White House chose Morgan to serve at the acting commissioner, according to a source familiar with the personnel change.

McAleenan fought to keep Sanders at CBP, according to the source. With his departure McAleenan lost an ally at DHS.

""We've been surprised by the twists and turns in personnel,"" said a senior DHS official, who added that leadership appears to be in a ""decent place now."""
Senate Republican calls out Trump’s DOJ for not responding to his domestic terrorism questions,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/republican-senate-chairman-slams-trumps-doj-over-domestic-terrorism-non-response-b903f3de5f75/,"Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, is typically a loyal ally of President Donald Trump and his administration. But on Wednesday, he went on Fox News and scolded Trump’s Justice Department and FBI for failing to provide even basic information about a major domestic terrorism threat.

In early May, Johnson and the committee’s top Democrat — Sen. Gary Peters (D-MI) — authored bipartisan letters that were sent to Kevin McAleenan, the acting secretary of Homeland Security, Attorney General William Barr, and FBI Director Christopher Wray. These letters asked for information about domestic terrorism and how each is addressing it. DHS responded, but four months later, the Justice Department and the FBI — which operates within the DOJ — have not.

In a new letter on Monday, Johnson and Peters noted that there have been several domestic terrorism attacks since their first letter. “Since the date of our request, there have been numerous mass attacks, including Virginia Beach, VA; Gilroy, CA; El, Paso, TX; and Dayton, OH… These continued mass attacks make it clear that the federal government has more work to do in preventing domestic terrorism.”

On Tuesday, Johnson took the issue directly to the Trump administration — by raising it on Fox News.

“On May 8th, ranking member Sen. Peters and I sent a letter to the Department of Justice and the FBI, asking them how do they keep track of these domestic terrorist attacks? What kind of resources do they have and what are they devoting to different aspects of this? We got a response from DHS. We haven’t got a response from the FBI or attorney general,” he complained.

“Monday, we asked them to respond. I’m not sure you’ll ever have enough resources in terms of what people will be requesting. This is a serious issue, though. We expect answers out of the FBI director and the attorney general.”

In 2009, the Obama administration’s Department of Homeland Security produced a lengthy report on the risk of right-wing domestic terrorism. Congressional Republicans accused then-Secretary Janet Napolitano of insulting “American citizens who disagree with the direction Washington Democrats are taking our nation” and got the report removed from the DHS website.

In May, Trump was asked whether he saw white nationalism as a rising global threat. “I don’t really, ” he replied."
USDA’s August Reports Could Be Data Dump Rivaling January Reports,https://www.agweb.com,[],,,,https://www.agweb.com/article/usdas-august-reports-could-be-data-dump-rivaling-january-reports,"USDA is set to release several reports on Monday. Farmers, traders and report watchers will get a better look at USDA’s resurveyed acreage reports, yield, crop production and even a first look at Risk Management Agency’s (RMA) prevent plant acreage results.

“This is a data dump that probably rivals only the January crop report in scope and scale,” said Ed Prosser, vice president of Commodity Risk Management for Scoular.

Jarod Creed of JC Marketing Services said he’s most interested in getting a better idea of what final carryout could be.

“My personal opinion is that prevent plant conversations, the acreage conversations, the yield conversations—they're getting to be peak noise,” said Creed. “We know the demand piece but we have so many questions around the supply. So, if you start to hone in on a little bit better of an idea of what we actually have planted, you can obviously start using best-case and worst-case yield scenarios to hone in on what our production is and what our demand has to do to potentially ration demand or pick it back up.”

Prosser said he wants to see carryout ranges narrow to get a better idea of what type of supply load the market could face heading into 2020.

“I think there are a lot of credible people that are in mid 150s in corn yield, and I think there are some credible people that want to be in the high 160s [for yield],” said Prosser. “We're going to start to narrow that. For right now, I think what we can hope for is that we're somewhere within plus or minus half a billion [bushels on carryout range] when we get done on Monday.”

George Soros's secret 2016 access to State exposes 'big money' hypocrisy of Democrats,https://thehill.com,[],08-07-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/456619-george-soross-secret-2016-access-to-state-exposes-big-money-hypocrisy-of-democrats,"Liberal mega-donor George Soros made some big bets during the last U.S. presidential election. One was that Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonIs the film 'The Hunt' a misfire or a direct hit in our left-right divide? Blaming Trump for 'trigger' words pours more fuel on the age of rage Trump lashes out at NYT reporter over Dayton, El Paso coverage MORE would win the presidency. Another was that he could reshape Ukraine’s government to his liking, and that his business empire might find fertile ground in that former Soviet state.

So when Donald Trump’s improbable march to the White House picked up steam in the spring of 2016, Team Soros marched to the top of the State Department to protect some of those investments, according to newly released department memos providing a rare glimpse into the Democratic donor’s extraordinary access to the Obama administration.

Then-Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland received repeated calls, emails and meeting requests from Soros, according to the memos obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the conservative group Citizens United.

On May 25, 2016, for example, Chris Canavan of the Soros Fund Management firm provided Nuland a written briefing under the heading “Russia sovereign bond issue.” At the time, Russian President Vladimir Putin Vladimir Vladimirovich PutinNATO's China problem GOP group targets McConnell over election security bills in new ad George Soros's secret 2016 access to State exposes 'big money' hypocrisy of Democrats MORE’s regime posed a threat to Soros’s vision for Ukraine.

“Toria, here is my take on Russia’s foray into the bond markets this week, based on the market chatter I’ve been able to pick up,” Canavan wrote in an email, released with heavy redactions hiding most of his advice to Nuland.

Canavan worked on the for-profit side of the Soros empire, and his cozy nickname relationship with the top State official responsible for Russia and Ukraine policy speaks volumes about the access Soros was afforded.

Six days later, the nonprofit side of the Soros empire rang the same doorbell. Soros and his top foundation official in Ukraine scored a hastily arranged call with Nuland to discuss European migration policy.

“Many thanks for sorting today’s call on such short notice — much appreciated,” a Soros official wrote Nuland’s aide. “During the call, Mr. Soros promised A/S Nuland he would send her his draft article on migration policy for the New York Review of Books.”

Few people in the world could command the attention of one of America’s busiest, most influential diplomats for a pre-publication read of a column. Soros apparently was one of those few.

A little over a week later, Soros's team reached out again to Nuland, this time seeking to discuss “EU visa liberalization for Ukraine and Georgia” after meeting in Brussels with a top European Union official. According to the emails to State, Soros’s team wanted the U.S. to intervene to get the EU to ease visa rules to help Ukraine, as that country pursued reforms advocated by Soros.

Nuland wrote back, alerting Soros’s top policy adviser on Eurasia, Jeff Goldstein, to a key piece of intelligence: One EU country “has changed its mind” and she was “happy to discuss this further.”

“We are working it. Not sure whether intervention by GS would help,” Nuland answered in response to Soros’s pressure.

Soros is arguably one of the largest, most influential donors of his generation, giving away as much as $1 billion a year to nonprofit and political causes and leaving an indelible imprint on policy positions of liberals worldwide. His reach and influence range from two dozen prosecutors he helped to elect in the United States, to fellows he helped train at the State Department, to global media institutions that he supports to the tune of $26 million annually.

His many admirers in America — including such financial beneficiaries as Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton, as well as many of the 2020 presidential candidates — all advocate to eliminate the corrupting influence of big political money and the access that big donors win inside government. Often, those liberals suggest it’s a Republican problem.

But the 2016 State memos offer a powerful irony: In many ways, Soros is emblematic of the very financial influence and access that liberals seek to eliminate.

People close to Soros told me in interviews that he often had contact with government officials during the Obama years, including a 2010 meeting with Clinton at State. But they acknowledged the flurry with Nuland in spring 2016 was unusual both for its frequency and its intensity.

They said the exchanges were driven by Soros’s concerns about Ukraine’s future, not politics or business.

“George Soros is the founder of an organization that gives away a billion dollars a year to promote democracy and human rights around the world. It is for that reason that people at the State Department speak to him, not because he is a political donor,” top Soros aide Michael Vachon told me.

But a close examination of internal Soros organization documents show a close alignment of his political, business and philanthropic interests, especially in 2016.

Federal election records show Soros was one of the top 10 donors to Clinton’s 2016 election effort, giving a whopping $10.6 million to her campaign and the super PACs supporting it.

And when Soros sought to build U.S. pressure on Ukraine policy in 2016, he turned to Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, as a prelude to Nuland.

“Both the migration crisis and Ukraine are part of his view of Europe as falling apart, and the U.S. as ultimately not doing enough to prevent the political disintegration of its most important ally,” Vachon wrote Podesta in a March 2016 email that U.S. officials say was hacked by Russia and published by WikiLeaks. That email sought a meeting with the Clinton campaign chairman.

Politics and policy intertwined.

Likewise, Soros set out a bold vision in an internal 2014 memo for his Open Society Foundation to help root out corruption in Ukraine and build a “civil society” after the Maidan Revolution ousted the country’s Russia-friendly president. It worked with U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) officials to leverage the so-called Kleptocracy Initiative to fight corruption. The initiative enabled DOJ to prosecute or seek asset forfeitures from foreigners suspected of corruption, even if the crimes didn’t technically occur on U.S. soil.

Such initiatives are noble in principle. But in Ukraine, some targets had political and business implications as well.

For example, one DOJ investigation in 2014 targeted Ukrainian oligarch Dmitri Firtash. He and Soros both have significant energy interests in Europe — and rival plans to rebuild Ukraine. After Firtash’s indictment, Soros’s business announced plans to invest $1 billion in Ukraine.

Since then, significant problems have arisen with the DOJ’s case, thwarting efforts to extradite Firtash to the U.S. for trial.

Arguably, philanthropy and business collided.

On another front, a Ukrainian nonprofit funded in part by Soros was a cheerleader for the discovery of documents in Ukraine during the 2016 election that showed then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort Paul John ManafortDOJ releases notes from official Bruce Ohr's Russia probe interviews George Soros's secret 2016 access to State exposes 'big money' hypocrisy of Democrats Judge dismisses one of two charges against former Obama White House counsel MORE received millions in payments from Ukraine’s Russia-friendly political machine. The revelations led to Manafort’s resignation and eventual prosecution.

This time, philanthropy and politics found common ground for the Clinton-backing Soros.

And when Ukraine’s general prosecutor sought to investigate one of the country's nonprofits partially funded by Soros during 2016, the State Department pressured Ukrainian officials to drop the case.

Politics, philanthropy and governance were all intertwined.

Whatever political persuasion you hold, Soros’s election-year contacts at State speak volumes about the fact that big-money access to those in power is a bipartisan phenomenon.

Syrian forces backed by the United States are struggling to contain ISIS following President Donald Trump's partial withdrawal of U.S. troops from the country, a Defense Department watchdog warned in a report released this week.

The report, produced by the department's office of inspector general, found that between April and June the so-called Islamic State consolidated its power in Iraq and mounted a resurgence in Syria.

Trump announced in December that the U.S. would soon reduce its fighting force in Syria, surprising allies and prompting the departure of then-Defense Secretary James Mattis.

""We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency,"" he wrote in a post on Twitter announcing the decision.

""I defeated 100% [of the] caliphate,"" Trump said during an interview with C-SPAN last month. ""That doesn't mean ISIS doesn't go running around bombing a store and doing what they do, because they're stone cold crazy, but we've done a great job.""

But the report, which largely summarizes the views of the U.S.-led military task force overseeing operations against ISIS, says that the group remains a threat in Iraq and Syria despite the loss of its final stronghold in Syria earlier this year.

The report says that ISIS retains between 14,000 and 18,000 members in Iraq and Syria, including about 3,000 foreign fighters. It also retains an extensive, global social media operation to recruit fighters.

In both countries, ISIS fighters carried out targeted assassinations, ambushes, suicide bombings in public places, and set fire to fields of crops, the report said.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

The insurgency did not carry out conventional attacks or attempt to take back territory, the report said, instead it sought to wreak havoc and decrease support for government institutions.

In Syria, it also began to reestablish ""illicit fundraising capabilities"" which the report likened to ""taxes"" on residents and businesses where it operates, the inspector general found. In Iraq, it was able to establish logistics nodes for coordinating attacks, bolstered by fighters who arrived from Syria following their final territorial defeat in March.

The group is strongest in Syria in the Dayr az Zawr province, parts of Raqqah province, and Homs province near Palmyra, the report said.

The report says the U.S. drawdown, completed in the spring, left American-backed Syrian forces ill-prepared to develop trust with local communities and develop human-based intelligence ""necessary to confront ISIS resurgent cells and insurgent capabilities in Syria.""

""Despite losing its territorial 'caliphate,' the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) solidified its insurgent capabilities in Iraq and was resurging in Syria this quarter,"" the report says.

In one massive camp in Syria, Al Hol, the absence of U.S. troops has left Syrian partners without the ability to provide more than minimal security, leading to the ""uncontested conditions to spread of ISIS ideology.""

""ISIS is likely exploiting the lack of security to enlist new members and re-engage members who have left the battlefield,"" the report says.

The withdrawal also limited the U.S. capacity to track the humanitarian situation at the camp, which is home to 70,000 people, two-thirds of which the International Committee of the Red Cross estimates are children.

The United Nations estimates that 11,000 residents of the camp are relatives of ISIS fighters, and the U.S. military estimates that as many as 45,000 are ISIS supporters.

In the coming months, the U.N. estimates that upward of 30,000 Iraqi residents at al Hol, primarily women and children, will return to Iraq.

Neither the Department of Defense nor the Department of State responded to a request for comment.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Wednesday that he had not read the report, The Wall Street Journal reported, but noted that the administration ""is incredibly mindful of the success we've had versus ISIS, and the challenge that it continues to present to the world."""
Maryland REAL ID Requirements Approved By Homeland Security,https://baltimore.cbslocal.com,[],08-08-2019,2019,8,https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2019/08/08/maryland-real-id-requirements-approved-by-homeland-security/,"



The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has given MDOT MVA the green light on its REAL ID requirements.

The Maryland Department of Transportation Motor Vehicle Administration officially has approval for its compliance with the federal REAL ID requirements, the agency recertified them on Wednesday- making Maryland the first state to achieve that designation.

The recertification affirms that Maryland has all documentation and security procedures in place that are required to make their REAL ID driver’s licenses and identification cards compliant with federal law.

Maryland became one of the first states in the nation to have it certified in 2011.

The REAL ID Act requires all states to recertify periodically. It was passed by Congress after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The law creates standards for secure driver’s licenses and identification cards nationwide.

RELATED COVERAGE:

By October 1, 2020, all Marylanders must have documents on file and be REAL ID-compliant to use a state-issued driver’s license or identification card to board an airplane or enter federal government facilities.

The documents required include a birth certificate or passport, proof of social security and two documents proving Maryland residence.

As of late June, more than half of Maryland drivers are compliant with the REAL ID requirements.

With millions still yet to obtain a REAL ID, the Maryland Department of Transportation Motor Vehicle Administration has extended branch hours and opened additional offices to handle the influx of customers."
