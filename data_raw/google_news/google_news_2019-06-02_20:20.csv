"Donald Trump says he never called Meghan Markle 'nasty,' calls comments about Duchess 'fake news'",https://www.foxnews.com,['Jessica Sager'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/donald-trump-twitter-meghan-markle-nasty-denial,"Donald Trump denied calling Meghan Markle ""nasty.""

Last week, it was reported that Duchess Meghan, 37, would skip out on events with President Trump during his state visit to the U.K., citing maternity leave following the birth of her and Prince Harry's son Archie Mountbatten-Windsor.

An interview she'd done previously while promoting ""Suits"" resurfaced at the time, in which she'd called Trump ""misogynistic ... and so vocal about it,"" adding, “I’m voting for Hillary Clinton, not because she is a woman, but because Trump has made it easy to see that you don’t really want that kind of world that he’s painting.”

She also said she may have moved to Canada permanently if he got elected.

In an interview with The Sun on Saturday, Trump reportedly said he was ""shocked"" by Duchess Meghan's past remarks.

“I didn’t know that. What can I say? I didn’t know that she was nasty,"" Trump reportedly told the outlet. When confronted with the fact that she wouldn't be seeing him during his state visit, he replied, “I didn’t know that. I hope she is OK.”

The former ""Apprentice"" host added that he believes the former actress will make “a very good” American princess, noting, “It is nice, and I am sure she will do excellently. She will be very good. I hope she does [succeed].”

On Sunday morning, however, the POTUS changed his tune.

""I never called Meghan Markle 'nasty,' he tweeted. ""Made up by the Fake News Media, and they caught cold! Will @CNN, @nytimes and others apologize? Doubt it!""

Trump State Visit to U.K. Faces Turbulence Amid Brexit Chaos,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Mark Landler', 'Maggie Haberman']",06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/02/world/europe/trump-uk-visit-may.html,"Supporters of Brexit have held up a trade deal as one of the prizes of a complete break with Europe. It would be controversial, however: Some experts say it would force Britain to lower its food and agricultural standards to let in American products, and hand over too much influence to American companies in Britain’s health system.

The White House did not reveal a detailed policy agenda for the visit, and some officials have questioned the utility of having Mr. Trump meet Mrs. May three days before she relinquishes power. That has put more focus on whether he would meet Mr. Farage or Mr. Johnson, something that is not on the formal schedule but that could happen during Mr. Trump’s ample downtime.

In his interview with The Sunday Times, Mr. Trump was unstinting in his praise for Mr. Farage. “He is a very smart person,” the president said. “They won’t bring him in. Think how well they would do if they did.”

For Mr. Trump, the triumph of Mr. Farage’s Brexit Party in recent elections for the European Parliament could be seen as an endorsement of the Briton’s brand of populism. But the political picture across Europe is murkier, with new parties on the left and right advancing, while the mainstream parties, including the Conservative and Labour parties in Britain, shrank.

For all the potential static in London, Mr. Trump’s meetings here might be the most congenial of his trip. On his layover in Ireland, the president will meet with Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, who has spoken out passionately against Brexit. And while in Normandy for the D-Day commemoration, Mr. Trump will meet with President Emmanuel Macron of France, with whom his once warm relationship has chilled.

“They still have a functioning relationship, even if the romance is gone,” Mr. Wright of the Brookings Institution said of the American and French leaders. “If there is anything substantive on the agenda, it will be Macron trying to dissuade Trump from moving from China to Europe with tariffs.”"
"Trump says Mexico is an 'abuser' of the US, amid tariff negotiations",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-mexico-is-an-abuser-of-the-us-amid-tariff-negotiations,"President Trump on Sunday called Mexico an “abuser” of the United States, and warned that if the country does not do more to “stop the invasion” of the Southern border, his newly-imposed tariffs on Mexican goods would force companies based in Mexico to be “brought back” into the U.S.

The president’s tweets come following his announcement on Thursday to impose a new 5 percent tariff on all Mexican imports — a tariff that would increase over time.

MEXICO DISPATCHES TEAM TO DC TO NEGOTIATE TARIFFS, AS TRUMP DEMANDS ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION REMEDY

“The problem is that Mexico is an ‘abuser’ of the United States, taking but never giving. It has been this way for decades. Either they stop the invasion of our Country by Drug Dealers, Cartels, Human Traffickers, Coyotes and Illegal Immigrants, which they can do very easily, or our many companies and jobs that have been foolishly allowed to move South of the Border, will be brought back into the United States through taxation (Tariffs),” Trump tweeted early Sunday.

“America has had enough!” he added.

Trump announced the new tariffs, which are slated to go into effect on June 10, on Thursday. The president said a new 5 percent tariff would be placed on all Mexican imports to pressure the country to do more to help crack down on the surge of migrants trying to cross the U.S. Southern border. Trump warned, though, that the tariff percentage would gradually increase up to 25 percent “until the illegal immigration problem is remedied.”

Fox News has learned that the tariffs, on all goods by land, sea, and air from Mexico, will hike up to 10 percent on July 1, 15 percent on August 1, 20 percent on September 1, and to 25 percent by October 1.

“Tariffs will permanently remain at the 25 percent level unless and until Mexico substantially stops the illegal flow of aliens coming through its territory,” the White House said in a statement this week.

MEXICAN PRESIDENT SAYS HE EXPECTS 'GOOD RESULTS' FROM TARIFF NEGOTIATIONS WITH US

But upon the announcement of the new tariffs, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador dispatched his foreign relations secretary to Washington on Friday, as the country scrambled to negotiate a solution with the U.S.

Over the weekend, though, Obrador said he expects “good results” from the upcoming talks in Washington and reportedly suggested he is open to reinforcing efforts to stem illegal immigration. Obrador said that Mexican officials plan to convey to the Trump administration what they have been doing to stop illegal immigration, and added that they are open to additional measures “without violating human rights.”

In a letter to Trump on Thursday following the announcements of the tariffs, Obrador said that “social problems are not solved with duties or coercive measures,” and added that the United States has a history of being a nation of immigrants.

“The Statue of Liberty is not an empty symbol,” he wrote in the letter.

But despite upcoming talks, White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, on ""Fox News Sunday,"" said the president's move to impose tariffs was one to show how serious he is about the situation at the border.

""I fully expect these tariffs to go on to at least the 5 percent level on June 10th the president is deadly serious about fixing the situation at the southern border,"" Mulvaney told Fox News' Chris Wallace Sunday.

Mulvaney also explained how tariffs against Mexico would benefit the U.S., citing the positive change in the economy following the administration slapping tariffs on Chinese goods.

""American consumers have gone to products that are made in the United States, for example, that don’t carry those tariffs, and we think the same thing will happen here and the American consumers will not pay for the burden of tariffs,"" Mulvaney said. ""American taxpayers are paying hundreds of billions of dollars for illegal immigrants. They’re paying hundreds of billions of dollars for the drugs that come across the southern border, so there’s already a cost associated with this that we are trying to get off of the backs of ordinary Americans.""

Meanwhile, on Sunday, the president blasted congressional Democrats, claiming they “are doing nothing” to address securing the border.

“The Democrats are doing nothing on the Border to address the Humanitarian and National Security Crisis! Could be fixed so easily if they would vote with Republicans to fix the loopholes!” he tweeted.

Trump added: “The Wall is under construction and moving along quickly, despite all of the Radical Liberal Democrat lawsuits. What are they thinking as our Country is invaded by so many people (illegals) and things (Drugs) that we do not want. Make America Great Again!”

The president’s tweets come as the border sees a historic number of migrants attempting to enter the U.S.

Last week, more than 1,000 illegal immigrants were apprehended by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents near the U.S.-Mexico border—the largest ever group of migrants ever apprehended at a single time, sources told Fox News.

The group of 1,036 illegal immigrants found in the El Paso sector included migrants from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, according to sources.

There were 58,474 families apprehended last month, according to CBP. In March, the agency said that there was an increase of nearly 106 percent over the same period last year.

A top Border Patrol official told lawmakers in April that authorities have apprehended more families illegally crossing the border between October 2018 and February of this year than during all of the 2018 fiscal year (Oct. 1, 2017-Sept. 30, 2018).

Many Democratic presidential candidates though have come out for it.

The disconnect may seem odd at first, but it makes a lot of sense when you consider who their audiences are.

Pelosi is interested in winning the 2020 general election. Democratic presidential candidates are more interested at this point in winning a Democratic primary.

The vast majority of Democratic primary voters (74%) think that Trump should be impeached and removed from office.

But it's not just that Democratic primary voters are for impeachment -- it's their intensity for it. Among Democratic primary voters, 66% are strongly for impeaching and removing Trump from office.

Of course, merely being for impeachment is not necessarily something that will give votes to Democratic candidates. Democrats are placing a historically high emphasis on electability in 2020. Given that a majority of voters are against impeachment, Democratic primary voters may be for impeachment, but also may view candidates who are for it as less electable.

It's almost certainly the case that Pelosi is feeling that way right now. She doesn't want to put House Democrats from more swing districts in electoral jeopardy by having them defend a leader who is for impeachment.

That may be something Democratic presidential candidates want to keep in mind."
Navy confirms request to keep USS John S. McCain out of sight during President Trump's visit,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Ledyard King', 'Published P.M.

McCain out of sight during his visit to Japan. AP, AP

WASHINGTON – The U.S, Navy acknowledged Saturday it had received a request to shield a U.S. warship bearing the name of former political rival John McCain from President Donald Trump's view during the commander-in-chief's visit to Japan last week – but did not comply.

“A request was made to the U.S. Navy to minimize the visibility of USS John S. McCain, however, all ships remained in their normal configuration during the President’s visit,"" according to a statement from Rear Adm. Charlie Brown, Chief of Navy Information, that the Pentagon released.

The one-paragraph statement did not mention who made the request and a Pentagon spokesperson did not respond to a request for further information.

In his statement, Brown also said there were ""no intentional efforts"" to exclude sailors on the McCain from attending the president's address on Memorial day aboard the USS Wasp at Yokosuka Naval Base, south of Tokyo. The McCain is docked there for repairs.

The Wall Street Journal was the first to report that White House officials wanted the guided-missile destroyer to be kept ""out of sight"" during Trump's visit to Japan, apparently fearful that the president would be upset at having to see the name of the late Arizona senator, a frequent target of the president's anger.

The ship was named after McCain's father and grandfather, both decorated admirals. The Navy added the name of Sen. McCain, a prisoner of war in Vietnam who emerged from captivity a war hero, to the ship in 2018, according to the Journal.

Trump on Thursday said he had no knowledge of the request to keep the ship from view, saying, ""I would never do a thing like that."" He described the aides that made the request as ""well meaning.""

'Tremendous disservice': President Donald Trump on the late Sen. John McCain: 'He did the nation a tremendous disservice'

Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan announced Thursday that he asked his chief of staff to investigate what was behind obscuring the name of the USS John McCain during President Donald Trump's visit to Japan.

""The Navy is fully cooperating with the review of this matter tasked by the Secretary of Defense,"" Brown said in the statement released by the Pentagon.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez bashed US foreign policy during a private meeting with Bronx community leaders, prompting two military veterans to storm out.

“She knocks the country, she knocks the president. And that’s not what America is about,” said Silvio Mazzella, a Vietnam War vet and treasurer of Community Board 11.

Anthony Vitaliano — an Army veteran who worked in the NYPD for 38 years, and commanded the Bronx’s homicide detectives — was sitting between Ocasio-Cortez and a staffer for the freshman Dem.

“She knocks the country, she knocks the president. And that’s not what America is about.” — Silvio Mazzella, Vietnam War vet

“I just couldn’t hear her BS anymore,” the former CB11 chairman said. “I just got up, got my umbrella in my hand and walked right out.”

“I just couldn’t hear her BS anymore. I just got up, got my umbrella in my hand and walked right out.” — Anthony Vitaliano, Army veteran who worked in the NYPD for 38 years

AOC held the closed-door meeting with about a dozen members of the board on Wednesday night, marking a rare visit to the Bronx part of her district.

One Middle Eastern board member raised the issue of the conflict in Yemen.

The progressive firebrand slammed the US policy of providing bombs to Saudi Arabia, which has supported Yemen’s government in a brutal civil war, according to attendees. Some blamed her for not including the roles of other nations in explaining the volatile region’s violence.

“Talking about America, that really turned me off completely,” said Mazzella, 74, who said he fought in Vietnam from 1966 to 1968.

When Israel came up later in the meeting, Ocasio-Cortez suggested President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are autocrats, according to a person at the meeting.

“I was revolted,” said the attendee, who didn’t want his name published.

He, Mazzella and Vitaliano said they all walked out in disgust before the end of the session.

Earlier, board members complained about problems with the US Postal Service, which regularly misses mail deliveries and a local Amtrak property that is a magnet for graffiti vandals. CB 11 is a working-class neighborhood on the eastern side of the Bronx covering Allerton, Morris Park, Pelham Gardens and Van Nest. In addition to parts of the Bronx, Ocasio-Cortez’s district includes north-central Queens.

“Did she care about the issues? She wrote them down,” said Vitaliano, 78. “The jury will be out on the local issues.”

She “danced around the whole” question of Columbus Day, for which the neighborhood holds a parade every year, said Vitaliano, who supports creating a day for indigenous people but wants to preserve the treasured Italian-American tradition.

The room wasn’t entirely hostile to AOC, though. One attendee said, “There were a lot of people that really adored what she was saying.”

AOC’s office denied that anyone stormed out of the meeting.

“The only person that left the meeting while it was underway was someone who had to go pick up their children,” said AOC spokesman Corbin Trent.

Asked about Trent’s comment, Vitaliano said, “That’s bulls–t. Everybody that was there knows I walked out.”"
State Department now requires U.S. visa applicants to share social media accounts,https://www.cbsnews.com,[],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/state-department-now-requires-us-visa-applicants-to-share-social-media-accounts-2019-06-01/,"The State Department is now requiring nearly all applicants for U.S. visas to submit their social media usernames, previous email addresses and phone numbers. It's a vast expansion of the Trump administration's enhanced screening of potential immigrants and visitors.

In a move that's just taken effect after approval of the revised application forms, the department says it has updated its immigrant and nonimmigrant visa forms to request the additional information, including ""social media identifiers,"" from almost all U.S. applicants.

The change, which was proposed in March 2018, is expected to affect about 15 million foreigners who apply for visas to enter the United States each year.

Social media, email and phone number histories had only been sought in the past from applicants who were identified for extra scrutiny, such as people who'd traveled to areas controlled by terrorist organizations. An estimated 65,000 applicants per year had fallen into that category.

The department says collecting the additional information from more applicants ""will strengthen our process for vetting these applicants and confirming their identity.""

The new rules apply to virtually all applicants for immigrant and nonimmigrant visas. The department estimated it would affect 710,000 immigrant visa applicants and 14 million nonimmigrant visa applicants, including those who want to come to the U.S. for business or education, according to an initial notice.

The new visa application forms list a number of social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube and require the applicant to provide any account names they may have had on them over the previous five years. They also give applicants the option to volunteer information about social media accounts on platforms not listed on the form.

In addition to their social media histories, visa applicants are now asked for five years of previously used telephone numbers, email addresses, international travel and deportation status, as well as whether any family members have been involved in terrorist activities.

Only applicants for certain diplomatic and official visa types are exempted from the requirements."
Jason Chaffetz: Lawbreaking FBI leaker must be prosecuted – Justice Department fails to do so,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Jason Chaffetz', 'Jason Chaffetz Is A Fox News Contributor Who Was The Chairman Of The U.S. House Oversight Committee When He Served As A Representative Utah. He Is The Author Of']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/jason-chaffetz-justice-department-leakers,"While the predictable news conference with Special Counsel Robert Mueller made headlines this week for repeating what we already knew, a bigger story from the Department of Justice broke that got far too little attention.

In a Wednesday report released by the Inspector General for the Department of Justice, we learned that the OIG was able to identify a former deputy assistant director at the FBI who violated the law by leaking sealed court documents to the media, engaging in repeated unauthorized contacts with journalists, and accepting a gift from the media.

BARR SAYS DOJ HAS 'MULTIPLE LEAK' PROBES UNDERWAY

We already knew leaking and unauthorized media contacts were a cultural and systemic problem at the FBI. A June 2018 OIG Report revealed the extent of the practice and provided a graphic illustration:

Although FBI policy strictly limits the employees who are authorized to speak to the media, we found that this policy appeared to be widely ignored during the period we reviewed. We identified numerous FBI employees, at all levels of the organization and with no official reason to be in contact with the media, who were nevertheless in frequent contact with reporters. The large number of FBI employees who were in contact with journalists during this time period impacted our ability to identify the sources of leaks.

But this week, we learned the OIG actually has identified one of the sources and suggested the allegations were supported by ""a preponderance of evidence."" Though that is certainly newsworthy, the real news was the Justice Department response. Officials mysteriously, though not surprisingly, declined to prosecute one of their own.

Creating new laws for theJustice Department to ignore does not solve the problem. But Congress can be part of the solution through the oversight function.

These are serious allegations against a very senior FBI official. How can the department not take action when there is direct evidence in hand? This is someone who deliberately and illegally disclosed sensitive information from sealed court filings. If the Justice Department looks the other way, what message does that send to the rest of the FBI? What better way to signal to the entire federal law enforcement apparatus that laws and rules are optional?

Unfortunately, we routinely have people at DOJ who put their thumb on the scale to impact politics. It's obviously part of the culture fostered by the two previous FBI directors, Robert Mueller and James Comey. They have both shown political animus and bias toward President Trump.

Comey himself released sealed information, likely for a political purposes. Mueller this week left no doubt of his own animus toward the president. No wonder the American people have lost faith in our federal law enforcement.

Not only is there no penalty for violating the law, there may actually be an incentive for doing so. For leakers with partisan motivations, the chance to impact an election may outweigh the risk of an unlikely prosecution.

If we want to instill confidence in the system, we need to be able to demonstrate that when somebody violates rules and laws within the FBI, they, too, will be prosecuted and held accountable.

There is little Congress can do legislatively. Leaking is already against the law. Creating new laws for the Justice Department to ignore does not solve the problem. But Congress can be part of the solution through the oversight function.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., should call on the Justice Department to answer to the American people for this failure to prosecute. Members of the Judiciary Committee in the House and Senate should question Inspector General Michael Horowitz about his findings and demand answers from the DOJ about the failure to prosecute. There may be no better way to get the answers the American people deserve.

Justice Department Is Reportedly Looking Into an Antitrust Investigation Into Google,https://gizmodo.com,"['Catie Keck', 'About The Author', 'Staff Reporter']",,,,https://gizmodo.com/justice-department-is-reportedly-looking-into-an-antitr-1835175063,"Photo: AP

The Justice Department may be preparing to launch an antitrust investigation into Google, according to reports.

The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that the department has been in talks with the Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust task force about launching a probe into the tech giant’s search and business operations. Following discussions over which should proceed with a new antitrust investigation—the FTC previously investigated Google but closed the case in 2013—the Journal said the two have agreed to the Justice Department leading any new probe into the company.

Separately, the New York Times also reported on the investigation, though the paper’s report hedged slightly by stating that the Justice Department was “exploring” a probe rather than preparing one. Citing sources familiar with the matter, the Times reported that the trade commission has recently directed complaints about the company to the Justice Department. According to the Journal, officials with the department have already spoken with some of these parties.

A spokesperson for Google did not immediately return a request for comment about the report. Neither the Justice Department nor the FTC returned comment requests.

According to the Times, the potential probe comes after the FTC’s antitrust task force began looking into Google’s ad and search practices. The task force, announced in February, was established to investigate possible anticompetitive conduct among tech companies. FTC Chairman Joe Simons said in a statement at the time that “it makes sense for us to closely examine technology markets to ensure consumers benefit from free and fair competition.”

“Our ongoing Hearings on Competition and Consumer Protection in the 21st Century are a crucial step to deepen our understanding of these markets and potential competitive issues. The Technology Task Force is the next step in that effort,” he added.

The reported probe would come as tech monopolies face increasingly louder condemnation from political critics who claim that they wield far too much power and engage in anticompetitive tactics by either gobbling up competitors or crushing their business. (The company has faced billions in fines from European regulators over antitrust abuses.) Chief among these critics in the U.S. is Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate who has called for breaking up Facebook, Google, and Amazon—tech giants she says have “too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy.”

“I want a government that makes sure everybody — even the biggest and most powerful companies in America — plays by the rules. And I want to make sure that the next generation of great American tech companies can flourish,” she said in March. “To do that, we need to stop this generation of big tech companies from throwing around their political power to shape the rules in their favor and throwing around their economic power to snuff out or buy up every potential competitor.”"
The EPA says a chemical in Monsanto's weed-killer doesn't cause cancer — but there's compelling evidence the agency is wrong,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Hilary Brueck'],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.businessinsider.com/glyphosate-cancer-dangers-roundup-epa-2019-5,"Gardeners Alva and Alberta Pilliod say they used Monsanto's Roundup spray to keep weeds off their driveway for more than two decades, applying the herbicide while wearing flip flops, shorts, and tank tops. Now, they both have Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL). In a lawsuit, they were awarded $2.05 billion in damages in May.

School groundskeeper Dewayne Johnson, now in his 40s, also used to spray Roundup up to 30 times every summer. He has the same blood cancer as the Pilliods, and won nearly $80 million in a suit last year.

A third man, Edwin Hardeman, used Roundup for more than 25 years to keep weeds off his oak trees. He got NHL, too. A jury in California ruled in March that Roundup was a ""substantial factor"" in his diagnosis.

More than 13,000 similar lawsuits have popped up in the US. Almost all are being filed by gardeners, groundskeepers, and other professional weed-whackers who allege that their consistent, repeated use of Roundup gave them cancer. One of the latest allegations came this week from 44-year-old groundskeeper Jeffrey Sabraski. Sabraski alleges he sprayed Roundup several times per week, wearing nothing but shorts and t-shirts, and has also developed NHL. He's suing Monsanto, as the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported on Wednesday.

Roundup is the most widely-used herbicide in the world, and its key chemical is called glyphosate. The plaintiffs in this recent surge of court cases say that Monsanto didn't sufficiently warn them about the potential health risks associated with the product or tell them how to protect themselves from exposure.

But teasing out the health risks of glyphosate isn't easy. The World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) says the chemical is ""probably"" carcinogenic to humans. But the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the agro-chemical giant Bayer, which now owns Monsanto, both say glyphosate isn't linked to cancer in any meaningful way.

""EPA continues to find that there are no risks to public health when glyphosate is used in accordance with its current label and that glyphosate is not a carcinogen,"" the agency said on its website. Canadian health authorities support the US' stance.

However, peeling back the curtain on the scientific studies that have looked at glyphosate thus far can tell us a lot about how the chemical can indeed be dangerous when people and animals are exposed to it in the wrong ways.

What Monsanto and the EPA say about glyphosate

Glyphosate, which has been in use around the world since the 1970s, blocks an enzyme pathway that helps plants grow. The herbicide's patent expired in 2000, and Indian and Chinese farmers are now the weed-killer's biggest buyers.

It's tricky for epidemiologists to say conclusively that something causes cancer, so what we know so far — from thousands of studies conducted in rats, mice, and humans — is that the pesticide might be linked with cancer, or it might not. Glyphosate might make cancer more likely to sprout up, since there's evidence it can encourage DNA damage. But more research is still needed to learn how, exactly, it affects the human body.

Monsanto maintains there's no good evidence the chemical causes cancer. The company often points to a 2017 study of more than 54,000 pesticide sprayers in Iowa and North Carolina (mostly farmers), which found no statistically significant association between glyphosate and cancer.

The company also often highlights the results of large-scale studies of French, Norwegian, and North American farmers that have found glyphosate to be safe.

But farmers are largely protected from the dangers of herbicides and pesticides, since they spray fields using industrial-grade farm equipment. In that same study, in fact, chemical sprayers who had the most exposure to glyphosate were found to have a slightly higher risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia than people who'd never used the weed-killer. The difference, however, was so small that more research is needed to confirm these results.

The EPA has also consistently said that consumers have nothing to worry about when it comes to glyphosate.

""In 2017, EPA published comprehensive ecological and human health risk assessments for glyphosate. No human health risks were identified,"" the agency said in April. However, the EPA cautioned that ""potential ecological risks were identified for terrestrial and aquatic plants, birds, and mammals, primarily from exposure to spray drift.""

Humans, of course, are terrestrial mammals, too. And gardeners who use lots of glyphosate — without much protection — would arguably also be exposed to spray drift.

""The evidence is not as strong so as to be absolutely sure"" Manolis Kogevinas, of the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, told Business Insider. ""But yeah, there's definitely a chance that they will develop cancer.""

The IARC has a different stance

In March 2015, the IARC convened a group of 17 experts from 11 countries to determine the potential human health dangers of glyphosate, along with four other pesticides and herbicides. The international, non-partisan committee concluded that glyphosate is ""probably"" carcinogenic to humans, based on studies in humans and lab animals.

That's why glyphosate is now a ""Group 2A"" carcinogen, according to IARC. That means that the chemical is considered to be a contributor to cancer, but not on the level of more well known cancer-causers like formaldehyde and UV radiation.

But the IARC also has a complicated history with glyphosate research. Reuters reported in 2017 that the agency had cut sections out of a draft report that suggested glyphosate might not contribute to cancer. In a follow-up letter to Congress, IARC director Christopher Wild wrote that the group revised that draft because some of the data came from ""a review article co-authored by a Monsanto scientist.""

He added that the information from that article ""was insufficient for independent evaluation of the individual studies and the conclusions reached by the Monsanto scientist.""

Why these groups came to different conclusions about glyphosate

A tightly reviewed and vetted paper published in the journal Environmental Sciences Europe earlier this year looked into why the EPA and IARC appear to disagree about the risks of glyphosate. It found that the EPA's conclusions relied mainly on ""unpublished regulatory studies,"" many of them industry-funded. The IARC, on the other hand, looked at ""mostly peer-reviewed studies.""

That could explain why 99% of the glyphosate studies that the EPA considered found that the chemical is not a cancer-causer, while 70% of the studies the WHO looked at suggested it probably is.

""It's kind of easy to understand why EPA would say, 'Well, geez, you know, it must be okay,'"" study author Charles Benbrook, an agricultural economist who now serves as an expert witness for plaintiffs involved in Roundup litigation, told Business Insider. ""It was okay because they were looking at a bunch of negative studies that Monsanto [did]. Monsanto repeated essentially the same study like 30 times.""

Benbrook alleges that the reason so many big payouts are being won in court is that Monsanto didn't properly warn people who used Roundup at home or on a small scale that they should wear protective clothing when they applied the weed-killer.

""It's not farmers out in the field with their large, modern spray rigs, where the operator is inside a steel and glass cab with a sophisticated air filtration system that essentially eliminates exposure,"" Benbrook said. ""Some people are spraying Roundup 6 or 8 hours a day for five days a week with this kind of handheld equipment.""

Monsanto maintains that as long as consumers follow the instructions on the label, glyphosate-based herbicides are perfectly safe. The company also points to hundreds of glyphosate studies in EPA databases that were not Monsanto-funded.

""At the end of the day, whether you're in the court of law, regulatory agencies, or court of public opinion, it's the science that should matter here,"" a Bayer spokesman said in an email to Business Insider. ""And the extensive body of science over 40 years, including several recent human epidemiology studies, shows that glyphosate-based herbicides are not associated with NHL. Customers who know these products best continue to rely on them.""

The company also points to the courtroom testimony of Robert Phalen, an environmental scientist who testified in the Pilliod's trial that human skin actually repels glyphosate. (Phalen once authored a textbook with another scientist also named Robert Phalen, who has said modern air may be ""a little too clean."")

Monsanto tweaked its Roundup formula in Europe

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that pets stay off lawns and plants that have just been sprayed with glyphosate, since animals can develop digestive or intestinal issues if they touch the substance when it hasn't dried. Glyphosate has also recently been linked to more severe cases of fatty liver disease in people.

But beyond glyphosate, there's another compound in Roundup: soap-like detergents called surfactants that help the chemical penetrate the leaves of plants to work its weed-killing magic. Benbrook believes Monsanto should be doing more to warn people about how surfactants work and how to protect themselves.

""It's the surfactants that are carrying the glyphosate first through the skin and inside the body, and then inside of cells where damage can be done to DNA,"" he said.

In Europe, Benbrook noted, surfactant chemicals have been made less toxic for consumers. In the US, however, there's been less regulatory pressure, so Monsanto has not changed Roundup formulas in the same way. ""When juries learn that Monsanto is making a product that's at least 10 times, maybe 100 times safer all across Europe?"" he said. ""That's not acceptable. That's one of the reasons that I think we can expect a continuation of these mammoth punitive damage awards that have occurred in the first three trials.""

Bayer said that allegation is one ""we don't believe is supported by the extensive body of science.""

The company told Business Insider in an email that ""regulators have specifically assessed the safety of the class of surfactants used in glyphosate-based herbicides; in 2009, the U.S. EPA concluded that these surfactants are not carcinogenic.""

The statement added that Monsanto tweaked the surfactants in products sold in Europe ""due to market preferences or country-specific requirements in the region.""

Traces of glyphosate in food don't seem to hurt people

As lawsuits about glyphosate have entered the spotlight, some people have expressed concerns about the trace amounts of the chemical in our food.

The traces of glyphosate found in a bowl of Cheerios or a glass of wine are probably not going to kill anyone, though.

""Using the internationally accepted limits, an average adult male would have to drink over 1,000 liters of wine a day to reach any level of risk,"" pharmacologist Ian Musgrave recently wrote in The Conversation.

That said, it's worth remembering that different people's bodies can react differently to chemicals. The foods pregnant women eat impact how their fetus grows and develops, for example, and the developing digestive systems of infants and toddlers may be more delicate than others. Scientists are still studying how pesticides can impact childhood brain development.

Kogevinas still doesn't think the chemical's presence in food is much to worry about, though.

""If you ask me, is the glyphosate the problem in my food? No, it is not,"" he said. But he noted that he prefers to buy organic produce to avoid pesticides more generally.

Kogevinas lives in Barcelona, where the Roundup formulations adhere to the European standards, but that didn't affect his decision about whether or not to buy it: He has opted never to use glyphosate in his own garden."

“The United States stands ready to work with @NayibBukele to advance prosperity in El Salvador and the hemisphere. Congratulations President Bukele on your inauguration!” Trump tweeted. Bukele retweeted the message shortly after.

The United States stands ready to work with @NayibBukele to advance prosperity in El Salvador and the hemisphere. Congratulations President Bukele on your inauguration! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 1, 2019

Bukele, a 37-year-old political outsider officially sworn into office Saturday, has vowed to prioritize bolstering El Salvador’s relationship with Washington, bolster education and social programs to curb gang violence in the country and, in a move likely to please the White House, veer away from the left-wing foreign policy alliances of his predecessor.

Trump has hammered El Salvador, as well as Guatemala and Honduras, for what he says is a failure to prevent Central American migrants from traveling north and entering the U.S. illegally. The president in March directed the State Department to halt aid to the so-called Northern Triangle countries.

“We were paying them tremendous amounts of money. And we're not paying them anymore. Because they haven't done a thing for us. They set up these caravans,” Trump told reporters in March.

Democrats slammed the move as counter-productive, saying that aid to those countries benefited the U.S.

“U.S. foreign assistance is not charity; it advances our strategic interests and funds initiatives that protect American citizens. This latest reported move shows the Administration still does not understand that the United States cuts foreign aid to Central America at our own peril,” Sen.

Immigration has emerged as an animating issue for both parties, with Republicans falling behind Trump’s hardline policies to curtail legal and illegal border crossings and Democrats saying any crisis is manufactured by the White House and that support to Latin America should not be reduced in retaliation."

McAleenan in the past has acknowledged a stronger economy could help a country like Mexico deal with the migration of people to the United States, but dodged questions Sunday about whether hurting Mexico's economy with the tariffs would be ineffective.

""We've got a situation we need to address in partnership with Mexico,"" McAlleenan said.

Trump on Thursday announced a 5 percent tariff beginning June 10 on all Mexican imports “until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico, and into our Country, STOP.”

The announcement came via Twitter, has has drawn ire from his own party.

Senate Finance Committee Chairmen Chuck Grassely (R-Iowa) said ""trade policy and border security are separate issues,"" and called the tariffs a misuse of presidential authority."

Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/schiff-calls-gop-the-cult-of-the-presidents-personality-hints-potential-impeachment-could-fail-without-their-support,"House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said that impeachment ""is destined for failure"" without Republican support, while blasting the party as “the cult of the president’s personality"" and stating that he is actually against ""putting the country"" through impeachment proceedings.

Schiff, on ABC News’ “This Week,” said that while he believes House Democrats could impeach the president, the move would likely fail, due to a lack of support from Republicans in the House and Senate.

NADLER: THERE 'CERTAINLY IS' JUSTIFICATION TO IMPEACH TRUMP

""I think we're going to do what is right for the country, and at this point, the speaker has not reached the conclusion, and I haven't either that it's the best for the country to put us through an impeachment proceeding that we know will, is, destined for failure in the Senate,"" Schiff said.

Schiff added that the president's ""conduct qualifies"" as ""high crimes and misdemeanors,"" but said: ""at the same time, we have to recognize that the reality — that one party, the Republican Party, has turned itself into the cult of the president’s personality and is not likely to act consistent with its constitutional obligations.""

Schiff added, however, that if Trump ""continues to stonewall"" Congress, and ""demonstrate his unfitness for office,"" congressional Democrats could move forward.

""There may be little additional cost to going through that process, even if unsuccessful in the Senate,"" Schiff said. ""But we're not there yet and I think if it is a close call, close calls go against putting the country through that.""

Schiff’s comments come as rank-and-file congressional Democrats have ramped up their calls for impeachment, following a rare public statement by Special Counsel Robert Mueller last week, who announced it was “not an option” for his team of prosecutors to charge the president with a crime due to longstanding Justice Department policy.

Mueller detailed the findings in his probe, maintaining that there was “not sufficient evidence to charge a conspiracy” with regard to whether members of the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russian government during the 2016 presidential election.

But Mueller did not mince words on his inquiry into whether the president obstructed justice.

“If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said that,” Mueller said. “We did not determine whether the president did commit a crime.”

Mueller explained the longstanding Justice Department policy, which states that a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime, and thus said “charging the president was not an option we could consider.”

Mueller added that “it would be unfair to accuse someone of a crime when there could be no court resolution of the charge.”

TRUMP BLASTS MUELLER AS 'HIGHLY CONFLICTED,' CALLS IMPEACHMENT A 'DIRTY, FILTHY, DISGUSTING WORD'

But Mueller said that while the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinion blocks a president from indictment while in office, “the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse the president of wrongdoing.”

Some on the left took that comment as a green light to ramp up talks about impeachment proceedings against the president.

Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., also compared Mueller's remarks to an ""impeachment referral,"" and said, ""We need to start impeachment proceedings. It's our constitutional obligation.""

Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., who is also running for president, said now that Mueller's job is done, ""Impeachment hearings should begin tomorrow.""



House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., whose committee would oversee impeachment proceedings, said that there ""certainly is"" justification to begin impeachment, but said it was critical to first gain the support fo the American people.

“Impeachment is a political act, and you cannot impeach a president if the American people will not support it,” said Nadler, D-N.Y. “The American people, right now, do not support it because they do not know the story. They don’t know the facts.”

Nadler added: “We have to get the facts out. We have to hold a series of hearings, we have to hold the investigations.”

But despite growing calls from rank-and-file Democrats, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has tread lightly on the topic, vowing to investigate allegations against the president, but stopping short of calling to begin impeachment proceedings.

Pelosi, this week, also said that Democrats “want to do what’s right and what gets results.”

“We’re legislating, we’re investigating and we’re litigating,” Pelosi said. “Everybody wants justice, everybody wants the president to be held accountable.”

But House Majority Whip James Clyburn, D-S.C., despite Pelosi’s resistance to the idea, said Sunday he feels Democrats have “already begun” impeachment proceedings.

“We’ve got all these committees doing their work, we’re having hearings, we’ve already won two court cases and there are other cases that are still to be determined, so why should we get out in front of this process?” Clyburn said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

“It’s kind of interesting to me when you talk to people and ask them what they think we ought to do,” he added. “They agree with what we’re doing, it’s just that, emotionally, they would like to see something done and see it done quicker.”

Trump, though, blasted the idea as a “scam.”

“I don’t see how they can,” Trump said Thursday. “It’s a dirty, filthy, disgusting word, impeach. It’s high crimes – there was no high crime. So how do you impeach?”

The White House also has ignored the discussion, and seized only on Mueller's move to announce the official conclusion of the Russia probe. Mueller, last week, said the investigation was officially complete, his office would close, and said he was resigning from the Justice Department to return to private life.

But even without launching official impeachment proceedings, congressional Democrats are leading several high-profile Trump-focused investigations. The House Judiciary Committee, which would oversee potential impeachment proceedings, is investigating the administration’s handling of Mueller’s report, and even voted to hold Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt for defying a subpoena requiring that he turn over an unredacted version of Mueller’s report, and its underlying evidence and documents. The president, in turn, asserted executive privilege over the files in a bid to protect them from release.

Meanwhile, the House Intelligence Committee, Oversight Committee, Ways and Means Committee and Financial Services Committee are all investigating the president and have aggressively sought his financial statements and documents for their probes, as well as testimony from high-profile Trump administration officials.

Thus far, the White House has directed the officials to defy their subpoenas to appear before Congress, and the president has vowed to block “all” subpoenas.

But Republicans, like House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Doug Collins, R-Ga., are shifting their focus to Barr’s review of the origins of the Russia investigation. Barr appointed U.S. attorney from Connecticut John Durham to lead an investigation into the FBI’s original Russia probe, and alleged misconduct related to Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants, as well as the FBI’s use of informants against the Trump campaign in 2016.

“It’s time for us to find out how this started and go from there,” Collins said on “Fox News Sunday.”"

State Dept. panel to redefine human rights based on 'natural law and natural rights',https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/state-dept-panel-redefine-human-rights-based-natural/story?id=63400485,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is setting up a commission at the State Department to redefine human rights as based on what the department is describing as ""natural law and natural rights.""

The move has alarmed human rights activists, especially those focused on LGBT rights and women's rights, who fear it will mean an end to promoting protections for both groups around the world.

""It's an important review of how we think about human rights inside of our efforts in diplomacy,"" Pompeo told reporters Thursday, adding the effort is focused on ""how do we make sure that we have a solid definition of human rights upon which to tell all our diplomats around the world how to engage on those important issues.""

The State Department has declined to comment beyond Pompeo's remarks. But it did issue a public notice in the Federal Register on Thursday that says the body, named the Commission on Unalienable Rights, will provide Pompeo ""advice and recommendations concerning international human rights matters"" and meet about once a month.

""The Commission will provide fresh thinking about human rights discourse where such discourse has departed from our nation's founding principles of natural law and natural rights,"" according to the notice.

Use of the term ""natural law"" has concerned some advocacy groups and department staff, as it is interpreted in this case as ""God-given"" or religiously-based rights that affect issues like sexuality, abortion rights, and more. In particular, the phrase has been prominent in the work of Princeton professor Robert George.

George has played a prominent role in the creation of the commission, according to a source familiar with the plans for the commission. George, co-founder of the National Organization for Marriage, a nonprofit that advocates against same-sex marriage, is among the 15 academics recommended to make up the panel, according to the source.

Author of the 1999 book ""In Defense of Natural Law,"" where he argued against homosexuality and abortion rights and in favor of religious liberty, George also wrote the original concept note that outlined a vision for the commission, the source said.

The commission ""is absolutely about those issues, but it's not explicit in the paper,"" the source said. ""It questions whether and which human rights are universal.""

George did not respond to a request for comment.

Dr. Kiron Skinner, Pompeo's director of policy planning, is listed as the top official on the Federal Register notice. Skinner, who leads the department's long-term foreign policy strategy team, recently raised eyebrows by describing the U.S. rivalry with China as a clash of civilizations and ""the first time that we will have a great power competitor that is not Caucasian.""

Along with George and Skinner, the full list of participants has been recommended to the Secretary, but he still has to approve the final list. As part of the process, however, the department had to publish the Federal Register notice, which is dated May 22.

Igniting further concern about the project is the fact that the department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor was not consulted in the process, two sources told ABC News.

""The wording of the Commission's mandate raised eyebrows with human rights advocates and congressional staff. The fact that it was announced with no prior outreach to or input from the human rights community immediately raised concerns over its motives... [and] the State Department already has a well-defined understanding of how to advance human rights and maintains several offices dedicated to various human rights issues,"" said Rob Berschinski, who served as deputy assistant secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, or DRL, in the Obama administration.

Pompeo said Thursday the project is ""separate"" from DRL, but ""deeply connected to the work that not only DRL does, but that the entire State Department does around the world.""

Promoting the right to religious freedom has been a high priority for Pompeo, who will host his second summit on the topic this July. But he and the Trump administration, in general, have been criticized for pulling punches on U.S. partners over their human rights abuses. Saudi Arabia and Egypt, for example, have been embraced by the top Trump officials despite their crackdowns on political opposition, women's rights activists, and NGOs.

""If the administration truly wants to engage in a meaningful dialogue about respecting human rights, then we are happy to have that discussion. But the fact that this panel was announced without details or consultation with human rights experts suggests that this may be just another instrument to negate rights, rather than protect them,"" said Tarah Demant, director of Amnesty International's Gender, Sexuality, and Identity program."
Google is facing an imminent antitrust investigation from the US Justice Department,https://www.theverge.com,['May'],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/31/18648052/google-us-justice-department-doj-investigation-antitrust-search,"Google may soon face an antitrust investigation from the US Department of Justice pertaining to its search business and potentially other aspects of the company’s sprawling software and services empire, according to a late Friday evening report from The Wall Street Journal. The DOJ is said to have spent the past few weeks preparing for the probe. Following publication of the WSJ’s story, The Washington Post, The New York Times, and Bloomberg are confirming an imminent antitrust probe as well.

Citing anonymous sources, the WSJ says the Federal Trade Commission, which works alongside the DOJ to bring federal antitrust cases, will defer to the Justice Department in this case. Prior to this, the FTC brought a case against the company in 2011 related to the placement of tracking cookies in Apple’s Safari browser. That case was resolved a year later with a $22.5 million civil penalty judgement, at the time the largest such judgement the FTC had ever earned in court. According to the WSJ, the FTC then investigated Google in 2013 for broad antitrust violations, but closed the case without taking any action against the search giant. Now, the DOJ is leading the charge on a new, potentially unprecedented antitrust evaluation of the company.

The 2011 FTC penalty pales in comparison to the three antitrust fines levied against Google by the European Union, which has fined Google billions of dollars related to its Google Search practices, the software it bundles with its Android operating system, and most recently non-compete contracts it forced customers to sign when using its AdSense product. Google’s antitrust bill from the EU now totals €8.2 billion ($9.3 billion).

Google has faced severe, multi-billion antitrust fines in the EU, but never in the US

In the US, Google has gone largely unscathed, even as its become, alongside Facebook, one of the most dominant digital advertising businesses on the planet. Google has similarly dominant positions in the markets for search engines, web browsers, mobile operating systems, email, and numerous other product categories, all of which aid in its ability to collect data and serve targeted ads. That’s led to Google becoming a top target for politicians and regulators looking to rein in the power of Silicon Valley, most prominent of which is 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).

Google, because it does not operate a traditional social platform, has mostly avoided taking heat for abetting of Russian interference in the 2016 US election and for the various election meddling, far-right organizing, and fake news issues that have plagued Facebook and Twitter over the last three years. But Google has gotten itself embroiled in many other controversies in that time related to repeated Gmail and Chrome privacy violations, extremism and child exploitation on YouTube, its work with the Pentagon on a drone project, its work developing a search product for the Chinese market, and the ethical considerations and oversight of its artificial intelligence research.

Although none of those issues cross into clear antitrust territory, the animosity for Big Tech among both the public and lawmakers toward Silicon Valley’s unchecked dominance and its lack of clear action toward tackling hard problems have created a far more adversarial atmosphere, in particular around topics like privacy, AI, work with the US government, and general overreach and accountability concerns. That in turn appears to have created a rift between Washington and the tech industry, once friendly allies during the Obama administration, that’s laying the foundation for potentially significant regulatory action.

Google has also become a prime target of conservatives who feel, through YouTube and Google Search, that the company is stifling speech and exhibiting bias toward Republicans and non-liberal viewpoints. That position has been elevated by President Donald Trump, who accused Google of rigging search results against him and other conservative individuals. There’s no indication the theory that Google is biased against conservatives, which has no basis in fact, is influencing this probe, but the company has been made to answer in front of Congress for perceptions of bias.

It’s not clear what parts of Google’s business the DOJ may focus on, and whether it will echo investigations from the EU’s antitrust authority. The latter has taken issue with the software Google packages with its standard Android license, the way its search engine rankings may favor its own product listings, and the ways the company has harmed competition in the digital advertising market through contractual stipulations forced upon customers. But the US is far more lenient when it comes to market competition than Europe, which is partly why companies like Google and Facebook have been able to grow to such immense size and influence with little to no impediments from regulators.

Google and the DOJ did not immediately respond to requests for comment."
5 things to watch on Trump’s trip to Europe,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/things-watch-trumps-trip-europe/story?id=63323367,"President Donald Trump departs Sunday for a five-day trip to Europe, heading first to the United Kingdom for a three-day state visit before continuing on to Ireland, where he will meet with the prime minister and visit one of his Trump-branded properties and pay his respects at Normandy on the 75th anniversary of D-Day.

Here are the storylines to watch:

The Royal Treatment

While the ceremonies of the president’s state visit to the United Kingdom are not expected to yield any concrete policy achievements, the honorary trip carries symbolic value in reinforcing the United States’ special alliance with its closest ally.

During his working visit to the UK last year, the president himself described the US-UK relationship as “the highest level of special,” and the state visit is designed to showcase that relationship in grand fashion over the three days of events.

“This will be a visit of symbolism,” Heather Conley, an expert on the US-UK relations at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “The president is very enthusiastic about meeting the royal family. You’ll have to ask the royal family if the level of enthusiasm is the same.”

Steve Parsons/Pool via Reuters

And In a significant gesture during the trip – in addition to the queen hosting a formal banquet at Buckingham Palace – the president and first lady will join the heir Prince Charles and his wife Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, for tea at their official residence, Clarence House.

With all that royal treatment comes the risk of a presidential breach of royal protocol or the possibility of an improper interaction.

Royal commentator Robert Jobson expressed confidence that the American president will have been thoroughly briefed on royal etiquette. And in the event of any tricky or uncomfortable moments that might arise with the president, Jobson said the queen can be expected to smooth over any potential awkwardness.

“The Queen has dealt with political leaders since Winston Churchill. They’re not always the easiest people to get along with. She gets along with everybody,” Jobson said. “Out of all the people that can keep President trump … in line, will certainly be the Majesty the Queen.”

While the president is expected to meet with the most high-ranking members of the Royal Family, there is one potentially awkward encounter the president will avoid: The American Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle. Meghan remains on maternity leave following the birth of son Archie and will not attend any of the events, according to the Palace. Her husband, Prince Harry, is expected to meet the president when the Queen welcomes him to Buckingham Palace for a private lunch.

“Meghan is officially on maternity leave, Harry too, so they’ve got an excuse,” Jobson said. “Also, you’ve got to remember that despite them being this fixation for the media, Meghan and Harry are very low down the pecking order in terms of a state visit. You’ve got more important, senior members of the Royal family there.”

Both Trump and Meghan have been publicly critical of one another. Prior to marrying into the royal family, Meghan publicly criticized Trump as a “misogynist” during the 2016 campaign and suggested she'd be inclined to live in Canada if he were elected president. And Trump has, in turn, has called the duchess “nasty.”

“I didn’t know that she was nasty,” Trump said in a recent interview with the British new outlet, The Sun, when asked about her past criticism. The president also said in the interview that he thinks ""it's nice"" that there's an American duchess and added, ""I’m sure she will do excellently.""

The president and his children, who are joining him on the trip, are expected to meet Prince William and Kate, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, during the official events. But Jobson said he doesn’t expect the young royal couple in direct line to the throne to receive the visiting First Family in the same personal terms by which the Obamas were welcomed.

President Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama had an intimate dinner at Kensington Palace with Prince William and Kate, along with Prince Harry, during which the Obamas were even greeted by a pajama-clad Prince George.

“I don’t think it will get that cozy, this is really the Queen’s gig,” Jobson said.

Navigating the Politics of Brexit

Even as the president’s visit to the UK is more for the ceremony than the substance, the state visit couldn’t come at a more politically fraught time in London.

It was just a little over a week ago that Prime Minister Theresa May announced her resignation and just days from now that May has said she will officially step down as her party’s leader.

May’s departure comes after several failed attempts to complete the central task on which she was elected: Producing an agreement to exit the European Union, known as Brexit, following a referendum vote. But the task of carving a path forward through a divided parliament ultimately proved insurmountable to May, who also lost the faith of many in her own cabinet.

Meanwhile, the clock is ticking down for the UK to forge or a way forward or risk a perilous break from the European Union with no deal in place when Brexit is set to take effect at the end of October.

“The substantive issues here are very challenging and the UK is undergoing a very significant leadership contest and increasingly looking like they may leave the EU without a deal this fall, so the challenges are enormous,” Conley said.

While the UK’s internal politics couldn’t be more complicated on their own, the president has already shown in an interview to the British news outlet The Sun that he isn't likely to keep his opinions to himself, something Conley said would “make a very difficult situation even worse” for the president's host, the British government.

The president criticized May's handling of Brexit in the interview, telling the Sun that she should have ""negotiated from strength"" by making more demands of the EU during the course of negotiations.

“I had mentioned to Theresa that you have got to build up your ammunition,"" Trump said. “You have to build up your side in terms of points, or you are just going in and asking, I mean it was just asking and you know, they would say whatever they wanted.”

Beyond the issue of Brexit, the president has also waded into the leadership contest for the next prime minister, expressing his favor for Boris Johnson, who is vying to be the next prime minister, calling him a ""friend of mine.""

“I think Boris would do a very good job. I think he would be excellent,” Trump said of Johnson in his interview with The Sun.

Though the president stopped short of an explicit endorsement of Johnson, he added: ""I like him. I have always liked him. I don’t know that he is going to be chosen, but I think he is a very good guy, a very talented person.""

Johnson previously served as May’s foreign minister but resigned from her cabinet in protest of her handling of Brexit.

The president has also offered praise for Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, who actually campaigned alongside Trump during the 2016 campaign as the two drew parallels between Trump’s anti-establishment campaign and the UK’s Brexit vote.

The president has not ruled out the possibility of meeting with either Johnson or Farage during his visit. If he does, Conley says, it would be seen as an insult to the outgoing prime minister, who views Johnson as “the politician that is ripping apart the conservative party” she leads.

“How would President Trump feel if Theresa May were to come here and hold an open meeting with Joe Biden and say how much she thought Biden is a fantastic politician and wishes him well?” Conley asked rhetorically. “The president would, of course, take great offense.”

“You don’t seek to embarrass your host, you seek to strengthen the relationship,” Conley said. “But we’ve grown accustomed to the norm-breaking by this president.”

In addition to the tricky diplomacy surrounding Johnson and Farage, there’s another local politician who the president has not held back from publicly sparring with in the past: London Mayor Sadiq Khan.

Last June, Trump blasted Khan as a “pathetic” and criticized his handling of the London Bridge terrorist attack, which killed eight people.

Khan has, in kind, also not held back from entertaining a public feud with the president. Ahead of the president’s state, Khan has shown he’s not backing down from his approach of publicly criticizing the president, saying in a recent interview that Trump is “not in the same class” as the two previous U.S. presidents honored with a state visit.

“We should have a close relationship with the president of the USA, but we shouldn't be rolling out the red carpet, we shouldn't have a state banquet,"" Sadiq said in an interview with British radio station LBC. ""And actually, history tells us only two [U.S.] presidents have had a state visit. President Trump is not in the same class as those two.""

It remains to be seen whether the president, who is not one to let slights go unchallenged, will be able to resist the urge to fire back at Khan’s latest jab.

Protests

While the president will avoid a potentially awkward encounter with the American duchess, one thing he likely won’t be able to avoid on this visit to London will be the large protests that are expected. Those demonstrations will stand in stark contrast to the otherwise warm welcome Trump is expected to receive from those in the British government taking part in the official events.

On his working visit to the UK last year, there were massive protests in the capital that included a large orange blimp that portrayed the president as a baby wearing a diaper – and is expected to take to the skies of London again for this visit. The president acknowledged in an interview with the British newspaper The Sun that last year’s protests in the British capital made him feel unwelcome.

“I guess when they put out blimps to make me feel unwelcome, no reason for me to go to London,"" Trump said of the blimp in the Sun interview. “I used to love London as a city. I haven’t been there in a long time. But when they make you feel unwelcome, why would I stay there?""

Last year’s visit was choreographed in such a way that the president was mostly able to avoid passing by the large protests. But on the state visit, which will take him to many of the main sites in London, it will be almost impossible that the president won’t pass a demonstration or two.

Will Trump reinforce or question bonds with allies

Two days of events during the president’s visit are organized around celebrating the 75th anniversary of D-Day and the close alliance between the US and its European allies that helped turn the tide of World War II against Nazi Germany.

“I’m hopeful that this is a powerful experience for the president in understanding the strength of alliances and it’s why the Greatest Generation created NATO,” said Conley.

But while the events will be an easy opportunity for the president to reinforce those close bonds, Conley also raised concern around the possibility that the president could go off-script and somehow raise doubt about the United States’ commitment to the joint security alliance.

“If he takes the opportunity to raise issues like European defense spending or undercuts NATO, again, this simply undercuts U.S. national security and it’s difficult for me to imagine a U.S. commander in chief wishing to do that,” Conley said.

On more than one occasion, President Trump has rattled the foundations of the US-European security alliance, formalized through NATO, by seeming to question the United States' unconditional commitment to the Article 5 principle that defines an attack on one of the NATO allies as an attack against them all.

Article 5 has only been activated on one occasion since the alliance was begun, and it was done so in the aid of the United States following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.

Tracing Reagan’s Footsteps

With his visit to Normandy on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the D-Day invasion that is remembered as the turning point in the Allied effort against Nazi Germany in World War II, the president will be completing a pilgrimage completed by many modern presidents before him.

The tradition of visiting the site of the Normandy invasion on the D-Day anniversary was first started by Ronald Reagan, whom the president praises as one of history’s finest US presidents and has in many ways sought to model.

President Jimmy Carter was the first U.S. president to ever travel to Normandy but his visit did not coincide with the anniversary.

Since Reagan visited Normandy in marking the 40th D-Day anniversary, Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama have also all made an anniversary pilgrimage to Normandy.

The last major anniversary commemoration was attended by President Obama, five years ago, to mark the 70th anniversary."
Migrants at overcrowded border facilities may become violent: DHS watchdog,https://nypost.com,['June'],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://nypost.com/2019/06/01/migrants-at-overcrowded-border-facilities-may-become-violent-dhs-watchdog/,"Migrants seeking asylum and being held at an overcrowded US Border Patrol facility in Texas could become violent due to the inhumane conditions, an internal Department of Homeland Security watchdog found.

State Department to launch new human rights panel stressing 'natural law',https://www.politico.com,['Nahal Toosi'],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/human-rights-state-department-1348014,"The Commission on Unalienable Rights will advise Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a move that has surprised and puzzled human rights activists. | Chris J. Ratcliffe/Getty Images foreign policy State Department to launch new human rights panel stressing 'natural law'

The Trump administration plans to launch a new panel to offer ""fresh thinking” on international human rights and “natural law,” a move some activists fear is aimed at narrowing protections for women and members of the LGBT community.

The new body, to be called the Commission on Unalienable Rights, will advise Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, according to a notice the State Department quietly published Thursday on the Federal Register.

Story Continued Below

“The Commission will provide fresh thinking about human rights discourse where such discourse has departed from our nation's founding principles of natural law and natural rights,” states the notice, which is dated May 22.

Several human rights activists said Thursday that they were surprised by the move and trying to learn details. Some privately said they worry that talk of the “nation’s founding principles” and “natural law” are coded signals of plans to focus less on protecting women and LGBT people.

The word “natural” in such context is often interpreted to mean “God-given,” a phrasing that is less common in modern human rights literature but which could signal a religious component, experts said.

Activists and former U.S. officials noted that the Trump administration’s record on human rights so far is spotty at best.

“Many in the human rights community will welcome an opportunity to advise the Trump Administration on where its policies contradict America’s founding principles. There will be much to discuss,” said Rob Berschinski, a top official with Human Rights First.

The State Department already has an entire bureau devoted to the issues of human rights, democracy and labor, and it was not clear whether officials in that bureau were involved or even aware of the plans for the new commission.

The top State Department contact listed on the notice was Kiron Skinner, Pompeo's director of policy planning. Her team acts like an in-house think tank that considers long-term foreign policy strategy.

Skinner drew criticism recently for seeming to suggest that China, a rising power, is such a fundamentally different culture from the United States that arguments about human rights may not have much effect in dialogue with Beijing. Skinner’s defenders have argued she is a serious thinker who probably simply stumbled in trying to articulate her point.

State Department officials were not able to offer details about the planned commission on Thursday.

But in remarks to reporters after this article was first published, Pompeo said the goal of the panel was to sort out “how do we connect up what it is we’re trying to achieve throughout the world, and how do we make sure that we have a solid definition of human rights upon which to tell all our diplomats around the world.”

“It was a project that I wanted to proceed on, and it’s an important review of how we think about human rights inside of our efforts in diplomacy,” he said. He added that while the panel is separate from the human rights bureau, it is “deeply connected” to that bureau’s work.

Former top U.S. officials who dealt with rights issues expressed puzzlement over the commission’s creation.

“On the one hand it’s commendable that the secretary wants to place more emphasis on these issues, given that the administration to date has not been very outspoken on them,” said David Kramer, who served as the assistant secretary of State for human rights under the administration of Republican President George W. Bush. “On the other hand, I’m not sure what this commission is supposed to do that the human rights bureau doesn’t already do.”

“I don’t think this is the advisory committee for expanding rights,” quipped Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.), a congressman who held the same assistant secretary role in the administration of President Barack Obama.

Generally speaking, President Donald Trump and his aides have de-emphasized the role of human rights in their foreign policy, raising the issue only selectively — typically to raise pressure on countries considered adversaries.

The Republican administration has, for instance, highlighted the plight of female activists seeking more freedom in Iran, a longtime U.S. nemesis, but largely ignored similar challenges facing such activists in Saudi Arabia, a longtime U.S. ally.

The administration has made promoting religious freedom overseas a high priority, a move that has delighted Trump’s many evangelical Christian supporters.

But the administration also has rolled back domestic regulations aimed at protecting members of the LGBT community, especially those who are transgender.

It also has cut down sections about women’s reproductive rights in the State Department’s annual human rights report and made attempts to eliminate references to “sexual and reproductive health” in U.N. documents.

According to the notice posted Thursday, the new commission will meet at least once a month. It is not clear who will serve on the panel or when their appointments will take effect, but activists and former U.S. officials noted that its composition will greatly affect the policies it promotes."
Treasury overlooks the true culprit behind US dollar strength,https://thehill.com,[],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/446354-treasury-overlooks-the-true-culprit-behind-us-dollar-strength,"After a long delay, the Treasury Department just released its latest semi-annual report on global currency exchange policies. The congressionally mandated report provides an assessment of whether foreign countries are undervaluing their currencies to gain a trade advantage.

The major takeaway from the report is that Treasury has expanded the list of countries it is monitoring for exchange rate abuses. However, the department repeated its longstanding practice — and once again found no currency “manipulation” by America’s trade competitors.

In other words, Treasury believes that foreign central banks are not acting to push the U.S. dollar’s value up to noncompetitive levels.

Treasury is barking up the wrong tree, however. In the current market, the dollar is indeed being driven up, but by private capital inflows, not central banks — and it’s making U.S. exports too expensive in global markets.

Conversely, the currencies of America’s chief competitors — Japan, China and Europe — are too low. The result is that American-made cars, airplanes and other manufactured goods are getting priced out of the market through no fault of domestic U.S. companies.

The Treasury Department did acknowledge in its report that the dollar is overvalued and that other countries’ currencies are undervalued. The report also recognized that the dollar’s relative overvaluation drives the current U.S. trade deficit. Regrettably, Treasury offered no policy proposals to address this growing problem.

With America’s global trade deficit continuing to climb, the administration and Congress must recognize that the 21st century’s problem is no longer currency manipulation by foreign central banks.

Instead, a glut of private foreign capital is flowing into U.S. financial markets, continually driving the dollar higher, which allows foreign competitors to reap a windfall without lifting a finger. Wall Street perpetually cheers this strong dollar, but it is now working against American companies.

For those wondering why the U.S. trade deficit grew in 2018 despite President Trump Donald John TrumpLondon mayor says UK is 'on the wrong side of history' with Trump visit Hickenlooper booed in San Francisco for denouncing socialism Cuomo calls Trump base 'mostly middle aged angry white males' MORE’s aggressive trade intervention, it’s these capital inflows that are the root cause.

A wonkish explanation is needed to understand the problem. In the 1970s and 80s, Japan and West Germany followed a strategy that supercharged their economic growth.

They manipulated currency markets by buying dollar-based assets and sold their own currencies at the same time. The result was a rise in the dollar that made their exports comparably cheaper in the U.S. market.

In 1985, President Reagan faced the largest trade deficit in U.S. history. He responded to congressional pressure by negotiating with Japan and West Germany to stop their currency practices. The resulting agreement, the Plaza Accord, devalued the dollar significantly while raising the value of the yen and the Deutsche mark.

U.S. products became globally competitive, and the U.S. trade deficit shrank. In 1988, Congress passed a law requiring the Treasury Department to issue twice-yearly reports identifying countries that manipulate their currencies.

From the mid-1990s through 2015, China and other countries followed a similar nationalistic strategy, buying dollars and selling their own currencies to gain a trade advantage. But in recent years, a global oversupply of private capital flowing into the U.S. has started to do the job for them.

Some foreign countries use economic strategies to produce more than their citizens consume, and they export the difference. They generate trade surpluses and, as a result, accumulate progressively more savings than they invest at home.

Those surplus savings flow into countries with trade deficits, primarily the United States. This flood of “toxic waste” capital — as some economists describe it — buys Treasury bonds and U.S. stocks, which drives the dollar higher. And so, the U.S. trade deficit gets worse as American exports become less competitive.

Wall Street is happy to accept these private capital inflows in exchange for the stocks and bonds their brokers sell. But U.S. goods and services become too expensive in global markets, harming workers and hurting economic growth.

American companies lose market share to foreign competitors both at home and abroad, and they struggle to remain profitable — cutting budgets for innovative research and wage increases. It’s the key problem facing Main Street today.

While Treasury correctly found that there is no large-scale currency manipulation occurring among central banks, the department is focused on the wrong issue because these governments no longer need to push the dollar higher. International banks and hedge funds are doing the work for them.

One solution is a market access charge to manage this toxic influx of foreign capital. Like a peak load charge during rush hour traffic, a fee applied to incoming investment could slow foreign capital inflows, gradually lowering the dollar to a trade-balancing price. America would become competitive again in international trade and maintain its global leadership.

President Trump and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin cannot eliminate the U.S. trade deficit until they focus on these excessive foreign capital inflows, which are weaponizing the dollar against the interests of America’s companies and workers.

Solving this problem will allow the president to fulfill his campaign promise of narrowing the trade deficit and creating millions of good-paying, middle-class U.S. jobs for many years to come.

US energy department rebrands gas exports 'molecules of freedom',https://www.bbc.com,[],,,,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48454674,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The US has announced its plans to ""spread freedom gas throughout the world""

US energy officials appeared to rebrand natural gas produced in the country as ""freedom gas"", in a statement announcing an increase in exports.

The US Department of Energy said the expansion of a Texas facility meant more ""molecules of US freedom"" could be produced and exported worldwide.

The facility, based in Quintana, produces liquified natural gas (LNG).

The move was a clear indication of US commitment to promoting clean energy, the statement said.

But the rebranding comes amid a Trump administration push to roll back climate change legislation introduced by Mr Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, which targeted vehicle emissions.

Shortly after taking office, Mr Trump announced the US would withdraw from the 2015 Paris climate change agreement, saying that he wanted to negotiate a new ""fair"" deal that would not disadvantage US businesses and workers.

The move was decried by climate change scientists and campaigners, and Mr Trump has faced accusations of hampering global efforts to cut carbon emissions.

Wednesday's announced expansion of the facility on Quintana Island will support some 3,000 new jobs in the area, according to the Department of Energy statement.

""Increasing export capacity from the Freeport LNG project is critical to spreading freedom gas throughout the world by giving America's allies a diverse and affordable source of clean energy,"" Mark Menezes, the US undersecretary of energy, said.

The term freedom gas is reminiscent of freedom fries, coined in the US 2003 as an alternative to French fries following France's opposition to the US invasion of Iraq.

Republican congressman Walter B Jones and his fellow Republican Robert W Ney also pushed for cafeterias in the House of Representatives to rename their French toast ""freedom toast""."
Andrew McCarthy: Mueller probe was always about impeachment,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Andrew Mccarthy', 'Andrew C. Mccarthy Is A Senior Fellow At The National Review Institute', 'A Contributing Editor Of National Review.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/andrew-mccarthy-mueller-probe-was-always-about-impeachment,"Why mention the OLC guidance at all?

That is the question for now-former Special Counsel Robert Mueller, left hanging by the statement his office jointly issued with Justice Department flacks on Wednesday, clarifying (as it were) remarks he had made hours earlier at his parting-shot press conference.

At issue is Mueller’s decision to punt on the question of whether President Trump should be indicted for obstruction of justice. In his startling remarks, Mueller sought to justify himself by citing instruction from the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel. The longstanding OLC opinion, an outgrowth of Nixon- and Clinton-era scandals, holds that a sitting president may not be indicted. The two press offices were struggling to reconcile (a) Mueller’s pointed reliance on this OLC guidance at the presser with (b) his prior disclaimers of such reliance.

According to Attorney General William Barr, in a meeting over two weeks before Mueller submitted his final report, the special counsel emphatically denied that his refusal to render a prosecutorial judgment on obstruction hinged on the OLC guidance. Naturally, in their continuing quest to frame Barr as the most diabolical villain since Lex Luthor, the media-Democrat complex insisted that the AG must be lying.

This is what derangement will do to you. I do not think Mueller’s contradictory assertions are that hard to figure out. But if you were inclined to blame sleight of hand, the culprit would be Mueller. You’ll notice that when we finally heard from him on Wednesday, he lauded Barr’s good faith, never claiming that the AG had misrepresented him. Moreover, the conversation between them on the OLC guidance was not a one-on-one affair. There were other people in the room when Mueller denied that the OLC guidance was his rationale for abdicating.

DHS says citizenship approvals rose in 2018,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Stephen Dinan']",05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/may/31/dhs-says-citizenship-approvals-rose-2018/,"Homeland Security reached a five-year high in approvals of citizenship applications last year, and swore in more people as naturalized citizens as well, according to the new statistical report released Friday night.

Those numbers contradict the criticisms of congressional Democrats who had complained about backlogs building at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the Homeland Security branch that handles legal immigration.

The new report also suggests that far from a crackdown, the government is processing more asylum-seeker petitions than any of the last four years. That included a 61 percent increase from 2017 to 2018 in affirmative asylum applications — though refugee interviews are down from more than 1250,000 in 2016, the last year under President Barack Obama, to just 26,400 in fiscal year 2018 under President Trump.

Still, when the whole panoply of humanitarian programs is considered — asylum, refugees, crime victim visas, Temporary Protected Status and screening for credible fear or reasonable fear of persecution — the numbers were 32 percent higher than fiscal year 2017. Credible fear and reasonable fear are first steps on the asylum track.

USCIS’s workload has become contentious in recent years, with immigrant-rights groups accusing the Trump administration of building a bureaucratic “wall” to deny people the chance to enter the U.S. legally. The accusation is a play on their disdain for Mr. Trump’s border wall intended to stop illegal immigration.

Hispanic Democrats in Congress say things are so bad that they requested — and have been granted — an investigation to be done by the Government Accountability Office. Rep. Joaquin Castro, chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said the case backlog is an example of “President Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda.”

Yet the backlog in citizenship applications, for example, exploded during the end of the Obama administration. The Washington Times, which tracked the explosion at the time, sought comment from immigrant-rights activists and lawmakers, including Democrats, but didn’t find many who blamed the Obama administration for the slow processing.

The new numbers from USCIS also detail some of the more hidden parts of the agency’s work, such as its efforts to weed out fraud in legal immigration applications.

Experts say fraud is rampant, but the agency has not released any major fraud assessments in years.

Still, the Fraud Detection and National Security division reported 149,3000 investigative leads or actions year — a 14 percent increase over 2017. That included 30,400 tips of fraud, 7,600 national security matters and nearly 17,000 public safety matters.

FDNS also reported screening social media in 11,700 cases.

Senators urge USDA to stop foreign-owned companies from getting farm bailout money,https://www.inforum.com,['Washington Post'],,,,https://www.inforum.com/news/nation/1354690-Senators-urge-USDA-to-stop-foreign-owned-companies-from-getting-farm-bailout-money,"WASHINGTON - A group of U.S. senators is urging Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue to ensure that a bailout program intended to help American farmers weather President Donald Trump's trade war does not benefit foreign-owned companies.

The program, which buys surplus commodities from farmers and ranchers, was pitched as a way to protect farmers during the U.S.-China trade war. But the USDA hasn't turned away foreign-owned corporations that want in. Earlier this year, taxpayer money was used to buy $5 million in pork products from a Brazilian-owned meatpacking firm. A Chinese-owned pork producer was slated to tap the program until the contract provoked intense criticism and was eventually canceled.

""It is unacceptable that American taxpayers have been subsidizing our competitors through trade assistance,"" according to a letter addressed to Perdue and signed by Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan and eight other Democratic lawmakers. ""We ask that you ensure these commodity purchases are carried out in a manner that most benefits the American farmer's bottom line - not the business interests of foreign corporations.""

Under a $12 billion bailout program announced last year, the Trump administration set aside $1.2 billion to buy surplus products from farmers, including more than $500 million from pork producers. Last week, the White House announced a separate $16 billion bailout that included $1.4 billion in commodity purchase relief for farmers.

The letter's other signatories are Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio; Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.; Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.; Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.; Patty Murray, D-Wash.; Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.; Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis.; and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y.

The senators pointed to what they called ""lucrative"" contracts that benefit foreign-owned entities and direct taxpayer money abroad. Those contracts include $62.5 million in pork products from JBS USA, which is owned by Brazil-based JBS SA. The food purchase program also was slated to buy $240,000 in pork products from Smithfield Foods, which is a subsidiary of Chinese-owned WH Group. Smithfield later asked that the contract be canceled after a political backlash. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, a farmer and member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, was among those who expressed alarm that a foreign-owned company could benefit from the bailout. (The USDA said it has not tallied how much money has gone to foreign-owned companies, but the contracts themselves are public.)

""Whether it's the WH Group, which is closely tied to the Chinese government, or JBS SA, which is benefiting from the U.S's loss of market share in certain countries, it is counterproductive and contradictory for these companies to receive assistance paid for with U.S. taxpayer dollars intended to help American farmers struggling with this Administration's trade policy,"" the senators wrote.

Perdue contends the program already buys only American-made products.

""JBS is a Brazilian company operating in the United States, buying product from U.S. farmers,"" Perdue said in a statement. ""What we do through these companies - it's not to help the companies - they offer a bid to us based on buying us farmers production. This helps U.S. farmers by supporting prices. Companies are able to buy from our farmers more because we are buying that product and taking it off the market.""

Dustin Baker, director of economics for the National Pork Producers Council, cautioned against limiting which pork producers could take advantage of the food purchasing program. Baker said that reducing the number of producers trying to get relief would only drive up the delivery costs of getting the products to food banks and needy families.

Plus, Baker said, just because some producers are foreign-owned doesn't mean they can't be ""the lifeblood of the economies in which they're located."" Many of these companies provide thousands of jobs in rural areas and, like their American-owned competitors, they must also comply with USDA guidelines, he said.

""The real purpose [of the program] is to take product off the domestic market that otherwise would have been exported,"" Baker said. ""By preventing companies from joining, all you're doing is increasing the cost of delivering that product to those who need it the most.""

In January, Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., said she would introduce the Buy American Agriculture Act, which would require the Agricultural Marketing Service to only buy food products from American companies. The legislation would also push for added transparency by requiring the agency to disclose why companies were awarded contracts.

""We were led to believe this program would assist producers impacted by low crop prices, not line the pockets of foreign companies who already report millions of dollars in annual profits,"" DeLauro in a statement at the time. ""The Buy American Agriculture Act would close that loophole and ensure that money spent by USDA on food purchases rightly prioritizes America's farmers and American businesses.""

Ex-State Department head of diplomatic security 'surprised' by Hillary Clinton's private email use,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ex-state-department-head-of-diplomatic-security-surprised-by-hillary-clintons-private-email-use,"The official in charge of protecting State Department staff said he was ""surprised"" to learn that Hillary Clinton used a personal email address to conduct government business.

Eric Boswell, the former head of diplomatic security, acknowledged in a deposition this month that he warned Clinton and other State Department staff against the use of personal emails.

""We also urge Department users to minimize the use of personal web email for business, as some compromised home systems have been reconfigured by these actors to automatically forward copies of all composed emails to an undisclosed recipient,"" read a 2011 memo that bore his signature.

Clinton was a recipient of the memo, but Boswell could not confirm whether the secretary of state actually read it.

Boswell, who stepped down from his position in 2012, said he and other former State Department officials had spoken about Clinton's use of the private email address clintonemail.com as a ""general issue.""

""We were surprised,"" he added.

Boswell participated in a deposition this month as part of a court-ordered discovery related to Clinton’s use of an unauthorized email server during her time as secretary of state. A federal judge ruled that several Obama administration officials would have to answer conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch's questions about whether Clinton intentionally attempted to evade the Freedom of Information Act by using a nongovernment email system.

Boswell also warned Clinton against her use of Blackberry devices in the executive offices of the State Department. In a previously declassified memo to Cheryl Mills, Clinton's chief of staff, Boswell said the secretary of state should discontinue her use of the device due to ""vulnerabilities and risks."" Although Clinton assured Boswell she read the internal memo and ""gets it,"" an email obtained by Judicial Watch indicates she still carried the device ""[a]gainst the advice of the security hawks.""

The debate over whether Clinton's home-based email server, which she claims was set up for convenience, remains alive today. During a hearing with Attorney General William Barr this month, Rep. Louie Gohmert accused FBI Director Christopher Wray of a pro-Clinton cover-up by not pressing the intelligence community for proof that it was not hacked by China.

Also this month, partially redacted documents were released by the FBI that were part of the bureau's ""Midyear Exam"" investigation, which looked into Clinton's mishandling of classified information on her unauthorized private email servers while serving as secretary of state. The documents put on display a sense of alarm among Clinton's staff following what they feared to be a hack of the server and glaring security oversights.

The FBI investigation into Clinton's emails came to a conclusion during the 2016 presidential election. Former FBI Director James Comey publicly recommended in 2016 that no charges be brought against Clinton, who was then a candidate for president, but admonished Clinton and her colleagues for being ""extremely careless"" in handling classified information.

One of the main controversies stemming from Clinton's emails was how a technician managing the server deleted 33,000 emails. The FBI was only able to recover about 5,000 of the emails, which were released in tranches up until earlier this year as part of a Judicial Watch lawsuit. Clinton has said she ""never received nor sent any material that was marked classified,"" but the FBI found 110 emails did contain classified information.

Clinton has long blamed the FBI's handling of the investigation as a reason for her 2016 loss to President Trump."
Department of Corrections turns over disputed documents to Justice Department,https://www.al.com,"['William Thornton', 'Wthornton Al.Com']",06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.al.com/news/2019/06/department-of-corrections-turns-over-disputed-documents-to-justice-department.html,"The Alabama Department of Corrections surrendered documents this week that the U.S. Department of Justice said dealt with reports of excessive force and sexual abuse against inmates by correctional officers.

According to a four-page motion filed Thursday by lawyers representing the DOJ, the ADOC provided documents “specifically related to use of force and sexual abuse by staff.” As a result, the DOJ withdrew a petition to enforce a subpoena that it filed last October.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Gray Borden had given both sides until Friday to come up with a solution to the impasse.

There is no word yet on what DOJ will do with the documents. In April the Justice Department released a report on its two-and-a-half-year investigation into violence and poor conditions within Alabama’s men’s prisons. The DOJ concluded that there is reasonable cause to believe that conditions in the prisons violate the Eighth Amendment.

Last month, in an effort to get the contested documents, Justice Department lawyers said there are still areas of the investigation that have “not been completed.”

A footnote on the first page of the 62-page report on Alabama’s prisons says that the investigation was opened to look at whether ADOC was adequately ensuring inmate safety from physical and sexual violence between inmates, and whether inmates had safe and sanitary living conditions.

However, the footnote stated that an investigation into a third issue - whether inmates were safe from excessive force and sexual abuse from staff members – is ongoing “because the Department’s petition to enforce its subpoena for documents relevant to that issue is pending with the court.”

On Oct. 12, 2018, DOJ filed a petition requesting the federal court force ADOC to turn over a series of individual prisoner investigative files, and documents on open and closed investigations, including autopsy reports on some inmates and some medical records not previously made available at correctional facilities.

The filing also requested weekly reports from ADOC’s Intelligence and Investigations Division from September 2016 to September 2017.

Since 2012, Alabama men’s and women’s prisons have come under repeated scrutiny for staffing and safety, as well as a pervasive atmosphere of documented sexual and physical abuse."
"Queen Elizabeth set to fete Trump, as she has so many other US presidents",https://www.cnn.com,['Betsy Klein'],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/01/politics/donald-trump-queen-elizabeth-ii-state-visit/index.html,"(CNN) Queen Elizabeth II has met with nearly every American President since Dwight Eisenhower during her more than 67 years on the throne. Next week, she'll welcome President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump back to the United Kingdom, this time for a rare state visit.

Though the Trumps and the Royal Family are expected to adhere to the highest levels of protocol during the visit, Trump's remarks ahead of the trip threaten to damage goodwill with the Queen -- he publicly insulted her grandson's wife on the eve of the visit.

During an interview with The Sun, Trump was asked about comments made by Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, ahead of the 2016 election. Speaking on ""The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore"" in 2016, Markle called Trump misogynistic and said his politics are divisive, saying she would move to Canada if he won the presidency.

Trump responded, ""I didn't know that she was nasty. I hope she is OK,"" later adding, ""I am sure she will go excellently (as a royal). She will be very good."" Buckingham Palace had no comment on Trump's interview regarding Markle.

The Trumps previously met with the Queen at Windsor Castle last June, a more informal meeting over tea.

The trip comes amid a blitz of foreign travel for the President and will be the Trumps' second state visit in less than two weeks. In May, they were Japanese Emperor Naruhito's first state guests since he ascended to the Chrysanthemum Throne earlier that month.

For the Trump's official visit, Buckingham Palace is pulling out all of the Royal stops befitting a world leader. An official state visit requires the formal invitation of the Queen to a head of state ""on the advice of the Foreign and Commonwealth office,"" per Buckingham Palace , and usually involves a ceremonial welcome, a state banquet, other meetings with British officials and a formal farewell.

Trump, who is known to appreciate pomp and circumstance, is sure to revel in the pageantry. His adult children, Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, Eric Trump and Tiffany Trump, will also be joining him and the first lady.

Likewise, they ""will have the opportunity to meet some other members of the Royal Family"" during the arrival ceremony, said a senior administration official briefing reporters on the trip. America's own member of the Royal Family, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, is not expected to attend, as she has largely remained out of the public spotlight since giving birth in early May.

The 'special relationship'

The ""special relationship"" with the United Kingdom also carries special significance for the President. After their 2018 tea, Trump told interviewer Piers Morgan that he was thinking of his mother when he met the Queen.

""I was thinking about my mother. My mother passed away a while ago and she was a tremendous fan of the Queen. She thought she was a woman of elegance, and my mother felt she was a great woman. I remember even as a little guy, if there was any kind of a ceremony to do with the Queen, my mother would be watching the television -- she wanted to see it,"" Trump said at the time.

Trump recalled: ""I was walking up and I was saying (to Melania), 'Can you imagine my mother seeing this scene? Windsor. Windsor Castle.' And it was beautiful, it was really beautiful but the Queen is terrific. She is so sharp, so wise, so beautiful. Up close, you see she's so beautiful. She's a very special person.""

Trump told Morgan that the Queen walked him through all of the presidents she had met.

""Harry Truman was the first president that she got to meet and know, and she went through a whole list. It was a very nice moment, Piers, very nice,"" he said.

The Queen met President Harry Truman when she was still Princess Elizabeth, during a trip to Washington in 1951 at the age of 25. She and Prince Philip stayed at Blair House with Truman and his family since the White House was under a four-year major renovation, according to the White House Historical Association.

State visits

Since then, she's met with every US President, with the one exception of President Lyndon B. Johnson. But this is only the third state visit from a US president during Queen Elizabeth II's reign; the invitation has only been extended to Trump's most recent predecessors -- Barack and Michelle Obama in May 2011 and George W. and Laura Bush in November 2003.

She hosted the Kennedys for a banquet -- not an official state visit -- in 1961, which was recently depicted in the Netflix drama ""The Crown,"" hinting at an icy, if not entirely accurate , relationship between the Queen and first lady Jacqueline Kennedy.

The Nixons, Carters, and Clintons also met her informally in 1970, 1977, and 1994, respectively, and she hosted a formal dinner honoring the Reagans at Windsor Castle in 1982. Carter drew the Queen Mother's ire during that 1977 visit when he kissed her on the lips.

""Nobody has done that since my husband died,"" she reportedly said.

The Queen has traveled to the United States for informal visits and state visits multiple times during her reign. For her first state visit to the US as Queen in 1957, she and Prince Philip stayed in the same suite in the White House in which her parents, King George VI and the Queen Mother, had stayed in 1939, according to the White House Historical Association, and she was greeted with large crowds on her motorcade from the airport.

At the White House

In 1976, President Gerald Ford and Betty Ford hosted her for a state dinner in the Rose Garden. President Ronald Reagan and first lady Nancy Reagan served the Queen enchiladas and chile rellenos when she visited them at their Santa Barbara ranch in 1983, and days later, hosted a State Dinner in her honor at San Francisco's M.H. de Young Memorial Museum.

She rolled up her sleeves -- though not literally -- during an official state visit in 1991, planting a tree on the White House South Lawn alongside President George H. W. Bush, replacing a storm-damaged tree her father planted in 1937. And she attended tie state dinner at the George W. Bush White House in 2007.

She shared a warm relationship with the Obamas, as Michelle Obama recently recalled

""So, I had all this protocol buzzing in my head, and I was like, 'Don't trip down the stairs and don't touch anybody, whatever you do,' "" the former first lady said during a book tour event. ""And so, the Queen says, 'Just get in, sit wherever,' and she's telling you one thing and you're remembering protocol and she says, 'Oh it's all rubbish, just get in.' ""

It remains to be seen whether the Queen shares the same affection for Trump.

Asked if he got the feeling she liked him, Trump told Morgan: ""Well, I don't want to speak for her, but I can tell you I liked her. So, usually that helps. But I liked her a lot."""

CNN reports the IG said that during an unannounced inspection investigators found unsanitary and “standing-room only conditions” at the processing center. One cell built to hold 12 migrants had 76 detainees, while another meant for eight people had 41 migrants, the report says. “[Customs and Border Protection] was struggling to maintain hygienic conditions in the holding cells. With limited access to showers and clean clothing, detainees were wearing soiled clothing for days or weeks,” the report says. “We also observed detainees standing on toilets in the cells to make room and gain breathing space, thus limiting access to the toilets.” The watchdog warned that morale is low among DHS workers at the facility, and “corrective action is critical to the immediate health and safety needs of detainees.”"

The Paralympic-style competition, which will be hosted in 2020 by the Marine Corps, brings together injured, ill or wounded active-duty service members and veterans to compete each year for the honor of their branch of service.

Events in the 2019 games, which will take place in June in Tampa, Florida, include archery, cycling, shooting, sitting volleyball, swimming, track and field, wheelchair basketball, indoor rowing, powerlifting, and time trial cycling.

""When they win a medal, they win it for their team. And they don't play their national anthem. They play their service song,"" said retired Marine Maj. Gen. Juan Ayala, the director of the city's San Antonio Office of Military and Veteran Affairs.

The games can mean a great deal to wounded service members like Marine Cpl. Mathew Maddux.

Maddux, the Marines' ambassador for the 2020 games, was injured in 2017 when a malfunction in his tank caused a nuclear, biological and chemical system to overheat and combust next to him. The blast left him with burns on his face, impaired peripheral vision, vertigo problems and a prosthetic ear.

Waking up after the incident, Maddux said he knew right away life would be different. Like the Marine he is, Maddux learned to adapt and overcome, competing in the 2018 Warrior Games.

""I was the ultimate champion last year -- did all the sports,"" Maddux said. ""I got a bronze medal in the 4x100, like a relay team.""

More than physically, he says, the games helped him mentally.

""Mentally reassuring yourself that you can still go out there and be an athlete,"" Maddux said. ""Still go out there and still be in a fight.""

Ayala, who the 2015 Warrior Games when he was still in the Marines, says the competition is special.

""They're focused on the recuperative powers to make that athlete feel like he or she are back in the game, they're back in the unit, they're back in the fight,"" Ayala said.

Democratic senator threatens to block Treasury nominees over info on Trump's tax returns,https://thehill.com,[],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/finance/446187-senate-dem-threatens-to-block-treasury-nominees-for-answers-on-trumps-tax,"The top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday threatened to block nominees to the Treasury Department until the Trump administration answers questions about the handling of a Democratic request for the president’s tax returns.

“If the Treasury Department refuses to answer our questions, I am prepared to again place a hold on department nominees as I did previously when routine requests for information went unanswered,” Wyden said.

“Congress needs to take action to force the administration to comply with oversight.”

Senators occasionally place holds on nominees who they find highly problematic, or to extract concessions. A hold prevents the Senate from quickly confirming the nominee.

Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the Senate panel overseeing Treasury, is seeking information from the department on Mnuchin's decision to decline a House Democratic request for Trump’s tax returns.

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal Richard Edmund NealTrump antagonizes both parties on trade SECURE Act will give Main Street workers needed security White House starts clock on approval for new NAFTA MORE (D-Mass.) on April 3 requested six years of Trump's personal and business tax returns from the IRS. After a series of delays, Mnuchin told Neal in a May 6 letter that he would not comply with the request after consulting with the Department of Justice.

Neal then sent subpoenas for the returns to Mnuchin and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, which are likely to spawn a lengthy court battle.

In a May 14 letter, Wyden asked Mnuchin for copies of emails, memorandums and other communications detailing how Mnuchin came to his decision.

Wyden also asked Mnuchin for information on how the IRS handled previous congressional requests for tax returns, under section 6103(f) of the tax code, the same provision Neal cited in his request for Trump’s returns. That section states the Treasury secretary ""shall furnish"" tax returns requested by the Senate Finance or House Ways and Means committees.

In a Wednesday letter to Wyden, the Treasury Department only handed over copies of Mnuchin’s previous correspondence to Neal and a report on requests for returns under 6103 in 2018.

Wyden called the reply “unresponsive and wholly unacceptable.”"
Trump's ethanol plan goes into effect,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/trumps-ethanol-plan-goes-into-effect,"The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday officially opened up year-round sales of higher ethanol fuel blends, called E15, fulfilling a promise President Trump made to Iowa corn farmers.

Trump has firmly backed the year-round sale of 15% ethanol fuel, despite opposition by the oil industry and refiners who argue the fuel would harm vehicle engines.

The E15 rule, a boon to corn farmers, follows billions of dollars the administration has doled out to farmers as compensation for the losses they've suffered from tariffs imposed in the trade war with China.

Farmers and the ethanol industry have been calling for the reversal of EPA's Reid vapor restrictions on the fuel for years to allow E15 to be sold year-round, instead of just in the winter, spring and fall months.

Allowing E15 to be sold in the summer opens the ethanol market up to the largest driving season of the year, with farmers expecting to see demand rise for the corn-based fuel.

Most of the U.S. gasoline supply already contains 10% ethanol. The 15% blend is being sold by such large gasoline chain stores as Sheetz and KwikStop in anticipation of the rule's rollout.

Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley recently told the Washington Examiner that the ethanol rule would give Trump an edge over his Democratic rivals in the 2020 presidential election. He explained that it would be hard for his rivals to demonstrate the same commitment to farmers as Trump has in passing this new rule.

Nevertheless, Grassley and fellow Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said that Trump's trade wars could cancel any of the gains the ethanol rule would provide for farmers.

EPA is also granting waivers to oil companies allowing them to forgo blending ethanol under the Renewable Fuel Standard program. The RFS requires refiners to blend renewable fuels in the nation's gasoline and diesel supplies. The ethanol industry argues that the refinery waivers are destroying demand for their product.

Industry lobbyists say allowing the sale of E15 year-round cannot make up for the effect of the waivers, which effectively reduce the amount of ethanol by over a billion gallons annually. Oil refiners say the ethanol industry's claims are exaggerated."
"DOJ watchdog: Former FBI official illegally leaked court docs, disclosed 'sensitive' information and took gift from media",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-watchdog-finds-fmr-fbi-deputy-assistant-director-leaked-sensitive-information-took-gift-from-media-but-declines-prosecution,"The Justice Department's internal watchdog announced in an investigative summary released Wednesday that an unnamed former FBI deputy assistant director engaged in ""misconduct,"" including leaking ""sensitive"" information to the media, violating federal law by disclosing sealed court records and taking a gift from someone in the media.

Nevertheless, the inspector general (IG) indicated, without explanation, that ""prosecution of the DAD [deputy assistant director] was declined."" The investigation's findings will be referred to the FBI for potential further action, the IG said.

The official became the second high-level FBI employee to be formally rebuked by the IG over media contacts seen as improper. Former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe was fired from the bureau in March 2018 by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions after an inspector general report revealed that he ""lacked candor"" when discussing his communications about federal probes with members of the media.

The IG first indicated in its June 2018 report on DOJ and FBI misconduct that ""although FBI policy strictly limits the employees who are authorized to speak to the media, we found that this policy appeared to be widely ignored during the period we reviewed.""

The IG, flagging what it called an apparent ""cultural"" problem at the bureau, said at the time it would announce the conclusion of multiple separate ""investigations"" into the matter at a later date. The Wednesday report appeared to be the opening salvo in those reports. A distinct, comprehensive IG report covering a variety of additional matters, including potential FBI surveillance abuses, is expected in a matter of weeks.

John Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, and John Huber, the U.S. attorney in Utah, are conducting independent parallel probes into the FBI and DOJ. Last week, President Trump authorized Attorney General William Barr to declassify and release materials pertinent to the reviews.

The investigative summary released Wednesday specifically found by a preponderance of evidence that the DAD had ""engaged in misconduct when the DAD accepted a ticket, valued at approximately $225, to attend a media-sponsored dinner, as a gift from a member of the media, in violation of federal regulations and FBI policy.""

STRZOK'S SPECIAL COUNSEL PHONE TOTALLY WIPED BY RECORDS OFFICER WHO ASSUMED NOTHING IMPORTANT WAS ON THERE

The report also assessed that the DAD ""disclosed to the media the existence of information that had been filed under seal in federal court, in violation of 18 USC § 401, Contempt of Court, provided without authorization FBI law enforcement sensitive information to reporters on multiple occasions; and had dozens of official contacts with the media without authorization, in violation of FBI policy."" Contempt of court can be punished by a jail term or a fine, at the court's discretion.

Media leaks played a central role in advancing the narrative that the Trump campaign may have colluded with Russia, and Republican lawmakers have charged that the FBI and DOJ planted sensitive information to further their own political and investigative goals.

The FBI, for example, extensively relied on news articles -- including one from Yahoo News -- to obtain a surveillance warrant to monitor former Trump aide Carter Page. The FBI did not inform the FISA court that the Yahoo article relied on a source that, according to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the FBI knew was politically motivated. Internal FBI text messages obtained by Fox News also show FBI brass fretting that a senior DOJ officials had similar concerns about a FISA source's bias.

And text messages between ex-FBI employees and former lovers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, unearthed last year, revealed that government officials were ""leaking like mad"" in the run-up to the Trump-Russia collusion probe.

""In addition to the significant number of communications between FBI employees and journalists, we identified social interactions between FBI employees and journalists that were, at a minimum, inconsistent with FBI policy and department ethics rules,"" the IG wrote in June. ""For example, we identified instances where FBI employees received tickets to sporting events from journalists, went on golfing outings with media representatives, were treated to drinks and meals after work by reporters, and were the guests of journalists at nonpublic social events.""

The IG concluded by describing ""the harm caused by leaks, fear of potential leaks, and a culture of unauthorized media contacts.""

""We do not believe the problem is with the FBI’s policy, which we found to be clear and unambiguous,"" the IG added. ""Rather, we concluded that these leaks highlight the need to change what appears to be a cultural attitude.""

"States Can’t Block Legal Hemp Shipments Within Their Borders, USDA Says",https://www.marijuanamoment.net,['Kyle Jaeger'],05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.marijuanamoment.net/states-cant-block-legal-hemp-shipments-within-their-borders-usda-says/,"Advocates, industry representatives, regulators, health professionals and marijuana legalization opponents stood up before the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday to share their perspectives on how to best approach regulating the cannabis compound CBD.

There are lots of questions, including many related to safety we will need to answer to ensure that FDA is taking an appropriate, well-informed, and science-based approach to the regulation of cannabis and cannabis derivatives, including CBD. — Dr. Ned Sharpless (@FDACommissioner) May 31, 2019

The first-of-its-kind public meeting is meant to inform the FDA’s approach as it considers developing alternative pathways to regulate cannabidiol, which is not currently permitted in the food supply or as a dietary supplement.

Here’s a look at the discussions that took place at the event:

Advocates and opponents

Jonathan Miller, general counsel at U.S. Hemp Roundtable, said there is “an urgent need for an efficient regulatory framework for CBD” and noted that it was the intent of Congress to provide for the marketing of hemp-derived CBD products when it passed the 2018 Farm Bill, federally legalizing the crop and its derivatives.

Interestingly, Miller said his organization has been working with lawmakers in recent weeks to draft standalone legislation to regulate CBD if the FDA determines that the task is too complicated for the agency to complete on its own. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), who led the charge on hemp legalization, previously suggested that further legislative action may be necessary to unlock the full potential of the hemp economy.

The National Cannabis Industry Association (NCIA), which represents a wide range of industry stakeholders, made a similar argument in its testimony.

Andrew Kline, the group’s director of public policy, said “we strongly recommend [that] FDA act quickly to clarify the regulatory environment.”

“Because there are significant confusions in the market, businesses don’t know what is legally permissible and some are making health claims in the absence of clear regulatory guidance,” he said. “Most significantly, banks and payment processors don’t understand [the regulatory rules] and as a result many CBD companies are at risk of losing financial services.”

NCIA also provided the panel with extensive written testimony it compiled from more than 100 industry representatives, scientists and attorneys in support of establishing clear regulatory guidelines for CBD.

“The bottom line is this: an overwhelming preponderance of evidence indicates that cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds present minimal safety concerns,” Kline said. He added that the FDA should create universal testing and labeling requirements to “help protect the public from health and safety risks.”

On the opposing side, members of the anti-legalization group Smart Approaches to Marijuana (SAM) Canada and the Marijuana Victims Alliance offered testimony that touched on CBD regulations but mostly served to express opposition to marijuana reform more broadly.

“The public is up against a narrative that is at war with science,” SAM Canada’s Pamela McColl said. She claimed that marijuana is addictive, leads people to harm themselves and damages DNA.

“The subversion of truth and science and what is going on in North America [is a source of] great concern and reason to pause and do risk assessments on these drugs and analyze the influence of the billionaires and in the industry that have influenced public sentiment and dictated a very deceitful campaign,” she said.

Sally Schindel, the representative from Marijuana Victims Alliance, said that her son committed suicide, which she attributed in large part to his cannabis use.

“What we need is our federal government enforcing federal laws,” she said. “We need FDA to be more involved and take a leading role in marijuana research and policy formation.”

Shawn Hauser, a hemp and cannabinoid attorney with the law firm Vicente Sederberg LLP, represented the Cannabis Trade Federation at the hearing. “The appropriate regulation of products containing lawful cannabinoids already exists, and that data arising out of the state-regulated regime supports such regulation,” she said.

But “whether right or wrong, the current situation has created a vacuum. It opens the door to bad actors,” which ought to inform the FDA’s next steps.

“Cannabis products can be safely regulated under the existing dietary supplement framework and where products are intended for non-medicinal purposes, it is appropriate to regulate them as such,” she said. “The years of data from these state regulatory regimes are an important source of data for the agency to consider in determining the regulatory pathway. We stand ready to advance to the next level as a partner with FDA in effective federal regulation of cannabinoid products.”

Regulators

Represents from state regulatory agencies in Virginia, Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania also addressed the uncertainty that’s prevalent throughout the industry without updated FDA guidelines.

“Currently, states are struggling with the lack of sound scientific research available in CBD and long-term health impacts, including those to children,” Pam Miles of the Virginia Department of Agriculture, said. She added that her department “is hopeful that FDA will begin to supply significant leadership as it related to CBD, including research related to its health impacts.”

Brenda Morris, representing the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, talked about the “patchwork of laws” surrounding CBD and how that has fostered an environment where “anything is allowed.”

“Without the FDA’s guidance and leadership, individual states may carve out their own regulatory exceptions for CBD,” Joseph Reardon of the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, said, noting that his state’s hemp industry has greatly expanded in recent years. “We urge the FDA to resolve the statutory issues and properly establish a legal pathway for CBD products to enter the market place.”

I’d like to thank @DrAbernethyFDA, Lowell Schiller & the FDA staff for organizing a productive hearing on products containing cannabis/cannabis derivatives. Also, thanks to the public for your comments & participation. You can submit comments through 7/2. https://t.co/z5ghSj1yBW pic.twitter.com/Ai8w3zuHy7 — Dr. Ned Sharpless (@FDACommissioner) May 31, 2019

Health and consumer advocates

The Alzheimer’s Association argued that existing research is insufficient to substantiate claims about the therapeutic potential of cannabis for Alzheimer’s and dementia. The group said the “lack of evidence creates a substantial risk for individuals and their families.”

The American Epilepsy Society expressed similar concerns, despite CBD being an FDA-approved drug in the treatment of seizures in the form of Epidiolex.

“We support reducing regulatory barriers to research of cannabis-derived compounds,” a representative for the group said. “We strongly urge the FDA to classify the compounds and drugs under the complete jurisdiction of the FDA. We also advocate for ongoing studies on the efficacy of cannabis drugs.”

Ashley Morgan of the American Veterinary Medical Association told the FDA panel that “we believe there is therapeutic potential in the development of cannabis-derived and cannabis-related compounds and we would like to see the potential realized.”

“We believe FDA must seriously consider the need for efficacy and safety data when therapeutic claims are made” about CBD products, she said. “To facilitate the development of such products for veterinary use is imperative [for the FDA to] provide pathways to ensure the regulatory clarity and predictability and economic viability of the industry. The agency must make enforcement priorities known and consistently and intentionally act on the priorities.”

Another interesting testimony came from Larry Walker at the University of Mississippi, which is currently the site of the nation’s only federally authorized marijuana manufacturer for research purposes. He raised some concerns about potential adverse effects of CBD but made a series of recommendations to the FDA about how to minimize risks.

“A possible path forward, it seems to us, is prudent to have a multitrack approach with these products that are cannabis-related,” Walker said.

“It would be outstanding if the FDA could conduct some basic studies in this realm. It is a national need,” he said. “We need a national testing program for cannabinoid quality and standardization, a national adverse reporting program for whatever products are out there and a rapid response program for products where there are serious incidents. We need analytical backup on many of these things where the serious incidents have occurred. Finally, if possible, together research outcomes in the state medical programs.”

Sue Sisley, an internal medicine physician at the Scottsdale Research Institute, expressed frustration over the fact that the DEA “has not processed” applications to increase the number of authorized manufacturers for research-grade cannabis “despite members of Congress repeatedly urging” the agency to do so.

“Sadly, because of the limitations with the current drug supply, we are forced to import study drugs from a Canadian manufacturer and that is disappointing to us,” she said. “We would like to see our own domestic variety of domestic manufacturers. The point is that researchers need access to options. Scientists need options when it is to embolden scientific freedom.”

James Beck, representing the Parkinson’s Foundation, noted that while traditional pharmaceuticals can treat some of the symptoms Parkinson’s patients experience, many remain unaddressed, leaving the community “seeking alternative ways in which to control the symptoms.”

He said that marijuana doesn’t seem to treat tremors, but “it may be helpful on a targeted level for nonmotor symptoms, sleep, anxiety.”

“Bottom line, we really need more research to understand the utility of cannabis for Parkinson’s disease,” Beck said. “I don’t know that there’s very other circumstances we have a drug that is life-saving.”

Jacqueline French of the Epilepsy Foundation said that the group wants the FDA to “preserve access to CBD for those who need it as a life-saving medication.” However, she emphasized the need to create “manufacturing standards” to avoid contamination from mold and other contaminants.

Americans for Safe Access’s Heather Despres talked about standards that her organization has developed, recommending that the FDA consider integrating some of their best practices on “cultivation, manufacturing, distribution and laboratory operations.”

“There are many challenges facing the cannabis industry. There are solutions available,” she said. “We have worked with state regulators to develop and implement a standard, [and] we look forward to working with you, together, to help implement those standards.”

FDA reaction

Amy Abernethy, the FDA principal deputy commissioner who helped organize the public meeting, identified several themes that emerged during the talks.

In general, there is a need to “further clarify the regulatory framework to reduce confusion in the market,” to provide that clarification in timely manner, to collect data on CBD to ensure that the products are safe and to create labeling standards so consumers know what they’re getting.

Here is some of what I am hearing… First, there is a need to further clarify the regulatory framework to reduce confusion in the market. The product questions apply to people and animals. — Dr. Amy Abernethy (@DrAbernethyFDA) May 31, 2019

Key questions about product safety need to be addressed. Data are needed to determine safety thresholds for CBD; datasets/information should be objective, of adequate quality and available for transparent review. Lab testing and data analyses need to be replicable. — Dr. Amy Abernethy (@DrAbernethyFDA) May 31, 2019

Consumers need consistent information and labeling. State/government entities need support in knowing what to do. And we really need to understand the implications for children when they take CBD-containing products at different dosage ranges. More updates later today. — Dr. Amy Abernethy (@DrAbernethyFDA) May 31, 2019

Another theme that seemed to develop is the lack of information about dosing guidelines. Several experts who testified were unable to give clear answers to the FDA panel when asked about what the proper doses are in different contexts, and what their affects on consumers are.

Many people use these products. For CBD, info presented suggests that many consumers think that regulatory pathways are fully in place to keep products safe. Meanwhile speakers reinforced that regulatory pathways are unclear. We must sort this out in service of public health. — Dr. Amy Abernethy (@DrAbernethyFDA) May 31, 2019

Today’s meeting illuminated many different issues encountered by manufacturers, researchers, local governments, etc (e.g., labeling, marketing, access to research product, terminology, manufacturing, standards). — Dr. Amy Abernethy (@DrAbernethyFDA) May 31, 2019

Systematic studies are needed. It sounds like a number of studies are available or underway. We also wonder if real-world evidence derived from electronic health records, personal monitors, administrative data, etc, can be used to address critical questions in this space. — Dr. Amy Abernethy (@DrAbernethyFDA) May 31, 2019

I suspect that the public docket will expand our understanding, add new information, and reinforce observations today. We will work as quickly as possible to define a way forward. Appreciate a speaker’s observation: “You guys have a tough job. Good luck with that.” Indeed. — Dr. Amy Abernethy (@DrAbernethyFDA) May 31, 2019

Interested parties can submit public comments to FDA’s docket on CBD issues through July 2.

This story was updated to include testimony delivered later in the day.

"Trump vows 'dramatic' action at border, as DHS vows to go after human smugglers",https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-vows-dramatic-action-border-dhs-vows-human/story?id=63372471,"President Donald Trump on Thursday vowed ""very dramatic"" action to address the refugee crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, saying he would make a ""big league statement"" later in the day or Friday, but otherwise providing few details on how he planned to up the pressure on his signature and divisive issue.

""It will be a statement having to do with the border and having to do with people illegally coming over the border,"" Trump said."" And it will be my biggest statement, so far, on the border. We have brought something to the light of the people. They see now it's a national emergency, and most people agree. The Democrats agree, too, but they won't give us the legislation you need to fix it.""

The president teased the announcement as he left the White House on a trip to Colorado but revealed little when reporters pressed him for more.

""Right now, when you catch somebody, you have to release them,"" Trump answered, blaming Democrats. ""They won't give us the legislation. Whether it's chain migration or whether it's a lottery, they won't give us any. And the asylum procedures are ridiculous. No place in the world has what we have in terms of ridiculous immigration laws.""

Trump's latest political move on illegal immigration comes as administration officials told ABC News in Guatemala that they are now targeting transportation networks for migrants with the same focus and effort as drug smugglers.

It’s the latest push by the administration to try to contain the crisis at the border that’s overwhelmed border communities and tested Trump’s “America First"" policy.

Migrants families are arriving in record numbers this year, with officials expecting to handle some 1 million people at the southern border this year -- double the number of last year. The reasons are complex, ranging from poverty to threats from gangs to weather-related disasters that have wiped out farmland.

The Trump administration also blames court-ordered limits on the ability to detain children past 20 days, insisting that has only encouraged travelers to bring children with the promise of a quick release where they will able to live and work waiting for an overwhelmed immigration court system to take up their case.

Critics counter that the president has done little to address the humanitarian crisis in Central America and say his threats to close the border and build a wall may have even encouraged the latest rush of asylum seekers.

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan tells ABC’s Matt Gutman in an interview in Guatemala this week that he was visiting the country to forge a new relationship with the country's security forces. The goal is to break up human smuggling networks that are charging people some $6,000 to $7,000 to reach the U.S.

McAleenan called Guatemala the ""epicenter"" of the migration issue with 40 percent of the migrants arriving at the border coming from there.

""We've got to work with them here to address these smugglers at the front end of the process,"" McAleenan said in the interview.

That view – addressing the root cause of the migration and going after transportation networks -- has long been pushed by the Homeland Security Department, including under McAleenan's predecessor Kirstjen Nielsen. But with the president's repeated promise of ""America First,"" Trump has shown little appetite – at least publicly – to address the crisis through diplomatic channels and foreign aid.

This spring, the State Department announced Trump wanted to cut all direct assistance to Guatemala, as well as El Salvador and Honduras -- the three countries that represent the vast majority of asylum seekers arriving at the U.S. border.

“The president didn’t want me to leave. I may or may not go back into the administration at a later time,” Zinke told the Houston Chronicle. “I believe in the president’s vision of making sure America is strong and not held hostage. The world is a lot safer when America is strong.”

Zinke told the Chronicle he was open to returning to Washington after the 2020 elections.

The former Navy SEAL and Montana congressman announced he would leave his post at the Department of the Interior in December of last year, following a string of ethics investigations.

Zinke’s behavior spurred more than a dozen investigations into his conduct in office, including probes into whether he improperly blocked an American Indian casino project after a competitor’s lobbying and scrutiny over a land deal involving a foundation he led and a company backed by David Lesar, chairman of oilfield services company Halliburton.

Interior’s Office of Inspector General also found that Zinke violated department policies by letting his wife travel in government vehicles, but the office cleared him of potential violations related to his official travel, including flying on a jet owned by an oil executive and using a private plane on a trip that included a political fundraiser.

Zinke was dismissive of the investigations.

“There’s an allegation and the opposition demands an investigation with great fanfare,” he said. “Washington has become a city that has a lot of anger, a lot of hatred, a lot of fake news and false allegations. The two sides are trying to destroy each other rather than work together.”"
EPA's Fuzzy Math Not Helping Environment or Economy,https://www.realclearpolitics.com,[],05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/05/29/epas_fuzzy_math_not_helping_environment_or_economy_140438.html,"There’s nothing Washington loves better than a false dichotomy. Tax or cut. Spend or slash. Regulate or deregulate. Either you’re for the former or you’re for the latter. Well, that isn’t how life really works, and -- especially when it comes to regulation -- it certainly isn’t how manufacturers think. Everyone wants clean water and clean air, everyone wants an economy that delivers growth and opportunity, and neither idea is in conflict with the other. The challenge is how do we achieve both?

The answer is not to regulate too much or regulate too little, but simply regulate smarter. This is the common-sense idea underpinning a recent policy announcement from the Environmental Protection Agency -- something that manufacturers strongly support and, if fully enacted, something that could have the greatest positive impact on the future of American manufacturing than any other EPA action in recent memory.

Recently, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler (pictured) ordered his agency to develop reforms that would increase consistency and transparency in the consideration of costs and benefits in the EPA rule-making process. This may sound arcane, but it actually matters a lot. There is hardly any trust or balance in the current cost-benefit equation. Nor is there much transparency in the assembly process for rules and regulations that it relies on. For example, when the EPA measured the benefits of its carbon-reducing rules, it used a metric that counted benefits 300 years into the future. Of the 17 rules the EPA issued between 2000 and 2013 that cost $1 billion or more, more than 97% of the benefits claimed were from reductions of a single pollutant (particulate matter), which almost necessarily meant the EPA double-counted benefits from rule to rule.

On the cost side, the EPA regularly avoids a statutory requirement to examine the impact of its regulations on small businesses, even though small firms make up the supply chain of virtually every regulated industry. It has also displayed frustrating inconsistency from rule to rule in terms of the costs it measures. For instance, the agency’s 2010 fuel economy rule measured only the costs and benefits to cars, despite the fact that the rule simultaneously triggered New Source Review permitting requirements for millions of buildings by making greenhouse gases “regulated pollutants.”

In perhaps the most egregious example, the EPA once considered setting a standard for ozone so strict that the controls needed to meet it didn’t exist. In its cost-benefit analysis, the EPA simply called these “unknown controls” and assigned them a modest cost. We measured the true cost of these standards and arrived at a different conclusion: It would have been the most expensive regulation ever.

No one wins when an agency this important is forced to rely on a system this flawed. Overcounting benefits threatens environmental action by eroding trust in what the agency says and puts out. Undercounting costs threatens manufacturers, our economy and the livelihoods of countless middle-class workers and families who obviously bear the brunt when reality eventually sets in (as it inevitability must). No one should want either of these things, and no one should have anything to fear from a serious, reliable and consistent set of standards for measuring costs and benefits into the future. Having reliable data to go on and smarter regulations based off of that data will go a long way toward getting us all closer to the better future that -- in the end -- every American wants. Greener and cleaner. Stronger and more prosperous.

The EPA has done a good job over the years cleaning up the environment, and regulations are a big part of its success. What manufacturers need now is for the agency to get those regulations right the first time. We don’t want zero regulation. We don’t want massive regulation. We just want better regulation. The way to get there is through a smarter and more consistent evaluation of the costs and benefits that they rely on, just as the EPA administrator himself recently proposed. Now, it’s up to the administrator and his team to issue rules fixing this process for good."
"Changes underway at Aurora Housing Authority to address old problems, documents show",https://www.chicagotribune.com,['Sarah Freishtat'],06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/aurora-beacon-news/ct-abn-aurora-housing-authority-change-st-0602-story.html,"The troubled Aurora Housing Authority has undergone significant changes in the months since it has come under new leadership, according to documents and the new executive director.

The agency has taken steps to close out questionable contracts and update its policies, and to better manage finances that had been questioned by auditors, documents obtained by The Beacon-News show. The documents show the agency has also taken steps to disentangle itself from the Northern Lights Development Corporation, an affiliated developer that once had a questioned relationship with the agency.

Executive Director Ralph Jordan described the agency he took over in July as one in “crisis” and “chaos.” Since then, he said he has made changes to some financial practices and “stabilized” the housing authority and is now looking toward summer youth programs, housing improvements and expanding affordable housing opportunities in Aurora.

“Now, we can focus on real housing things,” he said.

Jordan took over a housing authority deemed “troubled” by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The agency was first faulted by HUD in 2017 for the year ending March 2016, when findings in an audit questioned spending, personal use of housing authority vehicles, record keeping and aspects of the agency’s relationship with the affiliated Northern Lights Development Corporation. For the year ending March 2017, HUD faulted the agency for its public housing occupancy rate and for its finances, though housing authority officials said at the time the financial issues were due largely to failure to submit an audit which they later submitted.

A 2017 Beacon-News investigation documented questionable expenses at the housing authority’s administrative offices and the close relationship between the housing authority and Northern Lights, which were both overseen by the former housing authority executive director. Among the investigation’s findings were that Northern Lights won at least two publicly-bid contracts from the housing authority, including one in which it did not offer the lowest estimated cost.

The previous director left in June 2017, and the agency was under interim leadership for the year before Jordan arrived.

The housing authority’s most recent audit paints a picture of an agency in administrative turmoil. It covers the year ending in March 2018, before Jordan’s arrival, and was made public by the authority at the end of April 2019. It found the housing authority wasn’t properly accounting for tenants’ security deposits and hadn’t followed the correct process for awarding some of its contracts. The agency wasn’t properly accounting for federal dollars from one program used to pay for expenses in another program and wasn’t adequately managing money for one housing program, the audit found. It again faulted the agency for aspects of its relationship with Northern Lights.

All told, the audit questioned $320,075 in specific costs, plus housing authority practices.

Jordan said the issues outlined in the audit were ones he inherited and have been addressed. A March 2019 response to the audit shows changes underway at the housing authority.

The agency has created designated accounts for tenants’ security deposits and is reviewing changes to the way it obtains contracts, according to the document. It converted to a new accounting model that helps the agency better track its finances, and is reimbursing housing programs where necessary. The document also outlines changes to Northern Lights’ practices and to the developer’s relationship with the housing authority.

Northern Lights had been defunct after the former executive director left, but it is once again functioning, Jordan said. He is planning to further change the relationship between Northern Lights and the housing authority as well as the name of the developer. Though the two will still be linked, no housing authority employees work for the developer — as they had previously — and the development company will no longer be used for day-to-day operations of the housing authority or for managing properties, he said.

Instead, Northern Lights will focus on new development and, possibly, helping the housing authority with social services, Jordan said.

“The housing authority money will be for the housing authority, and that’s it,” he said.

The housing authority continues to work on improving in other, operational areas, and has boosted its occupancy rate above 98%, Jordan said, a move he called a “big improvement over last year.” Staff members have worked to remove tenants he described as bad, and exterminate bugs. They have focused on building relationships with tenants through monthly meetings, he said.

Now approaching one year on the job, Jordan is looking to modernize housing authority properties and improve the roofs, though he is still waiting on HUD approval.

He is looking forward to a summer youth jobs program geared primarily toward residents of the housing authority that will have teens working on jobs such as cleaning up properties and undergoing “life skills training.” The agency has also partnered with the park district to offer a summer recreational program including sports and arts and crafts for children at three housing authority sites.

Moving forward, he plans to look at ways to provide more affordable housing in Aurora. He also plans to look at possibilities for 13 acres of land surrounding the Aurora Housing Authority’s office off Jericho Road, including applying for tax credits to build low-income housing for elderly residents. The site was once public housing but was torn down in 2012, and controversy surrounded the decision not to rebuild public housing at the site.

When Jordan took over, he found staff who were left aside and the focus seemed to be on the not-for-profit development corporation, he said. Since then, staff communication and teamwork have improved, and he has changed the focus of the organization, he said.

“My focus has been on my actual tenants that I have at my public housing sites,” he said. “And make sure that they live in conditions that are going to be better.”

Parrot Among Manufacturers Chosen by DoD for U.S Army Recon Drone Program,https://dronelife.com,[],05-29-2019,2019,5,https://dronelife.com/2019/05/29/parrot-among-manufacturers-chosen-by-dod-for-u-s-army-recon-drone-program/,"The U.S. Department of Defense is looking for “eye in the sky” technologies: personal reconnaissance drones that can give soldiers on the battlefield a situational advantage.

In an effort to uncover the next-generation of short-range Reconnaissance drones for the U.S. Army, the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) and the Army’s Maneuver Center of Excellence (MCoE) are investing $11m to identify and prototype new capabilities with commercial manufacturers.

The six chosen companies are based in the U.S, with the notable exception of French manufacturer Parrot. The remaining five are Skydio, Altavian, Teal Drones, Vantage Robotics, and Lumenier.

The solicitation was issued in November 2018, with the funding going towards the development of prototypes that can support soldiers on the ground with a rapidly deployable scouting capability.

There are a few criteria that have been set out by the DIU and the MCoE as part of the solicitation process. These include a flight time of around 30 minutes, a range of up to three kilometres, a weight of three pounds or less, and a time from standard-issue rucksack to launch of less than 2 minutes.

U.S Army looks for homemade solutions

With the obvious exception of Parrot, the ambition here is clearly to develop solutions with companies based in the United States.

It should come as no surprise that industry leader DJI is not taking part in the innovation effort. There are wider issues overshadowing this particular exploration of drone technology.

Last week CNN broke the news that DHS’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has warned that Chinese-manufactured drones pose a “potential risk to an organization’s information.”

Plus, President Trump recently signed an executive order effectively stopping U.S. companies from using telecoms equipment provided by Chinese firm Huawei as an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China continues.

Even though DJI has the tech to provide the required tools to the US Army and has done in the past, it looks as though any dealings with a Chinese manufacturer are off the table. In fact, all commercial off-the-shelf drones were prohibited by the Department of Defense in May last year.

Parrot could well turn out to be the beneficiary. Founder and CEO Henri Seydoux said, “Parrot is proud to have been selected by the Army to work on this highly strategic project. The United States has always been a major market for the Parrot Group, whether it is for our well-known consumer range or our advanced professional offering.

“We have always been at the forefront creating advanced, easy to use, compact and reliable drone-based solutions. We also perfectly understand how small unmanned aircraft, such as the Parrot ANAFI platform, have the potential to become a key part of the defense system.

We look forward to focusing our advanced R&D on meeting the high standards set by the U.S. Army, to integrate drone efficiency in their day to day operations and support the world-leading U.S army.”

As hinted by Seydoux, the ANAFI platform has been designed to be adapted to suit a range of different commercial purposes. The recent ANAFI Thermal would appear to tick most of the U.S Army’s boxes.

Much will depend on the extra capabilities the chosen manufacturers can come up with. It’s easy to imagine a Skydio R1 with a range of new, security-focused skills built on top of its autonomy engine, for example.

Elizabeth Warren says she wants to make it legal to indict presidents,https://www.vox.com,['May'],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.vox.com/2019/5/31/18647042/elizabeth-warren-trump-indictment-mueller,"Special counsel Robert Mueller said indicting President Donald Trump was “not an option” this week, citing a longstanding Justice Department policy that shields a sitting president from criminal indictments and prosecution.

Now Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) says she would change the policy as president.

Warren, among the first major Democratic 2020 candidates to call for Trump’s impeachment, released a two-part proposal on presidential powers Friday. First, she called on Congress to pass a law clarifying that the president of the United States is subject to the same federal criminal code as everyone else. Second, she pledged to appoint an attorney general and assistant AG who would change current Justice Department policy around indicting sitting presidents.

“Donald Trump believes that he can violate the law, and he believes that the role of the Department of Justice is to help him get away with it. That’s not how our country is supposed to work,” Warren wrote. “I pledge to nominate an [Office of Legal Counsel] head who will reverse the Watergate-era rule that a President cannot be indicted for criminal behavior.”

On Wednesday, Mueller reiterated he was operating under DOJ policy, as presented by the Office of Legal Counsel, that a sitting president cannot be charged with a federal crime.

“Under longstanding department policy a president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office,” Mueller said. “That is unconstitutional. ... The special counsel’s office is part of the Department of Justice and by regulation it was bound by that department policy. Charging the president with a crime was, therefore, not an option we could consider.”

To be clear, what Mueller is referring to is not something expressly written in the Constitution. It’s a large gray area in the nation’s body of law — which Warren says she would address as president.

The question of presidential immunity, briefly explained

The closest the Supreme Court has come to answering the question of presidential immunity recently is a 1997 ruling in Clinton v. Jones, which maintained that a president is subject to civil lawsuits. But whether a sitting president can be subject to criminal prosecution remains an unanswered question in the courts.

Upon review in 1973 and again in 2000, OLC concluded that the best way to address criminal charges is to wait until a president leaves office, leaving impeachment as the avenue for accountability.

As Vox’s Dylan Matthews explained, the most famous argument in favor of making presidents immune from criminal prosecution is from a 1997 law review article by Yale constitutional law professor Akhil Amar and a then-student of his, Brian Kalt, who’s now a law professor at Michigan State University:

Amar and Kalt argue that the president is a unique official, as the sole person ultimately in charge of the executive branch. “If he is arrested, so too is the executive branch of the government,” they write. This distinguishes him from a normal legislator or judge, who can be prosecuted, because there are plenty of other judges and legislators who can carry on their work. “Any distraction of the President from his duties is much more significant than similar distractions of these other, prosecutable officials, and has a much bigger impact on the well-being of the nation and all its People,” they conclude.

But even Kalt says this is unsettled territory. There is an argument to be made that the president should be subject to the same legal standard as everybody else, and that there are structures in place to address a president with “distractions” from his executive duties.

The investigation into Trump, and the special counsel report outlining evidence that Trump may have obstructed justice, has raised this issue into the forefront once again.

US police chiefs call for meeting with Homeland Security over immigration issues,https://www.houstonchronicle.com,"['Tom Jackman', 'The Washington Post', 'Aaron Wilson', 'John Mcclain', 'Chandler Rome', 'Ana Khan']",05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/article/US-police-chiefs-call-for-meeting-with-Homeland-13907048.php,"MIAMI - The police chiefs of America's largest cities on Thursday called on the federal Department of Homeland Security to meet with them as their departments struggle with the influx of immigrants from the southern border. The chiefs said they want to hear how federal immigration authorities plan to deal with relocating immigrants to their cities and how they will handle ""sanctuary city"" status declared by local governments, and the police want a voice in the federal policymaking process.

The Major Cities Chiefs Association, comprising the chiefs and sheriffs of the 69 largest law enforcement agencies in the United States, formed an immigration working group at its meeting here, led by Houston police Chief Art Acevedo, who has openly opposed a Texas law banning sanctuary cities. Acevedo and other chiefs here said they do not take immigration status into account when performing their duties, only whether someone is breaking the law or has been a crime victim. They see immigration enforcement as a federal responsibility, not one for local police.

On HoustonChronicle.com: In El Paso, system at 'breaking point' with surge of migrant families and no quick fix

""From our perspective,"" Acevedo said in an interview, ""there is no such thing as a 'sanctuary city' in terms of taking action against those who would do harm to members of our communities."" Police have long felt that taking on immigration enforcement by routinely checking a person's status will deter immigrants from reporting crime or cooperating with investigations. Acevedo said there had been a nearly 43 percent drop in reporting of sexual assaults in Houston by its Hispanic community in 2017.

The chiefs' working group wants to discuss the federal policy on Immigration and Customs Enforcement civil detainers for undocumented immigrants, which a number of police departments and jails have refused to recognize since they are not criminal warrants. They also want to talk about the issue of notifying ICE before releasing prisoners who have immigration detainers. ""The immigration authorities have to pick them up,"" Acevedo said. ""We don't turn them over.""

Some chiefs told Acevedo that their local social service agencies are being overwhelmed by busloads of suddenly relocated immigrants. ""There needs to be a sense of urgency,"" Acevedo said, ""when we see asylum seekers that are being distributed throughout the country. We need to know what is the plan and what is the impact on public safety. We need to be part of the discussion because while immigration enforcement is a federal issue, these decisions have an impact on the safety and security of the American people, and that is our primary responsibility.""

Emails show Trump EPA overruled career staff on Wisconsin air pollution,https://www.reuters.com,"['Timothy Gardner', 'Min Read']",05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-epa-smog/emails-show-trump-epa-overruled-career-staff-on-wisconsin-air-pollution-idUSKCN1SY2BP,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Politically appointed U.S. environmental officials last year overruled concerns of career scientists about air pollution in a Wisconsin county where U.S. President Donald Trump has pushed for a factory to be built by Foxconn Technology Co, newly released internal emails show.

FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump (C) takes part in a groundbreaking with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker (L) and Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou during a visit to Foxconn's new site in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, U.S., June 28, 2018. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque

Trump has been a supporter of the Taiwanese technology giant Foxconn building a flat screen factory in Racine County Wisconsin, a project the company said could create up to 13,000 jobs. He announced the project at a ceremony in 2017 and has claimed it is proof of his ability to revive U.S. manufacturing. Former Wisconsin governor Scott Walker, a Republican, helped secure about $4 billion in tax breaks for the project.

But Racine County has suffered some of the state’s worst cases of smog, also known as ozone, pollution that causes premature deaths from lung and heart complications.

The emails obtained by the Sierra Club and Clean Wisconsin under a freedom of information request show Trump administration officials, including then-administrator Scott Pruitt, overruled career EPA scientists to exempt Racine County from a list of counties that break smog standards. That has freed Foxconn from having to make millions of dollars in pollution control devices, if the project is eventually built.

The Racine County case is latest example of the administration overlooking concerns flagged by agency scientists over other issues such as climate change or hazardous chemicals.

“My background is in air pollution health effects and more specifically on acute exposures, so for me personally this is hard to digest and support,” Lars Perlmutt, an EPA scientist, wrote to colleagues in an April email last year about pressure to make the exemption, one of the emails shows.

Jenny Liljegren, a scientist in the air and radiation division in EPA’s Midwest region, said she was “in disbelief” about the pressure from officials to make the exemptions. “I do not see a sound technical basis for the areas we are being directed to finalize in Wisconsin.”

In an exchange of emails with Liljegren, another EPA scientist, Eric Svingen, complained that Wisconsin “cherry picked” air quality data over wider areas of the state to suggest that emissions that form smog were not ultimately doing so within the Wisconsin borders.

“These emails show is that the political leadership appeared to be injecting itself in this process in a way that’s contrary to having fact-based decisions,” said Janet McCabe, head of air quality at the EPA under former President Barack Obama.

Foxconn did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In April the company, an Apple Inc supplier, said it was committed to its contract to build the flat screen plant and research facilities in Wisconsin.

EPA spokesman Michael Abboud referred questions about the emails to a brief the agency filed May 10 in the case. The brief said that EPA considers a wide range of information in deciding which areas are in compliance with air pollution rules and that “each designation is intensely fact-driven.”

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Illinois, which neighbors Wisconsin and could see greater levels of pollution, sued the EPA last year over the exemption in Racine County and the agency is also under pressure from lawsuits from environmental groups.

In the May 10 brief, the EPA asked a federal appeals court to take another look at the smog exemption decisions under Pruitt, but until the court makes any ruling companies do not have to purchase the pollution equipment."
Treasury Department Declines to Designate China a Currency Manipulator,https://www.wsj.com,"['Josh Zumbrun', 'Josh.Zumbrun Wsj.Com']",,,,https://www.wsj.com/articles/treasury-department-declines-to-designate-china-a-currency-manipulator-11559083328,"WASHINGTON—The Treasury Department on Tuesday passed on a chance to designate China as a currency manipulator but continued to highlight the nation’s currency practices as a source of concern.

“Treasury continues to have significant concerns about China’s currency practices,” the Treasury said in its semiannual currency report, which is the department’s formal opportunity to cite countries for maintaining undervalued currencies.

Return of the State Department news briefing,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Carol Morello', 'National Reporter Focusing On Foreign Policy', 'State Department']",05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/return-of-the-state-department-news-briefing/2019/05/28/60b804ef-d4d5-4073-b5b0-ee4e370d9a57_story.html,"The State Department spokeswoman was at the lectern again Tuesday, fielding questions from reporters about hot spots causing diplomatic agita.

Morgan Ortagus had some dismissive words for Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and the Iranian regime. She referred questions about a Middle East peace plan to the White House. She called Secretary of State Mike Pompeo “incredibly supportive” of President Trump and his foreign policy agenda.

Nothing Ortagus said was particularly groundbreaking. But the fact she was answering reporters’ questions at all was news in itself.

Ending an intermittent hiatus, the State Department’s regular news briefing is coming back. After a couple of off-camera practice runs such as Tuesday’s, on-camera briefings are expected to resume later this week, possibly as early as Wednesday.

Ortagus has promised to try to answer questions almost every weekday when she is not traveling with Pompeo. That will come as a relief to diplomats posted at embassies around Washington who follow the briefings closely, listening for any admonitions of their government’s transgressions.

The resumption of news briefings also sets the State Department apart in an administration in which many normal practices have been abandoned.

The Defense Department has gone almost a year without a press-secretary briefing, though Kiss frontman Gene Simmons and actor Gerard Butler have both done star turns on the Pentagon podium.

The White House briefing room has been gathering dust since press secretary Sarah Sanders last showed up March 11 for only her second briefing of 2019. Trump has said he directed Sanders “not to bother” with the tradition, calling the press corps rude and inaccurate.

The State Department briefings, a fixture since the Eisenhower administration, have served a small, targeted audience looking for gleanings of a shift in U.S. foreign policy and reaction to events around the world. They amplify the United States’ message, provide guidance to embassies and diplomats in Foggy Bottom and underscore the American belief in transparency even in the case of questions from Tass and Pravda.

The State Department used to brief daily. But in the Trump administration, the timetable shrank to no more than twice a week, and often less.

Robert Palladino, the deputy spokesman, held the last briefing on April 11. That was barely a week after Ortagus was named as a replacement for Heather Nauert.

Ortagus is a Navy Reserve officer who was the spokeswoman for the U.S. Agency for International Development during the George W. Bush administration and worked in public diplomacy in Baghdad. She was an intelligence analyst and most recently a contributor on Fox News.

Ortagus describes herself as a foreign policy wonk who watched the televised State Department briefings when she was in college and had a printout portrait of former secretary Condoleezza Rice on her dorm-room wall.

In recent months, State Department officials have tried to “widen the aperture” of news organizations that cover Pompeo’s diplomacy, as Palladino was overheard telling a Christian broadcaster he invited to a briefing last month. They have invited reporters from Breitbart and the conservative website Townhall to accompany them on overseas trips while limiting the number of seats available to other media outlets."
Letter: Let’s keep the VA,https://www.concordmonitor.com,"['Ben Finley', 'Denise Lavoie -', 'Matthew Lee -', 'Michael Kunzelman -', 'David Brooks']",06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.concordmonitor.com/Keep-the-VA-25864259,"I am responding to Archie Richards’s letter “Privatize the Veterans Administration” (Monitor letters, May 27).

In it, he got one thing correct. The VA is one of the best examples of socialism in the United States, next to every branch of the U.S. military. Lest citizens forget other examples of socialism: guaranteed public education; public libraries and transportation; roads and highways; social security; Medicare/Medicaid; public universities and parks; public parking; police and fire departments, etc.

Philip Longman, author of Best Care Anywhere: Why VA Health Care Is Better Than Yours, says: “The enemies of the VA include the Koch brothers who, fearful of the spread of socialized medicine, are funding a well-coordinated campaign (including support for the group Concerned Veterans for America) to discredit its only true example in the United States, which is the veterans health care system. And they include giant corporate health care systems that stand to gain billions in taxpayer dollars from the privatization or outsourcing of veterans health care.”

Why destroy the VA as so many doctors are experts and collaborate on addressing veterans’ problems ranging from Agent Orange concerns, traumatic brain injuries, to the deleterious effects on our veterans of using high-caliber depleted uranium bullets and high-powered DU shells.

VA doctors and medical technicians have done extensive research and testing on veterans suffering from AO, TBI, DU and PTSD.

The VA does an exceptional job of meeting the unique needs and health conditions of veterans. Let’s keep it.

New 3D Fuel Modeling Helps Predict Fire Behavior,https://www.usda.gov,"['Posted Diane Banegas', 'Research', 'Development', 'Forest Service In']",05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2019/05/31/new-3d-fuel-modeling-helps-predict-fire-behavior,"Research and Science Posted by Diane Banegas, Research and Development, Forest Service in Forestry

Land managers have a new tool in their firefighting arsenals that models forest fuels in three dimensions. These 3D fuel models have the potential to make firefighting and the management of controlled burns safer and less costly while helping to protect valuable natural resources.

The 3D fuels modeling technique will benefit land managers by allowing firefighters to develop better strategies and helping predict future fire behavior. It was recently tested at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida.

Managers will be able to input 3D fuels from this research into next-generation fire behavior models. This will allow them to test different ignition patterns for a prescribed burn to see how the resulting fire behaves in 3D.

Running 3D simulations can help firefighting teams develop strategies to manage or extinguish future fires as safely and economically as possible.

“These fire models can output various scenarios of fire behavior that help inform quick management decision making,” said Louise Loudermilk, a research ecologist at the USDA Forest Service’s Southern Research Station. The model can also give “burn bosses” choices on selecting the safest approach to meet management and ecological controlled burning objectives while better predicting smoke conditions.

“This work represents a new era in fuels research because it links fuel ecology with fire behavior. In fire behavior models, fuels traditionally are overgeneralized and have been unable to represent how fuels predict fire behavior. Now fuels can be represented dynamically in three dimensions,” Loudermilk said. “This advancement, which has taken over 10 years to achieve, is like going from a board game to a realistic video game.”

The modeling technique combines aerial and terrestrial LIDAR data coupled with new 3D field sampling, historical data about when an area last burned and simulation modeling to provide 3D fuel characterization at multiple scales. Data collected from a landscape of interest includes vegetation type, fuel mass and fuel volume, all represented in 3D.

Loudermilk co-authored a research paper about a new method of field sampling used for this modeling technique. “The method works equally well across small or large landscapes,” she said. “Our goal is to provide big data collections that will one day be downloadable for anyone to use.” She also contributed to a book chapter about the 3D modeling technique and the importance of fuels research. A related paper in Forest Ecology and Management explains how the status and trends of plant diversity can be monitored at a landscape-scale, information valuable for 3D fuels monitoring.

Ultimately, extensive 3D data collected on fuels will be available for landscapes across the United States. Any land manager will be able to select the data for their area and run 3D fire simulations for educational or fire management purposes.

The success of these projects has been dependent on Loudermilk’s extensive network of federal, state and private organization collaborators.
