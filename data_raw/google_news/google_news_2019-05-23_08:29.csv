Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kellyanne-conway-nancy-pelosi-trump-democrats,"White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, had a terse exchange after a meeting between President Trump and Democratic lawmakers was cut short on Wednesday.

Trump scrapped the meeting, which was slated as an opportunity to discuss the country's infrastructure, after Pelosi told reporters that the president ""engaged in a cover-up"" following a meeting with her caucus.

After Trump left the room, Conway asked the Speaker if she had a ""direct response to the president,"" Fox News confirmed.

""I'm responding to the president, not staff,"" Pelosi shot back.

Conway slammed Pelosi's dismissal of her.

""Really great. That’s really pro-woman of you,” the White House counselor is said to have responded.

The tense moment came before Trump blasted Democratic lawmakers with his remarks from the Rose Garden, telling reporters, ""I don't do cover-ups.""

“You can't do it under these circumstances,” Trump said about negotiating with Democrats. “Get these phony investigations over with.”

Pelosi doubled down on her accusation at the Center for American Progress 2019 Ideas Conference Wednesday afternoon.

“The fact is, in plain sight, in the public domain, this president is obstructing justice and he's engaged in a cover-up. And that could be an impeachable offense,” Pelosi said."
"Harriet Tubman $20 Bill Is Delayed Until Trump Leaves Office, Mnuchin Says",https://www.nytimes.com,['Alan Rappeport'],05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/us/harriet-tubman-bill.html,"“It is my responsibility now to focus on what is the issue of counterfeiting and the security features,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “The ultimate decision on the redesign will most likely be another secretary down the road.”

Replacing Jackson with Tubman was both filled with symbolism and marred by controversy.

Tubman was born into slavery, escaped and then returned to the South, where she led other slaves to freedom. She was a Union scout during the Civil War and later advocated women’s voting rights. Jackson orchestrated the removal of Native Americans from lands to the east of the Mississippi River and sent them marching west on the so-called Trail of Tears.

In 2017, speculation began that Mr. Trump might scrap Mr. Lew’s plan for the $20 bill when mentions of it were scrubbed from the Treasury Department’s website during a redesign.

Then, that August, Mr. Mnuchin made clear that Tubman’s future on the bill was in doubt.

“People have been on the bills for a long period of time,” he told CNBC. “This is something we’ll consider. Right now, we’ve got a lot more important issues to focus on.”

Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, recently introduced the Harriet Tubman Tribute Act and called on the Treasury Department to offer clarity on the status of the $20 bill. The legislation, if passed, would direct the department to place the likeness of Tubman on $20 Federal Reserve notes printed after Dec. 31, 2020.

“There is no excuse for the administration’s failure to make this redesign a priority,” Ms. Shaheen said. “Sadly, this delay sends an unmistakable message to women and girls, and communities of color, who were promised they’d see Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill.”

Supporters of the tribute act in the House — including Representatives Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, and John Katko, Republican of New York — also expressed frustration with the Trump administration over the delay."

Trump administration fights back against lone judges nixing policies ‘with the stroke of the pen’,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Shannon Bream', ""Shannon Bream Currently Serves As Anchor Of Fox News Channel'S"", 'Fnc']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-administration-fights-back-against-lone-judges-nixing-policies-with-the-stroke-of-the-pen,"Call it the power of one. Individual federal judges across the country have been issuing nationwide injunctions against the Trump administration in record numbers, blocking a range of executive policies from being enforced.

Now the Trump administration is fighting back, actively looking for a case to take to the Supreme Court in an effort to reassert the authority of the president and limit that of the judiciary.

TRUMP'S AGENDA HAMPERED BY TROUBLING NUMBER OF LOWER COURT INJUNCTIONS, BARR SAYS

""These nationwide injunctions have frustrated presidential policy for most of the President’s term with no clear end in sight,"" Attorney General William Barr said in a speech Tuesday. ""One judge can, in effect, cancel the policy with the stroke of the pen.""

Barr and Vice President Pence have been leading the very public effort to highlight what they say is a federal court system out of control. The administration makes the point nationwide injunctions have occurred more during this presidency than all others combined.

""We believe that needs to change,"" Pence said on ""Fox News @ Night"" last week. ""We believe that's really a distortion of the separation of powers and the balance of powers in our constitution. And so we're going to be looking for a case to take the issue of national injunctions all the way to the Supreme Court.""

A Fox News analysis largely supports the administration claims.

In President Trump's first year alone, federal judges issued 20 nationwide injunctions -- as many as president Obama’s eight years in office. Those included judges appointed by Republican as well as Democratic presidents.

The current number is more than three dozen -- on a range of hot-button issues -- especially immigration:

Rescinding grant money to sanctuary cities

Ending the socalled ""dreamers"" program for young undocumented aliens

Travel ban on certain Muslim majority countries -- a policy ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court last year.

Restrictions on transgender people joining the military

A planned citizenship question on the 2020 census

Several abortion and reproductive health policies, including administration efforts to suspend federal funding for family planning clinics that refer patients to abortion providers

Nationwide or universal injunctions have the effect of binding the government from implementing laws or policies -- maintaining the status quo at least until the issue is fully litigated. Most of the nearly 700 district court or trial judges confine their orders to the particular parties bringing suit -- and only in the region under the judge's control.

Some legal advocates say the shift is necessary: when the harm is nationwide -- so too must the legal relief:

""The suggestion that it's only very liberal judges putting a hold on president trump's policies is simply not true,"" said Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center. ""This is a matter of justice, it's not a matter of politics when it comes to the judicial branch.""

The ACLU is among the most active of advocacy groups requesting judges issue nationwide injunctions, and it has been mostly successful.

Last August a federal judge in San Diego issued an injunction requiring reunification of deported immigrant parents with their children. The judge refused an administration request to delay court-ordered deadlines sought by the Department of Homeland Security.

""The judge is refusing to let the government off the hook for the mess it made,"" said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project.

But the White House is pushing back, looking for the right case to present to the Supreme Court. But the issue likely would not be resolved in a presidential election year. But most legal experts say it will be ultimately resolved by the justices.

""I suspect the Supreme Court is going to weigh in at some point on this just because it nationwide injunction being increasingly prevalent in recent years,"" said Thomas Dupree, a former Bush principal deputy assistant attorney general. ""And there's a lot of unsettled law in this area about how far as a single district court's power projects. Can a single judge apply his or her ruling across the nation and different courts give different answers to that.""

The administration thinks it ultimately has a winning hand since Trump's two justices -- Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh -- now create solid conservative majority.

And Justice Clarence Thomas in particular is eager to address it.

""Universal injunctions are legally and historically dubious,"" he wrote last June in the Trump travel ban case. ""If federal courts continue to issue them, this Court is duty-bound to adjudicate their authority to do so."""

""We’re going to fact-check the sign he brought to today’s Rose Garden rant,"" Tapper said on his daily CNN program before diving into Trump's talking points about Mueller's probe into Russian interference.

Tapper began by calling out the stat that the special counsel's team spent more than $35 million throughout the course of the 22-month investigation. The host noted that it's not clear where Trump gathered that figure, but that the Justice Department said that Mueller's expenses were around $12 million by September 2018.

""The final price tag will no doubt be higher than that, but the data's not public. Where he got $35 million, no idea,"" Tapper said.

He then targets the claim that the investigation was led by ""18 angry democrats,"" noting that Mueller hired 19 lawyers and that Mueller himself is a ""well-known Republican,"" as well as former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein Rod RosensteinDemocrats talk subpoena for Mueller Klobuchar: 'Don't think' there are reasons to investigate Mueller probe's origins Democrats are running out of stunts to pull from impeachment playbook MORE. Rosenstein appointed Mueller and oversaw the investigation.

Tapper acknowledges that Trump is correct about length of the investigation, the amount of subpoenas issued and the number of witnesses involved.

But he takes issue with the poster's inclusion of the statements, ""No Collusion"" and ""No Obstruction."" Tapper notes that while Mueller did not find sufficient evidence to conclude a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Moscow took place, that it did identify numerous links between the two.

""Mueller specifically said that collusion was not a legal term and the report was not going to address it all,"" Tapper said, going onto note that Mueller made no conclusive determination regarding obstruction of justice.

""And if you read the report, Mueller in detail describes at least 10 instances which may have constituted obstruction. And Mueller clearly leaves it up to Congress to proceed,"" he said.

""There was a time in the Trump administration when his people would try to either explain his falsehoods as somehow in the neighborhood of something possibly accurate, or they would just change the subject,"" Tapper continues.

""But there has been a long slow slide into just taking his lies and asserting them to you. You are paying for those lies.""

Trump has continually railed against Mueller's probe, and on Wednesday used a placard describing facts from it to complement his criticism. The placard stood in front of Trump as he threatened to block infrastructure talks until Democrats' investigations into him finished."

Almost all researchers who work on the economic effects of climate change, trade policy and food stamps in the agency are being moved out of the capital in what they described to Politico as a political crackdown.

On March 5, the department began notifying people who were allowed to stay in Washington but didn’t provide a comprehensive list, only telling employees in person whether they had made the cut.

Current and former employees independently made a list, covering all 279 people on staff, which reportedly found that 76 are being allowed to stay in the capital.

The current and former employees told Politico the specialties of those being asked to move correspond closely to the areas where economic assessments often clash with Trump's policies, including tax policies, climate change and farms.

“This was a clear politicization of the agency many of us loved for its non-partisan research and analysis,” a current ERS employee told the outlet, claiming that department leaders picked those whose work was more likely to offend the administration and forced them to move “out or quit.”

""You can draw the conclusion that these are the less valued activities that are undertaken by ERS,"" said a former researcher who left last month in anticipation of being moved. ""They view ERS as being useful in that it produces data and statistics that can inform policy but the research that’s done by the economists and geographers and statisticians at ERS is less valuable and that they’re not concerned with a significant deterioration in ERS’ ability to do research.”

Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost to leave before year's end: Sources,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/border-patrol-chief-carla-provost-to-leave-before-years-end-sources,"U.S. Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost is expected to leave her post by December, according to several high-ranking former Department of Homeland Security and union officials with first-hand knowledge of the plan.

Provost, the first woman to lead the 95-year-old federal law enforcement agency, will retire by the year’s end, wrapping up her 24-year career, the Washington Examiner has learned.

The 48-year-old lifetime Border Patrol employee has served as permanent chief for less than a year. She was acting chief from April 2017 through August 2018 and officially took over late last summer after Robert Perez was confirmed by the Senate as deputy commissioner of Border Patrol’s parent agency, Customs and Border Protection.

Provost has led the agency’s 20,000 employees during a turbulent time as the organization struggles to handle the more than half a million people apprehended while illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in the first six-and-a-half months of fiscal 2019. It will also leave another hole in DHS, which has more than a dozen vacancies at the senior level.

“It’s not going well over there. The pressure’s outrageous,” said a former Customs and Border Protection leader who was aware of her forthcoming departure, who added she may leave earlier than December.

Two officials said Manuel ""Manny"" Padilla was most likely to take over when Provost leaves. Padilla is director of the Department of Homeland Security Joint Task Force West and served 30 years with Border Patrol. He was tapped in April to head the department's interagency emergency border cell.

Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection did not respond to requests for comment.

Provost joined the Border Patrol in her early 20s after working a short period as a police officer in her home state of Kansas. She worked in Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico. She went on to take over its Washington-based internal affairs office in 2015.

Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan credited her last August for her work in internal affairs and the lowering of firearm-related incidents even as assaults against agents jumped to a record high. However, an Intercept report last year showed assaults were being counted in a new way where each rock thrown at an agent counted as an assault.

Provost was endorsed by the National Border Patrol Council, the primary union for agents, at the time of her promotion to chief in early 2017.

“Carla is an agent's agent,” McAleenan said at the promotion announcement last August. “She's come up through the ranks.”

Since taking over Border Patrol as acting and permanent chief in early 2017, Provost has been on the receiving end of the Trump administration's attempts to go after unauthorized immigrants and thwart illegal immigration, including the family separations that took place during the ""zero tolerance"" policy.

Provost sat down with the Examiner last May and said one of her greatest frustrations was the amount of coverage on “anything that’s in a negative fashion.""

“I would tell you it doesn’t make it into the media generally because it’s not sexy,” Provost said. “I have seen and I’ve done it myself. Border Patrol agents — they apprehend people. They’re hungry and they’re thirsty. They go through a drive-thru on their way to take them in and they use their own money to buy them food and something to drink. I, many a time back in the day, ran through — whether it was McDonald's usually in Douglas because there wasn’t a lot of options — but agents do those things.""

On Monday, a 16-year-old unaccompanied Guatemalan boy died while in Border Patrol custody. The death marked the fourth minor to die in Customs and Border Protection custody this fiscal year and brought criticism from immigrant groups and Democratic lawmakers concerned about overcrowded conditions at government facilities on the southern border.

Mnuchin Presses Companies for Trade War Contingency Plans,https://www.nytimes.com,['Alan Rappeport'],05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/us/politics/irs-trump-tax-returns.html,"Walmart has said that it is working on strategies to mitigate the pain of the tariffs to keep prices low. A Walmart spokesman said that it was not unusual for the company to be in touch with White House officials.

“We’re viewed by Republican and Democratic administrations as an important bellwether of the economy and the health of the American consumer,” he said, “so it’s not uncommon that current and past administrations would reach out reach out to us on important issues like this.”

Retail analysts suggested that despite such efforts, companies cannot necessarily adjust their business plans as quickly as the trade winds blow.

“It is not something that can be changed overnight,” said Christopher Mandeville, an analyst at Jefferies. “Having said that, management has been aware of tariff risk for some time now, where, in circumstances that allow for it, they could shift sourcing to nearby countries in Southeast Asia.”

Mr. Mnuchin said that his “expectation is a lot of this business will be moved from China” and that there will be only a small number of items where tariffs are passed on to consumers.

While Mr. Mnuchin has privately cautioned against tariffs, on Wednesday he argued that depreciation of China’s currency could blunt some of the effects of the tariffs by making Chinese products cheaper to buy. He also said that it was yet not certain that the next round of tariffs would be imposed, noting that Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping of China will most likely meet at the G-20 summit meeting next month in Japan.

However, Mr. Mnuchin was far less optimistic about a deal than he was just a month ago.

“We were beginning to send out the date for the two presidents to meet and have a signing ceremony,” he said. “Unfortunately, China has taken a big step backward.”"

DOJ Attorneys Reportedly Ready to Block T-Mobile/Sprint Merger,https://gizmodo.com,"['Dell Cameron', 'About The Author', 'Privacy', 'Security', 'Tech Policy', 'Email', 'Dell Gizmodo.Com', 'Xmpp', 'Dell Jabber.Ccc.De']",,,,https://gizmodo.com/doj-attorneys-reportedly-ready-to-block-t-mobile-sprint-1834961808,"Photo: Jose Luis Magana / AP

To literally no one’s surprise, the head of the Federal Communications Commission on Monday announced Monday that he’d recommend approving the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint. But it now looks as if the Justice Department’s own attorneys vehemently oppose the merger.



Reuters reported Wednesday that the DOJ’s antitrust division has recommended filing a lawsuit to block the $26.5 billion deal. Citing two sources familiar with the matter, the news agency said the division’s staff have long been “skeptical” of the proposed merger, in that it does not appear to be in the best interests of consumers.

Per Reuters: “T-Mobile has a reputation for aggressively seeking to cut prices and improve service to woo customers away from market leaders Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc, and staff may want to preserve that dynamic.”

Ajit Pai, the FCC chairman, said earlier that commitments by T-Mobile and Sprint to close “the digital divide in rural America” and advance “United States leadership in 5G, the next generation in wireless connectivity,” has persuaded him to approve the deal.

FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr—only days after accepting an award from the nation’s largest wireless industry trade association—announced that he, too, was also swayed by the companies’ commitments and would support the chairman’s decision.

Praising his “ongoing leadership,” T-Mobile CEO John Legere thanked Pai for his support in a statement Monday, while promising the commitments T-Mobile agreed to are “verifiable, enforceable and specific.” But consumer advocacy groups and legal experts following the news disagreed entirely.

“Rather than actually examine the competitive impact, Chairman Pai’s recommended approval points to T-Mobile’s commitments and behavioral conditions,” said Yosef Getachew, media and democracy program director for Common Cause. “Not only are these commitments and conditions unenforceable and riddled with loopholes, they do nothing to address the blatant competitive harms the merger poses to consumers.”

Gigi Sohn, a counselor to former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, echoed those concerns in a Wired op-ed this week, writing that Legere’s assurances “are speculative, unsubstantiated, and entirely unenforceable.” Sohn went on to call T-Mobile’s vow not to raise prices for three years an “admission” that, should the merger be approved, “there would not be enough competition in the wireless market to constrain price increases.”

Pai’s announcement was also rebuked by, among others, New America’s Open Technology Institute and the Rural Wireless Association. FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, who is Democrat, compared the merger to “consolidation in airlines and with drug companies,” which she argued, “hasn’t worked out well for consumers.”

“The inadequate conditions [Pai] and his fellow GOP commissioners so readily and rapidly blessed are a tiny Band-Aid on what would be a fatal wound to wireless competition and affordability in this country,” said Matt Wood, vice president of policy at the advocacy group Free Press. “DOJ’s staff seems to get that, even if some of the political appointees leading the FCC don’t.”"
The Harriet Tubman $20 bill was set for 2020. Now the Trump administration says it won't happen for years,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Jason Silverstein'],05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/harriet-tubman-20-bill-2020-release-delayed-trump-administration-says-it-wont-happen-for-years-2019-05-22/,"Don't bet on seeing a Harriet Tubman $20 bill anytime soon. The redesigned bill bearing Tubman's face, which was supposed to debut next year, will not be coming out for nearly a decade, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said.

Planning started years ago to have Tubman replace former President Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill. Tubman, who was born into slavery and became a noted abolitionist and political activist, would be the first black woman to have her face on U.S. currency. The new bill was scheduled to be released in 2020 to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote.

But Mnuchin said Wednesday that it won't be happening under the Trump administration.

""It's not a decision that is likely to come until way past my term, even if I serve the second term for the president,"" Mnuchin told the House Financial Services Committee. ""So I'm not focused on that for the moment.""

In the Women on 20s grassroots campaign, which inspired bills in the House and the Senate, Harriet Tubman came out the frontrunner to replace President Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill, after more than 600,000 people cast ballots. WomenOn20s.org

Mnuchin said a redesign of the bill's security features will still come out in 2020. But the issue of changing how the bill looks ""most likely"" won't come up again until 2026, he said, and the new $20 bill won't be printed until 2028.

Mnuchin did not explain why the Tubman bill won't be produced on his watch. He also did not state whether he personally supports seeing Tubman on the money. ""I've made no decision as it relates to that,"" he said.

Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, who grilled Mnuchin about the Tubman plan, tweeted after the hearing: ""People other than white men built this county. And Sec Mnuchin agrees, yet he refuses to update our #currency.""

People other than white men built this county.

Mnuchin's predecessor in the Obama administration, Jack Lew, oversaw a 10-month process in which the public suggested hundreds of people whose portraits could appear on U.S. bills. He said that process ""inspired"" him to put Tubman on the $20 bill. The Treasury Department announced in April 2016 that it would work on getting the new bill out ""as quickly as possible.""

President Trump said during the 2016 campaign that he did not support putting Tubman on the 20, calling the plan ""pure political correctness."" He suggested instead having Tubman on ""the $2 bill"" or ""another bill.""

Mr. Trump has expressed admiration for President Andrew Jackson, who was a slave owner, and had a portrait of him put in the Oval Office."
"Mnuchin pegs debt ceiling deadline as 'late summer,' earlier than expected",https://thehill.com,[],05-22-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/finance/445056-mnuchin-pegs-debt-ceiling-deadline-as-late-summer-earlier-than-expected,"Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin on Wednesday said that the debt ceiling will need to be lifted by “late Summer,” earlier than some analysts had predicted.

“I haven’t been given an exact date, but I would say it’s late summer, and I share your concern and I urge Congress to raise the debt ceiling as soon as possible,” Mnuchin said at a House Financial Services Committee hearing.

The debt ceiling, which limits how much Treasury can borrow to pay off the government’s bills, was technically reached in March, but the Treasury Department has embarked on a series of “extraordinary measures” that allow it to borrow internally to keep paying bills.

If those measures run out before Congress passes and the president signs an increase to the limit, or suspends it altogether, the government would default on its bills, which could set off a global financial crisis.

Mnuchin testified that the economic impact of such an eventuality would be “significant.”

A study released earlier this month by the Bipartisan Policy Center estimated that the debt ceiling wouldn’t need to be lifted until October or even early November.

""Everybody understands this issue and I surely hope we never get to the point late summer where we're even contemplating these things,” Mnuchin said.

The new timing projection could be one reason why the White House has become amenable to including the debt ceiling in recent negotiations over spending caps.

Democrats familiar with the meetings said that the White House had originally hoped to delay striking a deal until closer to the deadline, anticipating that they could wring more concessions from Democrats. An earlier debt ceiling deadline could have interfered with that strategy.

Mnuchin Presses Companies for Trade War Contingency Plans,https://www.nytimes.com,['Alan Rappeport'],05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/us/politics/irs-trump-tax-returns.html,"Walmart has said that it is working on strategies to mitigate the pain of the tariffs to keep prices low. A Walmart spokesman said that it was not unusual for the company to be in touch with White House officials.

“We’re viewed by Republican and Democratic administrations as an important bellwether of the economy and the health of the American consumer,” he said, “so it’s not uncommon that current and past administrations would reach out reach out to us on important issues like this.”

Retail analysts suggested that despite such efforts, companies cannot necessarily adjust their business plans as quickly as the trade winds blow.

“It is not something that can be changed overnight,” said Christopher Mandeville, an analyst at Jefferies. “Having said that, management has been aware of tariff risk for some time now, where, in circumstances that allow for it, they could shift sourcing to nearby countries in Southeast Asia.”

Mr. Mnuchin said that his “expectation is a lot of this business will be moved from China” and that there will be only a small number of items where tariffs are passed on to consumers.

While Mr. Mnuchin has privately cautioned against tariffs, on Wednesday he argued that depreciation of China’s currency could blunt some of the effects of the tariffs by making Chinese products cheaper to buy. He also said that it was yet not certain that the next round of tariffs would be imposed, noting that Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping of China will most likely meet at the G-20 summit meeting next month in Japan.

However, Mr. Mnuchin was far less optimistic about a deal than he was just a month ago.

“We were beginning to send out the date for the two presidents to meet and have a signing ceremony,” he said. “Unfortunately, China has taken a big step backward.”"
Dem rebuked after calling child deaths ‘intentional’ in fiery exchange with DHS boss,https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dem-rebuked-after-calling-child-deaths-intentional-in-fiery-exchange-with-dhs-boss,"A hearing of the House Homeland Security Committee came to a screeching halt Wednesday when a Democrat had her words struck from the record after calling the deaths of children in custody at the border an ""intentional"" policy decision.

Rep. Lauren Underwood's questioning of Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan was contentious from the beginning, when the Illinois lawmaker asked him about the effects of separating children from their families at the border. She closed by claiming that the continued poor conditions in which children allegedly were being kept, and the recent death of a fifth child in custody, showed that this was the administration's goal.

US CLOSES TEXAS PROCESSING CENTER AMID FLU OUTBREAK AFTER TEEN MIGRANT'S DEATH

""At this point, with five kids that have died, 5,000 separated from their families, I feel like, and the evidence is really clear, this is intentional,"" Underwood said. ""It's a policy choice being made on purpose by this administration, and it's cruel and inhumane.""

McAleenan fired back, disputing Underwood's characterization.

""That's an appalling accusation, and our men and women fight hard to protect people in our custody every single day,"" he said. McAleenan added that his department asked for resources prior to the latest fatality and that Congress has not responded. He also said that DHS asked for changes ""that would have prevented this from happening.""

Underwood's comments were in reference to the government's announcement that a 16-year-old Guatemalan died Monday at a South Texas Border Patrol station. He was diagnosed with the flu on Sunday at a border facility, which was then temporarily closed.

Last week, a 2-year-old died after he and his mother were detained. Government officials said the child was taken to the hospital the same day his mother reported he was sick, and he was in the hospital for weeks. On April 30, a 16-year-old boy also died after officials at a Health and Human Services detention facility noticed that he was sick.

Underwood was given an opportunity to clarify her remarks, and she said the same thing, using virtually identical language. ""With five children dead and 5,000 separated from their families, this is intentional. It's a policy choice being made on purpose by this administration, and it's cruel and inhumane,"" she reiterated.

Ranking Member Mike Rogers, R-Ala., came to McAleenan's defense, calling out Underwood for her remarks.

""Mr. Chairman, you cannot impugn the character of the witness by stating that he intentionally murders children,"" he said. ""That is completely inappropriate, and her words should be taken down. She was very explicit.""

Underwood defended herself, saying she did not use the word ""murder,"" but said that deaths were the result of policy choices.

""He has said that he stands by the policy decisions of this administration, that's what he said at the beginning of his testimony.""

McAleenan said he ""did not say that at all.""

This eventually led to a vote over whether to take down Underwood's words from the record.

After a 9-7 vote, Underwood's words were taken down.

Internal memo orders military to restrict information it shares with Congress,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Missy Ryan', 'Reporter Covering The Pentagon', 'Military Issues', 'National Security', 'Greg Jaffe', 'National Security Reporter', 'May At Am']",05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/lawmakers-bristle-at-new-rules-for-sharing-pentagon-information-with-congress/2019/05/21/79315df9-d792-41df-a42e-10df9af7306e_story.html,"Acting defense secretary Patrick Shanahan has mandated new restrictions on the way the Pentagon shares information with Congress about military operations around the world, a move that is straining ties with key Republican and Democratic lawmakers.

In a May 8 internal memo, which was obtained by The Washington Post, Shanahan lays out the criteria for when Pentagon officials may provide congressional offices or committees information they request about operational plans and orders.

The memo comes as lawmakers from both parties complain that the Trump administration has withheld information that prevents them from executing their constitutionally mandated oversight role. Some lawmakers are also concerned about whether Shanahan has allowed the military to be drawn too deeply into President Trump’s immigration agenda.

“Congress oversees the Department of Defense; but with this new policy, the department is overstepping its authority by presuming to determine what warrants legislative oversight,” Reps. Adam Smith (D-Wash.) and Mac Thornberry (R-Tex.), the chair and ranking Republican of the House Armed Services Committee.

The memo was shared widely inside the Pentagon but was sent to key lawmakers only after inquiries by The Post. It outlines a half-dozen guidelines, including requirements that military officials and political appointees evaluate whether the request “contains sufficient information to demonstrate a relationship to the legislative function.” The memo urges Defense Department officials to provide a summary briefing rather than a requested plan or order itself.

The memo appears to have been inspired by concerns that lawmakers, who have security clearances, will not safeguard military plans. It calls on officials to assess “whether the degree of protection from unauthorized disclosure that Congress will afford to the plan is equivalent to that afforded” by the Pentagon.

Sen. Jack Reed (R.I.), the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the memo “seems to be another way in which they can claim that they don’t need to respond to legitimate inquiry of Congress.” Reed received the memo Saturday, shortly after The Post asked the Pentagon about it.

“From what I can glean from the memorandum basically they can use any factor they want to say no and they can make a determination what they think we need to do our job,” Reed said in an interview. “I think we’re better positioned to determine what we need to do our job.”

A defense official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe military officials’ thinking about the memo, said Pentagon leaders had been concerned about preserving the military chain of command and about the potential for congressional interference in what they consider to be an executive branch function, the formulation of military operations.

The official said that Congress had been most interested in learning more about Special Operations activities, which are among the most sensitive military operations but have also, in recent years, produced some of the biggest public backlashes.

“While I understand they’re not happy . . . we’ve gone from saying no to setting a process to adjudicate and consider saying yes,” the official said.

The guidelines represent a dramatic twist in a decades-long tug-of-war between the Pentagon and Congress over access to sensitive information.

While lawmakers routinely request information on a host of military matters, including weapons programs, personnel procedures and support to allies, they are also sometimes provided classified information about current or future military operations, which they are barred by law from disclosing.

The memo could complicate Senate confirmation hearings for Shanahan, who took over in January after his predecessor, Jim Mattis, resigned over differences with Trump. Shanahan is expected to appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee in June.

Lt. Col. Joe Buccino, a spokesman for Shanahan, said the new policy aims to increase “transparency and information sharing with Congress.”

Under Shanahan’s direction, Buccino said, “the Department of Defense has been engaging with the Senate and House Armed Services Committees to develop a process for providing Congress with access to plans and operational orders, including Executive Orders.”

While Trump has praised Shanahan, a former Boeing executive, numerous lawmakers have expressed skepticism about his ability to act as a counterweight to the president and his closest advisers in delicate matters of national security. Mattis labored to insulate the military from the country’s divisive politics and the White House, which won him plaudits from lawmakers but damaged his relationship with Trump.

Since taking on the top Pentagon job, Shanahan has presided over a deepening of the military’s involvement along the southern border, a mission Mattis viewed with skepticism but did not resist.

Some lawmakers see Shanahan’s decision to shift resources toward construction of a border wall, which has helped make up for Congress’ refusal to allocate funds for that purpose, as an effort to flout their prerogative.

In the new memo, Shanahan concentrates responsibility for evaluating congressional requests in the office of the undersecretary of defense for policy, which is typically led by a political appointee. Previously, officials across the Defense Department responded to requests on a more ad hoc basis, in keeping with what officials described as a “gentleman’s agreement” with lawmakers.

According to Reed, obtaining access to such information has become harder since Trump took office. Reed cited a 2017 operation in Niger in which four U.S. service members died, after which he said lawmakers had to “track down” the related operational orders and review the legal authorities under which troops were operating.

But officials from both the Pentagon and Capitol Hill agreed that a more formalized process for sharing information, if done in a mutually acceptable way, would be of value.

A former senior Pentagon official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly, said the memo did not appear to establish a more difficult process for routine congressional requests related to other oversight topics, including policy and budgetary issues.

“Rather, it appears to set an elevated, formal and mostly reasonable process relative to requests for a specific and especially sensitive subset of Pentagon materials provided the Pentagon doesn't seek to weaponize the process to frustrate a broader range of oversight requests, which would be deeply problematic,” the former official said.

Smith and Thornberry said they intended to address the sharing of operational information in this year’s defense authorization bill, which is now being drafted.

They appeared particularly galled by the memo’s suggestion that Congress might make sensitive information public, which they characterized as “inexcusable and inaccurate.”

“The Department is not in a position to evaluate defense committees’ worthiness to receive classified information, nor characterize our ability to appropriately protect it,” they said."
"Most presidents don't pardon murderers. Trump did, and may again.",https://www.cnn.com,['Analysis Zachary B.

And by some strange coincidence, he is considering these pardons as the most notorious of American war prisoners -- the ""American Taliban"" John Walker Lindh -- is scheduled to be released Thursday, after serving 17 years of a 20-year sentence

The presidential power to pardon is near-absolute in the Constitution -- ""except in cases of impeachment.""

But no previous recent president has pardoned a murderer. Until Trump.

People march to demand the release of Puerto Rican nationalist Oscar Lopez Rivera near the White House in Washington, DC, on January 11, 2017, shortly before Obama commuted his sentence.

Data on the Justice Department's website includes the nature of a pardoned person's crime only back through George H.W. Bush. Note: Most murders are prosecuted at the state and not the federal level.

led to deaths. Obama and President Bill Clinton also commuted the sentences of violent revolutionaries fighting for Puerto Rican independence responsible for multiple bombings in the US during the '70s and '80s. But they gave clemency only to those whose crimes had notled to deaths.

Trump crossed that line this month when he pardoned Michael Behenna , who had been sentenced to prison in 2009 for unpremeditated murder in the killing of an Iraqi detainee and released on parole in 2014 after his sentence was reduced.

That Trump is considering other pardons for military crimes on a short timeline before Memorial Day took the Department of Justice and the Pentagon by surprise and added new context to the pardon power, which he's already used to reward political allies and send political messages.

Here's a look at the history and practice of presidential pardons for service members.

Trump's praise for war crimes, shooting deserters

JUST WATCHED Trump tweets debunked legend about US general Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump tweets debunked legend about US general 01:25

This issue first and foremost recalls Trump's repeated endorsement of behavior that could easily be classified as war criminal.

During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump admiringly repeated an apocryphal story about Gen. John Pershing shooting Muslim prisoners with bullets dipped in pig blood -- because it violated Muslim law -- in the Philippines more than 100 years ago

wasn't a true story, but the point is that Trump liked it. He liked the idea of US troops killing 49 prisoners and disrespecting their religion in order to make the 50th tell other people what had happened. It probably wasn't a true story, but the point is that Trump liked it. He liked the idea of US troops killing 49 prisoners and disrespecting their religion in order to make the 50th tell other people what had happened.

It would also be a war crime to shoot prisoners.

Trump said US soldier Bowe Bergdahl, who had been held as a prisoner of war for years in Afghanistan, should be shot for desertion after he walked off his base in 2009. A military court gave Bergdahl no additional prison time after he pleaded guilty.

The new chapter in the annals of Trump and military justice is the news, first reported in The New York Times, that he's considering pardons for two American service members who are anticipating trial on murder charges.

He's also looking at the case of Marines convicted of urinating on dead bodies and the case of a contractor, once employed by Erik Prince's now-defunct Blackwater security company, convicted in federal court of first-degree murder for his role in the killing of 14 Iraqis in 2007.

But it is the idea of pardons for accused service members who have not yet gone to trial and been convicted that is raising the most concern for some military law experts.

Army Maj. Matthew Golsteyn divulged his role in the killing of a bomb maker in Afghanistan during a job interview with the CIA and subsequently in a Fox News interview. The Army says the killing was premeditated and Golsteyn is set to stand trial. He could face the death penalty.

Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher is charged with stabbing a wounded man to death, shooting at a male and female noncombatant and obstructing justice while deployed in Iraq. His own teammates turned him in, but Gallagher, who has pleaded not guilty, has found defenders in the media and on Capitol Hill.

Navy SEAL Chief Edward Gallagher is charged with murder of Iraqi civilians.

He was allowed to leave the brig after Trump tweeted about the case. The President also tweeted about Golsteyn.

""At the request of many, I will be reviewing the case of a 'U.S. Military hero,' Major Matt Golsteyn, who is charged with murder. He could face the death penalty from our own government after he admitted to killing a Terrorist bomb maker while overseas. @PeteHegseth @FoxNews""

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 16, 2018

The closest a modern president has come to a pardon for war crimes was Richard Nixon's treatment of William Calley, who was convicted of premeditated murder for his role in the Vietnam War My Lai massacre of unarmed civilians in 1968. Nixon released him to house arrest and his life sentence was commuted by Nixon's secretary of the army, Howard Calloway

The first difficulty of assessing war crimes in the US is that there is no commonly accepted definition of the term and the US is not a party to the Rome Statute, which created the International Criminal Court in 1998. In fact, the Trump administration recently revoked visas for the International Criminal Court chief prosecutor, which CNN reported was part of an effort by the US to deter ICC actions against US service members in Afghanistan.

That doesn't mean the US military is not prosecuting those suspected of war crimes, according to Chris Jenks, a law professor at the Southern Methodist University Dedman School of Law who is a former Army judge advocate. Jenks is an expert in the law of armed conflict who wrote about possible Trump pardons for the Just Security blog . He answered some questions about Trump's possible move and what it could mean for the military justice system.

What is a war crime and are US service members charged with war crimes?

Lt. William Calley walks from Fort Benning, GA. stockade, April 1, 1971. Calley was convicted for his part in the 1968 My Lai massacre incident of the Vietnam War. President Richard Nixon ordered him placed under house arrest during appeal.

""As a general proposition, when people say war crimes within the international legal community, what we're talking about is serious violations of the law of armed conflict or international humanitarian law, serious violations of the laws of war,"" said Jenks.

He pointed out that Calley was not charged with a war crime, but rather hundreds of charges of murder. Similarly, he said Sgt. Robert Bales, who killed 16 Afghan civilians , was charged with multiple counts of murder, even though, as Jenks said, ""I would tell you under international law definitions Sgt. Bales committed one or more war crimes.""

Is there any precedent for what Trump is doing?

""In terms of has there ever been an instance where the commander in chief has preemptively pardoned a US service member facing a court-martial for murder? No, I'm not aware of that,"" said Jenks.

""You have an entire military justice apparatus,"" he said, which is set up to make sure justice is served. It starts with the Navy SEALs who reported Gallagher, for example, continues through the Naval Criminal Investigative Service agents who collected evidence and the admiral who recommended that Gallagher be prosecuted.

""What's the point of having the military justice system if it's not allowed to operate?"" asked Jenks. ""What are you saying to the commanders and the judge advocates who participate in the process when you don't let the military justice process proceed?""

Are there adequate protections for US service members accused of war crimes?

Given that American service members are operating in war zones, it's important that they have protection from the US government.

""If there was ever a circumstance by which I was accused of serious wrongdoing and I was offered a choice of being prosecuted in a state court, a federal court, or a military court, I would run to a military court because of the protections and the process that it affords service members, frankly, well in excess of the protections and processes that are afforded in state and federal court,"" said Jenks.

He said there is a larger problem underlying Trump's potential pardons, which is that service members are standing accused of these crimes but also standing in judgment of each other.

""The broader unstated point is the President and those who support pardons are trying to position themselves as this is an us against them. But when you think about who is the us and who is the them -- it's US service members on both sides of this equation.""

He argued that after the criminal justice system is allowed to work, the decision to pardon becomes a matter of judgment. There is precedent for preemptive pardons, however. More on that in a moment.

Retired Army Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling said on CNN that usurping the military justice system will hurt the military as a whole.

""If you lose control of your forces, you're no longer a military force, you're just a mob,"" said Hertling, a CNN analyst.

Chelsea Manning and war crimes

Obama did not pardon but rather commuted the sentence of Chelsea Manning, the convicted leaker of classified information to WikiLeaks -- drawing widespread criticism since Manning arguably jeopardized national security. Supporters argue she uncovered US war crimes , like the killing of Iraqi civilians, including two who worked for Reuters. In that instance, perhaps proving how difficult and rare it is for the military to seek charges against its members, the only charges that were brought after an investigation into those killings were the ones against Manning for her leaks.

Unrelated to her commutation, Manning was ordered back to jail this month after refusing to testify before a grand jury as part of a federal investigation into Julian Assange and WikiLeaks.

Confederates and draft dodgers pardoned

There have been massive military-related pardons in American history. President Andrew Johnson pardoned Confederate soldiers after the Civil War . More than 100 years later, President Jimmy Carter essentially pardoned Confederate President Jefferson Davis by posthumously restoring his citizenship. Carter also, on his first day in office, pardoned draft dodgers after Vietnam."

The agreement comes amid negotiations between committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and the DOJ for the full Mueller report and underlying evidence and documents from the probe -- and effectively hits pause on Schiff's efforts to enforce a subpoena against the DOJ.

“The Department of Justice has already begun the process of identifying, locating, and reviewing the materials potentially responsive to the categories of documents [requested by the Committee],” the Justice Department said in a statement Tuesday, warning that it is a “process that will not continue should the Committee take the unnecessary and unproductive step of moving to hold the Attorney General in contempt.”

Schiff appeared to accept the Justice Department’s response while maintaining that their subpoena remains in effect.

“DOJ has accepted our offer, and will begin turning over to the Committee twelve categories of counterintelligence and foreign intelligence materials beginning this week. Our subpoena will remain in effect, and be enforced should DOJ fail to comply with the full document request,” Schiff tweeted Wednesday.

Schiff, though, said that while the Democrats are ""pleased"" they will receive documents, the Justice Department's cooperation on this specific matter is ""no substitute in any way, shape or form"" for the testimony of Mueller himself, and former White House Counsel Don McGahn.

""We have every expectation that [Mueller] is going to appear before our committee as well as the Judiciary Committee,"" Schiff told reporters Wednesday, stressing the importance of having Mueller testify in a public hearing. ""We're going to insist on that being the case as well.""

It's unclear whether Mueller will testify before any committee. Meanwhile, the agreement comes after the Judiciary Committee already voted, on party lines, to hold Barr in contempt for not turning over the unredacted Mueller report and other documents.

The president had asserted executive privilege over the files in a bid to protect them from release.

AG BARR: 'I FELT THE RULES WERE BEING CHANGED TO HURT TRUMP'

In the agreement with the House Intelligence Committee, the DOJ identified 12 categories of documents

""The Department may be in a position to discuss making them available to the Committee in relatively short order, subject to processing and reviewing"" and consultations with the intelligence community, the DOJ said.

Schiff said the ""initial production should be completed by the end of next week.""

The Justice Department already has made available a minimally redacted version of the special counsel’s report to a select group of congressional Democrats. The Justice Department said Tuesday, though, that “no Democrat has accepted the Department of Justice’s offer to review a less-redacted report at the Department of Justice.”

John Bolton Wants to Run a One-Man State Department: Report,http://nymag.com,['Matt Stieb'],05-22-2019,2019,5,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/05/john-bolton-wants-to-run-a-one-man-state-department-report.html,"Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

The Trump White House has long been a place of internal strife, from the early days of Steve Bannon versus everyone else, to the daily sparring of John Kelly and his boss, to the current defining conflict between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton. According to a new report from CNN, Pompeo is frustrated by Bolton overstepping his role and circumventing the usual policy-making processes.

Since becoming national security adviser in April 2018, Bolton has hosted fewer “principals meetings” involving high-level Cabinet officials and has pursued shorter, more informal briefs with the president and his staff. Generally, he has reengineered his role “into a decision-making perch instead of a position meant to funnel information to the President,” per CNN.

At times, that’s left other top-ranking officials, including Pompeo, feeling excluded and out of the loop.

During a recent debate over how to handle North Korea, Bolton left Pompeo off messages he sent to the CIA that included a list of questions he wanted answered, according to a source in the intelligence community.

That infuriated Pompeo, who as secretary of state has led negotiations with the North Koreans. In its replies to Bolton, the CIA started sharing information with both Bolton and Pompeo.

Bolton is also reportedly holding meetings at the CIA headquarters as an easy way to keep State Department staffers from attending. One source told CNN that “John Bolton is playing secretary of State.”

Pompeo and Bolton agree on foreign policy in broad strokes and are separated mostly by degrees of hawkishness. For example, Pompeo wants to put pressure on the Iranian government, while Bolton has long been an advocate for regime change in Tehran. But the two diverge in their approach to sharing information. While Pompeo tends to be careful in his media appearances, Bolton is happy to put himself at the forefront of policy debates on television and on Twitter, to the consternation of his counterpart at State. Bolton will also attempt to use lawmakers to forward his policy goals, reportedly sending staff to the Hill in advance of representatives’ meetings with Trump, hoping they will rebroadcast an idea of his in their sessions with the president.

Not only is Bolton’s jockeying causing open conflict with Pompeo in national security meetings, Trump also appears to be frustrated by his unconventional adviser. The president reportedly said that he felt undermined by Bolton on North Korea, and that Bolton is pushing a “war agenda” on Iran, when he would prefer diplomatic talks. Naturally, the president also doesn’t like his adviser’s public-facing role. Bolton’s Twitter presence and media appearances are not “appreciated by the president,” a source close to Bolton told CNN. “He wants it to be all about him.”"

In response to a question from Rep. Ben McAdams, D-Utah, about proposed tariffs and potentially higher prices on items including diapers, infant formula and strollers, Mnuchin said he discussed such concerns with Walmart Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs.

""I can tell you I am monitoring the situation very carefully. I was on phone with the CFO of Walmart, which obviously is one of the biggest sellers of the items that you've described to specifically understand from Walmart what things they can source from other areas and what items they can't,"" Mnuchin said at the House Financial Services Committee hearing.

""I would say we haven't made any decisions yet, but we will be especially sensitive to the consumer items,"" Mnuchin said.

Mnuchin added that he speaks with Biggs on a ""regular basis"" and has ""spoken to all of the major companies that provide consumer goods"" about the issue. Asked for comment, Walmart reiterated statements from its first-quarter earnings call made by Biggs and the chief executive of its U.S. arm, Greg Foran.

""In regards to tariffs, we continue to monitor the situation. Our goal is always to be the low price leader and we'll continue to actively manage pricing and margins with our customers and shareholders in mind,"" Biggs said Thursday. ""We're going to continue to do everything we can to keep prices low, that's who we are. However, increased tariffs will lead to increased prices we believe for our customers.""

Foran later added on the earnings call: ""Merchants are managing costs and retails on an item by item basis. We are working closely with domestic and international suppliers to drive higher efficiency and reduce costs."""
E.P.A. Plans to Get Thousands of Pollution Deaths Off the Books by Changing Its Math,https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/20/climate/epa-air-pollution-deaths.html,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.

WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency plans to change the way it calculates the health risks of air pollution, a shift that would make it easier to roll back a key climate change rule because it would result in far fewer predicted deaths from pollution, according to five people with knowledge of the agency’s plans.

The E.P.A. had originally forecast that eliminating the Obama-era rule, the Clean Power Plan, and replacing it with a new measure would have resulted in an additional 1,400 premature deaths per year. The new analytical model would significantly reduce that number and would most likely be used by the Trump administration to defend further rollbacks of air pollution rules if it is formally adopted.

The proposed shift is the latest example of the Trump administration downgrading the estimates of environmental harm from pollution in regulations. In this case, the proposed methodology would assume there is little or no health benefit to making the air any cleaner than what the law requires. Many experts said that approach was not scientifically sound and that, in the real world, there are no safe levels of the fine particulate pollution associated with the burning of fossil fuels.

Fine particulate matter — the tiny, deadly particles that can penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream — is linked to heart attacks, strokes and respiratory disease."

Houlton is leaving his position at the end of the week after nearly two years delivering the public message for a department that has been at the center of the Trump administration's focus on immigration and many of its controversial policies.

Houlton's last day at DHS is Friday and he is expected to remain in the administration, taking a position as a senior adviser at the State Department. CNN has reached out to the State Department for comment.

His departure from the department is the latest in a wave of changes at DHS headquarters, including at top leadership positions, stemming from the forced resignation last month of former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.

The departures included the acting deputy secretary of Homeland Security, the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as well as a leadership shakeup at US Secret Service, Customs and Border Protection and the Transportation Security Administration.

After Nielsen left the department, CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan was appointed as acting secretary, bringing a number of CBP staff with him to headquarters.

"Trump USDA is paying millions to a shady Brazilian meatpacking company under DOJ, SEC investigation",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/trump-usda-is-paying-millions-to-a-shady-brazilian-meatpacking-company-under-doj-sec-investigation,"A massive Brazilian meatpacking company is raking in millions of U.S. taxpayer dollars even while two federal agencies are investigating the corruption-addled parent company of the meatpacker.

In January, the Department of Agriculture purchased $22.3 million worth of pork from JBS USA, a subsidiary of the Brazil-based company JBS SA. But the one hand doesn't seem to know what the other is doing. While USDA is contracting with JBS, the Justice Department and the Securities Exchange Commission are investigating the parent company, J&F Investimentos, for ""potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,"" according to D.C. court documents reviewed by the Washington Examiner from September 2018.

A USDA spokesperson defended the agency's contract with JBS in a prepared statement sent to the Washington Examiner. “USDA buys American commodities, produced on American farms by American farmers. [USDA's Agriculture Marketing Service] obtains and maintains approved vendors who have proven they can procure these U.S.-produced products. This means that regardless of who the vendor is, the products purchased are grown in the U.S. and benefit U.S. farmers. JBS qualifies as a bidder under this criteria. This is similar to someone buying JBS bacon in a grocery store. Regardless of the packaging, the bacon inside is from a hog grown on an American farm.”

The DOJ and SEC declined to comment.

The current trade war with China, which is hurting U.S. farmers, has resulted in even more taxpayer money flowing to JBS. The company has pocketed more than $64 million in federal payments through Trump's special trade-war bailout program for farmers.

JBS SA is the largest meat processing company in the world. According to its 2018 earnings, it has a net income of $45 billion. J&F Investimentos is wholly owned by Joesley and Wesley Batista, billionaire brothers who confessed to and served prison time for bribing hundreds of officials in the Brazilian government.

The Batista brothers' complex and ongoing court case in Brazil took a strange turn this past week after Wesley Batista was indicted by a Brazilian federal court for insider trading. If convicted, he could serve a prison sentence of one to five years and a hefty fine.

On top of the DOJ and SEC investigations, the Batista brothers are also closely connected to Diosdado Cabello, the president of the Nicolás Maduro-backed Venezuelan National Assembly, through a $2.1 billion meat and poultry contract in 2015. In 2017, it was reported that Cabello put out an assassination order against Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., according to U.S. intelligence. Rubio's office has not yet responded to a request for comment.

The U.S. cattle industry has long battled with JBS, which it accuses of illegally colluding with other meat packers to drive down prices. The ranchers point to the many investigations swirling around the Brazilian company. In June 2017, Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund United Stockgrowers of America, the largest cattle association in the country, called on the Trump administration to move forward on an antitrust investigation into the company, citing its corrupt practices and its negative impact on farmers.

On Tuesday, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., sent a letter to Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue urging him ""to immediately cease any existing or future bailout payments to foreign-owned corporations, like the Brazilian-owned meatpacker JBS, and remove them from your approved and eligible vendors list.""

Blumenthal's office did not respond to a request for comment."

The Environmental Protection Agency is pulling from the market a dozen products containing pesticides known to be toxic to a linchpin of the U.S. food system — the honeybee.

The agency announced Monday it has canceled the registrations of 12 pest-killing products with compounds belonging to a class of chemicals known as neonicotinoids, as part of a legal settlement.

For years, beekeepers and wildlife conversationalists alike have voiced concern that the widespread use of neonics, as the chemicals are commonly called, is imperiling wild and domesticated bees crucial to pollinating commercial fruit, nut and vegetable crops.

The Trump administration's action was welcome news to some environmentalists. “Certainly we have a ways to go,” said George Kimbrell, legal director at the nonprofit advocacy group Center for Food Safety, whose lawsuit prompted the EPA’s action. “But it's an important first step in acknowledging the harm they cause.”

The EPA has pulled other neonics from market before, agency spokesman John Konkus said in an email. But close observers of the agency say such actions are rare.

“For the EPA to pull a previously registered pesticide is a pretty major step,” said Mark Winston, a professor of apiculture and social insects at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, B.C. “It’s not something they do very often.”

The decision follows five years of litigation in which the beekeepers and environmentalists pressed the agency to mount a response to the use of neonics as regulators in Europe and Canada have taken steps toward banning the chemicals.

Finally, at the end of 2018, three agribusinesses — Bayer, Syngenta and Valent — agreed to let the EPA pull from shelves the 12 pesticide products used by growers ranging from large-scale agricultural businesses to home gardeners. The legal settlement also compels the EPA to analyze the impacts of the entire neonic class on endangered species.

Two of the pesticide makers, Bayer and Valent, say their products are tested and safe to use, noting that the environmentalists and beekeepers won their case on the technical grounds that the EPA did not follow the right steps under the Endangered Species Act when registering their products.

“Neonicotinoids are rigorously tested before going to market to ensure they can be used safely and effectively,” said Steve Tatum, a spokesman for Valent, which makes four of the delisted products.

Bayer noted its two products targeted by the EPA action are not sold in the United States. But spokesman Darren Wallis added: “Growers rely on these critical pest-management tools because of their performance against destructive pests, as well as their favorable human and environmental safety profile.”

Concern over neonics has grown since 2006, when beekeepers first started witnessing the sudden and mysterious collapse of honeybee hives across the nation.

Researchers have shown the compounds to be harmful to bees in laboratory tests. But they have had less luck pinning down the pesticides’ effects on beekeepers’ colonies when they go about their work pollinating apple orchards and other farms.

In his second term Barack Obama, who had earlier approved installing a beehive on the South Lawn of the White House, launched an initiative to promote the health of honeybees and other pollinators.

But Rebecca Riley, legal director of the nature program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that the agency has failed often in the past to adequately consider the potential impact of its pesticide approvals on endangered animals — something every federal agency is supposed to do.

“EPA for years has been ignoring this requirement of the law,” she said.

That has led to a number of lawsuits, such as one the NRDC filed in 2017, asking a federal court to vacate the registrations of nearly 100 products that contain one of several insecticides that are harmful to various bees, butterflies, birds and insects. That case remains unresolved, even as the separate Center for Food Safety case led EPA to pull some pesticides from the market.

“This is a win for both the rule of law and also for bees, birds and other wildlife impacted by these pesticides,” Riley said of the latest case. “But the reality is there are hundreds of pesticide products on the market. So, this is important … but it does not get rid of the danger.”

— EPA doesn't send rep to hearing: Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), chair of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations, criticized the Environmental Protection Agency for failing to send a representative to testify during a hearing about a Trump administration proposal to roll back Obama-era mercury regulations. “I am continually frustrated and surprised by the administration's refusal to send witnesses to Congress,” she said. “And the EPA's refusal to show up today is just another example of the efforts to block Congress from performing its oversight functions. And so we're going to have to move forward, but it would be really helpful if we had the agencies here to help us.”

— Nominee for top Interior Dept. lawyer advances: The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee advanced the president’s pick to be the Interior Department solicitor, Daniel Jorjani, on a party-line vote. Jorjani advanced despite objections from Democrats including Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who criticized the nominee during Tuesday’s panel meeting. “It concerns me Mr. Jorjani has spent the past two years he served as acting solicitor overturning prior interpretations of our public lands laws in a manner that is out of step with the congressional intent,” Manchin said in a statement. “The Solicitor must uphold the law above all else—above party, politics, and ideology. That was not the sense I got from Mr. Jorjani’s responses to our questions.”

— Texas bill could penalize pipeline protesters: Under a new bill approved by both chambers in Texas’s state legislature, protesters who are found to have delayed pipeline operations or otherwise damaged equipment could face up to a decade in prison. “The Texas Oil & Gas Association applauded its passage and said the bill provides property owners and pipeline companies ‘greater protections against intentional damage, delays, and stoppages caused by illegal activity,’” Bloomberg News reports. “Environmental groups, meanwhile, called the measure an assault on free speech.” Cyrus Reed, interim director for the Sierra Club’s Texas chapter, said the bill is about “silencing protesters trying to protect their water and land.”

— The reality of plastic pollution: A new study found there are about 414 million pieces of debris scattered across the remote Cocos Islands of Australia, which could be an underestimate because a lot of the waste is below the surface, NBC News reports. The findings could suggest the amount of plastic polluting the world could be much more than previously realized. “The scientists surveyed seven of the 27 islands, which made up 88 percent of the total landmass of the islands, and estimated that they were littered with 262 tons of plastic. A quarter of those pieces of debris were single-use or disposable items such as straws, bags and toothbrushes (about 373,000 of them). The researchers also identified about 977,000 shoes,” per the report.

— A wild spring storm: A powerful spring system drove a variety of extreme weather throughout the country on Monday and Tuesday, with serious flooding and more than 20 tornadoes blasting through the Southern Plains, The Post’s Jason Samenow reports. ""Flash flooding proved to be more of a widespread hazard than the tornadoes,” he writes. “Flooding spread from the north and west sides of Oklahoma City northeast to Tulsa, where four to eight inches of rain fell in a short time. Roads were closed, and numerous high-water rescues were required.”

Corn: Flawed USDA Forecast Creates Tremendous Opportunity,https://seekingalpha.com,['Atlas Research'],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4265517-corn-flawed-usda-forecast-creates-tremendous-opportunity,"Normally, incompetence costs you dearly... but on May 10th, government incompetence created tremendous opportunity.

Regular readers know that I often disagree with government forecasts. Last month, I argued that the energy information agency (""EIA"") is likely overestimating the new supply coming from U.S. gas producers this year. You see, in my experience, government forecasters often simply extrapolate the prevailing trends into the future. Shale drillers supplied a lot of new gas in 2018... so why not just project more of the same in 2019? I detailed the evidence indicating why that projection was likely wrong in last month's article. So far, the available data confirms that gas production growth has slowed to a crawl in 2019.

In the case of the corn market, government forecasters simply plugged in an expected yield for this year's corn crop that closely matched the yield of previous years. Now in a normal year, this method of extrapolation might work out just fine. But 2019 is no normal year...

In this article, I'll explain why the USDA simply got it wrong with their latest estimate for corn yield, and thus corn production, for the current corn crop. And I'll show how this faulty forecast created a tremendous contrarian opportunity in the corn (NYSEARCA:CORN) market.

First, let's start with a basic overview of today's corn market.

Corn Supply and Demand Overview

Like any other commodity, analyzing the corn market is all about estimating future supply and demand. U.S. corn demand typically fluctuates by 1-2% annually, with longer-term corn demand driven by GDP and population growth. Shorter-term fluctuations can be influenced by changes in ethanol consumption since corn-based ethanol is used as a gasoline additive. Corn demand also fluctuates with shorter-term changes in consumption for livestock feed and exports.

For the 2018/2019 corn crop year (August 2018 through September 2019), the USDA estimates total corn consumption of 14.5 billion bushels. That's down 2% from 14.8 billion bushels last year, due to a 150 million decline in corn for ethanol production and a 138 million drop in corn exports. For the upcoming 2019/2020 crop year, the USDA forecasts corn demand growth of 1.2% to 14.7 billion bushels, boosted by higher feed demand and a rebound in corn usage for ethanol production.

Of course, the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China has created a lot of headline hype in the agriculture sector. And yes, some crops have taken a big hit from Chinese buyers pulling out of the market, namely soybeans. But the U.S. corn crop remains insulated from these trade tensions. Why? For one, U.S. corn exports to China have already suffered a more than 90% decline over the last several years:

The reasons for this drop are beyond the scope of this article. But here's the bottom line...

The U.S. consumes roughly 80% of its 14-15 billion bushels of its domestic corn production annually. And of the 2.3 billion bushels that we sold abroad last year, China bought just 15 million bushels. That's less than 1% of total U.S. corn exports and only 0.1% of total U.S. production. In other words, even a full-blown trade war would have little direct impact on the American corn market.

So there shouldn't be any big surprises in the demand picture this year. That leaves supply as the key factor driving corn prices today. And this is where the trade war has created an indirect headwind for corn prices. Let me explain...

Low Soybean Prices = More Corn Planting

Each year, many American farmers have the choice between growing corn or soybeans on their farmland. And unlike corn, trade tensions have dealt a major blow to U.S. soybean exports, pushing prices down to around $8 per bushel - the lowest level in over a decade. Depressed soybean prices have incentivized farmers to switch from soybeans to corn for the 2019/2020 crop year.

According to the latest USDA estimates, soybean acreage will drop from 89.2 million acres last year to 84.6 million acres this year, while corn acreage will rise from 89.1 million acres to 92.8 million acres. This 92.8 million planted acres translate into 85.4 million harvested acres, assuming normal crop loss rates. And if you assume a normal yield of 176 bushels per harvested acre, that means U.S. corn farmers will grow 15 billion bushels of corn this year - up 4.2% from last year's 14.4 billion bushel crop.

This projected production growth will handily outpace the expected 1.2% increase in consumption, thereby driving up corn ""ending stocks"" (the official term for corn inventories) to a massive 2.485 billion bushels, based on the following USDA projections:

The chart below puts this 2.485 billion bushel estimate for corn ending stocks into historical perspective...

So it's no surprise that corn prices tanked immediately following the release of these estimates in the USDA's most recent WASDE report released on Friday, May 10th. Prices fell from $3.54 to as low as $3.45 on the heels of that report and continued dropping to $3.43 the following Monday morning, exacerbated by escalating trade war rhetoric over the weekend.

For those who follow me on Twitter you may have seen me release the following tweet and chart, alerting my followers of a tremendous contrarian opportunity in the corn market on Monday morning:

""#Corn capitulation creating terrific opportunity to harvest irrational trade war-inspired volatility this morning. #bullish""

And here's what happened next…

By aggressively selling put options on corn futures, I captured thousands of dollars in option premiums in just a few trading days last week. I don't say this to brag...ok, maybe a little. But more importantly, I want to point out that commodity markets and government forecasters can occasionally get things very, very wrong. And when they do, you can make a lot of money by simply adding two and two together to get four. That's precisely what I did when analyzing the corn market last week. Here's the simple math I used to figure that the fear in the corn market was unjustified…

Basic Logic Shows the Fallacy of the USDA's 2019 Corn Yield Forecast

Each month, the USDA puts out a monthly WASDE (World Agriculture Supply and Demand Estimate) report estimating supply and demand for agricultural products, including corn. The following excerpt below from the latest WASDE report released on Friday, May 10th, which details how U.S. corn inventories would balloon to the aforementioned multi-decade high level of 2,485 million bushels. In this report, the USDA made one key assumption when calculating this year's production - a normal yield (circled in red) based on ""assuming normal mid-May planting progress"" (highlighted in yellow):

And that single assumption was all I needed to know that the USDA's forecaster inventory number was completely unrealistic and just plain way too bearish. Why? Two words: late planting.

You see, each year corn farmers have a brief 8-9 week window from early April through May 20th to get their crops planted if they hope to achieve optimal yields. Any corn planted after May 20th is officially considered ""late planted"" corn, as yields begin dropping for corn planted after this date. That's why crop insurance payouts begin dropping for corn planted after a specific cut-off date, typically in late May or early June.

So getting back to the USDA report, the following chart shows why it's simply absurd for the USDA to assume ""normal mid-May planting progress"" for 2019:

With just a few weeks left in the planting season, 2019's corn planting progress is nowhere near ""normal"". Farmers have only planted 30% of their planned acreage as of May 12th. That's more than 50% behind schedule compared to the five-year average. Thanks to the extreme rains that inundated the Midwest corn belt states this spring, many farmers trying to get their seed into the ground have found themselves in situations like this:

Simply put, too much water in the soil means farmers can't get their seeds into the ground. To get a sense of the extreme difficulty corn farmers have had this planting season, let's zoom to see where 2019's planting progress falls for this time of year (Week 19) compared with the last 40 years:

At just 30% of the corn crop planted by week 13, we've only seen two other years in the last 40 with less corn planting progress - 28% in 2013 and 29% in 1984. So to summarize…

The USDA created the market perception that U.S. corn inventories would soar to a multi-decade high by the end of 2019's crop season. But that projection was based on the ridiculous assumption of ""normal mid-May planting progress"". And I just showed how 2019 is very, very far removed from normal.

Now, the real question becomes - what's a more reasonable yield estimate given the large amount of corn that will likely be planted late (or not at all)? This article provides a great analysis of the historical impact that late planting has on U.S. corn yields. The key conclusion is summarized in the chart below, which shows that corn yields typically suffer a minor drop in yields when the amount of late planting exceeds the average by less than 10%. But when the deviation exceeds 10%, the yield decline goes exponential - dropping anywhere from 10-20 bushels per acre in the extreme cases.

So far, all signs point towards 2019 falling on the far right side of the graph. That means a big downside risk to corn yields. Based on the study's historical regression model, a conservative estimate would translate into a drop in yields of anywhere from 5-10 bushels per acre… and I wouldn't be surprised to see it come out much worse.

Now, the caveat here is that summer weather will provide the other critical variable in determining this year's corn yield. But no one trading corn today has any degree of certainty what the 2019 summer weather will look like. What we do know for sure is that corn farmers are way behind schedule with their planting this year. It's flat-out wrong to expect a normal yield based on the information available today.

So let's take a conservative estimate of losing 6 bushels per acre due to the extreme amount of late planting likely in 2019. That would lower the USDA's 2019 production estimate by roughly half a billion bushels to roughly 14,500 million bushels, based on the following math:

This 170 bushels per acre yield assumption creates a much less bearish ending stock number of 1,972 million bushels - a four-year low instead of the USDA's multi-decade high:

When using this conservative yield and ending stocks assumption, it's clear that corn prices trading well below the typical range of the last four years was way out of line with reality last week. The red line shows how far below the normal price range corn prices fell to last week, creating a tremendous contrarian buying opportunity when corn briefly traded below $3.50 per bushel:

It didn't take long for the market to realize the fallacy of the USDA forecast and irrational trade war fears. Corn prices have already rallied more than 10% off last Monday's lows. At just over $3.90 per bushel, I don't see a screaming opportunity to get long at today's levels. But on any pullbacks below the average price of the last four years, I'll be on the lookout to capture volatility through selling put options or getting long corn futures.

Going forward, there's a significant chance for a tail-risk event in U.S. corn supply, and thus much higher prices, if continued wet weather keeps farmers away from their fields in the few weeks left in the planting season. Meanwhile, summer weather will provide another wildcard that could either overcome the headwinds from late planting with benign growing conditions or create a meaningful supply shortage with harsh summer weather.

Subscribe for future updates and potential opportunities that might arise from further irrationality in today's corn market. And when the USDA releases its next corn supply and demand forecast, pay close attention to key assumptions driving their estimates... it just might create another terrific contrarian opportunity.

DHS warns of 'strong concerns' that Chinese-made drones are stealing data,https://www.cnn.com,['David Shortell'],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/20/politics/dhs-chinese-drone-warning/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Chinese-made drones may be sending sensitive flight data to their manufacturers in China, where it can be accessed by the government there, the US Department of Homeland Security warned in an alert issued Monday obtained by CNN.

The drones are a ""potential risk to an organization's information,"" the alert from DHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency states. The products ""contain components that can compromise your data and share your information on a server accessed beyond the company itself.""

The report does not name any specific manufacturers, but nearly 80% of the drones used in the US and Canada come from DJI, which is headquartered in Shenzhen, China, according to one industry analysis. US local law enforcement organizations and infrastructure operators have grown to rely on drones in recent years.

""The United States government has strong concerns about any technology product that takes American data into the territory of an authoritarian state that permits its intelligence services to have unfettered access to that data or otherwise abuses that access,"" the alert says.

""Those concerns apply with equal force to certain Chinese-made (unmanned aircraft systems)-connected devices capable of collecting and transferring potentially revealing data about their operations and the individuals and entities operating them, as China imposes unusually stringent obligations on its citizens to support national intelligence activities,"" the alert adds.

Justice Department offers to share additional Mueller documents to avoid House action against Barr,https://www.salon.com,[],05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.salon.com/2019/05/22/justice-department-offers-to-share-additional-mueller-documents-to-avoid-house-action-against-barr/,"The Department of Justice agreed to turn over documents to the House Intelligence Committee relating to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, seemingly in a last-ditch effort to stave off an imminent ""enforcement action"" against Attorney General William Barr.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff released a statement early Wednesday announcing the Justice Department had accepted the panel's offer as a ""first step towards compliance with the subpoena.""

The move comes after the California Democrat said last week that he would hold a ""business meeting"" Wednesday to take an unspecified ""enforcement action"" against the Justice Department for not complying with his subpoena for counterintelligence information related to Mueller's report.

The Justice Department on Tuesday offered to give the committee access to a less redacted version of the first volume of Mueller's 448-page report — the section discussing alleged ties between President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign and Moscow — and identify other documents related to the special counsel's investigation if House Democrats dropped its threat to hold Barr in contempt of Congress. The House Judiciary Committee has already voted to hold Barr in contempt for not complying with that panel's subpoena for an unredacted version of Mueller report.

Schiff said the Justice Department would begin turning over to the committee ""twelve categories of counterintelligence and foreign intelligence materials as part of an initial rolling production"" and noted that ""the initial production should be completed by the end of next week.""

The committee was expected to vote Wednesday on an enforcement action regarding Barr's subpoena, but Schiff said that meeting had been postponed as a result of the department's agreement. The subpoena, however, will remain in effect and will be enforced should the Justice Department fail to comply with the committee's full request, he added.

""The Department has repeatedly acknowledged the Committee's legitimate oversight interest in these materials,"" Schiff said. ""I look forward to — and expect — continued compliance by the Department so we can do our vital oversight work.""

The agreement between the Justice Department and the House Intelligence Committee represents a rare detente and comes amid escalating tensions between the White House and House Democrats over investigations on issues including foreign election interference, alleged mismanagement in the White House security clearance procedures, the president's finances and his immigration policies.

Since the Democrats seized control of the House of Representatives in January, current and former Trump administration officials have faced a barrage of subpoenas, demands to testify before a host of congressional panels and letters seeking a flurry of documents. But the White House has often ignored congressional requests for documents and witnesses, claiming that the demands are an unconstitutional infringement on the president's powers. Democrats, meanwhile, have accused the Trump administration of stonewalling or flat-out ignoring their requests for documents and information.

The executive branch's attempts to push back against congressional inquiries targeting the White House have led a growing number of Democrats to contemplate new ways to compel current and former West Wing aides to acquiesce to their demands, including heightening calls to open impeachment proceedings against the president. Some Democrats have even proposed personally fining or jailing administration officials who do not comply with their requests."

Senate Democrats on Tuesday hammered a top Treasury Department official over a bombshell report that Deutsche Bank resisted reporting suspicious financial activity tied to President Donald Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, whose companies were clients of the German lender.

One after another, Democrats at a Senate Banking Committee hearing that focused on anonymous shell company abuse urged the director of Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, Kenneth Blanco, to take action on the New York Times story.

Story Continued Below

Blanco's agency, known as FinCEN, is responsible for policing illegal money laundering and would have received any so-called suspicious activity reports filed by Deutsche Bank. According to the Times, bank employees prepared the reports but were blocked by executives.

Re “Secrecy Battle Builds as Judge Rebuffs Trump” (front page, May 21):

President Trump’s fight against shining light on his financial dealings clearly indicates that he knows that any documents will show illegal business activities.

It would be a simple matter to exonerate himself by making available his tax returns and his banking transactions. If there is nothing shady, he is innocent. If there is wrongdoing, he is best served by hiding the evidence.

As Judge Amit P. Mehta ruled , the House Committee on Oversight and Reform does have a legitimate legislative purpose: The Constitution gives the public the right to understand if and how the president is compromised in carrying out his presidential duties by his past business dealings. Other recent presidents have not had this issue because they have distanced themselves from business dealings and made available tax returns.

We, the American public, have the right to understand why Mr. Trump fights so hard to keep us in the dark."
Lawmakers slam Trump's pick for defense secretary over new oversight policy,https://www.cnn.com,['Ryan Browne'],05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/22/politics/shanahan-pentagon-oversight/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The senior Democrat and Republican members of the House Armed Services Committee criticized acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan over a new policy which they say seeks to limit congressional oversight of the Pentagon.

""If implemented, the Department's new policy guidance would dramatically limit Congress' ability to execute our constitutional prerogative,"" said Chairman Adam Smith, a Democrat, and ranking member Mac Thornberry, a Republican.

""Congress oversees the Department of Defense; but with this new policy, the Department is overstepping its authority by presuming to determine what warrants legislative oversight,"" they added.

The statement refers to a Shanahan-approved Pentagon memo , which has been obtained by CNN, and is dated May 8.

The memo stipulates that when a Department of Defense ""component receives a congressional request for access to an operational plan or operational order the DoD component will forward the request"" to a senior official who will review it using a series of criteria to include ""whether the request contains sufficient information to demonstrate a relationship to a legislative function"" and ""whether the request implicates presidential decision-making or the President's prerogatives as the Commander in Chief.""

"House panel votes to boost Interior, EPA budget by $1.7B",https://thehill.com,[],05-22-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/homenews/house/445083-house-panel-votes-to-boost-interior-epa-budget-by-17b,"A key House committee on Wednesday advanced the 2020 budgets for the Interior Department and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), voting to increase their funding by $1.73 billion over last year.

Trump originally proposed gutting the EPA’s budget by 31 percent and cutting Interior's by 14 percent. It was the third year in a row that the White House had proposed dramatic cuts to both departments, which appropriators have resoundingly rejected.

The president and some conservative Republican lawmakers have championed cuts to several departments, arguing they are necessary to rein in spending and reduce the national debt, which stands at $22 trillion.

Republicans on the committee complained that Democrats were moving ahead with bills while the House, Senate and White House have not yet agreed to overall spending levels, despite some progress in a Tuesday meeting.

Democratic lawmakers have blasted the White House’s budget requests, arguing the billions in proposed cuts would harm the departments’ ability to run efficiently and complete their public health and environmental mandates.

The committee’s appropriations bill instead aims to increase the EPA’s budget by more than $700 million, to $9.5 billion, compared to the bill passed last year by Congress.

Democratic lawmakers also removed nearly all the riders added in past years by Republicans that aimed to block Obama-era environmental regulations. In addition, they added language to the bills that would limit oil and gas drilling on public land.

Lines in the bill could also make it harder for the government to engage in new oil and gas lease sales. A part of the bill would deny fossil fuel leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) if bidding doesn't generate at least $500 million, half of the expected revenue. A GOP amendment to strip out the provisions was voted down.

Another measure Democrats floated in the bill would block any efforts to expand offshore drilling in the Atlantic and elsewhere until Interior makes public a final comprehensive plan. Interior Secretary David Bernhardt recently told Congress the draft plan is on hold for an indeterminate amount of time following ongoing legal challenges to ANWR drilling.

Additional amendments dealing with wild horses and sage grouse were not adopted.

The Interior portion of the bill also flew in the face of Trump’s budget request, which called for eliminating arts programs such as the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. The bill increased funding for both by $12.5 million, bringing their budgets to $167.5 million apiece.

It also upped programs such as the Smithsonian Institution, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, for which Trump had requested funding cuts.

The Interior portion of the bill allocated funding for ecological services, land management, the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service, and came out $2.4 billion above Trump’s request.

The bill is the eight of 12 appropriation bills that the committee has sent to the full House, which is expected to take them up in June. Two more bills are scheduled to advance through subcommittee this week.

The Senate has refrained from releasing appropriations bills until an agreement is reached on spending caps."

After two years of disturbing increases, the preliminary FBI statistics for the first six months of 2018 demonstrate a sustained reduction in violent crime. The numbers show a 6.7 percent decline in murders, a 12.5 percent decline in robbery, and a 12.7 percent decline in burglary compared to the first six months of 2017.

This is a win for the American people and especially for those communities most impacted by violent crime.

GERMANY REPORTS DROP IN CRIME, 96% OF HOMICIDE CASES CLEARED

Such decreases were not predestined. From 2014 to 2016, nationwide violent crime increased by nearly 7 percent -- with a troubling 21 percent increase in the murder rate. 2015 alone saw an 11 percent increase in murders, the largest annual increase since 1968.

Some of our large cities suffered the brunt of this violent crime spike with the murder rate rising in 22 of the 34 largest cities in 2016.

Following this significant increase in violent crime and murder, the Department of Justice under President Trump is committed to addressing the problem in a smart, systematic manner.

One of the government’s flagship programs is Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN), a nationwide strategy that brings together federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement -- and the communities they serve -- to address the most pressing violent crime issues and develop comprehensive solutions to address them.

Project Safe Neighborhoods is premised on three guiding principles. First, the best way to reduce violent crime is to target the most violent offenders. Research has shown that repeat violent offenders -- a small percentage of the overall criminal population -- are responsible for a grossly disproportionate number of violent crimes.

Second, local jurisdictions need to tailor enforcement to meet their specific needs. PSN is effective because it is not a Washington-centered, “one-size-fits-all” program. Every jurisdiction faces unique challenges, so federal authorities are working with local stakeholders to tailor methods and strategies to their respective communities. Using both pooled intelligence and the latest technology, law enforcement can target and interdict those who are the greatest threats to our communities.

Third, the approach must be comprehensive.

To have long-term, sustained reductions in the violent crime rate, we must dedicate resources to reach at-risk individuals and improve reentry outcomes for criminals who have completed their sentences.

The Department provides millions of dollars to support these programs nationwide. We are already seeing strong signs of progress.

To further decrease violent crime, the Department of Justice has focused on enforcing our gun laws.

Gun crime in America is driven by the illegal use and possession of firearms, including by felons and drug traffickers. In fact, according to a 2016 study of gun crimes in a major American city, 80 percent of firearms recovered by police were from people who were not the lawful owners. In fiscal year 2018, the Department of Justice prosecuted nearly 20 percent more firearms offenders than it did in 2017, and 30% more than it did in 2016.

But effective violent crime reduction is not simply about increasing prosecution rates -- it is about minimizing the number of crime victims by taking the most violent criminals off the streets.

To do so, our PSN partners have leveraged effective and innovative crime-fighting strategies, such as Crime Gun Intelligence Centers and focused deterrence models. Each U.S. Attorney is working with his or her local partners and stakeholders to identify the worst offenders and bring them to justice.

Preventing violent crime by enforcing the law is not a partisan issue; it is an issue for all Americans. Nobody takes that mission more seriously than the men and women of the Department of Justice and our partners in law enforcement. Through programs such as PSN, the Department of Justice under President Trump will continue vigorously to prosecute society’s most violent offenders, working to make every American neighborhood safer."
Treasury Secretary Mnuchin says there are no plans to go to Beijing for trade talks yet,https://www.cnbc.com,['Yun Li'],05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/22/treasury-secretary-mnuchin-says-no-plans-to-go-to-beijing-for-trade-talks-yet.html,"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said a resumption of trade talks with China is not on the calendar yet.

Mnuchin told CNBC's Ylan Mui on Wednesday that a trip to Beijing has not been scheduled. Mnuchin made the comments on his way into a hearing before the House Financial Services Committee.

China has invited the U.S. delegation to Beijing after the two countries failed to reach a trade agreement in Washington this month.

""I'm still hopeful that we can get back to the table. The two presidents will most likely see each other at the end of June,"" Mnuchin said during the hearing. The two leaders are set to meet at the G-20 summit in Japan next month.

President Donald Trump followed through with his threat to increase tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods from 10% to 25%. China immediately responded by upping the tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. goods to as high as 25%.

The trade tensions further intensified this week as the U.S. blacklisted Huawei and effectively halted its ability to buy American-made parts and components. China on Wednesday threatened to cut more economic ties with the U.S. in the wake of the new tariffs and Huawei ban.

The talks between the U.S. and China appeared to have stalled as it is unclear what the two sides would negotiate, CNBC previously reported. Trump said recently he has not ""made that decision yet"" on whether to put tariffs on another $325 billion in Chinese goods."
Commerce Dept. grants Huawei a 90-day license to help existing users,https://www.engadget.com,[],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.engadget.com/2019/05/20/huawei-temp-license/,"Last week the US Commerce Department added Huawei and 68 subsidiaries to its ""Entity List"" that bans it from doing business with US companies without a special license. Today, as anticipated, the Commerce Department loosened that restriction a bit with a temporary 90-day license. According to Wilbur Ross, the Secretary of Commerce, it ""will allow operations to continue for existing Huawei mobile phone users and rural broadband networks.""

Because many operators, or owners of various handsets might not have any other way to get software updates or look into backups for necessary equipment, Huawei can continue to service those existing customers -- for now at least. For the long term, however, it's still looking at the loss of access to technology like Google's Android OS, not to mention any business deals in the US.

Update: Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei made a rare public statement, telling media in China that his company had already made preparations for a ban, and said that its 5G would not be affected by the restrictions. He also said the temporary license ""bears little meaning."""

Tillerson, who met with the panel on Tuesday, reportedly “volunteered” to appear before the committee and called the Capitol Hill switchboard to say he was “happy to talk,” according to ABC’s Tara Palmeri.

An aide on House Foreign Affairs committee told me Former Sec of State Rex Tillerson ""volunteered"" to be interviewed by the committee after they put out feelers. Tillerson literally called their switchboard and said he's ""happy to talk"" — Tara Palmeri (@tarapalmeri) May 22, 2019

Tillerson’s meeting with lawmakers was not advertised to those in the media, and he entered the building through an entrance with little traffic.

The meeting, which lasted more than six hours, was scheduled following a request from House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., and covered a variety of topics.

“The discussion ... covered a wide array of topics related to foreign affairs, the operations of the nation’s foreign policymaking apparatus and his tenure as Secretary of State,” a spokesman for Tillerson said, according to the Post.

An official familiar with Tillerson’s meeting said that Tillerson addressed his relationship with White House advisers, and voiced some dissatisfaction with senior White House adviser Jared Kushner, who is also Trump’s son-in-law. For example, he claimed Kushner undercut his ability to share new policies with the president regarding important foreign affairs, the Daily Beast reports.

Tillerson also addressed Trump’s communications with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and claimed the Trump administration intentionally failed to challenge Russia on interference in the 2016 election, according to reports.

Tillerson was fired from his post last year by a tweet from Trump, who announced at the time he would nominate then-CIA Director Mike Pompeo to take his place."
"Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, Utah Gov. Herbert to meet over roadless rule",https://www.deseretnews.com,"[""Amy Joi O'Donoghue"", 'Amy Joi Is The Environmental Reporter For The Deseret News.']",05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900071458/agriculture-secretary-sonny-perdue-utah-gov-herbert-to-meet-over-roadless-rule.html,"SALT LAKE CITY — U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue is coming to Utah this week and will meet with Gov. Gary Herbert to discuss multiple issues, including the state's desire for a roadless rule specific to Utah and the formalization of a stewardship agreement with the U.S. Forest Service.

Herbert and Perdue will spend most of the day together Wednesday, kicking things off with a meeting, talks over breakfast, a Tooele County tour of a watershed restoration project, lunch and a tour of Welfare Square operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

As head of the agriculture department, Perdue oversees the management of the nation's forests. In Utah, there are 8.1 million forested acres, of which more than 4 million are designated and managed as roadless.

The 2001 Roadless Rule, according to the U.S. Forest Service, establishes prohibitions on road construction, road reconstruction and timber harvesting on 58.5 million acres of inventoried forest lands across the country.

Utah is following the lead of Alaska, which in 2018 successfully received approval of its petition to the U.S. Forest Service for the agency to begin developing a specific roadless rule plan for the Tongass National Forest.

Any new rule or update requires an environmental review process, and the state's petition to change what is on the books has prompted outcry and objection from multiple organizations.

In a briefing to lawmakers last week, the head of the Utah Public Lands Policy Coordinating Office, Kathleen Clarke, said Utah's petition was submitted at the end of February and is awaiting action by the U.S. Forest Service.

Perdue's visit is a good sign, she added, in her presentation to the Natural Resources, Agriculture and Environment Interim Committee.

“I think it is a very solid petition,"" Clarke said. ""There is a lot of rumor out there. There are a lot of accusations of it taking over management, which it does not do,"" she said.

Utah's desire for the roadless rule alteration comes in the aftermath of a record-breaking wildfire season in 2018 that cost the state more than $42 million in funding to quell.

Jeffrey D. Allred, Deseret News The Dollar Ridge Fire continues to burn at Strawberry Reservoir on Friday, July 6, 2018.

In a video presented to the legislative committee, Clarke's office detailed the specific motivation for seeking a Utah specific rule, citing the need to update the 18-year-old management structure that fails to keep pace with modern challenges of drought, climate change and rampant insect infestation killing millions of trees.

""Utah is not scheming to put more roads in forests,"" the narrator said, adding it is only asking for an updated rule that encompasses Utah's conditions that may differ from the rest of the nation.

But there are plenty of critics who say Utah's move for a modification of the rule is unnecessary and suspect, prompting some to threaten lawsuits or lobby personally in Washington, D.C.

Trout Unlimited sent Andy Rasmussen, the organization's Utah coordinator of the Sportsmen's Conservation Project, and Heidi Lewis, chairwoman of the Women's Initiative Council, and others to the nation's capital on Friday to press its case on keeping the current roadless rule intact.

""Trout Unlimited feels like it should not change and that we can work things out with programs already in place,"" Lewis said. ""Ultimately if you put roads in, you can't remove them.""

Kristin Murphy, Deseret News Linda Adams looks at the damage after the Dollar Ridge Fire in Fruitland on Wednesday, July 11, 2018. The fire destroyed her home, shed and camper.

Lewis added that Utah's prized Blue Ribbon fisheries would be threatened via changes to the roadless rule management.

The group met personally with Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, and staffers with other members of Utah's delegation.

""It was surprisingly positive,"" he said. ""They are definitely open to a path forward that does not include"" a revision of the rule, Rasmussen said, stressing that Utah's petition is especially concerning because it is so vague.

Rasmussen added the organization believes a better solution, and less costly one, would be an administrative agreement between Utah and the Forest Service, rather than wholesale makeover of the rule.

""I am with the governor on the goals as far as forest health and resiliency,"" he said, but added there should be an agreement that ""maintains the integrity of the roadless rule and still addresses (Utah) concerns.""

EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler

The EPA plans to stop counting potential lives saved from new pollution rules. GM reveals a platform that's connected to the future. Stanford scientists devise a way to use seawater to make hydrogen. And our latest Twitter poll asks what types of incentives work best to sell EVs. All this and more on Green Car Reports.

In its latest effort to unwind the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan, the EPA is considering a new analytical model that will quit counting thousands of lives potentially saved by cleaning up the air, according to a new report in The New York Times.

GM introduced a new electrical architecture expected to go into most of its cars by 2023, which can provide faster communications for electric drive systems, self-driving, and infotainment, with future expandability and Tesla-style over-the-air updates.

How to make enough hydrogen is one of the main challenges with fuel-cell cars. Getting it from water, in addition to requiring a lot of energy, could stress water supplies. Now scientists at Stanford have figured out how to make lots of it from seawater. That leaves several other challenges unsolved, however.

After checking out how Norway managed to find success with electric cars, our latest Twitter poll asks, ""What kinds of EV incentives are most effective?""

Spy photographers from our partners at Motor Authority have caught images of the new Chevy Bolt–based electric SUV from GM out testing on public roads. The new model, which could be called the Bolt EUV, is expected to be built alongside the Bolt EV in 2021.

Finally, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles recalled almost 200,000 Chrysler Pacifica minivans—but not the Pacifica Hybrid this time—for an electrical problem that could lead to a stall or a lack of power-steering assistance.

Piketon protesters voice radiation fears as US Energy Secretary Rick Perry urges officials to move quickly on testing,https://www.dispatch.com,"['Jessica Wehrman', 'Jessica Wehrman Dispatch Washington Bureau', 'Jessicawehrmanjoanne Viviano The Columbus Dispatch']",05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.dispatch.com/news/20190521/energy-secretary-urges-piketon-officials-to-move-quickly-to-test-for-nuclear-contamination,"WAVERLY — Holding signs saying “We want to live” and T-shirts pleading “Don’t Dump on Our Future,” a handful of children joined other protesters Tuesday outside a U.S. Department of Energy event designed to answer questions about the cleanup efforts at a former uranium enrichment plant in southern Ohio.

Crystal Glass of Piketon said the children needed to be there because “they are our future.”

“We’ve suffered enough here,” said Glass, whose 5-year-old daughter, Ruby Torian, wore a rainbow-colored tutu as she played in the grass outside the Pike County YMCA.

The protest drew 15 to 20 people who live in areas around the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Piketon, which enriched uranium from the mid-1950s until 2001.

>> VIDEO: Pike County residents allege nearby uranium enrichment plant causes cancer

Their concerns stem largely from recent discoveries that a form of the radioactive metal neptunium had been detected in 2017 by a U.S. Department of Energy air monitor outside Zahn’s Corner Middle School in Piketon.

Residents and local officials also were alarmed by an April report from researchers at Northern Arizona University that detected uranium and plutonium in homes, schools and creeks around the plant. DOE later disclosed that it had also found a form of a second radioactive metal, americium, in 2018.

Federal and state officials have said that the amounts detected by the DOE are of such a low amount that they do not pose health concerns. Still, the agency has agreed to fund a new round of independent testing to be conducted by a firm chosen by local officials.

U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry on Tuesday sent a letter to Gov. Mike DeWine urging the community to quickly pick the third-party company that will conduct the additional independent testing so it can be completed before the upcoming school year.

Perry was responding to a Thursday letter to a DOE official from DeWine, who said his understanding is that the amounts of neptunium and americium detected “are far below any public health risks."" He asked the DOE ""to provide any new radiological data to (the Ohio Department of Health) as soon as possible so that department experts can evaluate this data to make informed decisions regarding any potential public health concerns.”

Perry responded that he has directed the department to provide local and state authorities with all raw air-monitoring data from the 16 Portsmouth air-sampling locations from 2015 through the first quarter of 2019.

The third–party, independent study will be paid for via an existing grant to Ohio University. The third party will conduct tests of the Piketon community’s four schools and other areas of interest, Perry wrote.

But finding a third-party group to test the site has turned out to be something of a challenge, said Matt Brewster, health commissioner for the Pike County General Health District. He said his agency has spoken to four different labs that have backed out.

""When they realize what the scope of the work is as far as DOE involvement and the political nature of it all, they decline,” he said. “It’s a small, specialized field and some people, I think, don’t want to ruffle the DOE’s feathers if they have major contract work that comes from DOE.”

Inside at the open house, Jeff Bettinger, the DOE's Piketon site lead, said he hopes the new independent study will answer the community’s questions.

People who have worked in the industry for a long time, he acknowledged, may not always appreciate that the public views the issues differently.

“It’s a lesson to be learned, and we’re gonna get through it,” he said.

Cathy Eick of Waverly is a substitute aide who has worked at Zahn’s Corners, which closed early for the year last week due to contamination fears.

She was joined at Tuesday’s protest by daughters Madison Scott, 17, and Kaylee Scott, 12, who both attended the school.

Eick said the community has seen too many deaths, cancers and illnesses that have not been explained. And she wonders what is going on.

“My kids have had friends that have either passed away or they’ve watched them fight cancer and it’s just not acceptable, especially when you hear the reports that they find something in your school that can make your child sick,” she said. “The amount doesn’t really matter as much as it’s shocking that they found it there, and it isn’t acceptable.”

Eick lost her 26-year-old son, Corey Scott, to a heart condition two years ago. Now, she’s contacted her physician to ask if anything should be done for her daughters over the contamination concerns.

""I’m not willing to lose another child,” she said.

Glass, who protested outside the DOE meeting, said she was 36 when she was diagnosed last April with a rare woman’s cancer and went through surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. She attended Zahn’s Corners as a child.

Many can’t just pick up and leave the community, and Glass believes the government should pay plant neighbors for properties that have lost value due to contamination concerns. She plans to leave the community next year for Alabama and says some others are giving up.

DOE has rankled locals by declining a request to cease cleanup work until testing is done. Residents and local officials also oppose plans for a dumpsite on the plant property.

Charles Lux, who worked 18 years at the plant as a senior scientist, joined the protesters outside the YMCA, saying the government should perform full-body testing on the schoolchildren and teachers to determine if they have been adversely affected by any contaminants

Marilyn Ison and Gina Doyle, sisters who both live in Piketon, sat in lawn chairs nearby.

“We want heard. We want them to hear this in Washington,” said Ison, who held a sign asking ""Are we the next walking dead?""

Doyle cited a number of family members affected by cancer and said her sister has to have biopsies of several nodules in her thyroid. She said it is hard to believe that the cancer that has affected her family and others in the community is coincidental.

“It goes on and on. There are so many people, so many families in this county that have lost people to cancer and other horrible illnesses that everybody is tired of it,” Doyle sad. “Nobody wants to see anybody else die.""

""We have deterred attacks based on our reposturing of assets, deterred attacks against American forces,"" acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan Patrick Michael ShanahanThe Hill's Morning Report - Pelosi remains firm despite new impeachment push Iraq War looms over Trump battle with Iran Overnight Defense: Trump officials say efforts to deter Iran are working | Trump taps new Air Force secretary | House panel passes defense bill that limits border wall funds MORE said. ""Our biggest focus at this point is to prevent Iranian miscalculation. We do not want the situation to escalate. This is about deterrence, not about war.""

Shanahan was speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill after he, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard PompeoThe Hill's Morning Report - Pelosi remains firm despite new impeachment push Iraq War looms over Trump battle with Iran Overnight Defense: Trump officials say efforts to deter Iran are working | Trump taps new Air Force secretary | House panel passes defense bill that limits border wall funds MORE and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford briefed the House and the Senate on intelligence that led the administration to deploy additional forces to the Middle East and warn of threats to U.S. personnel emanating from Iran.

Democrats still worried: While congressional leaders from both parties and some individual lawmakers were previously briefed, Tuesday's all-members briefings provided the first opportunity for many on Capitol Hill to question the administration on intelligence and policy toward Iran.

And while the Trump administration's messaging Tuesday appeared designed to assuage concerns, Democrats emerged from the briefings continuing to voice concerns about President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump rips Dems' demands, impeachment talk: 'Witch Hunt continues!' Nevada Senate passes bill that would give Electoral College votes to winner of national popular vote The Hill's Morning Report - Pelosi remains firm despite new impeachment push MORE's strategy in the Middle East.

""When you do that, you're talking about a war that will go on and on and on.""

A refresher: Tuesday's briefing followed an outcry from lawmakers that the administration had not provided enough information to Congress on its decision to deployment military assets to the Persian Gulf and pull non-emergency personnel from diplomatic missions in Iraq in response to alleged Iranian threats.

The State Department then pulled non-emergency personnel from Iraq last week over the threats.

For his part, Trump spent days repeatedly pushing back on reports of disagreement among top aides over his administration's Iran strategy and said last week he hoped there would not be war with Tehran. On Monday evening, in a change in message, Trump said he had ""no indication"" Iran will act.

""With Iran, we'll see what happens. But they've been very hostile,"" Trump said. ""We have no indication that anything has happened or will happen. But if it does, it will be met, obviously, with great force. We'll have no choice.""

Shanahan says threat 'on hold': In addition to his comments at the Capitol, Shanahan told reporters at the Pentagon ahead of the briefing Tuesday that any threat from Iran is ""on hold"" after the arrival of U.S. military assets to the region.

""That doesn't mean that the threats that we've previously identified have gone away,"" Shanahan continued. ""Our prudent response, I think, has given the Iranians time to recalculate.""

Iran not open to talks: Iran on Tuesday dismissed the idea of talks with the United States, with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani saying that ""today's situation is not suitable for talks and our choice is resistance only.""

Trump had said Monday that if Iran called, ""we would certainly negotiate,"" but added that ""if they're not ready, they don't have to bother.""

The mood on Capitol Hill: The Hill's Rebecca Kheel also took a look at the tensions around Iran ahead of the congressional briefings.

HOUSE APPROPS PASSES DEFENSE BILL THAT WOULD LIMIT FUNDS FOR BORDER WALL, PULL US SUPPORT FROM YEMEN: The House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday passed its version of the fiscal year 2020 defense spending bill, voting along party lines for legislation that falls $8 billion below what the Trump administration requested, curtails the use of defense dollars to build a border wall and ends U.S. military support for the Saudi-led conflict in Yemen.

The panel voted 30 to 22 to move ahead the bill that funds the Defense Department at $690.2 billion in fiscal 2020, $15.8 billion above what was allocated the previous year but $8 billion below the White House's request.

Broken down, it includes $622.1 billion in base funding and $68.1 billion for the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) war fund.

""The Defense subcommittee has put forward a responsible spending bill that increases funds by $1 billion to address readiness requirements and ensure the well-being of our service members and their families,"" said House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey Nita Sue LoweyOvernight Defense: Trump officials say efforts to deter Iran are working | Trump taps new Air Force secretary | House panel passes defense bill that limits border wall funds House Appropriations passes defense bill that would limit funds for border wall, pull US support from Yemen war Ending AIDS requires US investment MORE (D-N.Y.).

""This bill also would prohibit the use of funds for President Trump's wasteful border wall, reserving DOD resources to protect the United States from actual threats, rather than those imagined by our President. This reflects a commitment to our national security for which we can all be proud.""

The AUMF fight: The bill reflects House Democrats' desire to curtail Trump's recent moves in foreign policy and along the border, most notably through Rep. Barbara Lee Barbara Jean LeeOvernight Defense: Trump officials say efforts to deter Iran are working | Trump taps new Air Force secretary | House panel passes defense bill that limits border wall funds House Appropriations passes defense bill that would limit funds for border wall, pull US support from Yemen war House panel approves language revoking 2001 war authority as Iran tensions spike MORE's (D-Calif.) amendment to retire the 2001 authorization for the use of military force (AUMF). The provision would sunset the AUMF – used as legal justification for military operations against terrorist groups 41 times in 18 countries since it was passed – eight months after the bill is enacted, giving Congress time to debate and vote on a new AUMF.

The AUMF debate comes as Trump has threatened Iran with military force.

But GOP lawmakers argued ending the current war authorization without a new one already approved could hamper military operations.

""I can think of few things more dangerous and ill-conceived than removing a fundamental underpinning for US military operations without having consensus agreement on what is to replace it,"" said the Defense subcommittee's ranking member, Rep. Kay Granger Norvell (Kay) Kay GrangerOvernight Defense: Trump officials say efforts to deter Iran are working | Trump taps new Air Force secretary | House panel passes defense bill that limits border wall funds House panel advances billion energy bill, defying Trump House Appropriations passes defense bill that would limit funds for border wall, pull US support from Yemen war MORE (R-Texas).

The reprogramming issue: The legislation's passage also sets up a fight over the bill's language to restrict the Pentagon's reprogram authority – or the amount of money it is allowed to move from the purpose for which the funds were designated into another area – to $1.5 billion. The move was a response to Trump's use of reprogram authority to move defense dollars to the construction of his promised border wall.

""It is unfortunate that the historical and unprecedented comity that has existed between the Committee and the Department of Defense no longer exists, and as a result, the bill reduces the amount of money the Department can move between accounts,"" said House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense Chairman Pete Visclosky.

Other problematic areas: In addition, the bill is likely to rankle the Republican-controlled Senate and the White House over its $690.2 billion defense top-line, which GOP lawmakers said would exceed budget caps and force budget cuts under sequestration.

The administration had instead sought to inflate its OCO request to $164.3 billion to stay under the caps, but Democrats accused the White House of attempting to set up a slush fund.

The bill also only allocated $15 million for the Pentagon to research setting up Trump's desired Space Force, far below the $72 million the department requested to build a Space Force headquarters.

Democrats have not been pleased with the administration's sparsely detailed plans for a separate space branch, and Visclosky said the Pentagon's Space Force proposal was ""incredibly lacking in detail.""

TRUMP TAPS NEW AIR FORCE SECRETARY: President Trump on Tuesday announced plans to nominate Barbara Barrett as the next Air Force secretary.

The president shared his choice via Twitter, adding that he believes Barrett ""will be an outstanding Secretary!""

""I am pleased to announce my nomination of Barbara Barrett of Arizona, and former Chairman of the Aerospace Corporation, to be the next Secretary of the Air Force. She will be an outstanding Secretary! #FlyFightWin,"" he wrote.

Who is Barrett? Barrett is the former chairwoman of The Aerospace Corporation, a federally funded research center for national security and military space systems.

She previously served in the Reagan and George W. Bush administrations, first as the deputy administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and later as the U.S. ambassador to Finland.

If confirmed by the Senate, she will replace outgoing Secretary Heather Wilson, who will step down at the end of the month.

""Ambassador Barrett is a force to be reckoned with and who has the leadership, experience, and knowledge to lead our Air Force into the future during a time of increased global threats,"" McSally, a veteran and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement.

What about Wilson?: Wilson has served in the role since May 2017. An Air Force veteran and former Republican congresswoman from New Mexico, she announced in March that she would leave to become president of the University of Texas at El Paso.

Her departure followed reports that her relationship with President Trump had soured amid the debate over his desire to establish a standalone ""Space Force.""

Air Force Under Secretary Matt Donovan will take over as the service's acting secretary beginning June 1 while a full-time replacement is confirmed.

USDA: Don’t add foodborne illness to summer menu,https://www.masslive.com,"['Anne-Gerard Flynn', 'Special To The Republican']",05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.masslive.com/news/2019/05/usda-dont-add-foodborne-illness-to-summer-menu.html,"Rates of foodborne illnesses increase during the summer.

According to the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the season’s hot and humid weather causes environmental bacteria to grow faster and, of course, food is more exposed to possible contamination with summer’s many outdoor activities.

“We receive thousands of different questions from consumers regarding food safety during the summer,"" said Adam Ghering of FSIS’ Office of Public Affairs and Consumer Education.

“Many of those questions are linked to the weather. Severe storms and power outages routinely impact food safety during the summer.”

He added, “In general, perishable foods will stay safe in a refrigerator for four hours when the door remains closed.”

“If the power is out for longer, you can transfer foods to a cooler with ice or frozen gel packs. Foods in the freezer will be safe for approximately 48 hours, 24 hours if the fridge is half full,” said Ghering, adding further information on what food is still considered save to consume after a power outage is available online or by calling the USDA’s Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-674-6854.

Ghering said that the “other topic that we receive many questions about is cooking outdoors.”

“Cooking away from the kitchen can be fun but it also requires a good deal of preparation to ensure everything goes smoothly,” he said.

“Bringing water for washing hands, utensils and other equipment is something that can be easily overlooked. Moist towelettes can be a good ‘touch-up’ when your hands get dirty but the most effective method is soap and water.”

He also recommended a cooler will “to keep your food cold, just remember to keep replenishing ice as it melts” and “any type of food thermometer will provide you with the internal temperature of your meat and thereby help you prevent foodborne illness.”

“Any type of improper handling of your food can cause illness but not properly cooking and cooling meat and poultry is vital during summer months,” Ghering said.

“Meat and poultry can quickly brown when grilled but that doesn’t mean they are safe to eat.”

He called probe food thermometers “which you can keep in meat and poultry while cooking” a “great addition to your grilling equipment” in particular.

USDA tips to avoid food poisoning that is estimated to cause some 128,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 deaths in the United States annually include:

Perishable food should not sit out for more than two hours at room temperature and no more than an hour when the temperature is above 90 degrees.

Pack beverages in one cooler and perishable food in another cooler and place cooler in shade when possible, even in car.

If grilling away from home, bring your own water for preparation and cleaning if unsure of availability of clean water supply.

Use a meat thermometer to ensure harmful bacteria are destroyed. Cook beef, pork, lamb and veal to internal minimum safe temperatures of 145 degrees; ground meats, 160 degrees; whole poultry, poultry breasts and ground poultry, 165 degrees.

Keep cooked meats at 140 degrees or warmer by setting them to the side of the grill rack, not directly over the coals where they could overcook. They may also be kept hot in an oven set at approximately 200 degrees in a chafing dish, slow cooker or warming tray.

Leftovers should be stored within two hours of cooking. Divide them into smaller portions and refrigerate or freeze in covered shallow containers for quicker cooling."
State Department condemns killing of American citizen in Nicaraguan prison,https://www.cnn.com,['Kevin Bohn'],05-18-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/18/politics/state-department-nicaragua-prison/index.html,"(CNN) The State Department condemned the killing of an American citizen being held in Nicaragua after a prison uprising, according to Nicaraguan and US officials.

However, they disagreed whether the killing of Eddy Antonio Montes Praslín was a justified homicide as the US ambassador and a lawyer representing Nicaraguan political prisoners maintain, or if it was justified because he was attacking guards as the Nicaraguans maintain.

Montes was killed during an incident at La Modelo prison on Thursday, according to Nicaraguan officials.

""We vehemently condemn the killing of Mr. Montes. His death, the deaths of hundreds of innocent civilians at the hands of (Nicaraguan President Daniel) Ortega's security and parapolice forces, and the continued detention of hundreds more political prisoners demonstrate the regime's utter disregard for human life and democratic freedoms,"" State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement.

""We call for an immediate, thorough, and transparent investigation of Montes's death. We reiterate our call for the unconditional release of all political prisoners. The United States will hold accountable the Ortega regime and Nicaraguan security forces involved in human rights abuses and violations,"" she continued.

"Kris Kobach turned down Homeland Security position, says only ‘czar’ can solve border crisis",https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Stephen Dinan']",05-22-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/may/22/kris-kobach-turned-down-homeland-security-position/,"Kris Kobach said Wednesday he turned down an immigration adviser’s position at Homeland Security because it doesn’t carry enough weight to be able to solve the border crisis.

Mr. Kobach, in an exclusive interview with The Washington Times, said only a position inside the White House, a “czar”-style post, would have the access and oversight to achieve what President Trump is striving for.

He said he wishes the best for Ken Cuccinelli, a former Virginia attorney general whom Mr. Trump did pick to take the as-yet undefined advisory role at Homeland Security.

But Mr. Kobach, a former Kansas secretary of state, said a non-confirmed subordinate position in one department can’t cut through the bureaucracy that’s preventing Mr. Trump from securing the border.

“I told him I wasn’t interested if I couldn’t get the job done,” he said to The Times. “It’s something that requires the White House to be directly engaged and moving the chess pieces on the table very quickly. A subordinate official at any one of those agencies isn’t going to be able to get it done.”

Frustrated by the massive migrant surge at the border, Mr. Trump last month orchestrated a shakeup at Homeland Security, ousting Secretary Kristjen Nielsen and acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Ronald D. Vitiello.

Mr. Trump said at the time he wanted a tougher direction.

A month and half later, the numbers at the border are worse, and it’s unclear what steps have been taken to change the incentives that spurred a record number of families to jump the U.S.-Mexico boundary last month.

The president was considering creating an “immigration czar” position, which would have crossed department lines and coordinated strategy from the top, presumably with the direct imprimatur of Mr. Trump.

In the end, the president went with the adviser’s position at Homeland Security. It’s not clear why he squelched the czar idea.

Mr. Kobach, architect of some of the most innovative and controversial state policies to crack down on illegal immigration during the Obama years, said it will take a czar-style post to make the changes the president wants.

“I discussed with the president the position Ken is now evidently going to take, but I said I wasn’t interested in it,” Mr. Kobach said. “It requires extraordinary coordination of multiple agencies, including the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, the Department of Labor and even the Department of Interior. That can only be done effectively either from the White House or at a Cabinet-level position.

“I hope I’m wrong, and I wish Ken the best. And I hope he is able to move the needle and truly want him to succeed,” Mr. Kobach said. “But I just fear that the position of a subordinate officer, not Senate confirmed, in the Department of Homeland Security just won’t be able to get it done.”

Mr. Kobach was the target of a leak earlier this week to The New York Times, which reported on his list of 10 conditions for taking the czar’s post. Among them were an office in the West Wing of the White House and walk-in privileges to see the president — both likely critical to a job that would require cracking heads across multiple departments.

He also asked for access to a jet to be on the border weekly, time to be with his family in Kansas and a promise he’d eventually be nominated as Homeland Security secretary.

Mr. Kobach on Wednesday said he expects to continue to offer advice to Mr. Trump.

“I still meet regularly with the president to discuss immigration issues,” he said. “I stand ready to help the president in any way.”

Mr. Kobach said he would have come to the job with a list of ideas the president could tackle without needing to rely on Congress.

He’s publicly written about four of them: releasing new rules to replace the Flores court settlement that forces the catch-and-release of immigrant families living in the U.S. illegally; revoke the Obama-era policy that grants parole to asylum-seekers while they await their cases, which in practice means they get work permits and food stamps; construct massive facilities to process and hold asylum-seekers; and pressure Mexico to sign a “safe third country” deal, which would mean asylum-seekers who cross its territory could be immediately sent back over the border.

Each of those moves could help change the incentives that spurred some 65,000 family-unit migrants to jump the border last month, though the safe third country agreement may be the biggest.

“If anything’s a silver bullet, that is a silver bullet,” Mr. Kobach said. “A subordinate official at DHS isn’t going to have any authority to get that done.”

Whatever steps Mr. Trump decides on, Mr. Kobach said there are “easily 50 significant executive actions” he could do without having to go to Congress for approval.

Instead, Mr. Trump last week delivered a speech laying out a plan to revamp the legal immigration system. The speech seemed like a non sequitur coming amid a border crisis related to illegal immigration.
