Reddit Quarantines Pro-Trump Subreddit r/The_Donald Over Anti-Police Threats,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Will Sommer'],06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.thedailybeast.com/reddit-quarantines-pro-trump-subreddit-the_donald-over-anti-police-threats,"Reddit quarantined the “The_Donald” subreddit on Wednesday, citing threats made on the popular forum for Trump supporters against law enforcement officers.

“Recent behaviors including threats against the police and public figures is content that is prohibited by our violence policy,” a Reddit spokesperson said in a statement. “As a result, we have actioned individual users and quarantined the subreddit.""

The new quarantine was brought on by anti-police threats posted on The_Donald. Some users had apparently encouraged violence against law enforcement, angry that officials in Oregon were trying to bring back GOP state senators who fled the state to avoid voting on a climate-change bill. In a note to The_Donald moderators, Reddit administrators said they had “observed this behavior in the form of encouragement of violence towards police officers and public officials in Oregon.”

It’s not clear what posts prompted the quarantine, but on Monday, Media Matters detailed a number of anti-police messages posted on The_Donald.

One user posted that they would have “no problems shooting a cop trying to strip rights from Citizens.” Another wrote that “rifles are the only way we're going to get any peace in our lives ever again.”

With roughly 754,000 subscribers, The_Donald is one of the largest forums for Trump fans on the internet, and by far the largest on Reddit. The site became so prominent in the Trump movement that Trump himself answered questions from the forum’s members during the 2016 campaign.

Trump digital strategy director Dan Scavino monitors The_Donald for ideas, Politico reported in May, and Trump has tweeted meme videos from the site.

The_Donald plays a key role in the right-wing ecosystem online, according to Becca Lewis, a Stanford doctoral student who studies online subcultures on the right. The_Donald posters take memes from more extreme forums like 4Chan or Gab and bring them to the subreddit, where they can picked up by more mainstream politicians and pro-Trump personalities.

“You get these things that start out just with smaller audiences, and then in part through The_Donald end up reaching millions and millions of people,” Lewis said.

As part of the quarantine, Reddit users will see a content warning before accessing the subreddit. In the past, quarantines against other subreddits have made them harder to find, and sometimes serve as a prelude to being banned from the site entirely.

The_Donald was controversial on Reddit long before Wednesday's quarantine. Prior to the 2017 Unite the Right white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, The_Donald moderators pinned a post encouraging members to attend the rally to the top of the page. The subreddit’s users regularly vote content from white supremacists and other extremists to the forum’s frontpage. The subreddit was also an early hotbed for conspiracy theories about murdered Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich, with The_Donald posters regularly claiming without evidence that Rich was murdered by Hillary Clinton.

Lewis believes the quarantine is a “step in the right direction,” but comes “too little, too late.”

“It has become a hotbed for disinformation, harassment, calls for violence, and conspiracy theories in the form of memes and other forum-style posts,” Lewis said of The_Donald.

In its message to the subreddit’s moderators, Reddit asked for them to take action to prevent further threats being posted on the forum. One The_Donald moderator, “shadowman3001,” fumed after receiving the note, claiming the quarantine was political.

“It would seem they've set up an impossible standard as a reason to kill us before the 2020 election,” the moderator wrote.

In emails to The Daily Beast, The_Donald moderator “sublimeinslime” said the quarantine was “unexpected” and said it could drive some The_Donald members to other social media platforms.

“As hard as our moderators work in a position in which they are not paid, it is somewhat of an insult as we are faced with the burden of correcting this,” the moderator said.

Other pro-Trump figures, including Fox News host Tucker Carlson and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, have also appeared in the forum to interact with subscribers.

The quarantine provoked outrage across the pro-Trump internet. A self-described “memesmith” named “Carpe Donktum,” whose videos Trump has reposted on Twitter, declared the quarantine to be “ABSOLUTE BULLSHIT.”"
"Restaurant group responds after employee is accused of spitting on Eric Trump, says she's been 'placed on leave'",https://www.foxnews.com,['Michael Bartiromo'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/restaurant-group-spitting-eric-trump-placed-leave,"The restaurant group that owns Chicago’s Aviary cocktail bar has responded to reports that an employee spat on Eric Trump on Tuesday night.

“Last night an unfortunate incident occurred between an employee at The Aviary and Eric Trump,” reads a statement issued by the Alinea Group, which owns several other restaurants in Chicago and elsewhere. “We did not witness the incident and we are just beginning to learn the details.”

Trump, whose Twitter activity indicates he was visiting Trump Hotel Chicago, shared a statement with Breitbart News following the incident, condemning it “purely a disgusting act by somebody who clearly has emotional problems.”

He also suggested the employee’s motivations were political, saying, “For a party that preaches tolerance, this once again demonstrates they have very little civility.”

The Alinea Group, however, called the online response, both from critics and supporters, ""troubling.""

“The online discussion about the incident is troubling. Hundreds of people are calling for the demise of our business, threatening our employees, and posting fake reviews… they are wrong to do so based on the actions of a lone individual,” the statement continued.

“So too, however, are those people wrong who are praising this as an act of civil disobedience. We have voices and the means to be heard. A degrading act lowers the tenor of debate. To some it might feel good, but it is unlikely to serve any larger purpose.

“We hope this incident can, at least, serve to illuminate the current absurdity of the discourse in our politics. As fellow Americans and citizens, we should all aim higher.”

Aviary’s mention of fake reviews has indeed prompted a response from Yelp, who placed the establishment’s page under an Unusual Activity Alert, during which time posts and reviews are temporarily disabled to prevent comments stemming from folks wanting to respond to recent news events, rather than their actual visits.

However, not all comments had been filtered out by Wednesday afternoon, with one praising the “MVP employee” who allegedly spat on Trump.

“I thought nothing could top the amazing cocktails. Then Eric Trump happened,” the Yelp user wrote in a five-star review posted Wednesday. “I love this place. I wish I could give more stars. I can't wait to go back and tip their MVP employee.”

Following the incident, the Chicago Police Department confirmed that they had arrived at the scene and assisted the U.S. Secret Service. Police did not confirm that Trump was the target. Representatives for Trump did not immediately respond to Fox News, and the Secret Service declined to comment as of early afternoon on Wednesday.

The Aviary, though, confirmed the employee was not currently working at the bar.

“We have not yet spoken with the employee but our HR team has, in the meantime, placed her on leave,” the Alinea Group confirmed. “We will not discuss internal HR matters beyond this statement.”

The Alinea Group owns and operates several other establishments, including Alinea, Aviary and Next in Chicago, along with Aviary NYC, among others."
Weeks of Talks Led a Reluctant Mueller to Testify,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Nicholas Fandos', 'Eileen Sullivan']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/us/politics/trump-mueller-testimony.html,"Mr. Mueller staked out his position in an 11-minute address — his first and only public appearance as special counsel — in the Justice Department briefing room. Congress could force him to testify, he said, but warned he “would not go beyond our report.”

“It contains our findings and analysis and the reasons for the decisions we made,” Mr. Mueller said. “We chose those words carefully, and the work speaks for itself. And the report is my testimony. I would not provide information beyond that which is already public in any appearance before Congress.”

Talks about his testimony had begun after Mr. Barr released a redacted version of Mr. Mueller’s report in April. They slowed after Mr. Mueller left his post as special counsel and no longer had easy access to a coterie of staff and official government channels for negotiating, people involved in the discussions said. Democrats ultimately turned to Jonathan R. Yarowsky, a partner at Mr. Mueller’s former law firm of WilmerHale who also previously worked for the Judiciary Committee, to serve as an intermediary to Mr. Mueller’s closest aides, according to the congressional official directly involved.

WilmerHale also made office space available to Mr. Mueller as he negotiated, Robert T. Novick, a managing partner, said on Wednesday.

By mid-June, the patience of Democratic activists and lawmakers on Capitol Hill was wearing thin. The White House was blocking witness after witness called to testify on Capitol Hill and threatened to go on stonewalling “illegitimate” oversight by Democrats as long as needed.

Democrats tried to impress upon Mr. Mueller’s team that they would subpoena him if he did not agree to terms and demand that he appear on two consecutive days for much longer sessions, said the senior official involved in the talks, who was not authorized to speak by name. And though Democrats understood his position, they made clear that Congress and the public disagreed with the view that a Justice Department prosecutor need never speak and that Mr. Mueller had a responsibility to clear the public record about his work.

By Tuesday evening, both sides agreed to the more limited setting under subpoena. Rather than risk letting details of the agreement leak out, Mr. Nadler and Representative Adam B. Schiff, the Intelligence Committee chairman, decided to announce the terms in a statement at 9 p.m."
Trump claims Japan 'doesn't have to help' if US is attacked,https://www.cnn.com,['Zachary Cohen'],06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/26/politics/trump-japan-defense-commitments/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump again lamented what he views as an unequal military alliance Wednesday, claiming that if the US is attacked, Japan ""doesn't have to help us at all"" and ""can watch it on the Sony television.""

Trump's criticism of Japan came during an interview with on Fox Business Network when he was asked about the possibility of bilateral trade deals ahead of his G20 trip, where he will meet with several counterparts, including Japanese President Shinzo Abe.

""Let me start off with general statement -- almost all countries in this world take tremendous advantage,"" of the US, Trump told Fox Business by phone, repeating a common refrain of his 2016 campaign.

The President then criticized NATO broadly, before singling out Japan for the terms of its military alliance with the US.

""If Japan is attacked, we will fight World War Three ... with our lives and with our treasure,"" he said, adding, ""If we're attacked, Japan doesn't have to help us at all,"" Trump said. Japan, he claimed, ""can watch it on the Sony television, okay, the attack.""

Top Clean-Air Official Plans To Step Down From EPA Post Amid Ethics Probe,https://www.npr.org,['Vanessa Romo'],06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.npr.org/2019/06/26/736290295/top-clean-air-official-plans-to-step-down-from-epa-post-amid-ethics-probe,"Top Clean-Air Official Plans To Step Down From EPA Post Amid Ethics Probe

Bill Wehrum is stepping down as the Environmental Protection Agency's chief air quality official at the end of the month, amid mounting scrutiny over possible ethics violations.

EPA Administrator Andrew Andrew Wheeler said Wednesday that Wehrum's departure as the head of the agency's Office of Air and Radiation is both voluntary and expected.

""While I have known of Bill's desire to leave at the end of this month for quite sometime, the date has still come too soon,"" Wheeler said in a statement.

Wehrum was confirmed to the EPA post in November of 2017. Since then, he has been regarded as the architect of some of the Trump administration's most controversial climate policies, overseeing efforts to roll back regulations that limit air pollution. One casualty was the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, which just last week was replaced by the Affordable Clean Energy regulation — new rules that allow more greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.

""I applaud Bill and his team for finalizing the Affordable Clean Energy regulation last week and for the tremendous progress he has made in so many other regulatory initiatives,"" Wheeler said.

Wehrum also crafted a proposal that would weaken future fuel economy standards for cars and trucks.

""Bill Wehrum oversaw the most relentless rollback of clean air, climate and health safeguards in EPA's history,"" said the Natural Resources Defense Council's John Walke, who is the clean air director of the group's climate and clean energy program. He called on the agency to ""return to its mission to protect Americans' health and air quality, and take strong climate action.""

Allegations of ethical violations dogged Wehrum throughout his EPA tenure, related to his former work as a lawyer and lobbyist for a number of the same companies the agency regulates — including some of the country's largest coal, oil and petrochemical companies.

Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee launched a probe into Wehrum's conduct in April, seeking to find out if he or his deputy, fellow former lobbyist David Harlow, may have loosened air pollution rules to help their former clients in the energy sector.

In a letter to eight utility companies and Wehrum's former lobbying firm, House Democrats on the Energy Committee said they were concerned that ""the Office of Air and Radiation's agenda appears remarkably similar to the substantive agenda"" of the firm's utilities clients. They added, ""These allegations have raised substantial questions regarding whether Mr. Wehrum and Mr. Harlow are properly carrying out the [Clean Air Act] as directed by Congress or instead changing agency policies to benefit former clients.""

Wehrum is the latest Trump administration official to leave the environmental agency under a cloud of scrutiny. Former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt who resigned after reports that he misused his power and spent far more taxpayer money than his predecessors had on travel and security expenses.

With Wehrum's exit, his deputy, Anne Idsal, will take over his responsibilities."
Supreme Court gives Marine seeking VA benefits second chance in lower court,https://www.cnn.com,"['Ariane De Vogue', 'Devan Cole']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/26/politics/supreme-court-kisor-wilkie-marine-veteran-federal-agencies/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Supreme Court on Wednesday gave a Marine Corps veteran who sought disability benefits for his service-related post-traumatic stress a second chance to prevail in a case that will impact the amount of power federal agencies have.

But lurking behind the case was a dispute over government agencies that some conservatives feel have become too powerful, upsetting the balance of power.

Writing for five of the nine justices, Justice Elena Kagan narrowed the circumstances in which courts will defer to an agency's interpretation of ambiguous language in its own regulations. But Kagan stopped short of overturning court precedent.

Kagan wrote that such deference ""retains an important role in construing agency regulations,"" but she said it is ""sometimes appropriate and sometimes not."" She outlined ""markers"" for when courts should and should not defer.

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote an opinion concurring in the judgment outlining those markers.

""The underlying regulation must be genuinely ambiguous; the agency's interpretation must be reasonable and must reflect its authoritative, expertise-based, and fair and considered judgment; and the agency must take account of reliance interests and avoid unfair surprise,"" Roberts wrote.

Paul Hughes, a lawyer for Kisor, praised the ruling, saying, ""Today's decision will significantly narrow agency authority."" Hughes noted that the lower court had applied a ""reflexive form of deference"" to the agency that was not warranted.

Justice Neil Gorsuch, joined in full by Justice Clarence Thomas and in part by Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Samuel Alito, wrote to say they thought court precedent should have been ""easy for the Court"" to overturn. Gorsuch said that while the opinion manages to leave court precedent ""maimed and enfeebled"" the justices should have found the ""nerve"" to wipe it off the books.

""Although it's easy to get lost in the administrative law weeds of this case, the major headline here is that Chief Justice (John) Roberts declined to join the four other conservative justices in overruling prior precedent, and instead joined his more progressive colleagues in narrowing but not ditching the idea that courts should sometimes defer to how administrative agencies resolve ambiguities in their own regulations,"" said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law.

""The chief justice wrote separately to suggest that there isn't that much daylight between the result the Court reached and the one the dissenters would have adopted, but lower courts may well disagree as cases like these go forward,"" he said.

Vladeck added that the Court ""was unanimous in agreeing to send the case back to the Federal Circuit, but split as to what should happen thereafter.""

""Five Justices still think there is some room for deference to the VA, although they're not sure whether such deference is warranted in this case. Four would have the lower courts resolve the issue without any deference to the VA,"" he said.

What Trump May Be Missing In Those Polls He Calls Fake,https://www.npr.org,['Ron Elving'],06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.npr.org/2019/06/26/734563557/what-trump-may-be-missing-in-those-polls-he-calls-fake,"What Trump May Be Missing In Those Polls He Calls Fake

Enlarge this image toggle caption Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images

As President Trump attends the G-20 summit in Japan this week, a score of Democrats who want his job are debating in Miami — vying for a nomination that looks increasingly worth having.

Major polls taken in the late spring showed President Trump trailing his top Democratic challengers both nationwide and in key states where the 2020 election will be decided. One recent Fox News poll, for example, showed Trump trailing prospective challengers Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders by 10 and 9 percentage points, respectively.

Weak polling numbers are not a new thing in the Trump presidency. In 2016, polls showed candidate Trump losing right up until the day he was elected. (Cliffhanger wins in several swing states produced his Electoral College majority, even as he lost the national popular vote by nearly 2 percentage points.)

The president has long since made a habit of dismissing polls, or at least those he doesn't like, as one more example of ""fake news.""

Yet it was widely reported this month that the president's own polling team had found similar results in its field work in March. When word of this leaked, and was confirmed by the president's campaign, the president reportedly fired three veteran members of his polling team.

The president's campaign manager has said Trump's numbers have recovered since March and that his ""numbers have never been better,"" although he has yet to release any numbers to back up that assertion.

Presidential perspective

Poor poll numbers are not unusual for presidents midway through a first term. Three of the past four presidents who won a second term were trailing prospective opponents 18 months before they were reelected.

As NPR's Mara Liasson has noted on Twitter, incumbents who have come back from significant deficits include Ronald Reagan, who won in 49 states against Walter Mondale in 1984. Moreover, the last incumbent president who lost his reelection bid (George H.W. Bush) did so after having been far ahead of the field with 18 months to go.

Polls pertain to a point in time, and their shelf life is short. They have only limited power to predict the future because the events and dynamics of the actual election year always alter the landscape in unforeseeable ways.

So what is the value of a poll taken this far from Election Day? One answer might be found in the examples Liasson cited.

All three of these presidents — Reagan, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama — had suffered substantial setbacks in the midterm elections during their first term. Each was battling emboldened opponents in Congress.

In June of the year preceding their reelection bids, three of the four were ""losing"" to either a specific opponent from the other party or a generic nominee of the other party.

But all found ways to tack toward the center, accentuate the positive side of their first term and renew their personal bond with the voters who put them in office. All three wound up winning — Reagan in a historic landslide. Clinton and Obama were reelected more narrowly but still had comfortable leads in the Electoral College.

So what happened to the one candidate Liasson cited who had been ahead at a comparable point in time? The first President Bush, flush with success after the quick collapse of the Iraqi army in the Persian Gulf War, seemed almost guaranteed a second term when polls were conducted in June 1991.

Partly as a result, Bush and his team underestimated the challenges and challengers ahead. They were dismissive of intra-party rival Pat Buchanan and independent H. Ross Perot, and untroubled by such upstarts as Clinton, who was then the youthful governor of Arkansas. Worse yet, the Bush team would be slow to react to the recession that overtook the economy that fall.

Battered by Buchanan and Perot and the economy in the early months of 1992, Bush found himself beleaguered and forced to cover his conservative flank. That led to moves such as his veto of the popular Family and Medical Leave Act (which was almost enacted over his veto). All this helped Clinton, who would win the three-way November election against Bush and Perot with just 43% of the popular vote.

Led by the polls

So, early polls cannot ""call the race."" But they can point a candidacy in a particular direction, right or wrong. They can lead to complacency, or they can offer insight into the state of political opinion and the mix of national sentiments.

Taken seriously, and taken in concert with other sources of intelligence, early polls can act as a corrective for a presidency at risk.

We can read today's polls, then, and ask why Trump is not doing better in the midst of relative peace, low unemployment and interest rates, and a soaring stock market. We can also observe that he loses these hypothetical matchups despite overwhelming approval ratings among Republicans.

Is there something he is doing that keeps his base firm but prevents its expansion? Are there ways the president can alter his approach and keep his friends close, while alienating fewer potential swing voters?

So far, his reelection strategy seems centered on his base and the most provocative issues and behaviors that bind him to it. These include his hard line on immigration, tough talk on trade and bellicose attitude toward foreign adversaries — as well as his confrontational personal style.

Defenders say ""it's worked for him so far,"" and that is true. But if the current polls mean anything, they mean that what has worked for him has limits. The signals are there to be seen."
Trump's attorney: White House and DOJ are not planning to block any of Mueller's testimony,https://www.cnn.com,"['David Shortell', 'Paul Leblanc']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/26/politics/jay-sekulow-white-house-doj-mueller-cnntv/index.html,"(CNN) The White House and Justice Department are not planning to block any of former special counsel Robert Mueller's testimony next month, President Donald Trump's attorney Jay Sekulow said Wednesday.

""There are no legal moves that are being made here,"" Sekulow said to CNN's Jake Tapper on ""The Lead.""

Sekulow said he expected Mueller's testimony to mirror the special counsel's report, and said it ""certainly would be inappropriate"" if Mueller made any new revelations in his testimony.

Sekulow would not say if the President has read the full report, but said Trump's legal team has ""reviewed it more than once."" He called the report ""convoluted"" and ""very hard to follow.""

The President's lawyers are not actively preparing for an impeachment, Sekulow said.

Veterans Affairs whistleblowers call for end to culture of retaliation,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/veterans-affairs-whistleblower-notified-termination-day-congressional-testimony/story?id=63922369,"A Department of Veterans Affairs health care worker said she received a letter from the agency on Monday notifying her that she would be terminated, just one day before she was scheduled to testify at a congressional hearing about how the VA treats other whistleblowers.

Baltimore psychologist Minu Aghevli said she received the letter, which outlined the VA Maryland Health Care Center's proposal to terminate her employment, after working for the agency for nearly 20 years and raising concerns for years about the quality of patient care and manipulating wait lists in opioid treatment programs. In an earlier letter, the VA says she was facing disciplinary action for treating a patient at a non-VA hospital and violating the agency's code of conduct, but she and her lawyer argue the agency is retaliating against her for raising concerns about problems within the department.

The agency denies that the notice was related to her testimony.

The VA has faced dozens of complaints from whistleblowers who say they were retaliated against for raising concerns about the quality of medical care for veterans or actions by agency officials, according to the agency that handles whistleblower complaints from federal employees. Aghevli and two other whistleblowers from the agency testified in front of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee on Tuesday saying the agency has a culture of trying to silence or punish people who report problems.

C-SPAN

Aghevli called the termination proposal scary, because she said it appears to be a warning shot to ward off other potential whistleblowers.

""This feels obviously retaliatory, but worse than that I feel like I'm being used as a threat against other employees who might think about speaking up about patient care concerns and I resent that. I do not want to be used as a pawn,"" she testified on Tuesday.

Aghevli first reported concerns over hospital waitlists in 2014, just as a national scandal erupted over wait times, amid allegations patients had died waiting for care at a VA facility in Phoenix.

""In order to reduce the waitlist, I was instructed to improperly remove veterans from the electronic waitlist by scheduling fake appointments for them in an imaginary clinic,"" Aghevli said in remarks she prepared to share with Congress on Tuesday. ""This clinic was not tied to any provider or location, nor did it actually correspond to any real visits...The veterans scheduled for these fictitious appointments were not actually receiving VA care.

""The VA also pressured me to artificially reduce the number of patients on the waitlist through other improper means,"" she added.

The VA's internal watchdog has investigated concerns about wait lists in opioid treatment facilities in Maryland, though it does not specify if it was prompted by Aghevli's complaint. The inspector general's inquiry published in 2018 confirmed that the VA's opioid program transferred veterans waiting for treatment to another list where they essentially wouldn't be counted. In an earlier report, the agency said they would improve internal controls by 2017 to ensure that all patients receive treatment.

Aghevli said the VA has ""engaged in continuous retaliation"" against her in an apparent effort to oust her from the agency ever since she first reported her concerns, including being stripped of patient-care privileges and assigned to do ""menial administrative tasks.""

""Two months ago, I was told that my clinical privileges are being suspended. So since that time I have been forbidden from having any clinical contact with patients and I was assigned to pretty menial administrative tasks,"" she said. ""It felt like I was put in a position where I would be especially visible to other staff to make it sort of a publicly humiliating situation.""

A letter from her legal team to the Office of Special Counsel -- which aims to safeguard federal employees, especially whistleblowers -- says Aghevli received the ""notice of proposed removal"" on June 24.

""The notice of proposed removal was issued immediately after the Agency learned that Dr. Aghevli's disclosures would be the subject of a front-page story in USA Today and that she would be testifying before Congress,"" her legal team wrote in the letter to OSC.

""The reasons set forth by the Agency for proposing Dr. Aghevli's removal are without merit and cannot be the actual reasons for proposing her removal.""

Aghevli did not send ABC News a copy of the letter because she said wanted to send her official response first.

Aghevli, who served as the former coordinator of the department's opioid addiction treatment program in Baltimore, said hospital officials cited in the letter an ongoing matter with a patient's follow-up care and gave her several business days to respond. In her testimony on Tuesday, she said her privileges were suspended in April because she visited a high-risk patient in a local hospital after he overdosed, and that the patient disclosed he attempted suicide after leaving the VA facility.

Aghevli declined to offer specific details about the April incident, citing potential patient privacy concerns, but she said it involved a ""high risk veteran"" who had visited the hospital’s emergency room in the past.

""So basically, what they say is I shouldn't have followed up with this high risk veteran in a community hospital, despite everything the VA says about following up with high risk veterans,"" she said. ""The VA says that we should engage them, keep them involved in care and provide proper mental health treatment.""

In a statement, the VA Maryland Health Care System said the notice of proposed termination was not related to her scheduled testimony on Tuesday.

""Dr. Aghevli will have an opportunity to respond to the proposed action, and a regional VA leader will decide whether to uphold it or mitigate it after ensuring all procedural protections in the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act have been met,"" it said in a statement, adding ""identifying as a whistleblower doesn’t shield someone from accountability when they have failed to uphold VA’s values and committed clear instances of misconduct.""

Another VA whistleblower who testified Tuesday, Katherine Mitchell a physician and consultant for the VA in Arizona, said she has faced continued retaliation even after the concerns she raised were addressed. She was one of the first people to raise concerns in 2014 about officials manipulating wait lists and jeopardizing care for veterans in Arizona.

She said she's seen a lot of improvement in patient care at the VA but that there's still a culture where some agency leaders make it difficult for people concerned about behavior that could be dangerous for patients to come forward.

""This has nothing to do with who’s in office. Things got worse two years ago because the media's attention turned off whistleblowers and turned on to politics and other things,"" she said Tuesday.

""It has nothing to do with who's in the president's office or who controls Congress. This is a malignant leadership culture that will outlast us all unless someone has the courage to break rank in leadership and finally change it."""
White House protocol chief suspended amid State Department investigation ahead of G-20,https://www.cnn.com,['Michelle Kosinski'],06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/26/politics/state-department-protocol-chief-suspended/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump's protocol chief, Sean Lawler, has been suspended indefinitely just ahead of the G-20 meeting in Japan pending the outcome of a State Department investigation into his conduct, according to multiple State Department officials with direct knowledge of the matter.

Two State officials told CNN that Lawler was called into the office of the deputy secretary on Monday afternoon and told he needed to leave due to the status of the investigation.

On the same afternoon, senior staff in the protocol office met with State Department management and were told that Lawler had to leave over personnel issues, according to the officials.

They were also told in this meeting that their new acting chief of protocol is Mary-Kate Fisher, and her acting deputy is Cathy Fenton, who served as social secretary in the George W. Bush White House and also handled social affairs‎ for Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush. State Department sources said both are highly respected.

One of the State Department officials described what multiple others told CNN was a pattern of behavior on Lawler's part. ""In my decade of government service, I have never seen someone so unprofessional, abrasive and rude as him,"" the official said. ""His bad behavior was terrible, and it was obvious. I personally saw it myself, as did a good chunk of the office.

Attorney General William Barr wows Justice Dept crowd with bagpipe playing,https://www.cbsnews.com,"['Emily Tillett', 'Emily Tillett Is A Politics Reporter', 'Video Editor For Cbs News Digital']",,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stoic-attorney-general-william-barr-wows-doj-crowd-with-bagpipe-playing/,"Attorney General William Barr took a break from his day job to showcase one of his hidden talents during an event with U.S. attorneys. Seated on stage Wednesday during the Justice Department event, the nation's top law enforcement official disappeared behind a curtain as a group of Pipes and Drums bagpipers from the New York Police Department, the Emerald Society, assembled in front of the auditorium stage.

Barr re-emerged onstage and tucked a bagpipe under his arm as the crowd of government attorneys laughed and applauded. A low drum beat sounded and the traditional bagpipe march ""Scotland the Brave"" began with Barr joining in. The crowd gave him a standing ovation at the end of the performance.

Barr explained that this was the first time he had played since his daughter's wedding. He found out that the Emerald Society pipers were coming as a surprise for him -- so he thought he would surprise them by bringing his bagpipes.

The attorney general's bagpipe playing is far from just a hobby. According to Pipes and Drums Magazine, Barr takes the bagpipe very seriously -- he's been playing since before his legal career began. Barr was a member of the now defunct U.S.-based Grade 2 Denny & Dunipace Pipe Band – which later evolved into the Scottish & Irish Imports and City of Washington – from the early-1980s until the early-1990s. Barr played with the band in a number of competitions, including the World Championships.

Soon afterward, Barr joined the Bush administration to serve his first stint as attorney general, effectively putting his competitive piping career on hold.

Barr later went on to serve as a board member of the U.S. Piping Foundation, an organization that supports competitions for bagpipers, from January 2017 to December 2018.

Mnuchin: 'We were about 90% of the way' on China trade deal and there's a 'path to complete this',https://www.cnbc.com,['Holly Ellyatt'],06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/26/mnuchin-says-us-china-trade-deal-was-90-percent-complete.html,"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC on Wednesday the U.S. and China were close to a trade deal, and he's optimistic that progress can be made during weekend talks between President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping. ""We were about 90% of the way there [with a deal] and I think there's a path to complete this,"" he told CNBC's Hadley Gamble in Manama, Bahrain. He said he's confident Trump and the Chinese president can make progress in stalled trade talks at the Group of 20 meeting. ""The message we want to hear is that they want to come back to the table and continue because I think there is a good outcome for their economy and the U.S. economy to get balanced trade and to continue to build on this relationship."" He did not provide any detail on what the final 10% of an agreement might entail, or what the sticking points are to completing a deal.

Trump is meeting his Chinese counterpart on Saturday at the G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan. The outcome of the meeting could be pivotal for the global economy and financial markets, which has been rattled by 18 months of trade tensions between the economic giants and an escalation of tariffs on each other's imports. Officials have yet to negotiate a breakthrough, but there are hopes that a meeting between the two presidents could help the discussions. A Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey of investors found that about two-thirds expect no deal this weekend, but there would be no new tariffs either. ""I'm hopeful that we can move forward with a plan,"" Mnuchin told CNBC. ""President Trump and President Xi have a very close working relationship. We had a productive meeting at the last G-20."" At their meeting in December at the G-20 in Buenos Aires, Trump and Xi reached a truce in the trade war, but talks in May broke down, and the countries added additional tariffs. Mnuchin said he was hopeful a deal could be struck by the end of the year but said ""there needs to be the right efforts in place."" Dow futures jumped after Mnuchin's comments and signaled a higher open for Wall Street Wednesday.

Slowing growth

Talks between the U.S. and China broke down in May because China reportedly did not want to commit to changes in its laws to help allay U.S. concerns about intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers and currency manipulation. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has previously played down hopes for a Trump-Xi breakthrough this weekend, saying in mid-June that ""the most that will come out of the G-20 might be an agreement to actively resume talks."" The trade war has impacted the Chinese and U.S. economies, despite both presidents insisting otherwise. In April, the International Monetary Fund lowered its global growth forecast for 2019 to 3.3%, down from an earlier forecast of 3.5%, citing ongoing global trade tensions as the rationale for the downgrade."
‘A Constant Game of Musical Chairs’ Amid Another Homeland Security Shake-Up,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Zolan Kanno-Youngs', 'Maggie Haberman']",06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/us/politics/mark-morgan-ice-cbp.html,"In an interview on Tuesday for a coming book about the president’s immigration policies, Mr. Trump acknowledged the tumult among his top immigration officials.

“I do burn out on people, I do. If somebody’s not really great, I do,” the president said during the interview in the Oval Office. He did not directly address the turnover at Customs and Border Protection, but said he had made “good changes” in the people who run his immigration agencies.

“I understand what I want,” he said. “And we’re starting to get there.”

The White House directed Kevin McAleenan, the acting secretary of homeland security, to replace Mr. Sanders with Mr. Morgan after multiple White House officials expressed displeasure that Mr. Sanders was not being aggressive enough at the southwestern border, administration officials said. Mr. McAleenan complied, hoping to diminish friction with the White House, officials said.

Mr. McAleenan resisted an earlier push by Stephen Miller, the architect behind Mr. Trump’s immigration policy, to appoint Mr. Morgan as the head of Customs and Border Protection, according to current and former homeland security officials.

In 2017, shortly after he took office, Mr. Trump forced out Mr. Morgan as Border Patrol chief. But Mr. Morgan won the approval of the White House after backing the president’s aggressive policies on television. In one appearance on Fox News, Mr. Morgan said that when he looked into the eyes of detained migrant children, he saw a “soon-to-be MS-13 gang member.”

In a letter to Customs and Border Protection employees on Tuesday, Mr. Sanders confirmed his departure.

“Although I will leave it to you to determine whether I was successful,” Mr. Sanders, a former chief technology officer at the Transportation Security Administration who helped spearhead the agency’s PreCheck program, wrote, “I can unequivocally say that helping support the amazing men and women of C.B.P. has been the most fulfilling and satisfying opportunity of my career.”"
FedEx sues the Department of Commerce after incident involving misrouted Huawei packages – TechCrunch,https://techcrunch.com,[],06-24-2019,2019,6,https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/24/fedex-sues-the-department-of-commerce-after-incident-involving-misrouted-huawei-packages/,"FedEx is suing the United States Department of Commerce, claiming that it has been “essentially deputize[d]” to enforce its trade blacklist. The lawsuit comes a month after Huawei said it is reassessing its relationship with the delivery giant after several packages meant for shipment within Asia were instead diverted, or erroneously marked for delivery, to the U.S. FedEx claimed the packages (which Huawei said did not contain any technology covered by the trade ban imposed against it by the Trump administration) had been misrouted by accident.

In a statement today about the lawsuit, FedEx said that the current export ban “places an unreasonable burden on FedEx to police the millions of shipments that transit our network every day.” Filed on Monday, the lawsuit asks the U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia to stop the Department of Commerce from enforcing prohibitions in the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) against FedEx.

FedEx said in its court filing that it has “developed a sophisticated proprietary risk-based compliance system” to adhere to U.S. export laws by screening for senders or recipients on the list of entities believed to pose a national security risk. Huawei, which was not mentioned by name in either FedEx’s announcement or its complaint against the U.S. government, was added to that list last month. But FedEx says the U.S. government expects it to perform a “virtually impossible task, logistically, economically, and in many cases, legally” since it handles million of packages each day and most of them are sealed by customers before being given to the company. Therefore, the company argues that EAR violates its rights to due process under the Fifth Amendment.

China is an important growth market for FedEx, but earlier this month its future there was put in jeopardy when the Chinese government said it was under investigation for violating laws and regulations after the incident involving Huawei’s packages. Last year the company was forced to cut its 2019 earnings guidance. FedEx’s chairman and CEO Frederick Smith blamed “bad political choices” around the world, including Brexit, state-owned enterprises and China and U.S. tariffs, for hurting its business."
Justice Department sues Omarosa Manigault Newman for failing to file financial disclosure report after she was fired,https://www.cnn.com,"['David Shortell', 'Kate Sullivan']",06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/25/politics/justice-department-omarosa-financial-disclosure/index.html,"(CNN) The Justice Department is suing former White House staffer Omarosa Manigault Newman for failing to file a financial disclosure report after she was fired in late 2017.

In a civil complaint filed Tuesday in Washington federal court, Justice Department attorneys said that Newman, the former reality star and longtime associate of President Donald Trump, had been told about the form before she left her position, and ignored multiple email requests for it in the weeks after her departure.

Newman declined to comment about the lawsuit, according to her attorney, John Phillips.

In a statement, Phillips said the White House had chosen ""to abuse process and use the Department of Justice to carry out retaliation.""

""The lawsuit alleges that Omarosa Manigault Newman 'knowingly and willfully' failed to file a report. This is untrue,"" he said in a statement.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

The Treasury Department will conduct an investigation into the circumstances leading to a delay in the production of a new $20 bill featuring a portrait of slave-turned-slave-emancipator Harriet Tubman.

In a letter to Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., released Monday, acting Inspector General Rich Delmar explained the inquiry will be folded into a larger examination of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing's project management processes for new note design that was already in the works.

""As part of this work, we will interview the stakeholders involved in the new note design process,"" Delmar wrote.

In 2016, the Treasury Department announced it would replace former President Andrew Jackson's face with that of the famed abolitionist by 2020. As NPR reported, the update would have made Tubman the first woman since Martha Washington to appear on an American currency note and the first African American. But last month, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced the redesign will be delayed until 2028.

Schumer called on the department to launch an investigation last week, specifically asking for a review of ""the involvement of other participants in the interagency process related to the redesign — including the Secret Service, Federal Reserve, and the White House — to ensure that political considerations have not been allowed to infect the process for designing American currency.""

Delmar noted the review will seek interviews with officials, including senior executives from Treasury, BEP, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), United States Secret Service and the Board's Currency Technology Office.

He added it will take approximately 10 months.

""If, in the course of our audit work, we discover indications of the employee misconduct or other matters that warrant a referral to our Office of Investigations, we will do so expeditiously,"" Delmar said.

Before he was elected, President Trump was critical of a redesign that would eliminate Jackson's image, saying the move was motivated by ""pure political correctness.""

Jackson ""represented somebody that really was very important to this country,"" Trump said in a Today show interview. He suggested it would be ""more appropriate"" to put Tubman's image on a note of different denomination."
"Acting ICE director: Detailed leak about planned raids was 'egregious,' put agents' lives at risk",https://www.foxnews.com,"['David Montanaro', 'David Montanaro Is An Editor With Fox News.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/acting-ice-director-mark-morgan-leak-raids-egregious,"Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director Mark Morgan said Tuesday that the detailed leak about planned ICE raids last week was ""egregious"" and placed agents' lives ""at risk.""

Morgan was asked on ""Fox & Friends"" about a report that Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan leaked the plans and ordered him to call off an operation that was expected to target 2,000 families living illegally in up to 10 cities across the country.

President Trump, however, ordered that Morgan continue as planned -- until he abruptly announced Saturday he was delaying the raids to see if Congress could work out a solution to the ""Asylum and Loophole problems at the Southern Border.""

Morgan declined to address the alleged stand-down order from McAleenan, saying it would not be ""appropriate"" for him to talk about ""privileged"" discussions with McAleenan or the White House.

TRUMP DOUBLES DOWN ON EXPECTED ICE RAID AMID PUSHBACK FROM LOCAL DEM POLITICIANS

""Detailed information about the operation was leaked and that's egregious. The operation was compromised and when that happens, the lives of agents and officers are absolutely put at risk,"" said Morgan.

The source told Fox News that Homeland Security officials had been planning the raids since April — prior to former acting ICE director Ron Vitiello’s departure from the administration amid a DHS staffing shake-up — and that McAleenan had been opposed to the plans from the start.

“He is the one that wanted to make sure this operation did not go forward,” the source told Fox News. “He has been fighting this operation since its inception.”

McAleenan's office vehemently denied the accusation, saying through a spokesperson to ""Fox & Friends"" that McAleenan has never leaked anything in his 18-year career.

""That's exactly what I've heard ... that the acting secretary has denied that the leaks came from him,"" said Morgan.

The plaintiffs, represented by Harvard Law School's Project on Predatory Student Lending and Housing & Economic Rights Advocates, accuse the Department of Education under DeVos of failing to implement an Obama-era regulation known as ""borrower defense, "" which allows students to have their federal student loans cancelled if their school misled them or engaged in other misconduct.

""The law is clear: Students who experienced fraud should not be required to pay back federal loans that should never have been made by the Department in the first place,"" said Toby Merrill, director of Harvard Law School's Project on Predatory Student Lending.

Around 160,000 people have filed claims with the government that their school defrauded them, and new applications continue to pour in. Almost all of these complaints concern for-profit schools, of which there are some 7,000 around the country and which take in around 15% of government financial aid.

However, student loan borrowers have found themselves waiting without answers. The Department of Education hasn't approved or denied a borrower defense claim since June 2018.

The civil complaint alleges that the former “Apprentice” star “knowingly and willfully” failed to “file the required public financial disclosure report after her employment terminated with the Executive Office of the President.”

The suit claims that Manigault Newman was given a “post-government employment briefing” in December 2017, after her firing, in which “she was advised of her obligation … to file a termination financial disclosure report” within 30 days as part of the Ethics in Government Act.

Manigault Newman, who served as director of communications for the office of public liaison during her government tenure, allegedly ignored multiple email requests from the Justice Department, as well as the White House Counsel’s Office, reminding her to complete and return the requested documents.

A White House attorney had emailed the controversial reality star after the 30-day deadline had passed to warn that she might face a $200 late filing fee, but she continued to not respond to repeated efforts to get in touch with her.

After her ouster, media reports began circulating that Manigault Newman had been physically dragged out of the White House after her contentious termination.

She denies those allegations, but that didn’t keep her from becoming a Trump target on social media.

A former senior Commerce Department official refused to answer more than 100 questions during an interview with the House Oversight and Reform Committee that centered on the Trump administration’s controversial decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, according to a transcript released Tuesday.

Commerce Department lawyers instructed James Uthmeier, who served as senior adviser and counsel to Secretary Wilbur Ross, not to answer the committee’s questions about his contacts with the White House and his conversations with Ross.

Uthmeier was also directed not to discuss the contents of a memo he wrote to a senior Justice Department official, John Gore, that purportedly outlines legal arguments surrounding the addition of a citizenship question to the census. On several occasions, Uthmeier was also blocked from disclosing details about his own conversations with Gore.

The Trump administration has sought to block several witnesses from cooperating with House Democrats’ investigations, including the Oversight Committee’s investigation of the census and the Judiciary Committee’s investigation into whether President Donald Trump obstructed justice. In both cases, the Trump administration has asserted that current and former officials are immune from testifying about their conversations with the president and their tenure in the administration.

Earlier this month, the Oversight Committee voted to hold Ross and Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over subpoenaed documents about the citizenship question and the Justice and Commerce departments’ coordination in creating it. The vote came after Trump asserted executive privilege over all of the documents.

Late Monday night, the committee officially filed its contempt report.

Uthmeier, who worked at a law firm that counted Trump’s presidential campaign as a client, told the committee during his June 11 interview that he “spoke with White House personnel” about the citizenship question, but Commerce Department lawyers blocked him from stating the names of those White House officials. Uthmeier also acquiesced to the department’s demands that he refuse to answer questions about his conversations with Ross.

But Uthmeier did tell the committee that both Ross and Earl Comstock, Ross’ policy chief, asked him to look into the legal arguments about a citizenship question in early 2017. Commerce Department lawyers objected to every follow-up question seeking more details about those conversations, but Democrats said Uthmeier’s response showed that Ross lied to Congress about the true origins of the citizenship question when he said it was added to the census “solely” at the request of the Justice Department.

Uthmeier delivered his memo analyzing those legal questions to Gore, who then formally asked the Commerce Department to add a citizenship question.

Administration officials have said that the citizenship question was added to the 2020 census in order to better enforce the Voting Rights Act, but Democrats have been skeptical of that claim. Uthmeier did not answer a question about whether the memo he wrote for Gore discusses the Voting Rights Act.

When asked why he wrote the memo, Uthmeier said: “In my research, the Voting Rights Act came up, and I am not very familiar with the Voting Rights Act and all of its nuances, and thus, I was hoping John [Gore] would provide legal advice that dealt with the memo and the topics that I was investigating.” Uthmeier did not answer follow-up questions.

Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the chairman of the committee, said in a statement: “Official after official appearing before the committee have refused to answer questions about the real reasons behind their effort, but the mounting evidence points to a partisan and discriminatory effort to harm the interests of Democrats and non-whites. The census is the foundation of our democracy, and our committee will continue doing everything in its power to ensure that it counts every single person in the United States.”

The committee has made the census probe — and the reasons a citizenship question was added — a central focus in its various investigations, which are also targeting Trump’s personal finances and the White House security clearance process.

Democrats say they’ve uncovered evidence supporting their claim that the Trump administration added the citizenship question in order to boost Republicans in future elections. Excluding noncitizens from the official census count, they say, would lead to redrawn congressional districts that favor Republicans.

Their investigation has revealed that administration officials spoke with immigration hard-liners known for their views on the citizenship question, including former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, now-deceased GOP operative Thomas Hofeller, and John Baker, a law professor.

The White House blocked Kobach from answering the committee’s questions about his conversations with Trump and other senior officials, arguing that they are privileged. Hofeller opined frequently about how Republicans would benefit from a citizenship question. And Uthmeier told the committee that Baker, who espoused similar views, was a “long-time mentor.”"
New EPA rule could expand number of Trump officials weighing in on FOIA requests,https://thehill.com,[],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/450169-new-epa-rule-would-allow-more-administration-officials-to-weigh-in-on-foia-requests,"More political appointees at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) could soon have the authority to weigh in on public information requests.

The rule is expected to be published in the Federal Register as early as Wednesday and will not allow for a public comment period.

ADVERTISEMENT

According to the new language in the FOIA rule signed by EPA chief Andrew Wheeler last week, the administrator and other officials would be allowed to review all materials that fit a FOIA request criteria, known as responsive documents, and then decide “whether to release or withhold a record or a portion of a record on the basis of responsiveness or under one or more exemptions under the FOIA, and to issue ‘no records’ responses.”

Lawyers outside the agency who specialize in FOIA requests say the “no records” response could lead to a situation where records seekers are being told there are no documents meeting their search criteria, even if they were found by EPA staffers who handle FOIA requests, with those documents ultimately withheld by political appointees.

“It’s allowing political appointees to make the decision that records someone has presumably identified as being responsive are not actually responsive. That theoretically would allow sensitive documents, that the agency doesn't want to send you, to withhold those records -- and that should shake out eventually in a lawsuit if that's what's happening,” said Matt Topic, government transparency and First Amendment lawyer at Loevy & Loevy, a Chicago-based firm that specializes in civil rights.

EPA strongly disputed that interpretation, saying the new rule does not grant appointees the ability to label responsive documents as non-responsive.

“The new regulation does not grant any additional authorities to 'reject' FOIA requests by claiming 'no records.' A response that yields 'no records' is simply a request in which a search has been conducted and no responsive records are found, it is a frequent determination that has existed since the passage of the FOIA, and has been available to any official authorized to issue FOIA determinations. This new regulation brings EPA into compliance with the law, which the Obama administration ignored,” said Michael Abboud, EPA spokesman.

Topic, who reviewed the text of the rule, said it’s common for FOIA officers at government agencies to initially find responsive documents to requests that other officials later dispute in terms of qualifying for public release.

He said the new language in the EPA rule suggests officials may have the opportunity to prevent release of the documents on the basis that they don’t meet the criteria, and are therefore non-responsive.

“You could have a situation where there is a pile of documents that the FOIA officer thinks is responsive and have a political appointee overrule them and say, 'I don’t think those documents are responsive because that’s not exactly what that person was looking for,’” he said. “There's a lot of opportunity to screw around with that.""

EPA officials who would be authorized to make that decision include the administrator, deputy administrators, assistant administrators, deputy assistant administrators, regional administrators, deputy regional administrators, general counsel, deputy general counsels, regional counsels, deputy regional counsels and the inspector general or delegates of those individuals, according to the final rule.

The latest version differs from the previous rule, which granted the same rights to the “head of an office, or that individual's designee.”

A blanket explanation for non-responsive materials could make it harder for groups or individuals to legally challenge any of EPA’s decisions to withhold documents, because it will be more difficult to prove why they were withheld. A person appealing their FOIA response would not know if any documents were withheld under a “no records” response.

“It’s exceptionally difficult to litigate on the ‘basis of responsiveness.’ There is no record,” said Kevin Bell, staff counsel at Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility. “FOIA litigation is always pretty one-sided, there is no discovery … now they are just saying, ‘Oh, it’s not responsive. Oh, we don’t have to tell you.’”

Bell equated EPA’s new FOIA rule to a similar regulatory action unveiled earlier this year at the Interior Department, called an “awareness review,” which allows political appointees 72 hours to review documents that mention them by name prior to release.

“It seems like EPA is doing about the same thing,” he said. “On the ‘basis of responsiveness’ and ‘no records responses’ are both things that we've seen in the environmental FOIA community time and again.""

EPA officials characterized the rule change as a much-needed update to regulations as stipulated by 2007, 2009 and 2016 congressional updates to FOIA processing. The Obama administration failed to change its FOIA regulations as charged by Congress, and the new rule brings EPA into compliance.

“The changes in today’s rule bring EPA’s regulations into compliance with non-discretionary provisions of the amended statute and reflect changes in the agency’s organization, procedure, or practice,” said a senior career EPA official who helped devise the regulation.

Critics argue the new rule specifically bestows more powers on political appointees to weigh in on specific FOIA cases.

“This new notice turns that upside down by substituting a wide array of political appointees for the career officials that heretofore have responded to FOIA requests for records in the possession of their offices,” said John Walke, senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

“The rule changes, for the first time, place an army of EPA political appointees as the gatekeepers for determining whether Americans receive responsive government records in response to FOIA requests.”

The EPA official said the change to the “final determinations” authority in EPA’s new rule largely combines two previous FOIA rules and is not a significant change.

“This provision is not intended to be broader than the old regulations, which covered the subject in several provisions,” the official said.

“The old regulations state that ‘the head of an office, or that individual’s designee, is authorized to grant or deny any request for a record of that office or other agency records when appropriate.’ All positions listed in the updated regulations fall within the ordinary meaning of ‘the head of an office, or that individual’s designee,’” the official added.

While the EPA administrator and other political appointees have had the ability to grant or deny FOIA requests, doing so under the “basis of responsiveness” and “no response” option is a new addition in the forthcoming rule.

Other major changes in the rule include a decision to no longer allow EPA regional offices to handle initial FOIA requests. All requests instead must first be sent to the agency’s National FOIA Office, which will then delegate the requests to the proper office.

Any requests sent first to regional offices by members of the press, the public or any organizations will not be redirected and won’t be considered received.

“EPA expects to improve the efficiency and consistency of its intake and assignment processing, including more consistent and earlier outreach to requesters, through centralizing these functions into one office at the Agency,” according to a statement provided by EPA on the rule change.

The agency official described the change as a way to align regional office FOIA responses with the national office.

“We took a look across the agency and saw there were different practices as to how they reached out to requesters in the first instance after a request has come in. We saw an opportunity to create greater uniformity. One of the practices we’ll be adopting as this goes into effect is reaching out consistently to FOIA requesters with an initial letter,” the official said.

Bell warned that the new order could allow EPA political appointees to better control the documents ultimately released by regional offices. He said regional offices often have less political pressure to withhold more responsive materials.

“This is just making sure that every FOIA request that gets reviewed gets taken down the hall or next door to Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerTop EPA official stepping down amid ethics probe Trump pick brings scrutiny to 'revolving door' between Pentagon, industry Overnight Energy: New EPA rule could expand officials weighing in on FOIA requests | Trump plan to strip conservation fund gets bipartisan pushback | Agriculture chief downplays climate concerns MORE's office,” Bell said. “Basically, anytime a FOIA request goes up to the administration you can extend however long it will take and reduce what you get back.”

The EPA official said the changes would neither speed up nor slow down the FOIA process. Under President Trump Donald John Trump2020 Democrats spar over socialism ahead of first debate Senate passes .5 billion border bill, setting up fight with House 'Teflon Don' avoids the scorn of the 'family values' GOP — again MORE, the agency has experienced a huge uptick in FOIA requests and major backlog in processing, which has been exacerbated in some instances by a lack of funding to hire new staff to help with those requests.

“I don’t think this will change the speed or response at all. We’re trying to be consistent with outreach to requesters and not anticipating this will slow down our response,” the senior official said. “Our aspiration is to come into compliance with the statue, in the most straight and most direct way possible, without coming into any discretionary changes with the statue.”

The EPA has come under criticism for its handling of FOIA requests under Trump’s presidency. Last fall, agency heads clashed with top Democratic lawmakers over an admittance by then acting EPA Administrator Wheeler’s chief of staff to investigators with the House Oversight and Reform Committee that certain FOIA requests were put under more intense scrutiny because they were “politically charged.”

Rep. Elijah Cummings Elijah Eugene CummingsCummings on Conway Hatch Act violations: 'This is about right and wrong' House panel votes to subpoena Kellyanne Conway over Hatch Act testimony TSA to send hundreds of workers to southern border to enforce immigration policies MORE (Md.), who at the time was the panel’s top Democrat and is now chairman, accused the EPA of impeding requests.

Hard-liners inside and outside the Trump administration are pressing for the removal of President Donald Trump’s acting Homeland Security secretary amid a rolling leadership purge that began in April and shows no signs of ending, according to five people in the Trump administration and four former Department of Homeland Security officials.

Kevin McAleenan, who took over the post less than three months ago, is under heavy criticism from prominent Trump allies, including former Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Thomas Homan, who might become the administration’s immigration czar.

Story Continued Below

Following the purge of three other immigration officials since the April resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, McAleenan stands accused of disloyalty to the Trump White House’s hard line on immigration because of a perception that he didn’t support ICE raids targeting migrant families scheduled to begin last weekend.

Like three other officials purged from immigration agencies since the April resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, McAleenan stands accused of disloyalty to the Trump White House’s hard line on immigration because of a perception that he didn’t support ICE raids targeting migrant families scheduled to begin last weekend.

Acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner John Sanders, a McAleenan ally, said Monday that he’ll resign effective July 5. Sanders did not offer a public explanation for his resignation.

Several critics of the administration, including former DHS officials, have characterized the latest shakeup as another instance of White House senior adviser Stephen Miller seizing an opportunity to fill key immigration posts with allies. But one senior administration official said the president also agrees with these stances.

“The two issues the president is driving the train on at all times are trade and immigration,” the official said. “There is disbelief inside the administration that we can’t enforce the law and people are trying to find the right personnel who will do it and not look for ways out of it.”

Miller and DHS did not respond to requests for comment. The White House press office also did not immediately respond to a request for comment on McAleenan.

The turmoil mirrors a chaotic situation along the southern border, where thousands of migrants are arriving each day and detained children are being denied basic necessities like toothbrushes and soap. Current and former DHS employees complain that the leadership turnover and attendant jostling for power have slowed the government’s ability to respond to what is now widely recognized to be a crisis.

“It’s awful for morale,” said one current CBP official. “Whoever’s going to be confirmed to acting [commissioner] next, we’re back to square one, getting a new person briefed. … It’s like starting all over in a transition.”

Homan suggested on “Fox & Friends” that this week’s planned ICE raids were delayed because McAleenan leaked information about them.

“You’ve got the acting secretary of Homeland Security resisting what ICE is trying to do,” Homan said. “In The Washington Post or in numerous media outlets, he does not support this operation, and I tell you what, if that’s his position, then he’s on the wrong side of this issue. You don’t tell the men and women of ICE, a day before they go out there and do this operation — ‘Look, this story was leaked.’ They gave the locations of the cities, the day it was supposed to start, how many targets.”

Homan spoke while sitting in front of a DHS seal, looking like a government official — something he has not been since June 2018. The seal was in a room set up in the basement of his Virginia home, according to two former DHS officials. Trump told Fox News on June 14 that Homan would be his new “border czar,” but Homan said a day later that the announcement was “kind of premature” and indicated that he hadn’t yet decided whether to take the job. An administration official said Wednesday that Homan has not yet been given a clear description of what the job would entail.

“Homan’s getting paid a lot better as border czar of Fox News than border czar of the White House,” said Ali Noorani, executive director of the pro-migrant National Immigration Forum. “And he kind of has the same job, to go on Fox News and carry the administration’s message.”

Several administration officials and hard-line immigration advocates have targeted McAleenan in recent days, arguing behind the scenes that he’s too liberal to run DHS because he served under President Barack Obama and has donated money in the past to Democratic candidates and organizations. Conservative media outlets, including the Washington Examiner, have run critical stories to amplify that narrative.

Brandon Judd, president of a union that represents Border Patrol agents and a Trump ally, also torched McAleenan in a Fox News op-ed over the weekend.

Judd — who has attacked McAleenan in the past for being insufficiently committed to Trump — said that if McAleenan did leak information about the raids, then he “was inexcusably willing to put the public at risk and law enforcement officers in harm’s way in order to further his own agenda.”

“There is no question that the president is sensitive to the lack of progress in resolving this crisis at the border and frustrated with the pace of changes, and it has become increasingly evident that one of the main reasons for the lack of progress is because Kevin McAleenan has been reluctant to take action that would more effective,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the restrictionist Center for Immigration Studies. “A lot of ideas proposed have been bottled up by him and his front office.”

The Trump White House assumed McAleenan could work with Democrats on Capitol Hill to secure more funding and policy changes, since he’s worked under both Republican and Democratic administrations, Vaughan said. But “he has not been able to deliver on those things.”

Within the past month Trump installed a pair of vocal immigration hard-liners in key immigration positions, naming Mark Morgan acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Ken Cuccinelli acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Both had drawn the president’s attention by making provocative statements about immigration on Fox News; Morgan, for instance, said he could tell whether a migrant child would later join MS-13 merely by looking into that child’s eyes.

Morgan appears already on the move. POLITICO and other outlets reported Tuesday that he’s expected to be named the new acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, although the White House has not made an official announcement.

Cuccinelli, meanwhile, scored a coveted perk during his first month that his predecessor, Francis Cissna, never enjoyed. Trump designated him to be one of 10 officials to get a government-funded car to drive him from his Virginia home to USCIS headquarters.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201906/3778/1155968404_6044370239001_6044253724001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404""

A USCIS spokesperson confirmed that Cuccinelli had been granted the benefit, but said that he “is currently driving himself to the office.”

Both newly installed officials occupy new “principal deputy director” positions created at their respective agencies to allow them to serve in an acting capacity under the 1998 Federal Vacancies Reform Act — a bureaucratic sleight-of-hand that could circumvent the confirmation process.

Cuccinelli, a former Virginia attorney general and head of a conservative political action committee, would face a hard road to confirmation in the Senate because he backed challenges to mainstream Republicans in recent years, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Morgan would at the least face strong Democratic opposition.

“I think the White House is looking for a certain model,” said one current administration official. “Cuccinelli and Morgan have been on Fox every day. I don’t think you’ll ever see Sanders up there.”

The latest personnel shake-up happened just days after the administration caught flak for its treatment of roughly 300 migrant children at a Texas facility who were filthy, hungry, and largely unsupervised, according to lawyers who interviewed some of them.

Several conservative immigration advocates said the DHS shake-up was unrelated to the ensuing public outcry, and instead had been brewing for weeks. Moving Morgan to CBP sets the stage for the administration to now get rid of McAleenan, one advocate said.

“Things have not changed at DHS since Nielsen left,” said a top official at a restrictionist immigration organization. “I disagreed with them getting rid of Francis Cissna but right now, they are looking in the right place.”

But “having all of this churn and not having stable leadership makes it very difficult to address the problems,” said Leon Fresco, former deputy assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's Office of Immigration Litigation. “Whenever you change a leader, you automatically lose a month as the person gets acclimated.”

USDA approves $4.85 million loan for Dorr-Leighton wastewater expansion,https://www.mlive.com,"['Michael Kransz', 'Mkransz Mlive.Com']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/2019/06/usda-approves-485-million-loan-for-dorr-leighton-wastewater-expansion.html,"DORR, MI -- The United States Department of Agriculture has approved a $4.85 million loan to help double the size of the Dorr-Leighton Wastewater Treatment Plant.

Though approved, treatment plant officials say they have to complete a number of further steps before the loan is finalized.

The expansion of the wastewater treatment plant serving Dorr and Leighton townships is needed because the plant is nearing capacity amid continued growth, according to Jeff Miling, Dorr Township supervisor and co-chair of the wastewater authority board.

Wastewater officials say the plant serves about 500 customers, which includes homes, businesses and multi-residence properties, such as an apartment complex and trailer park.

The USDA, in a press release Wednesday, June 26, said the plant upgrades are needed to meet Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy regulations.

Miling said he’s unaware of any regulatory violations and that USDA is likely referring to the plant being near the capacity at which EGLE officials require an expansion.

“We were getting close to 80 percent of capacity of our plant,” he said.

The expansion project will cost an estimated $5 million, Miling said. Wastewater officials say that if the loan comes through, bidding on the project could happen later this year.

The approved loan for the Dorr-Leighton plant is one of five announced Wednesday.

“This announcement includes more than $13 million in critical infrastructure assistance across the Lower Peninsula to ensure clean water and safe sewer systems in rural areas,” said USDA Rural Development State Director for Michigan Jason Allen."

Attorney Sarah Fabian went viral last week when she appeared to argue in defense of the Trump administration's operation of facilities that require migrants including children to sleep on concrete floors with just an aluminum foil blanket as covering. NBC News reported Tuesday that Fabian wrote on Facebook that she was sorry that her comments “struck a nerve.""

“I think that many many people believe I was in court Tuesday arguing against providing certain hygiene items to kids,” Fabian reportedly wrote in a private Facebook post shared to NBC News by her friends.

“I do not believe that’s the position I was representing,"" she reportedly added later.

“I will say that I personally believe that we should do our very best to care for kids while they are in our custody, and I try to always represent that value in my work,” she added in the post. “A vast majority of the work that I do is not public, but I strive to help people by my participation in the process.”

Fabian's court appearance was part of the Trump administration's legal effort to overturn a lower court's decision in 2017 that found that a group of migrant children were forced to sleep in conditions not considered ""safe and sanitary"" under the Flores Settlement, a 1997 court settlement that lays out the guidelines for treatment of migrants in the care of the U.S. government.

The Trump administration has argued that the the 2017 decision, which found that children were given inadequate food and dirty water while being cared for by U.S. officials, imposed “new substantive requirements” not laid out by the 1997 Flores settlement."

“Given the life-and-death stakes of the current situation between the United States and Iran, we can think of no issue where it is more imperative for the department to explain its rationale for, interpretation of, and limits upon the legal authorities that have been provided by the Congress, a co-equal branch of government that the Constitution vests with the sole power to declare war,” wrote Engel and Deutch, who is the chairman of the committee’s Middle East subcommittee.

The pair requested documents by 9 a.m. Friday, adding that if the department doesn’t meet that deadline, “we will be forced to consider other measures to obtain them.”

The letter comes as U.S.-Iran tensions have escalated. On Tuesday, President Trump Donald John Trump2020 Democrats spar over socialism ahead of first debate Senate passes .5 billion border bill, setting up fight with House 'Teflon Don' avoids the scorn of the 'family values' GOP — again MORE threatened that an Iranian attack on “anything” American would be met with “great and overwhelming force.”

Trump’s Tuesday threat stood in contradiction to his decision last week that a U.S. military strike with an estimated 150-person death toll was not a proportional response to Iran shooting down a U.S. drone.

Trump also told Hill.TV on Monday he does not believe he needs congressional authorization to strike Iran.

Publicly and, lawmakers say, privately, administration officials have asserted a link between Iran and al Qaeda. Democrats fear the Trump administration is building a case to use the 2001 authorization for the use of military force (AUMF) for military action against Iran.

The 2001 AUMF was passed in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to authorize military action against al Qaeda and other perpetrators of the attacks. An AUMF was also passed in 2002 to authorize the Iraq War.

Amid the Iran tensions, Democrats and some Republicans are scrambling to constrain Trump’s ability to launch a military strike.

In the Senate, Democrats are demanding a vote on an amendment to the annual defense policy bill that would block funding for military action against Iran without congressional authorization.

“We hereby submit that request,” Engel and Deutch wrote Wednesday. “We will be abundantly clear: as several members stated during the June 20 hearing, Congress has not authorized the President to attack Iran under any legal theory, including under the 2001 or 2002 AUMF.”"
10-year Treasury yield falls below 2% after weak consumer confidence data,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/25/us-treasury-yields-lower-ahead-of-powells-speech.html,"The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell below 2% on Tuesday as investors looked for safety following the release of much weaker-than-expected confidence data.

Short-term rates rose off their lows, however, following comments from St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard and Chairman Jerome Powell.

The yield traded at 1.994% as of 3:33 p.m. ET. The 2-year rate held steady at 1.736% while the 30-year bond yield declined to 2.52%.

Bullard said Tuesday he doesn't believe the U.S. central bank needs to lower borrowing costs by 50 basis points at its next meeting despite his push to cut rates last week.

""Just sitting here today, I think 50 basis points would be overdone,"" Bullard told Bloomberg News. ""I don't think the situation really calls for that, but I would be willing to go 25 (basis points).""

In a speech in New York, Powell reiterated that inflation — or how much prices rise throughout the economy — continues to run below the central bank's 2% objective.

""The crosscurrents have reemerged, with apparent progress on trade turning to greater uncertainty and with incoming data raising renewed concerns about the strength of the global economy. Our contacts in business and agriculture report heightened concerns over trade developments,"" he said at the Council on Foreign Relations.

The central bank leader also said in prepared remarks that the Fed ""is insulated from short-term political pressures — what is often referred to as our 'independence.'""

""Congress chose to insulate the Fed this way because it had seen the damage that often arises when policy bends to short-term political interests. Central banks in major democracies around the world have similar independence,"" he added.

Those comments may allude to President Donald Trump's recent attacks on the Fed and its monetary policies, which he believes are preventing stronger economic growth and keeping a lid on the stock market. Trump has also said the central bank's interest rate strategy undermines the administration's negotiating position in trade deliberations with China.

The Conference Board's consumer confidence index fell to 121.5 in June, reaching its lowest level since September 2017. Conference Board senior director Lynn Franco said escalating trade fears appear to have ""shaken consumers' confidence.""

""Those survey readings of higher consumer confidence were just a lot of hot air as it turns out,"" Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG, said in a note. ""If the Fed had had this almost ten point drop in the confidence number last week it may well have tipped the scale and led them to cut interest rates."""

Under a proposed new system, plant owners would be allowed to run pork plant slaughter lines as fast as they want. (Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News)

The Office of Inspector General is evaluating whether the U.S. Department of Agriculture concealed information and used flawed data to develop and promote a new hog inspection system that would shift many food-safety tasks from federal inspectors to pork industry employees.

The USDA’s inspector general, Phyllis Fong, notified 16 members of Congress on Friday that her office has launched the probe in response to concerns the lawmakers raised in March, according to a letter obtained by The Washington Post.

Under the proposed new system, plant owners would be allowed to run pork plant slaughter lines as fast as they want, a provision that has worker safety advocates concerned that worker injury rates would rise. The USDA said in a proposed rule — which if finalized would create the new system — that its data shows worker injury rates probably would be lower than those at traditional plants where limits are placed on line speeds.

Sen. Richard J. Durbin (Ill.), the second-highest-ranking Senate Democrat, and more than a dozen other Democrats sought the inspector general’s probe after two university experts reviewed the USDA’s data and analysis and concluded “it is impossible” for the department to “draw any statistically valid conclusion about worker injury rate differences.”

The data was not released until months after the 60-day public comment period for the rule had closed in April 2018 and only after Freedom of Information Act requests were filed by a Texas State University researcher and a worker safety advocacy group, the National Employment Law Project.



Durbin, who says he worked in a slaughterhouse for a year as a college student, said Monday he is glad the inspector general is heeding his request, adding that line speeds are “directly linked to worker safety.”

“Bowing to the meatpacking industry, the USDA relied on sketchy data to justify a major inspections change that could create unsafe working environments at pork processing plants in America,” Durbin said in a prepared statement for The Post. “I am concerned that the USDA also tried to hide this data from the public.”

[Pork industry soon will have more power over meat inspections]

Debbie Berkowitz, a worker-safety expert with the law project, asked USDA officials to extend the public comment period to allow others to examine and remark on USDA’s data and its worker safety analysis, records show. No extension was granted.

A Post analysis of the public comments showed that out of 84,000 public remarks made on the rule, 87 percent were either opposed or expressed negative opinions about the proposal. In numerous instances, groups asked for additional information to properly evaluate the proposal.

“The bottom line here is USDA is rushing this rule through and really abandoning any effort to be transparent,” Berkowitz said in an interview.

USDA declined to comment on the Inspector General probe. In earlier statements, it has said the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, not USDA, has the “statutory and regulatory authority to promote workplace safety and health.”

Berkowitz, who was OSHA chief of staff during the Obama administration, said the USDA does not “police companies about worker safety.” However, she said, “They should not be in the business of giving a green light to something that could cause further injury to workers.”

Illness rates for people who work in the meatpacking plants — including carpal tunnel syndrome and tendinitis — are 16 times higher than the average for all other industries, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The proposed hog-slaughter rule is based on a study that began 20 years ago, ultimately including five large plants. Efforts to expand the program have sputtered under past administrations, but Trump administration officials have pushed forward with the rule and hoped to finalize it this summer.

The USDA expects 40 of 612 hog plants will use the new system. Collectively, agriculture officials say, these plants will account for 90 percent of the pork produced in the United States.

In her letter to Durbin and other lawmakers, Fong said her office will seek to determine whether the USDA did the following: complied with federal public transparency requirements; made information about its preliminary analysis on worker safety clearly accessible to the public during the comment period; adhered to the department’s own data quality guidelines; came to a reasonable determination about the reliability of OSHA injury data; and consulted with OSHA and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health as it developed the rule.

The inquiry is expected to be complete by the end of the year, an inspector general spokeswoman said.

On Tuesday, the House of Representatives passed a 2020 appropriations bill that provides funding for USDA. However, the bill also requires that the Inspector General perform a more extensive data review before any funds are used for the new inspection system.

That requirement, proposed by Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.), would also include an examination of USDA data the department used to conclude that pork produced under the new system would be as safe as pork produced at plants using the traditional inspection system. It would also examine data USDA used to conclude the increased line speeds would not impact animal welfare. DeLauro called the proposed rule a “giveaway to large corporate meatpackers.”

In response to the inspector general’s probe, DeLauro said it is “an important first step toward ensuring the swine inspection rule changes are based on sound science by opening an investigation into the department’s use of flawed worker safety data. However, the OIG must expand their investigation to encompass all data USDA used to develop the proposed rule — as would be required by a provision I included in this year’s USDA funding bill.”

In an earlier statement, the North American Meat Institute, an industry group that supports the proposal, said: “This rule is founded on years of sound scientific data and experience. NAMI supports risk-based, science-driven food safety systems. Consumers deserve no less.”

(Lucy Nicholson/Reuters)

The Department of Justice official pictured in a viral video clip debating what specifically constitutes “sanitary conditions” under a court decision governing the detention of minors has received “several” death threats since the clip’s contents were reported by a number of news outlets last week, DOJ spokeswoman Kerri Kupec told National Review on Monday.

An edited version of Sarah Fabian’s Tuesday testimony before a panel of Ninth Circuit judges was published on Twitter by NowThis News on Friday under the headline: “A Trump official tried to argue that detained children don’t need soap, toothbrushes, or beds to be ‘safe and sanitary’ while in Border Patrol custody.”

A number of media outlets, including the The Hill and the Huffington Post, then highlighted the videos as evidence of the Trump administration’s willful mistreatment of migrants.

Fabian did not argue that children held in federal custody should not be given basic toiletries — as the viral headlines suggest — but rather suggested that the Flores Settlement agreement, a 1997 court ruling which governs the conditions under which minors can be held in federal custody, does not explicitly require the provision of those specific items.

Furthermore, Fabian’s testimony was related to a challenge of a 2017 ruling that U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, under President Obama, violated Flores by failing to provide children with basic sanitary products. The judge presiding over that case found that those items should be provided under Flores and recommended the appointment of a special monitor to ensure CBP provided the items going forward.

The treatment of migrants at CBP holding facilities has received greater scrutiny in recent weeks amid reports that CBP and the Department of Health and Human Services, which assumes custody of the migrants after they are processed by CBP, are unequipped to safely house and provide medical care for the overwhelming number of asylum-seekers arriving at the border each day.

Administration officials have asked Congress for additional funding to address what they claim has become a crisis at the southern border. They have also pleaded for legislative reforms that would grant CBP agents greater latitude to immediately deny entry to asylum seekers if their claims are clearly illegitimate. Under current law, CBP agents must admit virtually all asylum seekers pending an immigration hearing, which as many as 90 percent of them fail to appear for.

Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced last week that the Senate will vote in the coming days on a $4.5 billion aid package designed to address the government’s inability to adequately shelter the more than 100,000 asylum-seekers that have begun arriving at the southern border each month."

I have my doubts about how much the commission can accomplish, but the criticisms of it from the Left are misplaced. My latest column examines the controversy.

There are two principal complaints, as related in the New York Times and The New Republic. The Trump administration is inconsistent on human rights, giving a pass to allies such as Saudi Arabia while coming down hard on adversaries such as Iran. And the commission will try to push a narrow theocratic conception of human rights, one that scants gay rights and the right to abortion.

The first complaint is correct, but not distinctive to President Trump. No administration is or can be entirely consistent on human rights. . . . The U.S. has a lot of interests and they cannot always be simultaneously pursued. The Barack Obama administration was softer than Trump on Iran and harder on Saudi Arabia, in keeping with its own larger foreign-policy aims. (Homosexual acts are punishable by death in both countries.) If the choice before our government were to advance human rights at all times and places or not to advance them at all, then the latter course would prevail."

His LinkedIn profile lists “June 2019” as the end of his Treasury job, without providing a specific date. Bloomberg wrote last week about Phillips’ departure.

Phillips’ LinkedIn profile now says: “He supported Secretary Mnuchin in the development of policy for comprehensive housing finance reform.”

What it doesn't say: Oversaw the privatization of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

Phillips, the ultimate Wall Street insider, was seen by some as the great hope for reforming and releasing the government-sponsored enterprises, or GSEs, from government conservatorship. In a New York Times story last month saying he planned to leave, Phillips said he would return to Wall Street but didn’t have a job lined up yet. His LinkedIn profile doesn’t list a current position.

Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Mark Calabria said earlier this month that he hoped Treasury’s plan to release Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would come by the end of June. The White House is reviewing a draft of the proposal, Bloomberg reported last week, citing people familiar with the matter. The two mortgage giants guarantee more than half of the outstanding residential mortgages in the U.S., according to Federal Reserve data.

The departure of Phillips “matters” to the prospects of getting Fannie and Freddie back to anything resembling the footing they had before the housing crisis a decade ago, Jaret Seiberg, Managing Director at Cowen Group, said in a note to clients on Friday.

“Phillips was one of the few senior folks at Treasury with the clout to negotiate on GSE reform,” Seiberg wrote in the note. “While we believe he finished the Treasury white paper on GSE reform before he left, his departure means that Phillips cannot push the National Economic Council to approve the document. More broadly, Mnuchin has few other senior advisers and he devotes much of his time to trade disputes. The argument is that Mnuchin simply lacks the time and energy needed to advance a housing finance reform plan given the controversy that will surround any plan to recap and release Fannie and Freddie.”

After more than three decades at Wall Street firms, some of it spent as a mortgage trader, Phillips joined the Trump administration in 2017. He left a position as managing director at BlackRock to become Mnuchin’s top housing advisor. Prior to BlackRock, he held managing director positions at both Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, according to LinkedIn.

Last year, Phillips said in a speech at the Mortgage Bankers Association’s annual conference in Washington D.C. that the Trump administration wants to end the government takeover of Fannie and Freddie that began in July 2008 during the financial crisis.

“The administration advocates ending the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and returning them to private ownership,” Phillips said. “Their charters should be removed from statute and their operations should be overseen by the primary regulator that has the authority to approve additional guarantors to introduce competition into the secondary mortgage market.”"
Democrat Senators Come Out Against DOL ‘Joint Employer’ Rule,https://news.bloomberglaw.com,[],,,,https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/democrat-senators-come-out-against-dol-joint-employer-rule,"Six of the seven senators running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020 voiced their “strong opposition” to the Labor Department’s proposal to narrow liability for franchised businesses and companies that rely on temps and other contractors.

“The proposed interpretation would violate the language and intent of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and weaken the enforcement of wage-and-hour protections on behalf of many of the most vulnerable workers in the country, directly contradicting DOL’s mission,” Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), and several other Democratic heavyweights said in a June 25 letter to Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta.

The DOL proposed a new joint employer regulation—or interpretive rule—in April, seeking to narrow the circumstances when multiple companies can be considered “joint employers” of a group of workers. The Obama administration had looked to expand the scope of joint employer liability. The DOL said in April that its new proposal would reduce uncertainty about which businesses are responsible for workers’ employment protections and any associated liability for violating labor laws.

“As the prevalence of contracting, temporary staffing, and franchising arrangements has ballooned throughout the American economy, it is increasingly important that companies that share responsibility for workers are held liable for wage theft, child labor abuses, and other violations of federal wage-and-hour law that too often devastate the financial security of working families,” the senators wrote, noting that the 3-million temp-worker contingent across the country is “disproportionately made up of African American and Latino workers earning significantly less than other groups.

The joint employer issue is a flashpoint for franchised and gig economy companies and worker advocates. The comment period on the joint employer proposal ended June 25.

The DOL’s proposal also drew attention from a group of Democratic attorneys general and the largest business association in the franchise sector, the International Franchise Association. The IFA argues that long-accepted practices in franchising shouldn’t be considered evidence of joint liability.

“The Department of Labor has put forward a rule that can add much-needed clarity for franchise businesses,” IFA Senior Vice President of Government Relations Matt Haller said in a June 25 announcement. “An expanded joint employer standard has cost the economy billions and slowed down hiring and job growth—this rule is a major step toward righting that wrong.”

Officials from 18 states including New York, California, North Carolina, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and the District of Columbia wrote to Acosta to oppose the rulemaking.

“The experiences of many of the undersigned state Attorneys General (“State AGs”) in enforcing labor laws and protecting workers argue strongly against adopting the Proposed Rule,” the prosecutors wrote. “Based on our collective experience, we believe that the Proposed Rule does not adequately reflect today’s workplace relationships, in which growing numbers of businesses are changing organizational and staffing models by outsourcing functions to third” parties.”

The DOL regulation is considered an interpretive rule because Congress hasn’t directly authorized the agency to define joint employment. Critics have suggested the eventual policy will be subject to legal challenges.

The letter from Congress also was signed by Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio); Patty Murray (D-Wash.); Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.); Dick Durbin (D-Ill.); Ben Cardin (D-Md.); Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.); Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.); and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.)."
Why weak leadership at the Defense Department could lead us to war in Iran,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Michael J. Stricof', 'Michael J.

Michael J. Stricof is a doctoral candidate studying American history at Aix-Marseille Université.

Tensions are escalating between the United States and Iran. After Iranians shot down an American drone, President Trump weighed the option of a retaliatory strike, which he then called off because of potential casualties. Yet as bellicose rhetoric builds, the prospect of war continues to loom.

The possibility of war with Iran has sent commentators scrambling for comparisons to the second Iraq War. Destroyed ships in the Gulf of Oman also call up memories of the Gulf of Tonkin incident, which led to open American involvement in Vietnam in 1964. However, there is another historical comparison that may better capture the state of the current leadership in Washington and the risk of a different, dangerous path to war.

In December 1992, lame duck President George H.W. Bush committed U.S. troops to a U.N.-sanctioned humanitarian relief operation in Somalia. Operation Restore Hope was supposed to be a relatively simple mission: Deliver food and medical supplies to a war-torn country, but stay out of the fighting. It was the sort of operation that many were rallying behind in the immediate post-Cold War era; President-elect Bill Clinton publicly supported the move.

Ten months later, however, on Oct. 3, 1993, two Black Hawk helicopters carrying elite Delta Force soldiers, assigned to capture the Somali warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid, were shot down over Mogadishu. This incident, infamous for images of mutilated bodies dragged through the streets, ended with 13 Americans killed and one captured. A mission designed to offer peaceful aid had slid, almost unnoticed, into a Special Forces operation and ended with a firefight in the streets and an American defeat.

While in many ways a very different situation than the current tensions building around Iran, the Somalia example reveals that weak leadership at the Defense Department, which we have again today, can be catastrophic in a period of potential conflict.

How did a humanitarian assistance mission lead to a Special Operations debacle? After all, American soldiers weren’t supposed to be looking for firefights; they were supposed to be distributing food. While a considerable amount of the shifting mission had to do with changing U.N. missions, on the American side the problem was due to a lack of leadership, notably in the Defense Department itself.

When Bush committed troops, he knew he would be leaving an ongoing military operation in the hands of his successor. This meant near-immediate turnover at every level of management except for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, where Colin Powell would remain chairman until September 1993.

In addition to the usual changeover at the beginning of an administration, Clinton’s team got off to a rocky start because Defense Secretary Les Aspin was largely ineffective. He had no major management experience. While he had been chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, his collegial style did not mesh well with the tightly run Pentagon. Aspin also spent much of his first six months in office distracted by social issues, forced to handle the firestorm over Clinton’s attempt to allow gays to serve openly in the military, leading to the mixed “Don’t ask, don’t tell” policy, and addressing women in combat roles and sexual assault in the military following the 1991 Tailhook aviators conference scandal.

Aspin wasn’t the only one distracted. In the first half of 1993, no one in Washington was really paying attention. Clinton was focused on his domestic agenda, including his struggles to implement new deficit reduction measures. National security adviser Tony Lake meanwhile was preoccupied with elaborating a broader strategy of “Engagement and Enlargement,” which encouraged new post-Cold War deployments. That left the Defense Department to resist the “mission creep” that eventually led to disaster.

In traditional circumstances, this would have been fine. The Defense Department is historically conservative about the use of American military power. Institutional concerns with maintaining resources and a ready force for real threats to American security make it resistant to other missions, often leading it to push back against political or diplomatic leaders hoping to bring U.S. force to bear as a solution to less-than-existential threats.

Some of this traditional dynamic played out in the early months of the Clinton administration. Famously, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine Albright, who supported more direct U.S. involvement in Bosnia, frustratedly asked Powell, “What’s the point of having this superb military that you’re always talking about if we can’t use it?” In his memoir, Powell described his reaction: “I thought I would have an aneurysm. American GIs were not toy soldiers to be moved around on some sort of global game board.”

But in the fall of 1993, Powell was on his way out. He had finished his time as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and was preparing to retire at the end of September, just a few days before the Black Hawk incident.

Aspin meanwhile was focused on rolling out a major policy review. He would later be blamed for not approving additional backup for the Army Rangers and Delta Force before the mission to capture Aidid began. Although there is debate among historians about the importance of Aspin’s decision, it gave the Clinton administration somewhere to lay the blame.

In reality, however, as journalist David Halberstam put it, it was “the vagueness and drift in the administration’s policy” that deserved more of the blame for the Battle of Mogadishu. The lack of leadership in the Pentagon, while the president and the national security adviser focused on other things, allowed the mission to creep toward outright combat without any real debate over the potential risks.

The debacle, which outraged Americans, cost Aspin his job. The Clinton administration eventually found its footing in defense, although not before overlooking genocide in Rwanda and retreating from Haiti while the shock of defeat in Somalia wore off.

Today, circumstances are in some ways very different from 1993. It’s not the first year of the president’s term, and an experienced national security adviser, John Bolton, is in place. But there is again weak leadership at the Defense Department at a precarious moment. The well-respected secretary Jim Mattis departed in December over policy disagreements with the president. Acting secretary of defense Patrick Shanahan proved weak, uncomfortably trying to please Trump by justifying the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria, which Mattis had refused to do, prompting his resignation. Now Shanahan, too, is out, and a new acting secretary, Army Secretary Mark T. Esper, is in.

Trump has said he doesn’t want to start a war with Iran, but he has also been sending mixed messages. And the weakness at the Defense Department could prove especially significant in the bureaucratic negotiations that shape the president’s agenda.

Bolton has long been an unabashed hawk, and the fear in policymaking circles is that he will push toward war. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, another hawk on Iran, is also sounding threats. Normally, the defense secretary could be counted on to argue against committing U.S. troops. However, a Defense Department lacking leadership leaves a power vacuum that makes it possible that these other voices will win out.

Inattention in the Pentagon also can lead to poorly managed situations that may lead to unplanned, explosive moments of conflict, as the retaliatory strike Trump called off Thursday illustrated. One Gulf of Tonkin-like incident with few voices arguing for caution could very possibly lead to open war, and a poorly managed war at that. Iran is not the only concern; the administration has practiced brinkmanship with North Korea, Venezuela and, via trade policy, China. Although the 1993 Somalia case ended with American withdrawal, history is full of examples that went the other way."
"Homeland Security, other federal agencies remain vulnerable to cyberattacks, Senate panel finds",https://www.dispatch.com,"['Jessica Wehrman', 'Jessica Wehrman Dispatch Washington Bureau']",06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.dispatch.com/news/20190625/homeland-security-other-federal-agencies-remain-vulnerable-to-cyberattacks-senate-panel-finds,"The Department of Homeland Security — the very agency tasked with fighting cyberattacks — and seven other agencies have failed to address the vulnerabilities in their IT infrastructure, a Senate subcommittee chaired by Ohio Sen. Rob Portman has found.

WASHINGTON — Federal government offices are wildly vulnerable to cyberattacks, with the number of cyber incidents reported by federal agencies increasing more than 1,300 percent between 2006 and 2015.

But those being attacked are doing very little to protect themselves, according to the results of a 10-month Senate investigation of eight federal agencies.

The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, chaired by Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, found that the Department of Homeland Security — the very agency tasked with fighting cyberattacks — and seven other agencies have failed to address the vulnerabilities in their IT infrastructure, leaving them susceptible to cyberattack and Americans’ personal information vulnerable to theft.

The problems range from systems so antiquated that they can’t be updated with new security patches to agencies that year after year fail to protect the personal information of millions of Americans.

The subcommittee studied 10 years’ worth of government audits of the IT systems of the Homeland Security, State, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, Agriculture, Health and Human Services and Education departments and the Social Security Administration.

Their investigation comes after a surge in data breaches in the federal government, with agencies including the Postal Service, the IRS and the White House reporting attacks.

In 2015, for example, a hacker broke into government databases to gain access to 22 million security clearance files from the Office of Personnel Management.

In 2017 alone, federal agencies reported 35,277 cyber incidents.

Federal agencies often have access to sensitive information because of the very nature of what they do.

The Department of Education collects financial data on students and parents applying for college loans.

Disabled Americans must provide years of health records to prove they are entitled to disability benefits from the Social Security Administration.

And homeowners must provide payroll and savings information to HUD to qualify for home loans.

Congress tasked agencies with securing their information technology networks as far back as 2002, and asked each agency’s inspector general to annually audit compliance with basic cybersecurity standards.

But the subcommittee found that most of the agencies studied were failing to comply with even the most basic standards, including properly protecting personally identifiable information.

Five agencies did not maintain a comprehensive and accurate list of IT assets, meaning they had no idea which applications were operating on their networks.

All eight agencies failed to install security patches and other updates to prevent their systems from being vulnerable to attack.

In the most recent audits, seven of the eight agencies failed to provide for the adequate protection of personally identifiable information.

And all of the agencies used legacy systems that were so old that vendors no longer support or issue updates to patch cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

Homeland Security, for example, uses Windows 2003 on some of its systems.

The setup used by HUD to initiate and track loan-case numbers and associated data is so old that lenders are unable to submit loan applications electronically and must instead send hard copies through the mail.

In some cases, Social Security’s system to hold retirement and disability information on millions of Americans uses a programming language developed in the 1950s and 1960s — a language that will become increasingly obsolete as the IT professionals who know the language retire.

Some of the agencies are particularly susceptible to attack. The Department of Education, for example, has been unable to prevent unauthorized outside devices from easily connecting to the agency’s network since 2011.

In its 2018 audit, that department’s inspector general found that it had been able to restrict unauthorized access to 90 seconds — still enough time for a hacker to “launch an attack or gain intermittent access to internal network resources that could lead to” exposing the agency’s data.

Portman said federal agencies “have failed at implementing basic cybersecurity practices, leaving classified, personal and sensitive information unsafe and vulnerable to theft.”

“The federal government can, and must, do a better job of shoring up our defenses against the rising cybersecurity threats,” he said.

The report makes a list of recommendations aimed at securing government IT systems. Among them are ones urging federal agencies to consolidate security processes and capabilities in order to better detect cybersecurity incidents and another calling on each agency to give broader authority and latitude to their chief information officer to make organization-wide decisions regarding cybersecurity.

Sen. Tom Carper, D-Delaware, the ranking member of the subcommittee, said the Office of Management and Budget — the agency responsible for cybersecurity efforts across government — “must provide the necessary leadership to ensure that agencies are staying vigilant and prioritizing good cybersecurity practices.”

“We know that the threats posed by cyberattacks continue to evolve and grow every day, so it is crucial that agencies across our government prioritize efforts to better protect their networks from hackers,” he said.

Critics slam EPA for rolling back union protections with latest contract,https://thehill.com,[],06-26-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/450505-critics-slam-epa-for-rolling-back-union-protections-with-latest,"Critics are pushing back after the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced this week that it is rolling back the union protections offered to its employees.

In an email sent to agency staff earlier this week and obtained by The Hill late Tuesday, the agency announced it will implement a new contract that remains unsigned by the union itself.

“It’s styled as a collective bargaining agreement, but there’s no agreement. It’s imposed as an order, a dictate,” said Jeff Ruch, pacific director for Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER), adding that the contract would dramatically reduce the assistance the union can offer the EPA employees.

ADVERTISEMENT

Under the contract, union employees would have to give up office space within the EPA offices and union leaders would not be able to use the intranet or agency billboards to communicate with members. It would also limit the amount of time union leaders could spend helping rank-and-file employees with labor disputes and other issues by 75 percent.

PEER leaders said numerous EPA employees had reached out to them with concerns following the move.

The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) has already filed an unfair labor practice charge against the EPA to stop the seven-year contract from taking effect July 9.

EPA and the AFGE, the largest union representing EPA employees, have struggled for years to negotiate a new contract for employees.

EPA officials said they put the contract in place after the union walked away from negotiations that had been dragging on since 2010. The two sides have long disagreed over how much of the union contract is up for review.

“As practical matter, if EPA decided to lay off one-third of its employees as the Trump administration has been proposing for last couple of years, the union ability to block that or even intercede is severely weakened,” Ruch said.

EPA officials claim the new contract was designed for efficiency and effectiveness.

A career EPA employee said “there are certain limitations within the arbitration provision” that apply to employees who are being disciplined or fired.

But the agency argued that disputes were being handled in too many ways.

“If you already have other avenues of redress, then giving people multiple avenues for redress doesn’t make sense, especially when you have employees file in more than one place — it's ineffective at a certain point,” the agency said.

PEER called the move “mean-spirited and petty.”

AFGE said the EPA’s actions are likely illegal.

AFGE Council 238 President Gary Morton said the current process is required by law.

“We want to follow process established by Congress,” he said.

“Really this is bigger than just the contract itself. Overall this is part of the administration’s plans as they stated to gut the EPA and deny the employees the proper resources to fulfill the mission of the agency,” Morton said.

As for office space, agency staff said eliminating the union work area is part of the EPA’s effort to reduce its overall office space.

They also said blocking the union from using the agency intranet or billboards wouldn’t hinder communication as representatives were able to communicate through their own email during the shutdown.

“A lot of it just goes back to being an efficient and effective use of our equipment and the time,” another EPA career official said."

The Trump administration made an unusual last-minute plea to the Supreme Court Tuesday, telling the justices that actions by lower courts make it urgent to act quickly to resolve the legality of adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census.

The Justice Department move followed an appeals court order earlier Tuesday, which returned one lawsuit over the census to a district court judge to address recently-discovered evidence that the addition of a citizenship question may have been intended to diminish the political impact of the Latino vote.

Story Continued Below

The latest tumult in the litigation was prompted by citizenship question opponents gaining access to evidence that the views of a deceased GOP redistricting expert, Thomas Hofeller, may have played a role in a Justice Department request that led to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross adding the citizenship query to the census questionnaire.

In a two-page letter to the high court, Solicitor General Noel Francisco essentially invited the justices to shut down the pending lawsuits by declaring that Ross’ decision was lawful and that further inquiry into the motives for the decision is unnecessary.

“The Fourth Circuit’s order underscores the need for this court to address the equal-protection claim and the immateriality of the Hofeller files in its disposition of the above-captioned case so that the lawfulness of the secretary’s decision can be fully and finally resolved,” Francisco wrote. He said the government needs a quick and clear decision by the end of this month in order to finalize the print version of the census forms for use next year.

However, late Tuesday night, civil rights groups fired back in a letter to the Supreme Court, arguing that the Trump administration is trying to short-circuit the normal judicial process by having the justices rule on something that hasn’t been formally presented to them.

“The Solicitor General’s request would require this Court to render an improper advisory opinion on issues that have not been briefed or argued before this Court, relating to cases that are not before this Court, based on a trial record that is not before this Court,” wrote Denise Hulett of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, or MALDEF, and Niyati Shah of Asian Americans Advancing Justice.

They also disputed the government’s claims of urgency, noting that the Census Bureau’s chief scientist testified that with additional resources the questionnaire could be finalized as late as October.

Before the Justice Department’s Supreme Court latest salvo, civil rights advocates celebrated the order from the Richmond, Va.-based 4th Circuit as an indication that arguments against the citizenship question were gaining traction.

“The always-flimsy house of cards shielding the Trump administration’s biased and nefarious intent in adding a citizenship query to Census 2020 is rapidly collapsing,” said Thomas Saenz of MALDEF. “We look forward to presenting our enhanced case demonstrating the unlawful nature of the late addition of the citizenship question, and to vindicating one of our most enduring and important constitutional principles.”

The Trump administration has maintained that it added the question to enhance Voting Rights Act enforcement, but opponents say it was done for partisan reasons to discourage citizen and noncitizen immigrants from responding to the census.

Three federal judges have ruled that the addition of the question was illegal because it was justified inadequately by the officials involved.

The Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling on the issue this week. Decisions in some cases are expected Wednesday and additional releases are possible later in the week before the justices depart for their summer break.
