White House Asked Navy to Hide McCain Warship,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Maggie Haberman', 'Helene Cooper']",05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/29/us/politics/uss-mccain-navy-ship.html,"The White House asked the Navy to hide a destroyer named after Senator John McCain in order to avoid having the ship appear in photographs taken while President Trump was visiting Japan this week, White House and military officials said Wednesday.

Although Navy officials insisted they did not hide the ship, the John S. McCain, they did give all of the sailors aboard the day off on Tuesday as Mr. Trump visited Yokosuka Naval Base.

Two Navy sailors, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said that the McCain sailors were not invited to hear Mr. Trump speak that day aboard the amphibious assault ship Wasp, while sailors from other American warships at the base were.

A Navy service member based on Yokosuka said that all of the American warships in the harbor were invited to send 60 to 70 sailors to hear Mr. Trump’s address, with the exception of the McCain. When several sailors from the McCain showed up anyway, wearing their uniforms with the ship’s insignia, they were turned away, the service member said."
Here’s the damage done to the stock market since Trump’s May 5 trade tweet,https://www.marketwatch.com,['Mark Decambre'],05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-the-damage-done-to-the-stock-market-since-trumps-may-5-trade-tweet-2019-05-29,"What’s our damage so far?

The bullish dynamic for risk assets on Wall Street is beginning to unravel, clearly. Blame it on trade-war fears, at least partly sparked by a May 5 tweet from President Donald Trump, or peg it to worries that the global economy is facing a pronounced slowdown. In any case, major assets are reflecting deepening concerns about the durability of bull run for stocks, which will mark its 10th year in about a month.

Here is how the market is setting up:

Nasdaq nears correction territory

The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.79% stands down 7.6% from its record on May 3. Most market participants view a decline of at least 10% from a recent high as representing a correction.

S&P 500 threatens to fall below 200 day

The S&P 500 SPX, -0.69% is trading at or near its 200-day moving average, at 2,776.04, as of Wednesday afternoon trade. A breach below that point would represent a longer-term bearish momentum shift for the broad-market index. Market technicians tend to view moving averages as the demarcation between bullish and bearish momentum in an asset.

Check out: Here’s why stock-market bulls should heed the bond market’s warnings

Bonds have trounced stocks

The exchange-traded iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF TLT, +0.23% has gained 4.4% since May 3, compared with a negative 5.5% return for the S&P 500 and a negative 5.2% return for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.87%

Deep inversion

The 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.50% fell below its 3-month TMUBMUSD03M, -0.22% deepening an inversion of the yield curve, which measures the difference between the yield on the longer-dated Treasury and its shorter-dated counterpart.

Such rate inversions are rare because investors tend to demand higher yields for extending loans over a longer period. Therefore when rates invert it is viewed as a signal that an economic recession is in the offing. The 3-month/10-year inversion currently stands at the most severe since 2007.

Other asset moves

The small-capitalization Russell 2000 index RUT, -0.94% which should be more resilient to trade-war issues but tend to reflect growing domestic slowdown worries, has fallen nearly 7.7% since May 3 and is off more than 14% from its August 31 peak.

The Dow Jones Transportation Average DJT, -0.76% is down 9.4% since early May.

The Stoxx Europe 600 Index SXXP, +0.30% is down 10.5% since its April 15 peak and off 5.1% since early May. Meanwhile, yields on German 10-year bonds TMBMKDE-10Y, +8.74% a proxy for the health of the European economy, have deepened their slide, yielding negative 0.18% compared with a yield at 0.02% on May 3, before Trump’s tweet storm.

In Asia, the Shanghai Composite Index SHCOMP, -0.31% has declined by 5.3%, while China’s benchmark CSI 300 Index 000300, -0.62% has declined by 6.4% over the same period.

"Mueller, in First Comments on Russia Inquiry, Declines to Clear Trump",https://www.nytimes.com,['Sharon Lafraniere'],05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/29/us/politics/mueller-special-counsel.html,"“When a subject of an investigation obstructs that investigation or lies to investigators, it strikes at the core of their government’s effort to find the truth and hold wrongdoers accountable,” he said.

Mr. Mueller defended his decision to pursue the allegations against the president, even though, he said, charging him with a crime was “not an option we could consider.” Mr. Barr suggested at one point that the special counsel should not have collected evidence against Mr. Trump if he intended only for Congress to review it.

But Mr. Mueller said that it was important to interview witnesses while their memories were still fresh and to hold accountable anyone who might have conspired with the president and could face criminal charges. He also referred to the impeachment process, a point that is reduced to a footnote in his report.

“The Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing,” he said. He cited the same opinion from the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel that states that a sitting president cannot be criminally charged.

He added that the former deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, who appointed him as special counsel, specifically authorized him to investigate actions to interfere with his inquiry and that he kept Mr. Rosenstein apprised of his team’s work.

Mr. Mueller stressed that he would not comment further on the actions of the Justice Department or Congress. He suggested that Democrats in Congress were wasting their time in seeking his testimony because he would simply repeat what he stated in his report. “The report is my testimony,” he said.

He added: “I am making that decision myself. No one has told me whether I can or should testify or speak further about this matter.”"
Roy Moore hits back at Trump in defiant interview,https://www.politico.com,"['James Arkin', 'Caitlin Oprysko']",05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/29/roy-moore-hits-back-at-trump-in-defiant-interview-1487921,"Roy Moore made it clear he is convinced he could capture his party's nomination in the face of President Donald Trump's opposition. | Joe Raedle/Getty Images elections Roy Moore hits back at Trump in defiant interview The controversial former judge says the president ‘doesn’t control’ Alabama voters, and he can win despite Trump’s opposition.

A defiant Roy Moore brushed aside Donald Trump’s warning not to run for Senate again, telling POLITICO on Wednesday that Alabama voters are capable of deciding for themselves whether he’s fit for office.

“The president doesn’t control who votes for the United States Senate in Alabama,” Moore said in a phone interview. “People in Alabama are smarter than that. They elect the senator from Alabama, not from Washington, D.C.”

Story Continued Below

The scandal-plagued former judge said he is “seriously considering” running for Senate again and plans to decide in a “few weeks.”

Moore's recalcitrance comes as Republicans, including Trump, are warning him to stay out of the race against Democratic Sen. Doug Jones. Republicans view the Alabama contest as a linchpin of their Senate majority — ousting Jones in 2020 would give the GOP a larger cushion with the party mostly on defense on the Senate map.

Jones narrowly defeated Moore in a special election in 2017 amid allegations of sexual misconduct by Moore with young girls decades ago. Those allegations emerged after Moore won the GOP nomination by defeating the Trump-endorsed candidate, then-interim Sen. Luther Strange.

Trump tweeted Wednesday morning that he has ""NOTHING"" against Moore, despite the sexual misconduct allegations against the former judge. But, he wrote, Moore “cannot win, and the consequences will be devastating.” That came after Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., also tweeted at Moore to steer clear of the race.

Top allies to Senate Republican leadership have made clear they view Moore as the best chance Democrats have to maintain the seat.

“We believe most Alabama Republicans realize that nominating Roy Moore would be gift wrapping this Senate seat for Chuck Schumer,” said Steven Law, president of Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.

Moore is convinced he could capture his party's nomination in the face of the president's opposition again. He said some Republicans are fearful that he still has support in the state.

“They know I'll win,"" he said. ""That's why they're upset.""

He also continues to deny the multiple allegations of inappropriate behavior against him that were reported on during the 2017 race. “It was fake news then, [and] it’s fake news now,” Moore said.

Republicans have believed for weeks that Moore was likely to run for Senate again. They also acknowledge there’s little they can do to stop him, and that he has a hard-core base of supporters in the state that likely gives him both a high floor and low ceiling of support. Alabama election laws require winning a majority of the vote to secure a party nomination, so Moore could have an opening to make a runoff in a crowded primary field.

Opposition to his potential candidacy has been fairly unified throughout the party. Sen. Todd Young of Indiana, the National Republican Senatorial Committee chairman, had spoken with Trump in recent weeks and raised concerns about Moore, according to two people familiar with the discussion.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201905/355/1155968404_6042392432001_6042394724001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

Trump’s tweet Wednesday was widely praised by Republicans, who believe the president is uniquely able to chip away at Moore’s support given his popularity among the GOP base in deep-red Alabama.

The dynamics of the race ""were different before the president weighed in, but they're fundamentally changed after the president weighed in,” said Josh Holmes, a top McConnell adviser. “I don't think Roy Moore could win a primary before the president weighed in, and I know he can't win one after the president weighed in.”

With or without Moore, the GOP contest appears wide open. Several Republicans are already running: Rep. Bradley Byrne, state Rep. Arnold Mooney, and Tommy Tuberville, the former head football coach at Auburn University.

Each of the candidates face hurdles to emerging from the field. Byrne, the first candidate in the race, had more than $2 million in the bank at the end of the first quarter. Though a potential problem looms: Byrne called on Trump to step aside from the presidential race in 2016 after the ""Access Hollywood"" tape. Though he eventually said he would vote for Trump and has been a staunch supporter since the president took office, it’s unclear whether he can clear the hurdles of his previous criticism.

Tuberville, meanwhile, has put together a strong campaign team of veteran consultants, but he's a first-time candidate without experience as a campaigner or fundraiser. Mooney, a staunch conservative, already earned the endorsement of Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) — but as a state representative, he also faces a battle to prove fundraising ability and broader support.

Leaders of the conservative Club for Growth are watching the race closely and have met with Mooney and Tuberville, who could both receive a major boost from an endorsement. The group opposes Byrne and would not back Moore if he does run. David McIntosh, the Club president, said they had “good meetings” with both Mooney and Tuberville.

“We are waiting to see if either put together a great campaign and raise the money necessary to be competitive,” McIntosh said.

If Moore does run, as appears likely, Republicans' goal would be to defeat him outright and deny him a spot in a runoff. But given his potentially unshakable base of support in the state, some Republicans acknowledge it’s possible he could make a runoff again as he did in 2017. One Republican working on the race, who requested anonymity to discuss internal strategy, said polling had shown about 15 percent of the primary electorate views Moore “very"" favorably. This Republican said in a crowded field, Moore would be unlikely to grow his support beyond that.

A second Republican involved in the race, however, said Moore has a “hard-core following” that could put him in a runoff. This Republican emphasized that Trump’s opposition would likely mean any opponent could defeat him one-on-one, but Moore making a runoff is a potentially disastrous scenario for Republicans given the unpredictability of those matchups.

“I think it's a disaster if it's misplayed,” this Republican said.

National Republicans are not yet picking a candidate to back, and the state GOP is staying out of the primary. Terry Lathan, the state party chair, said in a statement that they will remain neutral: “It is up to the candidates to make their case to the Republican primary voters to secure their support.”

The primary, set for next March, is still far away. The filing deadline is in December, leaving plenty of time for other candidates to enter the race. Even as the other candidates build their campaigns, Republicans in Washington plan to bash Moore, if he runs, as unelectable not just for the allegations of sexual misconduct, but for the other controversies in his past, including being twice removed from the state Supreme Court.

""Last time around was a sprint. This is a marathon,” said Jesse Hunt, a spokesperson for the NRSC. “Roy Moore has proven he's incapable of winning a general election, and no stone will be left unturned as it pertains to his background.""

Trump betrays America again.,https://slate.com,['William Saletan'],05-29-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/trump-betrays-america-again.html,"U.S. President Donald Trump reacts during a news conference with Shinzo Abe, Japan’s prime minister, not pictured, at Akasaka Palace in Tokyo on May 27. Kiyoshi Ota—Pool/Getty Images

President Donald Trump swears he’s a patriot. He hugs the flag, preaches “America First,” wages trade wars, and builds up the military. He points out, correctly, that the Mueller investigation failed to prove that he criminally conspired with Russia to win the 2016 election.

But a president can betray his country without engaging in a secret conspiracy. He can do it out in the open, just by being pathologically disloyal. That’s how Trump has sold out America to a series of dictators, starting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. This week, while visiting Japan, Trump again made himself a tool of foreign influence, by joining North Korea in a verbal assault on former Vice President Joe Biden.

The Japan trip showcased three elements of Trump’s personality that make him an easy mark for foreign exploitation. The first is narcissism. Trump routinely abandons the people around him: wives, employees, officials, and aides. He applies the word treason not to betrayals of the Constitution, but to any threat to himself, including the FBI’s decision to open an investigation into his campaign in 2016, when Trump was just a candidate. He spurns NATO, scorns American war heroes, and ridicules U.S. intelligence agencies. Trump believes he is the state. Therefore, he feels nothing for any part of the state beyond himself.

This makes it easy to turn Trump against the U.S. government. Over the weekend, he flew to Japan, along with national security adviser John Bolton and other aides, to discuss regional concerns. When reporters asked about North Korea’s recent launches of short-range ballistic missiles, Bolton confirmed that the launches violated U.S.-backed United Nations Security Council resolutions. Bolton assured the press that Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe would step in to protect “the integrity of the Security Council resolutions.” At a joint press conference with Trump, Abe affirmed that the launches were violations.

Trump cares more about beating his domestic rivals than standing up to foreign enemies.

But Trump didn’t. Before the press conference with Abe, the president disowned Bolton’s statement. “North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me,” Trump tweeted. “I have confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me.” Then, during the press conference, when Trump was asked whether North Korea had “violated U.N. resolutions with the short-range missile launch,” he said no. “My people think it could have been a violation, as you know. I view it differently,” the president declared. Reporters pressed him: “You’re not bothered at all by the small missiles?” Trump replied, “No, I’m not.”

In Trump’s self-absorbed mind, U.S.-backed international resolutions don’t matter. Nor does the opinion of Trump’s host, Japan, which faces a direct threat from Kim’s arsenal. Nor do the assessments of “my people,” including Bolton. All that matters is what Kim pledged “to me.” And Trump is willing to act on his impulses. In March, he overruled North Korea sanctions that had been announced by his administration. To reverse U.S. policy, all a dictator has to do is suck up to Trump.

Second, Trump cares more about beating his domestic rivals than standing up to foreign enemies. And to win these domestic fights, the president is happy to claim America’s enemies as his allies. He consistently sided with Putin against President Barack Obama. In 2016, Trump openly urged Russia to help him defeat Hillary Clinton. This year, Trump declared that the Chinese government was “far more honorable” than U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and the rest of what Trump called “the opposition party.”

In Japan, Trump took Kim’s side against Biden. On May 22, a commentary in North Korea’s state-run news service called Biden a “fool of low IQ.” Days later, while Trump was in Japan, he tweeted that he had “smiled when [Kim] called Swampman Joe Biden a low IQ individual, & worse. Perhaps that’s sending me a signal?” (Trump was incorrect: The North Korean statement wasn’t attributed to Kim.) Later, at the press conference with Abe, Trump was asked, “Does it give you pause at all to be appearing to side with a brutal dictator instead of with a fellow American, the former vice president, Joe Biden?” Again, Trump endorsed the insult. “Kim Jong-un made a statement that Joe Biden is a low-IQ individual. He probably is, based on his record,” said Trump. “His administration, with President Obama, they were basically a disaster.”

That’s how Trump thinks: The real enemy is Biden. By insulting Biden, Kim is, in Trump’s words, “sending me a signal” of support. So the best route to getting on Trump’s good side, if you’re a foreign government, is to help the president in his domestic wars. And if you don’t, Trump will say you did anyway. Returning from Japan, he tweeted, “Numerous Japanese officials told me that the Democrats would rather see the United States fail than see me or the Republican Party succeed.” (There’s no evidence that Japanese officials said any such thing.)

Third, Trump is a reflexive liar. He’s happy to contradict U.S. intelligence when it gets in the way of his interests. He has denied intelligence on Russia’s election interference, intelligence about the persistence of ISIS, and intelligence implicating Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.

Trump has been lying about North Korea for a year. He consistently contradicts intelligence that shows Kim is pushing forward with nuclear and missile development. In Japan, the president compounded his lies. The Department of Defense says that on May 9, North Korea “flight-tested multiple ballistic missiles.” But when reporters in Japan asked Trump about the launches, he insisted, “There have been no ballistic missiles going out.” Trump also claimed, contrary to a Pentagon statement, that the United States was “continuing to get the remains” of U.S. military personnel from North Korea.

Trump’s corrupt habits—narcissism, deceit, obsession with domestic rivalry—have taught foreign malefactors how to manipulate him. Look at the North Korean commentary that attracted his interest during the trip to Japan. It parroted Trump’s mockery of Biden, calling the former vice president sleepy, gaffe-prone, and low-IQ. It appealed to Trump’s sense of rivalry, claiming that Biden’s criticisms of Kim were “politically motivated” and driven “by ambition for power.” It painted Bolton as a menace to Trump, calling the aide a “security-destroying adviser” who conspires with the United Nations to drag the United States into war.

Bolton foolishly imagines that he speaks for Trump. “The president’s view,” Bolton declared in Japan, was for “keeping sanctions in place and in force until North Korea shows it has made a strategic decision to give up its nuclear weapons.” At the press conference with Abe, Bolton chuckled when Trump endorsed North Korea’s insults of Biden. But Bolton has no idea what Trump’s position will be a month from now, because Trump has no true commitments. And like every aide before him, Bolton will soon be out in the street. He’s just another American in Trump’s way."
Opinion | I Thought I’d Seen the Worst of Trump,https://www.nytimes.com,['Jennifer Finney Boylan'],05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/29/opinion/i-thought-id-seen-the-worst-of-trump.html,"Sometimes I wonder if, as far as the news is concerned, I’ve begun to resemble the protagonist in “The Princess Bride,” who develops an immunity to a poison, iocane powder, simply by ingesting a little bit of it every day. Incredibly, the monstrousness of our age no longer shocks me, not least because I spend part of each day taking it all in.

But on Friday, for the first time, I read the newspaper and just collapsed in a chair and wept actual hot tears. My wife and son came over and held me in their arms, fearing, perhaps, that I felt unloved.

But that’s not why I wept.

I’ve always felt a ridiculous love for this country, a kind of cheese-ball passion that is almost embarrassing to admit to. Maybe it’s because my mother was an immigrant, or because my father went from rags to riches, Horatio Alger-style. Maybe it’s because when I came out as something as unexpected as transgender in midlife, there seemed — against all odds — to be room for me. I don’t know. Maybe it’s just that I love rock 'n' roll, and Philadelphia hoagies, and the Boston Red Sox, and James Cagney. I am that Yankee Doodle boy — or, you know, girl.

The story that slew me, of all things, was about a proposed change to the Affordable Care Act, removing its civil rights protections for gender identity. The move wasn’t unexpected; after all, the Trump administration has been considering various means of erasing transgender identity since at least last fall."
Mueller explains why he didn't charge Trump,https://www.youtube.com,[],,,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_nviH-cldU,"Published on May 29, 2019

Special counsel Robert Mueller broke his silence one month after he released the findings of his Russia probe. He explained that it would have been unconstitutional to charge a sitting president and suggested it is up to Congress to pursue impeachment. Former U.S. Deputy Assistant Attorney General Bob Litt joins CBSN to provide legal insight on what Mueller said Wednesday.

US Department of Energy is now referring to fossil fuels as “freedom gas”,https://arstechnica.com,['Megan Geuss'],,,,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/05/us-department-of-energy-is-now-referring-to-fossil-fuels-as-freedom-gas/,"Call it a rebranding of ""energy dominance.""

In a press release published on Tuesday, two Department of Energy officials used the terms ""freedom gas"" and ""molecules of US freedom"" to replace your average, everyday term ""natural gas.""

The press release was fairly standard , announcing the expansion of a Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) terminal at the Freeport facility on Quintana Island, Texas. It would have gone unnoticed had an E&E News reporter not noted the unique metonymy ""molecules of US freedom.""

DOE Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy Steven Winberg is quoted as saying, ""With the US in another year of record-setting natural gas production, I am pleased that the Department of Energy is doing what it can to promote an efficient regulatory system that allows for molecules of US freedom to be exported to the world.”

Also in the press release, US Under Secretary of Energy Mark W. Menezes refers to natural gas as ""freedom gas"" in his quote: “Increasing export capacity from the Freeport LNG project is critical to spreading freedom gas throughout the world by giving America’s allies a diverse and affordable source of clean energy.""

Slate notes that the term ""freedom gas"" seems to have originated from an event with DOE Secretary Rick Perry. Earlier this year, the secretary signed an order to double the amount of LNG exports to Europe, saying, “The United States is again delivering a form of freedom to the European continent. And rather than in the form of young American soldiers, it’s in the form of liquefied natural gas.”

A reporter at the order signing jokingly asked whether the LNG shipments should be called ""freedom gas,"" and Perry said, ""I think you may be correct in your observation.""

If the DOE is still running with the term as a joke, then the wit in the Energy Secretary's office is bone dry. Ars contacted the DOE to see if ""freedom gas"" and ""molecules of US freedom"" are now going to be standard in department communication with the public. We are also curious if any potential drop in LNG exports could result in patriotism bloat. The DOE has not responded, though we'll update the story if it does.

According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), Canada, Mexico, South Korea, and Japan were the top importers of freedom gas last year. China, India, and the UK buy a smaller number of molecules of US freedom."
Book review of Siege: Trump Under Fire by Michael Wolff,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Ryan Lizza', 'May At Pm']",05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/a-trip-inside-trumpworld-and-inside-the-presidents-head-with-bannon-as-guide/2019/05/29/7560ec12-8236-11e9-95a9-e2c830afe24f_story.html,"Steve Bannon served as White House chief strategist before being fired in August 2017. He hasn’t talked to President Trump since then, but he still has lots to say about his former boss. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)

Ryan Lizza is a senior political analyst for CNN and chief political correspondent for Esquire.

The author’s note that opens “Siege,” Michael Wolff’s sequel to “Fire and Fury” — which documented President Trump’s first year in office, much of it through the anonymous musings of Steve Bannon — reads like the scene-setting crawl at the start of a Star Wars movie. The reader learns that Wolff’s new account begins in February 2018, when the “president’s capricious furies have been met by an increasingly organized and methodical institutional response” and Trump’s “own government, even his own White House, has begun to turn on him.” Instead of cutting to Hoth, the distant ice planet in “The Empire Strikes Back” that’s home to the struggling rebellion, we soon cut to Bannon’s kitchen table.

Bannon has been driven out of the White House by Trump and dumped by his financial patrons, the Mercers, and has set up shop in a shabby Capitol Hill townhouse, theatrically known as the Embassy, which, it slowly becomes clear, might as well be Hoth. It takes 193 pages, but we eventually learn that Bannon hasn’t talked to Trump since he was fired.

That doesn’t prevent Wolff from centering the entire narrative on the president’s former aide. So the new Wolff book is much like the last one: a sail through the Trump diaspora and inside the president’s head with Bannon as the cruise director. But also like the last book, “Siege” is ultimately crippled by three flaws: Wolff’s overreliance on a single character, and one who is now more distant from the action; factual errors that mar the author’s credibility; and sourcing that is so opaque it renders the scoops highly suspicious and unreliable.

For long stretches of “Siege,” Trump and the White House staff disappear and the reader is subjected to a tedious ticktock of Bannon’s travels and his plotting from the Embassy, where he pontificates throughout 2018 about how the Republicans will win the midterms (they didn’t), how his nationalist project is still ascendant in the GOP (it isn’t), how Robert Mueller will destroy the Trump presidency (he didn’t), and how Bannon himself may have to replace Trump and run for president in 2020, with Sean Hannity as his running mate (we’ll have to wait for Episode III).

In the acknowledgments, Bannon is the only named source whom Wolff thanks, praising him effusively and, in an allusion to Dante’s “Divine Comedy,” calling him “the Virgil anyone might be lucky enough to have as a guide for a descent into Trumpworld.” In reality Bannon is more like Wolff’s Farinata, the former Florentine political leader whom Dante portrays as banished to the circle of hell for heretics, where, alone in his tomb, he still obsesses about his own era in politics but has no access to current events unless one of the dead brings him a snippet of news from the center of power.

In “Siege,” the dead arrive at Bannon’s doorstep in the form of former Trump aides such as Corey Lewandowski, David Bossie, Sam Nunberg and Jason Miller, and Wolff, like many other Washington reporters, absorbs a mix of gossip, misinformation and occasional insight that the outer rings of Trump advisers are famous for circulating.

This rogues’ gallery of Trump hangers-on that Wolff seems to depend on is sometimes presented as a group of devoted ideological rebels trying to keep the flame of true MAGA alive. According to Wolff, several of them, usually working through Hannity, who has better access to the president, press Trump on issues like building the border wall or declaring a national emergency over immigration. Bossie and Lewandowski “weren’t operatives, they were believers,” Wolff credulously reports, a statement that will generate guffaws among Republicans. But mostly, Bannon’s knitting circle is involved in low-level score-settling — often against then-White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner — and making money off their association with Trump. Lewandowski and Bossie hawk a conspiracy book about the “deep state” even though, according to Wolff, Bannon tells their ghostwriter that “none of this is true.”

Wolff’s rebels and Trump are co-dependent but clear-eyed about each other. Trump, Wolff writes, likes Lewandowski more than his own sons, even though he derides him as an “ass kisser.” Trump says Bossie, who unsuccessfully maneuvers to become chief of staff, is “shifty.” Nunberg is mocked by the president for living with his parents, and Wolff quotes Trump remarking of Miller, “I get the people who no one else wants.”

Likewise, they have no illusions about Trump. Wolff summarizes the view of the president from the ragtag Embassy team: Trump is a “clown,” an “idiot” and a “nutter.”

Bannon’s core political project of attaining power by stoking racial resentment is left uncriticized by Wolff. (In case there is any doubt about this, Bannon tells Wolff: “If you voted for Trump, every picture of a Mexican immigrant, a parent or a child, together or apart, reconfirms that vote.”) Wolff’s obsession with documenting Bannon’s every thought, while remaining uninterested in the reality of the racial politics unleashed by him and Trump, reaches peak hilarity when he earnestly quotes Bannon’s dissection of whether the president is an anti-Semite (probably not) or a racist (probably). While many who have studied Trump — for a fraction of the time that Wolff has — have easily made up their minds on the issue, Wolff, who quotes Trump making racist and anti-Semitic remarks and calling Mexicans “wetbacks,” writes that whether he is a racist or not is “a rosebud riddle.”

However, Bannon’s frequently shrewd observations make it clear why Wolff finds him irresistible. The author is mostly interested in Trump’s psychology. He is adept at documenting the president’s lunacy, and Bannon is frequently an able fellow shrink. For example, he credibly theorizes that Trump’s inevitable disgust with anyone who works for him is a natural outgrowth of his alleged self-hatred. “Hating himself, he of course comes to hate anyone who seems to love him,” Bannon tells Wolff. “If you seem to respect him, he thinks he’s put something over on you — therefore you’re a fool.”

But the idea that Wolff is documenting some larger ideological struggle in the Trump GOP is mostly familiar Bannon spin. According to Wolff, Lewandowski reports that “he had almost wet himself” during a White House confrontation with Kelly, a former Marine, who grabbed Lewandowski by the collar outside the Oval Office. What Wolff leaves out about this well-known episode, first reported by the New York Times, is that Kelly was yelling at Lewandowski for trying to profit off Trump’s presidency. Wolff also ignores, perhaps because of his publishing deadline, that Bossie was officially excommunicated from Trumpworld in May when the Trump campaign suggested he was running a “scam group” that was “interested in filling their own pockets with money from innocent Americans’ paychecks.” Believers indeed.

Wolff’s broad conceptual error — that the real heart of Trumpism is heroically being kept alive by Bannon’s band of true-believing outsiders — would be forgivable if the book wasn’t marred by two more strikes: some cringeworthy errors, and sourcing that is so opaque it renders the extremely fun and juicy quotes sprinkled across every chapter as — sadly — difficult to trust.

Wolff reports that he had two fact-checkers assigned to the book, but they apparently weren’t enough. He writes that after Ty Cobb left the White House, Trump’s only lawyers were Jay Sekulow and Rudy Giuliani (whom he describes as “drunk on a bid for further attention, or just drunk”). Wolff seems not to know that Trump hired Jane and Martin Raskin, whose names do not appear in the book, to deal with the Mueller probe. He writes that Russians hacked the email account of John Podesta and servers at the Democratic National Committee after July 27, 2016, the day Trump famously called on Russia to find Hillary Clinton’s missing emails. That’s wrong. The Podesta hack happened in March, the DNC hack happened in April, and the fruits of those hacks had already been released, which is why Trump made the comment.

Wolff observes that reporting on Trump is difficult because the president and many of the people who work for him or advise him lie indiscriminately. Other reporters have faced this dilemma by maximizing the number of sources needed to confirm the many rumors that swirl around Trump and by generally increasing transparency to retain reader trust in an environment where the president regularly attacks truthful reporting as fake.

Wolff takes a different approach. Dramatic scoops are plopped down on the page with no sourcing whatsoever. Would-be newsmaking quotes are often attributed to Trump and senior officials without any context about when or to whom they were made.

Wolff clearly relies on the work of dozens of other reporters on the Trump beat, but because he rarely uses any attributions, the reader never knows whether a fact he’s relaying comes from him or elsewhere. For example, he writes that Kushner was briefed by intelligence officials that his friend Wendi Deng might be a Chinese spy. The reader would be forgiven for thinking this was another Wolff scoop, rather than a major exclusive reported by the Wall Street Journal in early 2018.

The cutting comments Wolff attributes to Trump certainly sound like the president: “the stupidest man in Congress” and a “religious nut” (Mike Pence); “gives me the creeps” (Karen Pence); “feeble” (John Kelly); “a girl” (Kushner); “looks like a mental patient” (Giuliani); “a pretty stupid boy” who “has too many f---ing kids” (Donald Trump Jr.); “men’s shop salesmen” (Republican House candidates); “ignoramuses” (Trump’s communications team); “the only stupid Jew” (Michael Cohen); “a dirty rat” (former White House counsel Donald McGahn); a “virgin crybaby” who was “probably molested by a priest” (Brett Kavanaugh); “the poor man’s Ann Coulter” (Kellyanne Conway); “sweaty” (Stephen Miller). But the lack of sourcing transparency and footnotes does not inspire confidence.

By far the biggest scoop in the book is a document that Wolff alleges is a draft indictment, eventually ignored, of the president from inside the special counsel’s office. In addition to the alleged indictment, Wolff reports on several interesting and newsworthy memos outlining Mueller’s legal strategy for what to do if Trump pardoned Michael Flynn or tried to shut down the investigation. These documents, if verified, would rescue the book, because they offer the first real glimpse inside the nearly airtight Mueller operation.

On Tuesday, the special counsel’s office issued a rare on-the-record statement insisting that the “documents described do not exist.”"
"DOJ watchdog: Former FBI official illegally leaked court docs, disclosed 'sensitive' information and took gift from media",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-watchdog-finds-fmr-fbi-deputy-assistant-director-leaked-sensitive-information-took-gift-from-media-but-declines-prosecution,"The Justice Department's internal watchdog announced in an investigative summary released Wednesday that an unnamed former FBI deputy assistant director engaged in ""misconduct,"" including leaking ""sensitive"" information to the media, violating federal law by disclosing sealed court records and taking a gift from someone in the media.

Nevertheless, the inspector general (IG) indicated, without explanation, that ""prosecution of the DAD [deputy assistant director] was declined."" The investigation's findings will be referred to the FBI for potential further action, the IG said.

The official became the second high-level FBI employee to be formally rebuked by the IG over media contacts seen as improper. Former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe was fired from the bureau in March 2018 by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions after an inspector general report revealed that he ""lacked candor"" when discussing his communications about federal probes with members of the media.

The IG first indicated in its June 2018 report on DOJ and FBI misconduct that ""although FBI policy strictly limits the employees who are authorized to speak to the media, we found that this policy appeared to be widely ignored during the period we reviewed.""

The IG, flagging what it called an apparent ""cultural"" problem at the bureau, said at the time it would announce the conclusion of multiple separate ""investigations"" into the matter at a later date. The Wednesday report appeared to be the opening salvo in those reports. A distinct, comprehensive IG report covering a variety of additional matters, including potential FBI surveillance abuses, is expected in a matter of weeks.

John Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, and John Huber, the U.S. attorney in Utah, are conducting independent parallel probes into the FBI and DOJ. Last week, President Trump authorized Attorney General William Barr to declassify and release materials pertinent to the reviews.

The investigative summary released Wednesday specifically found by a preponderance of evidence that the DAD had ""engaged in misconduct when the DAD accepted a ticket, valued at approximately $225, to attend a media-sponsored dinner, as a gift from a member of the media, in violation of federal regulations and FBI policy.""

STRZOK'S SPECIAL COUNSEL PHONE TOTALLY WIPED BY RECORDS OFFICER WHO ASSUMED NOTHING IMPORTANT WAS ON THERE

The report also assessed that the DAD ""disclosed to the media the existence of information that had been filed under seal in federal court, in violation of 18 USC § 401, Contempt of Court, provided without authorization FBI law enforcement sensitive information to reporters on multiple occasions; and had dozens of official contacts with the media without authorization, in violation of FBI policy."" Contempt of court can be punished by a jail term or a fine, at the court's discretion.

Media leaks played a central role in advancing the narrative that the Trump campaign may have colluded with Russia, and Republican lawmakers have charged that the FBI and DOJ planted sensitive information to further their own political and investigative goals.

The FBI, for example, extensively relied on news articles -- including one from Yahoo News -- to obtain a surveillance warrant to monitor former Trump aide Carter Page. The FBI did not inform the FISA court that the Yahoo article relied on a source that, according to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the FBI knew was politically motivated. Internal FBI text messages obtained by Fox News also show FBI brass fretting that a senior DOJ officials had similar concerns about a FISA source's bias.

And text messages between ex-FBI employees and former lovers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, unearthed last year, revealed that government officials were ""leaking like mad"" in the run-up to the Trump-Russia collusion probe.

""In addition to the significant number of communications between FBI employees and journalists, we identified social interactions between FBI employees and journalists that were, at a minimum, inconsistent with FBI policy and department ethics rules,"" the IG wrote in June. ""For example, we identified instances where FBI employees received tickets to sporting events from journalists, went on golfing outings with media representatives, were treated to drinks and meals after work by reporters, and were the guests of journalists at nonpublic social events.""

The IG concluded by describing ""the harm caused by leaks, fear of potential leaks, and a culture of unauthorized media contacts.""

""We do not believe the problem is with the FBI’s policy, which we found to be clear and unambiguous,"" the IG added. ""Rather, we concluded that these leaks highlight the need to change what appears to be a cultural attitude.""

Mueller inadvertently confirms William Barr didn't misrepresent his report,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/mueller-inadvertently-confirms-william-barr-didnt-misrepresent-the-special-counsels-report,"In Robert Mueller's first and only public remarks regarding the special counsel investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 election, Mueller reiterated that the office declined to come to a conclusion about whether President Trump committed any obstruction of justice offenses.

""If we had had the confidence that the president had not clearly committed a crime, we would have said so,"" Mueller announced. He once again pointed both to inconclusive evidence as well as his assertion that charging a sitting president with a crime was ""prohibited"" and ""unconstitutional.""

None of this is explicitly new information, but that Mueller found it necessary to use his lone eight minutes of public speaking time out of the past three years is telling. It also further counters the charge that Attorney General William Barr misrepresented the outcome of the special counsel investigation.

Outside of Mueller's specific request that Barr use the executive summaries and introductions from the report as the initial summary of the investigation to the public — a move that was practically improbable and functionally impossible, given Barr's duty to decide after Mueller punted the obstruction question — Mueller's statement today only further bolsters the accuracy of Barr's framing in his letter summarizing the principle conclusions of the Mueller report.

Just 48 hours after receiving the Mueller report, Barr wrote:



The Special Counsel states that ""while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him."" The Special Counsel's decision to describe the facts of his obstruction investigation without reaching any legal conclusions leaves it to the Attorney General to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime.

...

applying the principles of federal prosecution that guide our charging decisions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel's investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense. Our determination was made without regard to, and is not based on, the constitutional considerations that surround the indictment and criminal prosecution of a sitting president.



Compare this to the Executive Summary of Volume II of the Mueller report:



Under applicable Supreme Court precedent, the Constitution does not categorically and permanently immunize a President for obstructing justice through the use of his Article II powers. The separation-of-powers doctrine authorizes Congress to protect official proceedings, including those of courts and grand juries, from corrupt, obstructive acts regardless of their source.

...

Finally, we concluded that in the rare case in which a criminal investigation of the President's conduct is justified, inquiries to determine whether the President acted for a corrupt motive should not impermissibly chill his performance of his constitutionally assigned duties. The conclusion that Congress may apply the obstruction laws to the President's corrupt exercise of the powers of office accords with our constitutional system of checks and balances and the principle that no person is above the law.



Even if Barr had subscribed to the exact same legal theories on obstruction and the criminal prosecution of a sitting president as Mueller does, his and Rosenstein's decision not to prosecute falls squarely in line with Mueller's. Perhaps Mueller wanted Barr to explain that Congress could still impeach Trump as a form of checks and balances on Trump, but why would Barr need to say so? He didn't exactly hide the ball that the evidence simply would not successfully clear the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard required to convict Trump or any of his associates.

[ Also read: Trump: 'Case is closed' on Mueller investigation]

Barr's job is not to encourage Congress to use impeachment proceedings as a criminal trial. High crimes and misdemeanors posit a political reading, not a strictly legal one. Mueller couldn't have his cake (refusing to charge the president with a crime) and eat it too (fairly setting the stage for Congress to impeach Trump).

Even if Mueller's read of the law is accurate, Congress would have to reasonably believe that Trump committed some sort of political crime to then begin proceedings. Investigators aren't supposed to look for exculpatory evidence and then impugn a suspect when there isn't any, even more so when it's a politically charged body aimlessly searching for an underlying crime.

Barr's letter may have been cursory, but it certainly wasn't dishonest, and Mueller proved that on Wednesday."
Justice Department asks Supreme Court to move quickly on DACA,https://www.cnn.com,"['Ariane De Vogue', 'Cnn Supreme Court Reporter']",05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/29/politics/daca-supreme-court/index.html,"Washington (CNN) A frustrated Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to say by the end of next month if it will hear arguments on whether it can wind down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, an Obama-era program that protects young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children from deportation.

Such action could mean the court hears oral arguments and issues a decision in the middle of the 2020 presidential election.

As things stand, lower courts have ruled against the administration's attempts to rescind the program and issued a nationwide injunction that keeps it on the books, and the Supreme Court has not acted upon a longstanding request from the Justice Department to take up the issue.

The justices' inaction suggests that some of them believe the issue should percolate in the lower courts before Supreme Court review."
Mueller’s report is done and so is Mueller,https://www.bostonglobe.com,[],05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/editorials/2019/05/29/mueller-report-done-and-mueller/DL5zeVkmfEsh8PRKBAQO0H/story.html,"Mueller spoke about the investigation for the first time on Wednesday and made it clear that there’s nothing more to wait for — and that expecting a definitive recommendation from him was a mistake all along. He has investigated the facts, finished his report, and had his say. Mueller is not going to declare that the president’s a crook, and he’s not going to declare that he’s not. Make him testify before Congress, and the special counsel will just say it again: While he found no evidence to establish a conspiracy between the Russian government and the Trump campaign, he could not clear the president of obstruction of justice.

For the last two years, Robert Mueller has maintained his sphinx-like silence as he investigated Russian meddling in the 2016 election and possible obstruction of justice by President Trump. That has allowed politicians, both Democrats and Republicans, to use the special counsel to their own advantage. For Trump, he was a punching bag who didn’t hit back against attacks on his integrity. For Democrats, he was a ready-made excuse to their base for failing to impeach the president already: “Wait for the Mueller report” became the party’s semi-official refrain.

His exact words: “If we had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said that.” The report lays out the facts that Mueller’s investigation established, including numerous instances of Trump trying to shut down or stymie the Russia investigation. But he makes clear that it’s not the place of a federal prosecutor to decide what to make of that evidence. That’s because sitting presidents can’t be charged with crimes under Justice Department guidelines. “The Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing,” he said.

The “process other than the criminal justice system” is impeachment. What Mueller is saying is that if Congress feels that Trump’s actions are unacceptable, its remedy is to impeach him.

If Mueller’s public statement accomplishes anything, it should be to reframe the debate over Trump’s actions in the Russia probe to one of presidential conduct rather than criminality. Is it OK for a president to fire the FBI director to derail an investigation into his actions? Do we want to live in a country where presidents criticize witnesses who cooperate with the government, and praise the ones who don’t?

Those are not questions that Robert Mueller should try to answer — they are political questions for Congress. It doesn’t matter whether Trump’s conduct would clear the bar for a criminal indictment, though hundreds of former federal prosecutors have said it does; what matters is whether Congress decides it’s a “high crime or misdemeanor.” Sure, Trump could be indicted after he leaves office as a result of this investigation or of other ongoing federal probes, but is that enough?

Those are the questions that the Congress — and, ultimately, the country — needs to consider. For Democrats, calling for further investigation — or for more testimony from Mueller — begins to look like a delay tactic. Mueller’s job was to investigate, and now he clearly wants to ride off into the sunset. His statement should be a reminder that at some point investigating the facts needs to yield to acting on them — or not."
The Department of Energy Is Now Calling Fossil Fuels “Molecules of Freedom” and “Freedom Gas”,https://slate.com,['Jordan Weissmann'],05-29-2019,2019,5,https://slate.com/business/2019/05/freedom-gas-molecules-of-freedom-department-of-energy.html,"From now on this is known as a “freedom flame.” (It’s actually a natural gas flare in New Mexico.) Nick Oxford/Reuters

The Trump administration loves fossil fuels, but apparently has decided that they need some rebranding. Or so E&E News editor Ellen Gilmer discovered Tuesday when she opened up what should have been the world’s driest press release.

TFW you delete a DOE press release thinking it’s just another DOE press release. And then you realize it’s not just another DOE press release https://t.co/oY4XFRq9Q6 pic.twitter.com/Pbbo5JTgDO — Ellen M. Gilmer (@ellengilmer) May 29, 2019

That’s right. Hydrocarbons shall henceforth be known as “molecules of U.S. freedom.” Proud Americans are fracking compounds of liberty from the glorious shale beds of Texas and shipping it ‘round the world.

Anyway, it gets better. The actual news here is that the Department of Energy gave Houston-based Freeport LNG approval to export gas processed at a new liquefaction plant that the company is set to build at a facility off the coast of Texas. Elsewhere in the government’s press release, U.S. Undersecretary of Energy Mark W. Menezes explains, “Increasing export capacity from the Freeport LNG project is critical to spreading freedom gas throughout the world by giving America’s allies a diverse and affordable source of clean energy.” (Bolds are mine.)

Freedom gas. It appears that turn of phrase originated earlier this month, when Secretary of Energy Rick Perry signed an order aimed at doubling U.S. liquefied natural gas shipments to Europe. At a press briefing in Brussels, he explained that the move would help European nations diversify their energy supply away from Russia, the region’s major supplier of gas. “The United States is again delivering a form of freedom to the European continent,” he said. “And rather than in the form of young American soldiers, it’s in the form of liquefied natural gas.” Afterward, a cheeky reporter from EURACTIV asked whether “freedom gas” would be a correct way to describe the new fuel shipments. “I think you may be correct in your observation,” an apparently inspired Perry responded.

And now it’s the Trump administration’s official line. As one of my colleagues put it, spreading freedom gas sounds like what happens when you’re newly single and suddenly have the apartment to yourself. Which raises the question: Did the Department of Energy mean to make a fart joke in an official statement? Or are we just lucky? The world may never know."
Ex-State Department head of diplomatic security 'surprised' by Hillary Clinton's private email use,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ex-state-department-head-of-diplomatic-security-surprised-by-hillary-clintons-private-email-use,"The official in charge of protecting State Department staff said he was ""surprised"" to learn that Hillary Clinton used a personal email address to conduct government business.

Eric Boswell, the former head of diplomatic security, acknowledged in a deposition this month that he warned Clinton and other State Department staff against the use of personal emails.

""We also urge Department users to minimize the use of personal web email for business, as some compromised home systems have been reconfigured by these actors to automatically forward copies of all composed emails to an undisclosed recipient,"" read a 2011 memo that bore his signature.

Clinton was a recipient of the memo, but Boswell could not confirm whether the secretary of state actually read it.

Boswell, who stepped down from his position in 2012, said he and other former State Department officials had spoken about Clinton's use of the private email address clintonemail.com as a ""general issue.""

""We were surprised,"" he added.

Boswell participated in a deposition this month as part of a court-ordered discovery related to Clinton’s use of an unauthorized email server during her time as secretary of state. A federal judge ruled that several Obama administration officials would have to answer conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch's questions about whether Clinton intentionally attempted to evade the Freedom of Information Act by using a nongovernment email system.

Boswell also warned Clinton against her use of Blackberry devices in the executive offices of the State Department. In a previously declassified memo to Cheryl Mills, Clinton's chief of staff, Boswell said the secretary of state should discontinue her use of the device due to ""vulnerabilities and risks."" Although Clinton assured Boswell she read the internal memo and ""gets it,"" an email obtained by Judicial Watch indicates she still carried the device ""[a]gainst the advice of the security hawks.""

The debate over whether Clinton's home-based email server, which she claims was set up for convenience, remains alive today. During a hearing with Attorney General William Barr this month, Rep. Louie Gohmert accused FBI Director Christopher Wray of a pro-Clinton cover-up by not pressing the intelligence community for proof that it was not hacked by China.

Also this month, partially redacted documents were released by the FBI that were part of the bureau's ""Midyear Exam"" investigation, which looked into Clinton's mishandling of classified information on her unauthorized private email servers while serving as secretary of state. The documents put on display a sense of alarm among Clinton's staff following what they feared to be a hack of the server and glaring security oversights.

The FBI investigation into Clinton's emails came to a conclusion during the 2016 presidential election. Former FBI Director James Comey publicly recommended in 2016 that no charges be brought against Clinton, who was then a candidate for president, but admonished Clinton and her colleagues for being ""extremely careless"" in handling classified information.

One of the main controversies stemming from Clinton's emails was how a technician managing the server deleted 33,000 emails. The FBI was only able to recover about 5,000 of the emails, which were released in tranches up until earlier this year as part of a Judicial Watch lawsuit. Clinton has said she ""never received nor sent any material that was marked classified,"" but the FBI found 110 emails did contain classified information.

Clinton has long blamed the FBI's handling of the investigation as a reason for her 2016 loss to President Trump."
"DOJ inspector general: Ex-FBI official leaked 'sensitive' info, improperly accepted gift from media",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-inspector-general-ex-fbi-official-leaked-sensitive-info-improperly-accepted-gift-from-media,"The Justice Department's watchdog said a high-ranking FBI official leaked ""sensitive"" information to reporters multiple times with authorization and had improperly accepted a gift from the media.

A one-page report from Inspector General Michael Horowitz released Wednesday concluded that a now-former deputy assistant director with the FBI “engaged in misconduct” by disclosing information to the media that had been filed under seal in federal court, maintaining dozens of unauthorized contacts with reporters, and accepting a $225 ticket from a member of the media to attend a dinner sponsored by the media.

Despite these violations of FBI policy, the inspector general said “prosecution of the [deputy assistant director] was declined.”

The investigation was initiated by the Office of the Inspector General in response to allegations from the FBI, and the inspector general said that it is now “providing this report to the FBI for appropriate action.”

When the Washington Examiner reached out to the DOJ inspector general’s office for further information about the investigation, including the identity of the unnamed deputy assistant director, a senior counsel said to file a Freedom of Information Act request with their office.

During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing this month, Sen. Chuck Grassley told Attorney General William Barr “there have been a number of leaks coming out of the Justice Department and FBI during high-profile investigations” and that “leaks undermine the ability of investigators to investigate.” Barr assured him that “we have multiple criminal leak investigations underway.”

The inspector general said in its report Wednesday that the investigation stemmed from one of many episodes referenced in the office’s bombshell 2018 report titled “Review of Allegations Regarding Various Actions by the Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Advance of the 2016 Election.” That inspector general inquiry, which focused on the conduct of the DOJ and FBI during the “Midyear Exam” investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server, concluded that members of both the department and the bureau acted improperly.

The 568-page tome that dropped nearly a year ago described “a culture of unauthorized media contacts” within the FBI and had a section focused on “dozens of FBI employees that had contact with members of the media,"" many in violation of FBI policies. Horowitz said “the harm caused by leaks” and “the fear of potential leaks” actually “influenced FBI officials who were advising then Director Comey on consequential investigative decisions in October 2016.”

The 2018 report said investigators “identified instances where FBI employees received tickets to sporting events from journalists, went on golfing outings with media representatives, were treated to drinks and meals after work by reporters, and were the guests of journalists at nonpublic social events.” Horowitz said “we do not believe the problem is with the FBI’s policy, which we found to be clear and unambiguous,” but instead “we concluded that these leaks highlight the need to change what appears to be a cultural attitude.”

A February 2018 report from Horowitz found former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe had improperly disclosed information to the Wall Street Journal confirming the existence of a Clinton Foundation investigation. That report determined McCabe “lacked candor” when speaking with former FBI Director James Comey, with the FBI’s Internal Investigations Section, and with the Office of the Inspector General. Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired McCabe in March 2018 just a couple days before he was set to retire.

Former FBI General Counsel James Baker, who has been making the rounds on cable news shows defending his role in the Trump-Russia investigation and his handling of the Steele dossier over the past few weeks, recently confirmed the existence of a likely criminal leaks investigation into him, but declined to provide many specifics. “I am confident that I did nothing wrong and nothing illegal,"" Baker said. That probe was handled by U.S. Attorney John Durham, who was recently picked by Barr to head up the investigation of the investigators who ran the Trump-Russia probe.

Besides looking into criminal leaks, Horowitz is also handling a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse investigation that is expected to wrap up in May or June."
Michael Wolff’s new book tease is at least believable this time,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/michael-wolffs-new-book-tease-is-at-least-believable-this-time,"Michael Wolff is probably lying again to sell advance copies of his new book, but at least his newest lies don’t require the complete suspension of readers' disbelief.

The Guardian on Tuesday reported that Wolff’s upcoming book ""Siege"" — a sequel to his sensational Fire and Fury — says that special counsel Robert Mueller drafted up documents that would have indicted Trump for three counts of obstruction of justice.

A spokesperson for Mueller’s office has denied that the documents “exist,” without ever addressing whether maybe they ever had existed in the past, say, before an incinerator received their paper shredder remnants.

If Wolff’s claim were to prove anything, it’s that Trump was right. The special counsel wasn’t an innocent fact-finding mission set up to restore the integrity of our justice system. It was a politically motivated persecution.

The document drafts, according to the Guardian’s reporting of Wolff’s book, “spelled out what Mueller considered to be the overriding theme of Trump’s presidency: the ‘extraordinary lengths’ taken ‘to protect himself from legal scrutiny and accountability, and to undermine the official panels investigating his actions.’”

Sure, Mueller and his team maybe thought every single one of those things but, as concluded in the actual product from the two-year investigation, the facts time and time again served as an impenetrable wall shielding Trump from any charges. The president’s oversight of the Justice Department gives him the authority to hire and fire whomever he pleases. And, not that it makes any difference to House Democrats, Mueller found no initial crime! The whole purpose of setting up a special counsel was to determine whether the Trump 2016 campaign coordinated with Russia to influence the election. The report explicitly said it didn’t find any evidence that it had. So, what was Trump obstructing if there was nothing that needed justice?

Much like Wolff did in his first book, his fun little narrative is meant to do nothing but run out of steam before converging neatly with the real world.

“Ultimately,” says the Guardian’s story, Mueller “concluded he could not move to prosecute a sitting president.”

Talk about a cliffhanger!

Based on his track record, there’s no reason to believe Wolff’s tale isn’t entirely made up. He did it with one brilliant piece of fiction before. But if this particular bit about the special counsel is true, Mueller has to be hoping no one can prove it."
Trump administration urges Supreme Court to fast-track decision on DACA,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Camilo Montoya-Galvez'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-on-daca-administration-urges-supreme-court-to-fast-track-decision-on-immigration-program/,"The Trump administration is urging the Supreme Court to quickly determine if it will hear oral arguments in a prolonged legal battle over President Trump's decision to terminate the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which shields approximately 800,000 undocumented immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children from deportation.

In a brief filed with little fanfare late last week, the Justice Department asked the conservative-leaning court to announce whether it intends to hold arguments before the end of June on several petitions concerning the administration's 2017 decision to wind down the program.

U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco, who represents the federal government before the high court, said it's ""critical"" for the justices to make a decision before they enter their summer recess. This would allow the government and plaintiffs to prepare briefs for oral arguments before the court's fall term, Francisco said in his brief.

The solicitor general raised several concerns about the prolonged litigation surrounding the program, which has been kept alive after several lower courts ruled against the administration. Francisco urged the court to ""expedite"" his request and consolidate the handful of cases for consideration next term.

In one passage, Francisco suggested that efforts by Congress to address the situation of those covered under DACA were being stymied by the ongoing court cases. ""The very existence of this pending litigation (and lingering uncertainty) continues to impede efforts to enact legislation addressing the legitimate policy concerns underlying the DACA policy,"" he wrote.

Several efforts to place young undocumented immigrants, dubbed DREAMers, on a pathway to citizenship have failed for nearly two decades. Although Mr. Trump has expressed some sympathy for this group of immigrants, he has repeatedly opposed stand-alone bills to legalize DACA recipients, and his administration did not include a permanent fix for the program in its latest immigration plan, spearheaded by White House senior adviser Jared Kushner.

In the coming weeks, House Democrats are set hold a floor vote on their latest version of the DREAM Act, which would put millions of young undocumented immigrants — as well as immigrants with temporary protections — on a pathway to U.S. citizenship.

The Supreme Court is expected to consider the Justice Department's latest petition Thursday during a closed-door session.

Since then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced in 2017 that the government would move to gradually dismantle the program, four federal circuit courts have issued injunctions — one as recently as last week — blocking the administration from ending the program. Since late last year, the Justice Department has asked the Supreme Court, which now includes two justices appointed by the president, to take up the case.

The second time the American diplomat felt the attack was in her apartment kitchen, after a long day working at the US Embassy in Havana. “I felt an extreme pressure like the full, frontal top of my face was exploding off my head.” Unsteady on her feet afterward, unable to work, she was medevaced to Miami and diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury. But what caused that injury, and more like it to dozens of other US diplomats and their families? That’s still unknown — and may stay that way due to the way the US State Department began the medical investigation into what happened. “Day to day, we still don’t know how to attribute it,” said the injured diplomat, who spoke to BuzzFeed News anonymously to preserve her future chances of working overseas. For the past three years, diplomats working in Cuba have complained of an array of mysterious ailments and symptoms — dizziness, headaches, difficulty concentrating — that often started with reports of metallic shrieks inside their homes in Havana. Many report long-lasting, perhaps permanent effects. The “Havana syndrome” mystery has been the subject of intense, and public, scrutiny, with much of it focused on the search for some sort of weapon — ultrasound, microwaves, psychology, and even crickets have been offered as explanations. Yet despite intense political pressure, international headlines, sanctions against Cuba, and withdrawal of most US diplomats from Havana, very little still is known about the cause of the “health attacks” as then–secretary of state Rex Tillerson described them in 2017, that affected at least 40 US and Canadian personnel working in the country. The syndrome is now under investigation by the big guns in biomedicine, federal health agencies, and the US National Academies of Science. But public health experts who spoke to BuzzFeed News said the State Department dropped the ball by not opening the investigation earlier to a wider swath of medical experts outside of its immediate sphere.

“The fundamental problem is you can’t trust anybody here.”

According to interviews with public health officials and affected personnel, as well as documents obtained by BuzzFeed News via a Freedom of Information Act request that included hundreds of emails exchanged between researchers and the US Navy’s research office, much of the early research into the mystery may have been botched or biased. The initial investigation was confined to two competing sets of researchers, both eager to publish studies on their own work, and whose findings have been at odds with each other. In one case, researchers were also seeking to promote their own newly approved medical device as a diagnostic tool. And until now, the effort has lacked broader oversight by an institution capable of cross-disciplinary research. “The fundamental problem is you can’t trust anybody here,” said medical ethicist Sergio Litewka of the University of Miami, who has written about the political cloud of secrecy and distrust surrounding the diplomats’ injuries. “Not the US State Department and not the Cuban government.” (BuzzFeed has filed a lawsuit with the State Department requesting its communications related to the medical research into the injuries, after the agency denied a request for them on medical privacy and ongoing investigation grounds.) The two medical teams the State Department first tasked with treating victims — one from the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine and the other from the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine — diagnosed the diplomats with injuries centered on their own respective areas of research expertise: inner ear damage and concussions. That drew criticism from other medical experts who saw them and the State Department as embracing familiar theories while closing off other explanations, ranging from viruses to poison to mass psychology. “Medical groups do tend to see what they are used to seeing,” University of Virginia applied ethics professor Deborah Johnson told BuzzFeed News, comparing the situation to the joke about intoxicated people who look for lost keys under a streetlamp because that’s where the light is. “It’s why it is best to hear from a lot of disciplines in an investigation.” Until now only those two US medical teams have reported, inconclusively, on the injuries to 26 US diplomats (and 14 Canadian ones) that began in Havana in late 2016. The US National Academy of Sciences will begin an investigation starting in the next few weeks, consisting of three standing committees of varied specialists investigating for a year. But outside experts are worried it might be too late to crack the case, starting now one year after the last report of injuries in Havana. They also fear that the State Department and other federal agencies have hobbled the medical investigation by keeping the details closed and hidden from the outside world. “The National Academy is an excellent choice, likely to bring in sophisticated scientists with a good arm’s length from the political players,” UCLA neuroscientist Mark Cohen told BuzzFeed News. “I hope that the NAS will also take the step of bringing in experts from outside the US, as well.”

Emails show the teams quarreled, refused to share data, and disagreed over study authorship, as they raced to publish in high-prestige publications.

The State Department does not fund medical research but, after the teams from Miami and UPenn failed to reach a consensus, did ask the CDC to investigate the injuries in December 2017. The CDC has not yet published the results of its investigation, more than a year later. The NIH’s brain trauma research, now open to injured diplomats and their families, is a five-year study. “Our response continues to be guided by the medical facts,” State Department senior medical adviser Behzad Shahbazian told BuzzFeed News in a statement. “World-class brain injury specialists and other scientists” at UPenn, NIH, and CDC, he said, “continue to examine the medical data to gain a better understanding of the nature and mechanism of injury that caused these patients’ symptoms.” But according to public records obtained by BuzzFeed News, emails show the teams quarreled, refused to share data, and disagreed over study authorship, as they raced to publish in high-prestige publications. (The UPenn team requested copies of their own emails, and then declined to comment on them to BuzzFeed News. The Miami-led team responded after it was presented with a list of incidents in the emails.) The emails show the Miami-led team discussed turning the investigation into a multiyear effort at the US Office of Naval Research (ONR) and, more unusual, also looked at the research on the injured diplomats as a marketing opportunity for diagnostic goggles — a medical device that one researcher and his university had a patent application on. (Via a spokesperson, the researcher denied having a financial interest in the patent.) They also worried about “State trying to reclaim ownership” of the investigation, according to their communications, which also privately suggest some saw little chance that the cause of the illnesses that started more than two years ago in Havana would ever be found.

Miami Herald / Getty Images Workers at the US Embassy in Havana leave the building on Sept. 29, 2017, after the State Department announced that it was withdrawing all but essential personnel from the embassy because Cuba could no longer guarantee diplomats’ safety.

In November 2016, the first cases of strange noises and injuries began appearing among a handful of diplomats posted to Havana. Initial reports were of buzzing sounds inside private homes. Embassy security at first thought these were just noises meant to annoy staff, according to US Senate testimony by State Department security official Todd Brown. The erratic nature of the incidents, a few one week, and then none another, added to the confusion, but by February 2017 it was clear that around half a dozen embassy staff were ill with headaches, hearing loss, or vertigo.

From the beginning, the medical investigation into these reports was ad hoc, a side project run by the doctors tasked with diagnosing and treating the diplomats and their families. The research investigation was allowed by the State Department, but not run by it. “I literally got this call, ‘This is the State Department, we have a problem,’” University of Miami medical school otolaryngologist Michael Hoffer told a Pentagon-sponsored presentation last August. “All of these individuals had experienced a loud noise or pressure before and during the symptoms.”

Hoffer, a former Navy doctor with two decades of military experience, had experience with blast victims who sustained traumatic brain injuries during the Iraq War, even receiving funding from the NFL Foundation for his research. Since Miami was the evacuation point for the embassy, it made sense for the State Department to ask the University of Miami expert to look at what resembled head injuries. He and his colleagues examined evacuated staff members with injuries in Miami, giving them neurologic, hearing, and physical exams. He later traveled to Havana to see many more, mostly unaffected personnel. In late March 2017, embassy staff were gathered in Havana by then-ambassador Jeffrey DeLaurentis, who warned them about the incidents and said they would be evaluated if they wished. It was the first time many had heard about the injuries or the sounds. According to news reports, Canadian diplomats and their families, including children, also began reporting such ailments that month — including headaches, nosebleeds, dizziness, and ringing in the ears — from similar sound-linked incidents. (Fifteen Canadians, including five diplomats, sued their country in February, charging that their government “downplayed the seriousness of the situation, hoarded and concealed critical health and safety information, and gave false, misleading, and incomplete information to diplomatic staff."") And the injuries kept coming. “Like a teapot on steroids, such a very high-pitched sound,” the injured American diplomat told BuzzFeed News about the incident in her Havana apartment in April 2017, one month after the embassy town hall. While in her apartment kitchen, “I literally had to duck around a corner to get away from it,” she said.

“Like a teapot on steroids, such a very high-pitched sound.”

Her vision started to blur over the next three days, so she went to a Cuban eye doctor, who diagnosed bleeding in her retinas. “We couldn’t tell the [Cuban doctor] anything,” she said, but the State Department quickly evacuated her as soon as she alerted them about the problem. She stayed in Florida for about six weeks for treatment for her eyes, before returning to Havana “to resume life.” Shortly after her return, there was a second incident in the apartment, accompanied by a buzzing noise. She said, “A sudden force on my face was pulling it up, everywhere above the nose.” Afterward she felt unsteady while walking and had fatigue and difficulty concentrating. She was evacuated to Miami, where she was evaluated for a traumatic blast injury, in the process donning a pair of experimental diagnostic goggles that tracked her eyes to measure the severity of her vertigo, and serving as a data point in Hoffer’s research. (Essentially, the goggles claim to track how the pupils of the eyes constrict in response to seeing objects move back and forth, an involuntary response that people with even mild traumatic brain injuries find difficult.) By April, the University of Miami’s Hoffer had invited his longtime colleagues, bioengineer Carey Balaban of the University of Pittsburgh and Kurt Yankaskas, their grant officer at the US Navy’s Office of Naval Research hearing loss program, to collaborate on investigating the diplomats’ injuries. The three scientists discussed inner ear “cavitation,” damaging implosions of blood bubbles caused by focused sound waves, as an explanation. In an email obtained by BuzzFeed News, Balaban shared a proposal for a “blood vessel” grant with Yankaskas later that same month. Still more diplomats reported injuries. On May 23, 2017, the State Department told Cuba to send two of its diplomats home from its Washington, DC, embassy, unsatisfied with the Castro government’s protests of innocence concerning the injuries. Cuba had a long history of constant surveillance aimed at US diplomats. It was also known to engage in petty harassment, such as leaving unplugged refrigerators and cigarettes in ashtrays after break-ins. It made the notion of the regime lacking any knowledge of the injuries, or responsibility for them, implausible in US eyes. In all, Hoffer’s team would see 25 diplomats or their families affected by the incidents, 10 who lived with them but were unaffected in Miami, and another 105 unaffected personnel seen separately in Havana. “There was no media attention given to what was happening in Cuba when we saw these individuals,” Hoffer said at the later Pentagon teleconference, calling the group “in a sense, pure.” On July 6, 2017, Hoffer and other medical experts met with federal officials, reportedly including top State Department medical officer Charles Rosenfarb, to discuss the still-secret injuries with the diplomats. The expert panel “came to a consensus that the initial findings were most likely related to neurotrauma from a non-natural source,” according to the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). That consensus was perhaps unsurprising, given the experts who were looking under the lamppost: They included neurologists and hearing specialists from the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, and the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, according to a State Department email asking them for travel receipts. But there were no infectious disease, toxicology, tropical medicine, or psychiatric experts listed as meeting specialists — no one who might have had a competing explanation for the injuries was present. Competing theories would, however, come into play much later. Complicating any collaboration, and the research overall, was secrecy about the injuries. This remains a problem today. BuzzFeed News asked the four scientists from Johns Hopkins who were listed as participants in the July 2017 meeting, for example, to comment on the progress of the medical investigation into the Havana injuries so far. A university media representative said that one, otolaryngologist Frank Lin of the Cochlear Center for Hearing and Public Health, had signed a nondisclosure agreement, and that the rest “can’t comment” for undisclosed reasons. The July 2017 meeting also included neurosurgeon Douglas Smith of the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. The State Department looked to his Penn Center for Brain Injury and Repair, a highly regarded center for the treatment of brain injuries near Washington, DC, where many of the injured diplomats and their families lived, for their extended treatment. “It was good care, they took very good care of us,” the injured diplomat said of UPenn. “They told me, ‘We need to fix you and make you better,’; they would treat us like anyone else who came into their center with our symptoms.” Outside, however, a storm was brewing. On Aug. 9, 2017, in answer to a question from a CBS News correspondent, State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said that some embassy personnel “reported some incidents which have caused a variety of physical symptoms,” and mentioned the expulsion of Cuban diplomats in May. Headlines quickly erupted of “hearing loss” and “brain damage” to diplomats caused by an “acoustic attack,” all suggestions that outside experts have later found questionable. Cuban state television in October 2017 blamed the noises heard by the diplomats in the incidents on cicadas or crickets, something the diplomat interviewed by BuzzFeed News scoffed at. “I’ve heard cicadas before,” she said. “It sounded different.” In September, another injured diplomat who spoke to BuzzFeed News under similar conditions of anonymity was evacuated from Havana ahead of Hurricane Irma, which devastated the island. He had heard a buzzing noise in his home and the sensation of pressure, followed by problems with vertigo. “I fell out of my chair at work,” he said. He was also evaluated at UPenn, and is back at work now in the US, although he still has trouble concentrating. “I don’t function at the level I did before,” he said, and worries about the long-term effects, especially, he said, in light of the US government’s longtime wrangling with war veterans with unexplained illness tied to Agent Orange and Gulf War syndrome.

By the middle of August, according to emails reviewed by BuzzFeed News, Hoffer’s University of Pittsburgh colleague Balaban was corresponding with Smith about collaborating on a study of how UPenn’s brain images of injured diplomats might explain how ultrasound beams could selectively damage a person’s inner ear from a distance.

“Your data will be very important in narrowing down plausible scenarios,” Balaban wrote in an Aug. 20, 2017, email to Smith. Smith was dubious, asking how ultrasound “can go through air and [a] possible glass pane, then the skull, to selectively affect the brain.” Competition to publish research results first is the lifeblood of US scientific process. But for Havana syndrome, this drive pitted the two medical teams against each other in a race to publish in the world’s two most prestigious medical journals, the New England Journal of Medicine and the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). The fastest team, from UPenn, would submit a paper to a journal within a few weeks of looking at the last diplomats in their study. By November 2017, Hoffer and Balaban were drafting a paper on the diplomats that they had seen, which they planned to submit to the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine. That same month, the Food and Drug Administration approved sales by Pittsburgh-based Neuro Kinetics Inc. of the diagnostic goggles that Hoffer used to assess the diplomats’ injuries. Along with his university, Balaban had applied for a patent on the goggles with Neuro Kinetics. They shared the news with Yankaskas, their US Navy ONR grant officer:

BuzzFeed News

“It does not seem imprudent to speculate that a highly specific unidentified energy exposure, perceived as a sound or pressure, could be producing a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) or similar inner ear concussion,” said a December 2017 update of the draft paper, obtained via FOIA request. It compiled symptoms that ranged from ringing ears to foggy thinking to dizziness, all signs of inner ear damage, to come to this conclusion. Such symptoms were hallmarks of the blast damage to the head that the medical team had seen and diagnosed during the Iraq War. Those investigations, too, were not without controversy. The Defense Department’s inspector general in 2011 released a report critical of research that Hoffer and Balaban had conducted on US soldiers at Camp Al Taqaddum, Iraq, who were injured by explosions from 2008 to 2009. “Neurological assessments did not adhere to clinical practice guidelines” for mild traumatic brain injury, the report found. It also said that a “potential financial conflict of interest” in the experimental antioxidant tablets was not revealed to the injured personnel in the study, a research ethics violation. (Hoffer held patents on a method of administering the tablets.) A US Navy representative told Time, “The evidence suggests that no physical harm was caused by the administration of the investigational drug,” after the report came out. To close out 2017, the State Department asked the NIH to investigate the diplomats’ injuries — a move the top Republican and Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee called for on Dec. 5 — with staff members quoted as critical of the medical investigation.

In January 2018, the journal JAMA notified Balaban and Hoffer that the UPenn doctors had submitted their paper and added them as coauthors. The notice led to an angry face-off between Smith and Balaban, who wanted to see the data and delay publication of the JAMA paper. He told Smith he had complained to ethics officials at the University of Pittsburgh, which posed the threat of a scientific misconduct investigation. (University of Pittsburgh’s communications office did not respond when asked if there had been an outcome of that complaint.)



BuzzFeed News “In or out” email from Smith to Balaban, Feb. 9, 2018.

JAMA released the UPenn study online less than a week after Smith told Balaban he was either “in or out,” without him or Hoffer as authors. The study of 21 people, 11 women and 10 men, concluded “they had sustained injury to widespread brain networks,” a constellation of symptoms similar to concussions caused by physical impacts. “Clinically, it’s clear they have suffered some sort of neurological insult. Something happened,” UPenn’s Randel Swanson, the lead author on the study, then told BuzzFeed News.

Other experts weren’t so certain. Neuroimaging expert Arthur Toga of the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California told BuzzFeed News the study was “inconclusive,” noting its MRI results didn’t indicate anything grossly wrong with the diplomats’ brains that corresponded to their symptoms. Neuroscientist Sergio Della Sala of the University of Edinburgh said that the study’s standard for brain damage, seen in only two or three patients, was so loose as to describe roughly 40% of the general population as having brain damage.

“Clinically, it’s clear they have suffered some sort of neurological insult. Something happened.”

The JAMA study authors noted that privacy and secrecy restrictions precluded the release of some of the data about the injured diplomats, noting that only Smith and Swanson were responsible for the data. Nonetheless, they ruled out a viral cause of the injuries, because no one had reported a fever, and called poisoning unlikely to have worked so quickly after the sounds heard by 18 of the 21 patients, some of them on the island for less than 24 hours before reporting symptoms. It also ruled out a mass psychology or “functional” disorders, triggered by everything from whiplash to migraines, because the diplomats wanted to return to work and didn’t show signs of “malingering.” This last conclusion is at odds with how “psychogenic” injuries actually work — people suffer physically from injuries triggered by stress in such cases, often with symptoms like dizziness, headaches, and the others reported in some of the Havana cases. They do not fake injury to get time off work. Despite the presence of neuropsychologists on the UPenn team, the description called into question how well the JAMA study authors had really investigated the possibility of psychology to explain the injuries, medical sociologist Robert Bartholomew, coauthor of Outbreak! The Encyclopedia of Extraordinary Social Behavior, told BuzzFeed News. Four days after the study appeared in JAMA, the State Department’s Rosenfarb gave Balaban and his colleagues authorization to publish their own paper in submission with the New England Journal of Medicine. “My apology for the delay,” said Rosenfarb. They had lost the high-prestige publication race, and the delay hadn’t helped, according to an April 2018 email from Balaban. “An NEJM editor has asked us for rights of a first look before the JAMA paper was published. Our release occurred after the JAMA on-line edition appeared,” he wrote to a University of Pittsburgh publicist planning a news conference with the University of Miami’s medical school on publication of their paper, now under consideration by the journal Frontiers in Neurology. Plans for the press conference included a presentation of the Neuro Kinetics goggles that the paper described as able to uniquely diagnose people with the Havana injuries, as well as setting up advance interviews with the Miami Herald and the New York Times. A draft of the paper in review with Frontiers lists no financial conflicts of interest in the study.

BuzzFeed News A University of Pittsburgh email from Balaban, April 17, 2018.

That seems troublesome to neurologist Mitchell Joseph Valdés-Sosa of the Cuban Neuroscience Center, a leader on a Cuban panel that concluded in 2017 that the injuries were likely caused by mass hysteria. “There could be a conflict of interest, and that could have [led] to confirmation bias,” he told BuzzFeed News by email. “Their hypothesis could have been that they were going to find evidence of vestibular [inner ear] damage, which is what the [Neuro Kinetics] helmet measures.”

In response to this concern, University of Pittsburgh media relations director Joe Miksch told BuzzFeed News by email, “Balaban has not and will not receive any financial benefit from Neuro Kinetics or the sales of the Neuro Kinetics diagnostic goggles, even if the patent is granted.” He did not answer whether Balaban’s employer, the university, which owns intellectual property on the patent and can license the invention, would financially benefit from the goggles. The university has not entered into any license with Neuro Kinetics, according to Miksch. The last report of a US diplomat injured in Havana came one year ago, in May 2018. Cuba’s foreign ministry said the US State Department had informed it that a woman had “reported health symptoms as a result of ‘undefined sounds’ in her place of residence.” That same month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reported that two US diplomats in China reported the same sort of illness “entirely consistent” with the past Cuban cases, prompting the State Department to launch a task force with the Health and Human Services and Energy departments to investigate. (Eventually 15 US diplomats from China would be investigated for such incidents, with the Associated Press later reporting that 14 of them were ruled out from suffering the syndrome, with the 15th inconclusive.) In August, a series of letters critical of the JAMA study were published in that journal, written by a mixture of neurologists critical of the brain damage claims, and experts in “functional” disorders triggered by stress who blasted its dismissal of psychology as an explanation.

“Research with this patient cohort was not originally anticipated due to secrecy and privacy concerns,” Smith and his colleagues said in response to the letters. They restated the criteria for “neuropsychological impairment” and wrote, “we are performing advanced neuroimaging studies of the patient cohort, hoping to identify structural brain changes that may underlie the neurological manifestations.” These studies have still not been published. As mentioned, after asking to see the public records of communications released to BuzzFeed News, Smith did not reply to requests for comment. “I can only vet the (published) cognitive data, and these do not hold water,” Della Sala, the editor of the journal Cortex, told BuzzFeed News by email. “These further explanations made things even worse.” Also unpublished was the submitted Frontiers in Neurology paper by Hoffer’s team. The next appearance of their results instead came in August in talks at a “SOFWERX” Defense Department think tank in Tampa, where Hoffer discussed the injuries suffered by the diplomats. Balaban described the “Frey effect” in his talk, the production of clicking noises in the ears by exposure to microwaves, a phenomenon researched in the 1970s. “So, the ability of radiofrequency to affect the nervous system is real,” he said.

Balaban also touted the Neuro Kinetics goggles at the talk, claiming a 90% ability to tell Havana subjects apart from either blast victims or healthy people. “This is a fieldable technology,” he said.

“The promotion of the silly goggles is a shameless attempt at commercial promotion,” said Cohen, the UCLA neuroscientist. Little more than a week after Hoffer’s Tampa appearance, the New York Times published a story citing the Frey effect and suggesting that microwaves were the prime suspects as the technology that hurt the diplomats, with an endorsement of the idea from UPenn’s Smith. This caused some suspicion on both Hoffer’s and Balaban’s part that their August presentation had been eavesdropped upon and their ideas pilfered (in reality, a University of California, San Diego, news release had touted the idea a few days ahead of the story).

BuzzFeed News Email from Hoffer, Sept. 2, 2018.

“I think State trying to reclaim ownership [is] a strong possibility because we noted that the Penn group (which is a group entirely composed of clinicians) now is convince[d] this is microwaves,” Hoffer wrote in a Sept. 2 note to Balaban and Georgetown University neuroethicist James Giordano, another colleague. “Definitely smacks of what we call ‘Penngazzi’. Lol.” The group discussed arguing for the Office of Naval Research, instead of the State Department, to lead an investigation into a “multi-layer” plethora of various kinds of energy beams causing the Havana injuries. They also discussed dropping a “red herring” as part of a “misinformation” campaign at their next talk, scheduled for later that week at a Pentagon-sponsored teleconference.

(As mentioned, BuzzFeed News has filed a lawsuit with the State Department for public records of Hoffer’s communications on his research.) “There was no misinformation campaign,” Hoffer told BuzzFeed News by email. The “red herring” was a symptom to distinguish real Havana syndrome patients from pretenders, he said. “Indeed, we have seen patients who present themselves as such.”

“Definitely smacks of what we call ‘Penngazzi’. Lol.”

When asked about the context of the email suggesting the State Department was trying to reclaim ownership, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine media relations director Joanna Palmer replied, by email, “Dr. Hoffer has no further comment.” Meanwhile, outside experts threw cold water on microwaves, calling the Frey effect wildly implausible as an explanation for the injuries, since its inner ear clicking noises it caused were far too weak to damage tissues. “Maybe Fidel Castro is subjecting them to an ESP attack from beyond the grave,” said University of Pennsylvania bioengineer Kenneth Foster to BuzzFeed News, when shown the discussion of the “multi-layered” radiation attack idea. Foster, who has no affiliation with UPenn’s medical school team, first described the mechanism behind the clicking effect in 1974, but is dubious it is in play in Cuba. “Unless there is some independent evidence for an exposure of some kind, one could speculate endlessly.” Nevertheless, the Pentagon teleconference received press coverage, noting Balaban’s theory of some confluence of radiation and ultrasound perhaps triggering targeted cavitation in the inner ears of the injured diplomats. “I do not believe that we are close to claiming victory. In fact, I doubt that we can identify ‘the source’ for Cuba,” Balaban wrote to ONR’s Yankaskas in the aftermath of the news coverage. In the outside world, skepticism abounded about both mystery noise-making secret weapons and the diagnoses of the research teams. On Oct. 8, 2018, a neuroscience reporter from another news outlet contacted Yankaskas at ONR, for example, asking whether they could discuss “wildly implausible” ideas that Balaban had presented, and questioned whether he had a “proprietary interest” in the diagnostic goggles. Yankaskas forwarded the interview request to Balaban the same day, writing: “He’s the same reporter that I mentioned this morning.”

President Trump will meet the Irish prime minister — at the airport,https://www.vox.com,['May'],05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.vox.com/world/2019/5/29/18644731/trump-ireland-visit-leo-varadker-shannon-airport,"As part of his big European trip next week, President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with Ireland’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, on Wednesday.

It won’t be a fancy affair, though, because they’re meeting at the airport. Well, the VIP lounge, at least.

As the Washington Post’s Anne Rumsey Gearan reports, Trump wanted to host Varadkar at his golf club and hotel in Doonbeg, in County Clare, Ireland.

The Irish prime minister (known as the taoiseach) declined, reportedly favoring Dromoland Castle Hotel, about 30 miles away, which has hosted US presidents, including George W. Bush.

But Trump must’ve rejected that option, so a more neutral locale has been agreed on: the Shannon airport, also in County Clare.

According to reports, the debate over the visit location threatened to derail the meeting between the two leaders, as Varadkar objected going to Trump’s private club and Trump threatened to just go to his club in Scotland instead, according to the Irish Times.

So the compromise was reached — a place where no one wants to go, the airport.

The New York Times reports that the Shannon airport has hosted international meetings in the past, so even if this is not exactly a fancy state visit, there is some precedent. The other people who probably aren’t thrilled about this are those who will be traveling through the airport during the president’s visit. They’ve been warned to factor in an additional 15 minutes to their travel time (but let’s be honest, it’s probably going to be a way longer delay than that).

And Trump will get a chance to visit his golf course. He’ll travel the following morning to France to attend a D-Day commemoration celebration, and will then return to Doonbeg, in Ireland, to spend the night at his golf club.

Seriously, the president’s bilateral meeting with Irish PM Varadkar is going to take place at the VIP lounge at Shannon. Trump wanted it st his nearby golf club. The Irish said no thanks. So, across from the Duty Free and next to the Irish Coffee bar at the airport. Perfect. — Anne Rumsey Gearan (@agearan) May 29, 2019

Trump hosted Varadkar at the White House this March, but the US president abruptly canceled a visit with the Irish prime minister last November.

Protesters prepared to demonstrate ahead of that November visit, and they’re likely to gather again, something Varadkar himself acknowledged.

“I’d say to them, this is a democracy and peaceful protest is part of democracy,” Varadkar said earlier this month, about possible Trump protests. “And I would certainly never criticize anyone for taking part in a protest if that’s the way they wish to express their views.”

That might be why Trump was eager to decamp for his golf resort in Doonbeg, where the town is expected to drape itself in American flags ahead of his visit.

Trump is visiting the United Kingdom ahead of his visit to Ireland and France, and protests are expected in London ahead of his visit there, too.

The nations on the watchlist have at least $40 billion in bilateral trade goods trade with the US, and meet at least one of three criteria. They have a bilateral trade surplus with the US of at least $20 billion, they run a current account surplus equal to at least 2% of GDP, or they intervene in currency markets with net foreign-exchange purchases of at least 2% of GDP in at least six months of the year.

"States Can’t Block Legal Hemp Shipments Within Their Borders, USDA Says",https://www.marijuanamoment.net,"['Kyle Jaeger', 'Chris Roberts']",05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.marijuanamoment.net/states-cant-block-legal-hemp-shipments-within-their-borders-usda-says/,"The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said on Tuesday that hemp can be transported across state lines—even through states that haven’t enacted laws allowing the crop’s production—and that the descheduling of the plant and its derivatives under the 2018 Farm Bill are already in effect because they are self-executing and do not require further action by federal agencies.

In a four-point legal opinion issued by the agency, USDA specified that hemp has been removed from the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), states and Indian tribes may not prohibit the interstate transportation of lawfully marketed hemp products—including those that fall under the more limited research-focused provisions of the previous 2014 Farm Bill—and that restrictions on participation in the hemp industry apply for individuals with felony drug convictions.

The USDA Office of the General Counsel said that while states and Indian tribes can still control the production of hemp in their respective jurisdictions, interstate commerce must be permitted following the implementation of the agency’s hemp regulations.

In the meantime, before any businesses can begin planting, harvesting and processing hemp crops under the new Farm Bill’s provisions, however, the USDA must first enact implementing regulations and then approve state-submitted regulatory plans.

“It is also important to emphasize that the 2018 Farm Bill does not affect or modify the authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services or Commissioner of Food and Drugs to regulate hemp under applicable U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) laws,” the agency added, perhaps referring to confusion that has surrounded the question of including hemp-derived CBD in food products and dietary supplements. “USDA expects to issue regulations implementing new hemp production authorities in 2019.”

The memo also indicates that people with felony drug convictions—who would otherwise be prohibited from participating in the legal hemp industry for 10 years—are exempted from the ban if their participation began following the passage of the 2014 version of the agriculture legislation but prior to the enactment of the broader 2018 bill.

Another notable aspect of the memo concerns THC derived from hemp.

“Congress has removed hemp from Schedule I and removed it entirely from the CSA,” USDA wrote. “In other words, hemp is no longer a controlled substance. Also, by amending Schedule I to exclude THC in hemp, Congress has likewise removed THC in hemp from the CSA.”

The 2018 Farm Bill definition of hemp stipulates that a cannabis crop must not contain more than 0.3 percent THC to qualify. THC derived from marijuana remains federally prohibited.

The agriculture bill shifted regulatory responsibility for hemp from the Justice Department to USDA. As such, USDA noted in its legal opinion that “this decontrolling of hemp (and THC in hemp) is self-executing.”

“Although the CSA implementing regulations must be updated to reflect the 2018 Farm Bill amendments to the CSA, neither the publication of those updated regulations nor any other action is necessary to execute this removal,” USDA wrote. In other words, the Justice Department doesn’t have to update its guidance on hemp and its derivatives for the policies to be in effect.

These are some of the most concrete updates that the USDA has offered since the 2018 Farm Bill was signed into law in December 2018. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has indicated that his department wouldn’t be expediting the rulemaking process, but he said that hemp regulations would be implemented ahead of the 2020 planting season.

One of the more consequential takeaways from the legal opinion for industry stakeholders concerns interstate transportation of hemp and its derivatives. USDA explained that a provision of the agriculture legislation “preempts State law to the extent that State law prohibits the interstate transportation or shipment of hemp that has been produced in accordance with” the Farm Bill.

Hemp produced under the 2014 version of the bill also qualifies for the interstate transportation protection, USDA further explained.

A separate memo released on Tuesday clarifies that Indian tribes can continue to engage with states that authorize hemp pilot programs for research purposes but that they, unlike states, cannot themselves authorize hemp research programs.

That second memo doesn’t touch on the 2018 version of the bill, but it states that the “law remains unchanged in that Indian tribes, individuals, and entities located in States that do no permit hemp production are ineligible to participate in the growing or cultivation of hemp under the 2014 Farm Bill program.”

Special counsel Robert Mueller: Russia report did not exonerate President Trump,https://www.denverpost.com,"['Eric Tucker', 'Michael Balsamo']",05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.denverpost.com/2019/05/29/robert-mueller-public-statement-wednesday/,"WASHINGTON — Special counsel Robert Mueller said Wednesday he believed he was constitutionally barred from charging President Donald Trump with a crime but pointedly emphasized that his Russia report did not exonerate the president.

“If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so,” Mueller said. “We did not however make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime.”

He cautioned lawmakers who have been negotiating for his public testimony that he would not go beyond his report in the event he appears before Congress. But he also signaled that Congress was the proper venue, not the criminal justice system, for deciding whether action should be taken against the president in connection with allegations that Trump and aides obstructed the investigation of Russian interference to help the Republican in the 2016 election campaign.

Trump, who has repeatedly and falsely claimed that Mueller’s report cleared him of obstruction of justice, modified that contention somewhat shortly after the special counsel’s remarks. He tweeted, “There was insufficient evidence and therefore, in our Country, a person is innocent. The case is closed!”

After the statement, members of Congress also took to social media to voice their opinions.

“[Mueller] said only Congress can hold the president accountable,” U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Denver, tweeted. “That’s why we need to begin our impeachment inquiry now.”

Mueller just said: DOJ rules prohibit him from saying that the president committed a crime – but, if the president HAD NOT COMMITTED A CRIME, HE WOULD SAY SO! He said only Congress can hold the president accountable. That’s why we need to begin our impeachment inquiry NOW. — Rep. Diana DeGette (@RepDianaDeGette) May 29, 2019

Mueller’s comments were his first public statements since his appointment as special counsel two years ago. His remarks, one month after the public release of his report on Russian efforts to help Trump win the presidency, appeared intended to both justify the legitimacy of his investigation against complaints by the president and to explain his decision to not reach a conclusion on whether Trump had obstructed justice.

Indicting Trump, he said firmly, was “not an option” in light of a Justice Department legal opinion that says a sitting president cannot be charged. But, he said, the absence of a conclusion should not be mistaken for an exoneration of the president.

“The opinion says the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing,” Mueller said, referring to the Justice Department legal opinion. That would shift the next move, if any, to Congress, and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, which would investigate further or begin any impeachment effort, commented quickly.

It falls to Congress to respond to the “crimes, lies and other wrongdoing of President Trump – and we will do so,” said New York Rep. Jerrold Nadler.

Trump has blocked the committee’s subpoenas and other efforts to dig into the Trump-Russia issue, insisting Mueller’s report has settled everything.

Mueller’s statement came amid demands for him to testify on Capitol Hill about his findings and tension with Attorney General William Barr over the handling of Mueller’s report.

That report found no criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia to tip the outcome of the 2016 presidential election in Trump’s favor over Democrat Hillary Clinton. But it also did not reach a conclusion on whether the president had obstructed justice.

Barr has said he was surprised Mueller did not reach a conclusion on whether the president had criminally obstructed justice, though Mueller in his report and again in his public statement Wednesday said that he had no choice. Barr decided on his own that the evidence was not sufficient to support an obstruction charge against Trump.

“Under longstanding department policy, a president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office,” Mueller said. “That is unconstitutional. Even if the charge is kept under seal and hidden from public view that, too, is prohibited.”

Mueller, for his part, complained privately to Barr that he believed a four-page letter from the attorney generalsummarizing his main conclusions did not adequately represent his findings.

Mueller also appeared to put Congress on notice that he would not break new ground in the event he testifies on Capitol Hill.

“I do not believe it is appropriate for me to speak further about the investigation or to comment on the actions of the Justice Department before Congress.”

EPA's Fuzzy Math Not Helping Environment or Economy,https://www.realclearpolitics.com,[],05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/05/29/epas_fuzzy_math_not_helping_environment_or_economy_140438.html,"There’s nothing Washington loves better than a false dichotomy. Tax or cut. Spend or slash. Regulate or deregulate. Either you’re for the former or you’re for the latter. Well, that isn’t how life really works, and -- especially when it comes to regulation -- it certainly isn’t how manufacturers think. Everyone wants clean water and clean air, everyone wants an economy that delivers growth and opportunity, and neither idea is in conflict with the other. The challenge is how do we achieve both?

The answer is not to regulate too much or regulate too little, but simply regulate smarter. This is the common-sense idea underpinning a recent policy announcement from the Environmental Protection Agency -- something that manufacturers strongly support and, if fully enacted, something that could have the greatest positive impact on the future of American manufacturing than any other EPA action in recent memory.

Recently, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler (pictured) ordered his agency to develop reforms that would increase consistency and transparency in the consideration of costs and benefits in the EPA rule-making process. This may sound arcane, but it actually matters a lot. There is hardly any trust or balance in the current cost-benefit equation. Nor is there much transparency in the assembly process for rules and regulations that it relies on. For example, when the EPA measured the benefits of its carbon-reducing rules, it used a metric that counted benefits 300 years into the future. Of the 17 rules the EPA issued between 2000 and 2013 that cost $1 billion or more, more than 97% of the benefits claimed were from reductions of a single pollutant (particulate matter), which almost necessarily meant the EPA double-counted benefits from rule to rule.

On the cost side, the EPA regularly avoids a statutory requirement to examine the impact of its regulations on small businesses, even though small firms make up the supply chain of virtually every regulated industry. It has also displayed frustrating inconsistency from rule to rule in terms of the costs it measures. For instance, the agency’s 2010 fuel economy rule measured only the costs and benefits to cars, despite the fact that the rule simultaneously triggered New Source Review permitting requirements for millions of buildings by making greenhouse gases “regulated pollutants.”

In perhaps the most egregious example, the EPA once considered setting a standard for ozone so strict that the controls needed to meet it didn’t exist. In its cost-benefit analysis, the EPA simply called these “unknown controls” and assigned them a modest cost. We measured the true cost of these standards and arrived at a different conclusion: It would have been the most expensive regulation ever.

No one wins when an agency this important is forced to rely on a system this flawed. Overcounting benefits threatens environmental action by eroding trust in what the agency says and puts out. Undercounting costs threatens manufacturers, our economy and the livelihoods of countless middle-class workers and families who obviously bear the brunt when reality eventually sets in (as it inevitability must). No one should want either of these things, and no one should have anything to fear from a serious, reliable and consistent set of standards for measuring costs and benefits into the future. Having reliable data to go on and smarter regulations based off of that data will go a long way toward getting us all closer to the better future that -- in the end -- every American wants. Greener and cleaner. Stronger and more prosperous.

The EPA has done a good job over the years cleaning up the environment, and regulations are a big part of its success. What manufacturers need now is for the agency to get those regulations right the first time. We don’t want zero regulation. We don’t want massive regulation. We just want better regulation. The way to get there is through a smarter and more consistent evaluation of the costs and benefits that they rely on, just as the EPA administrator himself recently proposed. Now, it’s up to the administrator and his team to issue rules fixing this process for good."
George F. Will: Trump’s protectionism is iatrogenic government,https://www.sltrib.com,"['George F. Will', 'The Washington Post']",05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2019/05/30/george-f-will-trumps/,"Washington • The cascading effects of U.S. protectionism on U.S. producers and consumers constitute an ongoing tutorial about what Daniel Patrick Moynihan called “iatrogenic government.” In medicine, an iatrogenic ailment is one inadvertently caused by a physician or medicine. Iatrogenic government — except the damage it currently is doing is not inadvertent — was on display last week.

The Trump administration unveiled a plan to disburse $16 billion to farmers as balm for wounds — predictable and predicted — from the retaliation of other nations, especially China, against U.S. exports in response to the administration’s tariffs. The $16 billion does not need to be approved by Congress because not much that presidents do nowadays needs to be. The president said the sum will be paid for by the billions of dollars the Treasury takes in from China. The evident sincerity of his frequently reiterated belief that exporters to the United States pay the tariffs that U.S. importers and consumers pay is more alarming than mere meretriciousness would be.

The $16 billion is not the first such tranche ($12 billion was disbursed last year) and the $28 billion probably will not be the government's final restitution, using other people's money, for damages it is doing. So, taxpayers who are paying more for imported goods covered by the administration's tariffs (which are taxes Americans pay) are also paying to compensate some other Americans for injuries inflicted on them in response to the tariffs that are injuring the taxpayers.

President Trump, who deserves Winston Churchill's description of U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles (a ""bull ...who carries his china closet with him""), has tweeted that the government could buy $15 billion worth of surplus commodities (for you keeping score at home, that would bring tariff compensation for farmers to $43 billion) from U.S farmers (""@POTUS loves his farmers"") and ship the commodities to developing nations. What could possibly go wrong?

In a masterpiece of understatement, Darci Vetter, President Obama's chief agricultural trade negotiator, told Politico that this could have ""serious market implications"" in recipient countries. Implications such as the devastation of local agriculture, the largest industry in many developing nations.

The administration might be pleased that some non-Chinese companies that manufacture in China are moving production elsewhere to avoid U.S. tariffs on goods from China, thereby slowing that nation’s economy. What could possibly go wrong? Presumably the administration has thought through the consequences of promoting an economic slowdown in the country that buys many U.S. goods — e.g., China is one of Boeing’s biggest customers, and Cadillac sells more cars in China than in America.

Zachary Karabell, an investor writing in The Wall Street Journal, has noted that China is not as vulnerable to U.S. pressure as Japan was in the 1980s, when the U.S. purchased about a third of Japanese exports and supplied about half of its foreign investment and much of its national defense. ""China has a $700 billion trade relationship with the U.S., including imports and exports, but it has a $3 trillion trade relationship with the rest of the world.""

The New York Times recently reported that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a member of an administration that purports to be a dike against a rising tide of socialism, is ""encouraging [U.S.] firms to reorient their supply chains and source their products elsewhere"" — meaning, out of China. Capitalists believe that market signals, not political appointees with political agendas, give satisfactory encouragement for reasonable commercial behaviors.

Today's system is capitalism leavened by cronyism and administered by know-it-alls. What could possibly go wrong? A report by a Federal Reserve researcher and two University of Chicago economists has found that tariffs on washing machines raised their cost by $86 on average — but also raised the prices of dryers by $92 as, The New York Times reports, ""manufacturers of laundry equipment used the tariffs as an opportunity to raise prices on things that were not, in fact, affected by the tariffs."" The tariffs, according to the report, have created about 1,800 American manufacturing jobs, but at a cost of over $817,000 a job.

This is the art of the deal as practiced by him who relishes his self-bestowed sobriquet ""Tariff Man,"" and who explains tariffs this way: ""When people or countries come in to raid the great wealth of our Nation, I want them to pay for the privilege of doing so."" Is that clear? Perhaps not, but this is: Protectionism is yet another example of government being the disease for which it pretends to be the cure.

Treasury Dept. Declines to Label China a Currency Manipulator,https://www.nytimes.com,['Alan Rappeport'],05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/us/politics/treasury-declines-to-label-china-currency-manipulator.html,"In addition, if a country actively intervenes in foreign exchange markets for six out of 12 months, rather than the current eight-month threshold, it will be closer to being flagged for manipulation.

A Treasury Department official said that even with the new thresholds, no country in recent years would have been designated. China meets only one of the thresholds, but the department used its discretion to add it to the watch list because of the size of its trade surplus.

Last week, the Commerce Department proposed a rule change that would allow the United States to expand its ability to penalize countries that manipulate their currencies.

It proposed expanding a type of remedy that is typically used to levy tariffs on products that are determined to be unfairly subsidized by foreign governments. Under the proposed rule, so-called countervailing duties could be imposed when foreign governments “subsidize” their products by weakening their currencies relative to the United States dollar, the department said.

A senior Treasury Department official said the Commerce Department proposal was a separate matter that would not affect how the Treasury executed its designations.

Although the Trump administration has complained about China’s currency practices, the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said during a congressional hearing last week that the weakening of China’s currency would help minimize the impact of Mr. Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods.

As a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump made labeling China a currency manipulator a central plank of his economic policy, promising in his “contract” with American voters that he would direct the secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator in the first 100 days of his presidency."
Minneapolis police 'behind the ball' on years-old Department of Justice report,http://www.startribune.com,"['Libor Jany', 'Libor.Jany Startribune.Com', 'Glen Stubbe', 'Star Tribune']",,,,http://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-police-behind-the-ball-on-years-old-department-of-justice-report/510595072/,"When it comes to policy issues, there’s not much about the Minneapolis Police Department that Chuck Turchick doesn’t know.

So when it appeared that the department was slow to make federal government-recommended changes to how it handles potentially troublesome officers, Turchick, a longtime observer of the city’s police force, started asking questions. Others are doing the same.

More than four years after a Justice Department review of the department’s internal discipline process determined that Minneapolis police practices fell short, officials have yet to reveal which recommendations for improvement have been implemented.

The closest thing to a public answer came at a meeting this month of the Police Conduct Oversight Commission (PCOC), a policy-shaping civilian group whose monthly meetings Turchick regularly attends.

Turchick, who prides himself on being a persistent advocate of department reform, again urged the commission to push for answers about the report. Commissioner Laura Westphal said she asked for a status update earlier this year and was assured by Deputy Police Chief Henry Halvorson, who runs the professional standards bureau, that the department was working to implement the remaining recommendations.

“He agrees and admits that they are behind the ball on getting it properly organized and updating us on it,” said Westphal, one of a handful of commission holdovers from the administration of former Chief Janeé Harteau, who requested the yearlong study amid criticism of the department’s tactics.

Minneapolis Police Chief Janeé Harteau

“That’s the first positive sign that I’ve got since last July,” Turchick responded.

The report in question, released in early 2015 by the U.S. Justice Department’s Office of Justice Programs (OJP), called on the department to rethink its coaching program for officers, expand racial sensitivity training and overhaul its Early Intervention System (EIS) for flagging troubled officers and getting them help before they misbehave.

The 34-page report pointed to five key areas of improvement for the department to consider, ranging from ramping up community knowledge and trust of police oversight to addressing inconsistencies on how officers are coached.

At the time the report was released, Harteau promised a new internal data-based accountability system, replacing an old process that critics long had argued allowed bad cops to slip through the cracks.

Many of the report’s recommendations have already been implemented out of the public’s eye, department spokeswoman Sgt. Darcy Horn said via e-mail.

Harteau, who was ousted as chief in 2017 after then-officer Mohamed Noor fatally shot Justine Ruszczyk Damond, oversaw the overhaul of the EIS, which now uses metrics such as use of force, involvement in a traffic incident and sick time to evaluate officers.

After the report’s release, Harteau applauded its findings as “progressive steps we can take to enhance our community relationships and increase public trust and accountability.”

Acting on the Justice Department’s advice, the Police Department launched a two-week leadership academy for new sergeants and lieutenants, which covers topics ranging from de-escalation tactics to handling a police-involved shooting.

Additionally, the department has beefed up its community relations and communications departments, Horn said.

Still, other changes have taken longer to take hold, Horn said.

After the report’s publication, department officials pledged to establish a new EIS policy — but as of this month, Horn said, those guidelines were still taking shape. Supervisors also still don’t have direct access to information collected about their officers, but they should have it by the end of the year, she said.

Council Member Cam Gordon, who served on the communications subcommittee, says that even though current Chief Medaria Arradondo has implemented many of his predecessor’s reforms, it wouldn’t surprise him if some were either postponed or quietly abandoned. That usually happens when administrations change, he said.

“Maybe they’ve all helped to move us in the right direction slowly, but it’s hard to track what exactly happened,” he said of past reforms, adding that the OJP report only reinforced that impression. “When the chief changed, I’m not sure what kept and what didn’t.”

Imani Jaafar, who was briefly on the police conduct and oversight subcommittee, said she didn’t know whether the group’s recommendations were ever addressed, and if they were, whether that was adequately communicated to the public.

“I do think it just seemed that it was an initiative that Chief Harteau had wanted to move forward, and I haven’t really heard much about [it] at all in the last few years,” said Jaafar, director of the Office of Police Conduct Review. The city board investigates citizen complaints against Minneapolis police.

Others were less surprised by the outcome.

Longtime police critic Spike Moss said he is frustrated by the lack of federal action to enforce the changes.

“There’s no fairness, because they’re the ones who say, ‘We don’t want that investigated, we don’t want that looked at,’ ” said Moss, who was part of a 2003 federal mediation board that called for a host of reforms. “Not one office of any kind is doing something on behalf of us.”

Turchick said he has not yet heard from police officials about their plans.

In an e-mail last fall to Arradondo — on which he copied other department officials, council members and all eight PCOC commissioners — Turchick wondered “whether or how” the proposed changes have been carried out.

“In the short time I did serve on the Police Conduct and Oversight Sub-Committee, some implementation suggestions I had made were approved unanimously,” wrote Turchick, who participated in work groups involved in the report. “But I never heard what happened to those recommendations.”

Clear-cut answers have been hard to come by, Turchick said, although a department spokesman recently e-mailed him to meet to discuss his concerns about the report’s findings.

“I never get a response,” he said in a recent interview. “That is not a good way to build trust in the Police Department, and even city officials.”"
"DOJ agrees to make Mueller court activity public, with some redactions",https://www.cnn.com,['Katelyn Polantz'],05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/28/politics/mueller-court-activity-public/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Justice Department said Tuesday it agrees that a federal court in Washington can make public lists describing potentially hundreds of miscellaneous court actions, like search warrants, used in the Mueller investigation.

The department asked for three weeks to make redactions on ""a few entries"" because of ongoing law enforcement efforts, and a judge said she would give the agency that time.

CNN had asked the court to make the lists public. The unsealing would not necessarily reveal the details of the court filings, but instead give the public a broader overview of how, when and for what Mueller was going to the federal court to gather evidence.

Mueller said in his final report that his team had received almost 800 search, seizure and communications warrants from federal courts in the investigation, yet his office wouldn't give more detail. It's still unknown exactly how many of those were approved by judges in federal court in DC.

Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the DC District Court has shown the government three lists of unknown length that give limited information about these matters. It is possible that the lists will reveal how often Mueller approached technology and communications companies for access to information -- with the targets of many of the warrants not named in these lists.

Emails: EPA Staff Objected To Pared-Down List Of Areas Facing Tougher Smog Regulations,https://www.wpr.org,['Danielle Kaeding'],05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.wpr.org/emails-epa-staff-objected-pared-down-list-areas-facing-tougher-smog-regulations,"Recently released emails show staff with the Environmental Protection Agency objected to limiting areas of southeastern Wisconsin that would fall under tougher standards to reduce ground-level ozone pollution.

In May 2018, the EPA produced a pared-down list of ""non-attainment areas"" or Wisconsin counties that weren’t meeting federal smog regulations. The final list included areas along the shore of Lake Michigan, including parts of Kenosha, Door, Manitowoc, Sheboygan, Milwaukee and Ozaukee counties. A previous version of the list included several other areas including Racine County where Foxconn plans to build its multi-billion dollar manufacturing plant.

Clean Wisconsin filed a federal lawsuit against the EPA over its decision last summer. The environmental group was among those that obtained emails showing staff disagreed with the administration’s findings.

""My background is in ozone chemistry. I do not see a sound technical basis for the areas we are being directed to finalize in Wisconsin,"" said Jennifer Liljegren, EPA physical scientist in an April 11, 2018, email. ""I will need the wordsmithing of the legal and policy experts if we are really going to do this — I am still in disbelief.""

Katie Nekola, general counsel for Clean Wisconsin, said the emails show the science didn’t support changes to the ozone designations.

""We need to go back to the original designations, which are far more protective of the air in Wisconsin and people’s health,"" said Nekola.

Ground-level ozone or smog can form when chemicals from emissions combine with heat and sunlight. Smog can exacerbate respiratory illnesses like asthma, especially in children and older adults.

The original list was met with opposition from the Walker administration and business groups including Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce (WMC).

Scott Manley, senior vice president of government relations for WMC, said the emails show a history of lower lever staff at EPA who are in favor of the ""command and control"" approach to regulation.

""The more communities or the more businesses they can get tangled up in their regulatory spiderweb, the better from their perspective,"" said Manley.

He thinks the EPA’s final decision demonstrates a common-sense approach to ozone regulations. Manley said non-attainment designations make it difficult and very expensive to grow economic development.

""We call an ozone non-attainment designation as an EPA no-grow zone because it’s very difficult to site any new type of manufacturing facility or power plant in one of those areas,"" he said.

A non-attainment designation for Racine County could have meant more expensive requirements for Foxconn to control pollution or offset it.

The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources found in its preliminary determination for a Foxconn construction permit that the company’s facilities would create hundreds of thousands of tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year. Future emissions weren't taken into account as part of the EPA’s analysis.

The EPA has since asked for seven out of the nine counties considered as non-attainment areas to be sent back to the agency for further review. Nekola said it’s unclear what the case will mean for Foxconn.

""I believe Gov. Evers has said he needs to review or would want to review all the permits for Foxconn,"" she said. ""I think once we know what Foxconn is really going to be and what kind of air emissions it’s going to have, I think then we’ll need to take another look at it.""

A spokesman for the agency referred to its recently submitted brief filed in Clean Wisconsin v. EPA. Attorneys for the agency argue the group has shown no evidence that the EPA erred in its decision.

""Faced with voluminous emissions data, sophisticated modeling, and other information, EPA has to decide, for each area it designates, exactly where to draw the boundary between attainment and non-attainment,"" the brief states. ""That in turn requires the agency to analyze all the evidence holistically, often making tough judgment calls about where the weight of that evidence falls.""

Parrot Among Manufacturers Chosen by DoD for U.S Army Recon Drone Program,https://dronelife.com,[],05-29-2019,2019,5,https://dronelife.com/2019/05/29/parrot-among-manufacturers-chosen-by-dod-for-u-s-army-recon-drone-program/,"The U.S. Department of Defense is looking for “eye in the sky” technologies: personal reconnaissance drones that can give soldiers on the battlefield a situational advantage.

In an effort to uncover the next-generation of short-range Reconnaissance drones for the U.S. Army, the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) and the Army’s Maneuver Center of Excellence (MCoE) are investing $11m to identify and prototype new capabilities with commercial manufacturers.

The six chosen companies are based in the U.S, with the notable exception of French manufacturer Parrot. The remaining five are Skydio, Altavian, Teal Drones, Vantage Robotics, and Lumenier.

The solicitation was issued in November 2018, with the funding going towards the development of prototypes that can support soldiers on the ground with a rapidly deployable scouting capability.

There are a few criteria that have been set out by the DIU and the MCoE as part of the solicitation process. These include a flight time of around 30 minutes, a range of up to three kilometres, a weight of three pounds or less, and a time from standard-issue rucksack to launch of less than 2 minutes.

U.S Army looks for homemade solutions

With the obvious exception of Parrot, the ambition here is clearly to develop solutions with companies based in the United States.

It should come as no surprise that industry leader DJI is not taking part in the innovation effort. There are wider issues overshadowing this particular exploration of drone technology.

Last week CNN broke the news that DHS’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has warned that Chinese-manufactured drones pose a “potential risk to an organization’s information.”

Plus, President Trump recently signed an executive order effectively stopping U.S. companies from using telecoms equipment provided by Chinese firm Huawei as an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China continues.

Even though DJI has the tech to provide the required tools to the US Army and has done in the past, it looks as though any dealings with a Chinese manufacturer are off the table. In fact, all commercial off-the-shelf drones were prohibited by the Department of Defense in May last year.

Parrot could well turn out to be the beneficiary. Founder and CEO Henri Seydoux said, “Parrot is proud to have been selected by the Army to work on this highly strategic project. The United States has always been a major market for the Parrot Group, whether it is for our well-known consumer range or our advanced professional offering.

“We have always been at the forefront creating advanced, easy to use, compact and reliable drone-based solutions. We also perfectly understand how small unmanned aircraft, such as the Parrot ANAFI platform, have the potential to become a key part of the defense system.

We look forward to focusing our advanced R&D on meeting the high standards set by the U.S. Army, to integrate drone efficiency in their day to day operations and support the world-leading U.S army.”

As hinted by Seydoux, the ANAFI platform has been designed to be adapted to suit a range of different commercial purposes. The recent ANAFI Thermal would appear to tick most of the U.S Army’s boxes.

Much will depend on the extra capabilities the chosen manufacturers can come up with. It’s easy to imagine a Skydio R1 with a range of new, security-focused skills built on top of its autonomy engine, for example.

"Homeland Security, Guatemala bust illegal immigrant smuggling cartel",https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Stephen Dinan']",05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/may/29/homeland-security-guatemala-bust-illegal-immigrant/,"Homeland Security agents and Guatemalan authorities busted a significant smuggling organization Wednesday, arresting nine people who were involved in transporting thousands of illegal immigrants from across the globe through Latin America and into the U.S.

The bust was the first fruit of a new cooperation agreement signed this week between the U.S. and Guatemala, authorizing the two countries to pool information and resources to go after the smugglers who are fueling the illegal immigrant surge.

Authorities dubbed the operation the Merida organization, after Lidia Fausta Merida-Lopez, whom a Homeland Security official identified as the ringleader. The organization had assets of $10 million, and facilitated smuggling of people from Guatemala, elsewhere in Central America and South America, and even from terrorist-connected countries such as Somalia and Pakistan.

“They’ve moved thousands of people,” the official said. “They’re diverse, they’re connected and linked to narcotics smuggling organizations, they’re truly a transnational criminal organization.”

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan was in Guatemala on Wednesday where he is engaged in meetings with Central American governments, looking to find ways to stop the surge of their people fleeing their countries and headed north.

Earlier this week he inked the cooperation deal with Guatemala, which he said is a geographic “chokepoint” for migration from the south up through Mexico. If the U.S. can stiffen Guatemala’s enforcement, it can cut into the overall flows.

“You’ve got to come through Guatemala, so if we can create a border security situation that’s more robust on the Guatemalan border with Honduras, the Guatemalan border with El Salvador … that’s going to disrupt this cycle,” Mr. McAleenan said.

If successful, that could give the U.S. other options besides relying on Mexico, which U.S. officials say has been an iffy partner, swinging from tough talk to lax enforcement.

The agreement he reached with Guatemala commits the U.S. to helping provide better training, information sharing and support as authorities there try to take down some of the smuggling operations that are siphoning its people away. The agreement does not call for any additional financial assistance for Guatemala, the Homeland Security official said.

He said Homeland Security Investigations agents, who are part of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), began looking into the Merida organization in January, and found it was moving “special interest aliens,” or people from countries outside the ones that usually make up illegal migration to the U.S.

The organization would charge up to $3,500 to smuggle a child into the U.S. and up to $12,500 for adults, depending on where in the U.S. the wanted to reach, and the mode of transportation it took to get them there.

Latin American press accounts said nine of the Merida organization’s 10 leaders were arrested in Wednesday’s operation. Some migrants being held by the organization were also arrested.

Both U.S. and Guatemalan authorities said the organization was set up like a franchise operation, with smugglers able to control different pieces of the methods and routes, and the organizers chiefly facilitating the passage among those operators.

They used word of mouth, their reputation for getting people successfully into the U.S., and sometimes social media to advertise their services.

The nine arrested Wednesday will be prosecuted in Guatemala.

Mr. McAleenan said taking out smuggling organizations will cut into the flow of people headed north.

“Without those organizations migrants can’t move out of the country,” he said

The operation comes as the border crisis remains a heated debate in Washington.

Congress left town last week without a deal on the $4.5 billion emergency spending request President Trump made to provide better care for the record numbers of illegal immigrant children and families streaming into the U.S. each month.

Most of that money is designated for Health and Human Services, which under a law passed by Congress is required to care for unaccompanied alien children (UAC) who arrive at the border. But some of the money is designated for Homeland Security, and would be used to feed and care for the families and children, and to replenish ICE’s detention budget.

Mr. McAleenan said he was “extremely concerned” that Congress hasn’t approved the money.

“The failure to act on that request is frankly unconscionable, and putting children at risk,” he said.

As for ICE, he said it will face “very stark choices” of either releasing more new border crossers, releasing criminals caught in the country’s interior, or slashing money in other accounts to fund ICE’s detention beds.

“I don’t like any of those choices. I prefer that Congress act on the request,” the acting secretary said.

Return of the State Department news briefing,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Carol Morello', 'National Reporter Focusing On Foreign Policy', 'State Department', 'May At Pm']",05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/return-of-the-state-department-news-briefing/2019/05/28/60b804ef-d4d5-4073-b5b0-ee4e370d9a57_story.html,"The State Department spokeswoman was at the lectern again Tuesday, fielding questions from reporters about hot spots causing diplomatic agita.

Morgan Ortagus had some dismissive words for Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and the Iranian regime. She referred questions about a Middle East peace plan to the White House. She called Secretary of State Mike Pompeo “incredibly supportive” of President Trump and his foreign policy agenda.

Nothing Ortagus said was particularly groundbreaking. But the fact she was answering reporters’ questions at all was news in itself.

Ending an intermittent hiatus, the State Department’s regular news briefing is coming back. After a couple of off-camera practice runs such as Tuesday’s, on-camera briefings are expected to resume later this week, possibly as early as Wednesday.

Ortagus has promised to try to answer questions almost every weekday when she is not traveling with Pompeo. That will come as a relief to diplomats posted at embassies around Washington who follow the briefings closely, listening for any admonitions of their government’s transgressions.

The resumption of news briefings also sets the State Department apart in an administration in which many normal practices have been abandoned.

The Defense Department has gone almost a year without a press-secretary briefing, though Kiss frontman Gene Simmons and actor Gerard Butler have both done star turns on the Pentagon podium.

The White House briefing room has been gathering dust since press secretary Sarah Sanders last showed up March 11 for only her second briefing of 2019. Trump has said he directed Sanders “not to bother” with the tradition, calling the press corps rude and inaccurate.

The State Department briefings, a fixture since the Eisenhower administration, have served a small, targeted audience looking for gleanings of a shift in U.S. foreign policy and reaction to events around the world. They amplify the United States’ message, provide guidance to embassies and diplomats in Foggy Bottom and underscore the American belief in transparency even in the case of questions from Tass and Pravda.

The State Department used to brief daily. But in the Trump administration, the timetable shrank to no more than twice a week, and often less.

Robert Palladino, the deputy spokesman, held the last briefing on April 11. That was barely a week after Ortagus was named as a replacement for Heather Nauert.

Ortagus is a Navy Reserve officer who was the spokeswoman for the U.S. Agency for International Development during the George W. Bush administration and worked in public diplomacy in Baghdad. She was an intelligence analyst and most recently a contributor on Fox News.

Ortagus describes herself as a foreign policy wonk who watched the televised State Department briefings when she was in college and had a printout portrait of former secretary Condoleezza Rice on her dorm-room wall.

In recent months, State Department officials have tried to “widen the aperture” of news organizations that cover Pompeo’s diplomacy, as Palladino was overheard telling a Christian broadcaster he invited to a briefing last month. They have invited reporters from Breitbart and the conservative website Townhall to accompany them on overseas trips while limiting the number of seats available to other media outlets."
Watchdog group requests ethics probe for head of EPA's air office,https://thehill.com,[],05-29-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/446032-watchdog-group-requests-ethics-probe-for-head-of-epas-air-office,"A government watchdog group on Wednesday requested an investigation into the head of the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) air office, arguing the Trump appointee violated an ethics pledge by meeting with former clients.

Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) filed a complaint against Bill Wehrum, a former lobbyist who returned to the EPA during the Trump administration to fill the same role he held under former President George W. Bush.

CREW argues in its complaint that Wehrum failed to get any of the necessary ethics waivers before taking such meetings and that his explanations for doing so “misconstrues the requirements of the ethics pledge and fails to address the distinct recusal obligations under his ethics agreement.”

“Mr. Wehrum seems not to appreciate that his recusal is intended to protect against representatives of special interests trading on their relationships with him to gain special access to the levers of power that affect all Americans,” the group wrote in the letter.

EPA’s Office of Inspector General said they have received the complaint and will review it.

James Hewitt, an EPA spokesman, said the CREW letter “repeats previous allegations that has been made public by the press. Mr. Wehrum has pledged to work with ethics officials to continue ensure compliance going forward.”

Wehrum has been dogged by reports that he met with former clients from his work as a lobbyist for Hunton & Williams LLP, from giving a talk at the firm after joining the administration to working on a policy memo that stood to benefit a former utility client.

Democrats have requested similar probes into Wehrum: one would look at Wehrum’s involvement in a memo that reversed the EPA’s position in litigation against DTE Energy Company, which was represented by Hunton, and another would investigate Wehrum’s ethics and recusal obligations more broadly.

“The Office of Air and Radiation’s agenda appears remarkably similar to the substantive agenda,” of several utilities, a trio of House Democrats wrote in a request to the inspector general in April.

EPA has repeatedly said that Wehrum has recused himself from all matters where DTE is a party, though the allegations against Wehrum involve a number of other utilities.

Other EPA officials have also been flagged for investigation by Democratic lawmakers. Earlier this month, three Senate Democrats requested an investigation into Elizabeth ""Tate"" Bennett, arguing she violated her ethics pledge."

Harris was asked about her plans for healthcare reform during a televised town hall in South Carolina. She responded by reiterating her belief that access to healthcare should be a ""right"" and how she's been a proud supporter of Medicare For All.

She then knocked the skeptics who question whether they'd be able to keep their doctor under Medicare For All, which she admitted was an ""understandable point.""

""Well 91% of the doctors in the United States are in the Medicare system, so the odds-on favorite is that you will be able to keep your doctor,"" Harris said.

The senator's remarks resemble the assurances President Obama gave while promoting the Affordable Care Act, where he told Americans that ""If you like your health care plan, you can keep it,"" something Politifact declared as ""Lie of the Year"" in 2013.

MSNBC host Lawrence O'Donnell later pressed Harris on which Medicare For All proposals would she sign as president.

""Mandatory Medicare for everyone,"" O'Donnell said.

""For everyone,"" Harris responded.

""So that does mean giving up their current private healthcare plans,"" O'Donnell followed.

""No, but they would be entitled to receive and have basically supplemental insurance, but under Medicare For All and my vision for Medicare For All, we would expand the coverage of Medicare so it would include dental, it would vision for our seniors, it would include hearing aids, which are so expensive,"" Harris continued. ""The goal is that everyone is going to be in the same system."""
"State Street Subsidiary Violated Iranian Sanctions, Treasury Says",https://www.wsj.com,"['Mengqi Sun', 'Mengqi.Sun Wsj.Com']",,,,https://www.wsj.com/articles/state-street-subsidiary-violated-iranian-sanctions-treasury-says-11559074674,"A subsidiary of State Street Corp. violated Iranian transactions and sanctions regulations, the Treasury Department said Tuesday, but the government stopped short of issuing a monetary penalty.

The Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control said custodian bank State Street Bank & Trust Co. violated U.S. Iranian sanctions regulations by processing payments on behalf of a person in Iran.

State Street Bank, acting as a trustee for a customer’s employee retirement plan, processed at least 45 pension payments totaling more than $11,000 to a plan participant between 2012 and 2015, OFAC said. The person was a U.S. citizen with a U.S. bank account but was residing in Iran, according to OFAC.

The bank disclosed the violations and subsequently improved its compliance program, OFAC said in explaining its decision to not impose a monetary penalty.

“We take our [anti-money-laundering] and sanctions responsibilities seriously and we have cooperated fully with OFAC throughout the process,” State Street said in a statement Tuesday. “In the four years since we reported this issue, we have made a number of enhancements to our global sanctions compliance program.”

OFAC said the bank’s internal system indicated the payment recipient’s address was in Tehran, Iran, and that the unit that oversaw payments related to the retirement plan used its own sanctions-screening filter, instead of the bank’s centralized screening system, according to the enforcement order.

The screening software raised alerts on about 45 transactions because of the Iranian address, OFAC said, and the alerts were escalated to the compliance staff for the servicing unit, rather than the bank’s specialized sanctions compliance staff. The servicing unit’s compliance staff reviewed and approved the 45 distribution payments, according to the enforcement order.

Payments from the business unit now go through the bank’s central screening system, and alerts are escalated and reviewed by the bank’s central compliance unit, OFAC said.

The enforcement comes weeks after the regulator issued guidance on expectations for sanctions compliance programs. The guidance is part of a Treasury effort aimed at improving transparency around the department’s evaluation and resolution process.

"Former Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano sees many dangers, but not from migrants",https://www.azcentral.com,"['Ronald Hansen', 'Published A.M. Mt May']",05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2019/05/29/former-governor-janet-napolitano-sees-threats-us-not-migrants-homeland-security-trump-administration/1266073001/,"CLOSE

Guns, cyberwarfare and climate change currently pose the biggest threats to the U.S., not undocumented immigrants, said Janet Napolitano, the former secretary of Homeland Security and former Arizona governor.

""If you watch the news today, you would think the Department of Homeland Security was really the Department of the Southwest Border because that's all it does,"" Napolitano told about 250 people Tuesday night at the Madison Center for the Arts in Phoenix. ""In terms of evaluating what risks really affect the security and safety of Americans, I would not put the southwest border on the list. It's not a threat to the safety of Americans.""

Napolitano, a Democrat who served in President Barack Obama's Cabinet, outlined a politically charged message of her new book, ""How Safe Are We? Homeland Security Since 9/11,"" which seems to run counter to President Donald Trump's central concern of tightening security along the nation's southern border.

During an hour-long talk led by Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego, Napolitano said that, in some ways, the nation is safer than it once was, such as in preventing the specific kind of attack terrorists used in 2001 in New York, Virginia and Pennsylvania.

For more stories that matter, subscribe to azcentral.com.

But the nation remains ""woefully ill-prepared"" on other threats, she said.

Napolitano acknowledged few consider climate change a homeland security issue.

She said the more extreme weather it brings, from wildfires to tornadoes and hurricanes, kill people and destroy property. Additionally, it fuels drought, disease and discord in other parts of the world, such as Syria and Yemen, which can breed terrorist threats, she said.

""That's another connection between global warming and homeland security,"" Napolitano said.

The United States treats mass killings by gunfire as a law-enforcement issue, she said but doesn't adequately explore the public-health implications of such violence.

And the nation has done almost nothing meaningful to prevent cyberattacks, most notably including Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, Napolitano said.

""Our nation's critical infrastructure — our utilities, our telecommunications, our banks, our water systems, our traffic systems — are all linked. And they're all susceptible to hacking,"" she said. ""This country is still woefully ill-prepared to protect itself and its critical infrastructure.""

Asked by an audience member about the increases in migrants entering the nation from points in California and Arizona, Napolitano took a swipe at the Trump administration's former practice of separating migrant families, which was halted after a public outcry.

""I think that the whole family-separation debacle was government malpractice at every level,"" she said.

The problem, according to Napolitano, began with a legal decision to charge people apprehended at the border as criminals, taking the matter from Homeland Security, which routinely handles such cases, and put it in the hands of agencies like the Bureau of Prisons, which doesn't accommodate families.

Doing so, she said, required the additional intervention of the Department of Health and Human Services as well.

""It was a wrong policy and it was contrary to our values the way that happened,"" Napolitano said. ""I'm glad that it seems to have stopped.""

Napolitano, the president of the University of California, was twice elected governor of Arizona in 2002 and 2006. She left the post in 2009 to serve as Obama's first Homeland Security chief. She left that position for her current job in 2013.

Napolitano has touted the presidential prospects for former Vice President Joe Biden, whom she recently described on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" as the kind of Democrat who could win in a traditionally Republican-leaning state such as Arizona. Western Democrats are a different breed than East Coast Democrats, she said.

""I’m not surprised Vice President Biden has come out of the gates so strongly because I do believe within the Democratic Party there is a core, a core of what I think of as kind of pragmatic progressives who want the country to be working in a more united fashion,"" Napolitano said.

""They’re very conscious and supportive of civil rights, women's rights and human rights, but also kind of skeptical of some of the ideas coming from the far left.""

CoreLogic Counsel Leaves Amid Federal Antitrust Inquiry,https://therealdeal.com,['Kevin Rebong'],05-29-2019,2019,5,https://therealdeal.com/national/2019/05/29/corelogics-chief-counsel-is-leaving-the-company-as-it-deals-with-a-doj-inquiry/,"The move comes a week after the US Department of Justice demanded the multiple listings service vendor hands over its data

The chief legal officer at CoreLogic, the multiple listings service vendor and housing analytics firm, is leaving the company as it handles an inquiry by the U.S. Justice Department into multiple listings services.

In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said Arnold Pinkston had “accepted another professional opportunity” and would leave the company June 14 and that his departure is “not the result of any disagreements with the company.”

Last week, CoreLogic notified clients of a request by the U.S. Department of Justice for MLS data relating to buyer broker commissions and its policy language around the appropriate handling of the data.

Multiple listings service vendors and major residential brokerages have received increasing scrutiny for antitrust concerns in recent months following a class action lawsuit filed by homesellers. The lawsuit was filed last year against the “big four” national residential brokerage companies Realogy, Re/MAX, HomeServices of America and Keller Williams, as well as the National Association of Realtors. It alleges the brokerages conspired with the industry group to determine buyer agents’ compensation by introducing rules that require all brokers to offer buyer broker compensation when listing a property on a MLS. As a result, the homesellers allege this has driven up costs to the seller and stifled competition.

CoreLogic was targeted in a separate lawsuit earlier this month in Texas, where the Austin Board of Realtors have accused the firm of selling home sale data to a local appraisal organization."
"Klobuchar, in Iowa, calls for changes to EPA ethanol rules",https://thehill.com,[],05-28-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/445763-klobuchar-in-iowa-calls-for-changes-to-epa-ethanol-rules,"Sen. Amy Klobuchar Amy Jean KlobucharThe narratives of the Democratic presidential candidates The Hill's 12:30 Report: Mueller breaks silence in surprise statement The Memo: Huge Democratic field boosts Biden MORE (D-Minn.), a 2020 presidential candidate, is proposing changes to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) biofuel regulations that could help her win over support in Iowa.

Speaking at a campaign stop over the weekend in Iowa, the country's top corn producer, Klobuchar called for the EPA to give away fewer of its waivers that allow oil refineries to avoid mixing their fuel with ethanol, according to Reuters.

ADVERTISEMENT

The waivers, aimed at helping small refineries meet fuel standards, exempt some refineries from the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which requires oil refiners to blend ethanol with their gasoline pool or purchase credits from refiners that do.

Smaller refineries with a capacity of less than 75,000 barrels per day can obtain a waiver after proving that complying with the rule could cause financial stress. But ethanol groups and politicians representing corn-producing states have long called for the EPA to reconsider how it grants the waivers.

Klobuchar called the EPA’s waivers “misguided” and said the biofuels trading market is manipulated by financial institutions, according to Reuters.

She called for new compliance standards and oversight, a stance likely to drum up support from ethanol groups and leaders in Iowa, a key battleground state in the 2020 race.

Ethanol makers have long argued that too many companies qualify for waivers and that the process is not transparent. While the Trump administration has voiced support for the ethanol industry’s plea to extend the use of gas mixed with 15 percent ethanol year-round, it has also made extensive use of small refinery waivers. Even major companies like Exxon Mobil Corp received exemptions for certain facilities."

"Edmund Morris, acclaimed presidential biographer of Roosevelt and Reagan, has died at 78",https://www.cbsnews.com,['Brian Pascus'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/edmund-morris-died-acclaimed-biographer-presidents-theodore-roosevelt-ronald-reagan-dead-age-78/,"Edmund Morris, the famed author who wrote acclaimed presidential biographies of Theodore Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan, died Friday in Danbury, Connecticut, according to The New York Times. The cause of death was not disclosed, though The Times did report the 78-year-old was at a hospital following a stroke he suffered Thursday.

Morris was a true master of biographical literature. He won the 1980 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography and the 1980 National Book Award for biography for his first book, ""The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt."" The book was the first in a trilogy of works exploring the 26th president's life, the others being ""Theodore Rex,"" published in 2001 and ""Colonel Roosevelt,"" published in 2010.

Edmund Morris, author of ""Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan,"" poses at Random House in New York, Wednesday, Sept. 29, 1999. Morris said he welcomes the controversy over the literary technique he uses in the biography, in which he makes himself a fictional character in Reagan's early life and invents a few other people, too. (AP Photo/Marty Lederhandler) MARTY LEDERHANDLER

In 1999, he published his most controversial work, ""Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan,"" an authorized biography written in an experimental style. Starting in 1985, Morris had been granted ""fly-on-the-wall"" privileges by the Reagan White House, allowing him to interview the President and First Lady and their children. He wrote the biography to include a fictional Edmund Morris who was added to the narrative as an observer and one of Reagan's childhood friends. Within the book, the fictional Edmund Morris told the story of the 40th president's life from his childhood in Illinois to the White House. While some praised the book, others were not so kind.

Morris was born May 27, 1940 in Nairobi, Kenya, the son of South African parents. He married Sylvia Jukes Morris in 1968. According to the author's Penguin Random House biography page, Morris worked as an advertising copywriter in London before immigrating to the United States in 1968. His other biographies included a work on Ludwig von Beethoven titled ""Beethoven: The Universal Composer"" as well as a collection of essays.

According to The New York Times, he is survived by his wife, a brother, Eric and a sister, Judy Davidowitz."
"State Department calls Russian, Syrian airstrikes a 'reckless escalation'",https://thehill.com,[],05-28-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/international/middle-east-north-africa/445802-state-department-calls-russian-syrian,"The State Department on Tuesday called recent Russian and Syrian government airstrikes in northwest Syria a “reckless escalation” as Syrian president Bashar Assad seeks to oust rebels from the country’s Idlib province.

“Indiscriminate attacks on civilians and public infrastructure such as schools, markets and hospitals is a reckless escalation of the conflict and is unacceptable,” State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said.

“The violence must end,” she added.

Recent government airstrikes, backed by Assad’s allies in Moscow, have uprooted more than 300,000 people and killed 229 civilians, according to the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations.

The statement came nearly a week after the State Department said it had seen signs that Assad may have renewed his use of chemical weapons in northwest Syria, warning Damascus of a quick response if such an attack were proved.

Idlib is home to thousands of anti-government fighters and has been a focal point of clashes as Assad seeks to wipe out any remaining opposition to his government.

Syria's civil war first began in 2011 and has left hundreds of thousands of civilians dead and forced millions of Syrians to flee violence.

The United States Department of Justice, whose mission is to enforce the law and administer justice (however elusive) is meddling in an antitrust case in which a federal judge struck down the core of dominant wireless chip maker Qualcomm’s business model.

The landmark ruling issued earlier this month by U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh prohibits Qualcomm from cutting exclusive licensing deals. Judge Koh also decided Qualcomm must make key modem chip IP available under license to its chip rivals. The ruling comes as the rollout of 5G wireless technology emerges as a national security cause célèbre for the Trump administration that has effectively blacklisted 5G first-mover and modem chip also-ran Huawei.

“There is a sufficient likelihood that Qualcomm will hold monopoly power in the 5G modem chip market such that exclusive dealing agreements for the supply of modem chips could foreclose competition in that emerging market,” Judge Koh wrote.

Judge Lucy Koh is being pressured by the feds.

The Justice Department inappropriately sought to sway Koh’s ruling when it undertook the unusual and highly political step of filing a “statement of interest” that constitutes another shot across the bow of an independent American judiciary. Judge Koh was essentially being pressured to think twice before ruling against Qualcomm, which few would dispute has a stranglehold in the 5G modem chip market.

Not even mighty Intel Corp. is willing to take on Qualcomm in the 5G silicon race, exiting the market as soon as Qualcomm settled a cellular patent dispute with Apple last month. (Judge Koh’s ruling invalidates that deal.)

There was a time in conservative economic theory when the government kept its paws off of emerging markets. In those days, the government dared not pick “winners and losers.” Just as what is left of the Republican Party in the Trump era no longer cares about federal budget deficits, the bedrock principle of not favoring one corporation or technology over another has gone the way of the dodo bird.

It is widely assumed DoJ will keep up the pressure on Judge Koh to go easy on Qualcomm, citing U.S. national security concerns as the Trump Administration continues to target 5G competitor Huawei. In so doing, it reinforces a troubling pattern by politicizing the administration of justice. Mark A. Lemley, a law professor at Stanford University, hardly a bastion of antitrust fervor, told our Rick Merritt: “This is a very surprising move by the DOJ. It is extremely rare for them to interfere in the Federal Trade Commission’s cases.”

Back in the 1990s, we interviewed Huawei officials at its sprawling headquarters in Shenzhen. At the time, there was growing suspicion that Huawei had pilfered key networking technologies from its U.S. partner Cisco Systems. During our interview, Huawei managers sized us up, sticking with strictly technical subjects and the marketing spiels they had just learned to master.

Finally, we asked about the Cisco allegations. Interview over!

Huawei’s unwillingness to even address the IP theft issue was telling. We had hit a raw nerve. As the Trump administration targets Huawei, one cannot help but think the country standing for free enterprise and unprecedented technological innovation is behaving in much the same way as those Huawei bosses.

Justice Department meddling in the Federal Trade Commission case against Qualcomm isn’t just troubling. It threatens to undermine the rule of law and the principle of an independent judiciary.

From an antitrust standpoint, FTC actions are often about changing corporate behavior. A decade ago, Intel wisely settled when the agency alleged anticompetitive behavior. The chip maker moved on and the processor market continued to thrive.

Qualcomm can appeal Judge Koh’s ruling, as it promises to do. Fine. That’s how our judicial system works. Meantime, the Justice Department should butt out and let justice takes its course.

"USDA spotlights high antibiotic use in pigs, cattle",http://www.cidrap.umn.edu,[],,,,http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/05/usda-spotlights-high-antibiotic-use-pigs-cattle,"Two new reports from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) provide a sense of the extent of antibiotic use and stewardship among US livestock producers.

The two reports from the USDA's National Animal Health Monitoring System examine how antibiotics were used on beef feedlots and large swine operations in 2016. That was the last year before the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) implemented a new policy preventing use of medically important antibiotics for growth promotion in food-producing animals and requiring veterinary oversight for the use of medically important antibiotics.

The data from the two reports show that 87.5% of feedlots and 95.5% of swine operations gave cattle and pigs any antibiotics in feed, water, or by injection in 2016. Just over 90% of swine operations gave pigs medically important antibiotics, while 56% of feedlots used medically important antibiotics.

""These numbers clearly show that there is a fair amount of antibiotic use in livestock,"" Karin Hoelzer, PhD, DVM, a senior officer with the Pew Charitable Trusts' antibiotic resistance project, told CIDRAP News. ""Having such widespread reliance on antibiotics is concerning.""

Respiratory conditions often targeted

While the numbers aren't necessarily surprising, the two reports are important because they provide much needed data on antibiotic use in livestock production that, up until now, hasn't been available. The FDA issues a yearly report on the sales and distribution of medically important antibiotics for use in food-producing animals, but that report provides no information on how and why those antibiotics are used, or how they were administered.

""These reports really give deeper insight into how and why antibiotics are used in US agriculture,"" Hoelzer said. ""They also look at stewardship practices, such as how decisions about whether to treat and how to treat are made, how farmers are accessing veterinarians and veterinary care, and where farmers are getting antibiotics.""

The data, which came from 199 swine operations and 378 feedlots, show that most swine sites (98%) and feedlots (85%) had a relationship with their veterinarian. According to the swine report, in 87% and 91% of farms that gave antibiotics to pigs in feed, a veterinarian decided when to use antibiotics, and which antibiotics to use. The numbers were similar for those farms that gave antibiotics in water.

By comparison, veterinarians were involved in the decision to give antibiotics to cattle only between 25% and 37% of the time, depending on the route of administration.

Hoelzer said she found the reasons farmers use antibiotics in swine and cattle to be among the most important takeaways from the two reports. In both feedlots and swine operation, the reports found that the primary reason for antibiotic use was to prevent, control, or treat respiratory diseases. Treatment of diarrhea was also a common reason for antibiotic use in pigs. Nearly a third of beef feedlots (29%) and 13% of swine operations were using antibiotics for growth promotion.

""On the positive side, these reports start to give us an idea of what these underlying conditions are, and what needs to be addressed to reduce that use,"" Hoelzer said.

In pigs, gentamicin, neomycin, oxytetracycline, and penicillin G were among the most frequently used medically important antibiotics. Chlortetracycline was the most commonly used medically important antibiotic on beef feedlots.

Hoelzer also said the reported use of injectable antibiotics was noteworthy, because the FDA policy applies only to antibiotics used in feed or water. That means farmers don't need a prescription from a veterinarian to use them. Nearly 90% of swine sites reported giving antibiotics by injection, while 80% of feedlots gave injectable antibiotics to individual sick cattle and 14.8% gave injectable antibiotics to groups of cattle. Large feedlots with more than 1,000 cattle were more likely than small feedlots to give antibiotics by injection.

According to the FDA, roughly 95% of medically important antibiotics used in water and feed require veterinary supervision. The remaining 5% are mostly injectable antibiotics.

""Injectable products were not affected by the FDA's policy changes, so a lot of them are still available over the counter, even medically important ones,"" Hoelzer said. ""These reports provide some information not only on how many operations are using injectable antibiotics—which is quite a lot—but how many are using them in groups of animals.

""That shows how important it is to get these products under veterinary oversight,"" she added.

Call for even more data

So far, the FDA policy changes appear to be having some impact on sales of medically important antibiotics to farmers. According to the most recent FDA report, the sale of medically important antibiotics for use in food-producing animals fell by 33% from 2016 through 2017, and by 43% since sales peaked in 2015.

But critics have called for the FDA to do more to reduce the use of medically important antibiotics on farms. Requiring veterinary oversight for use of all injectable antibiotics is just one of the additional steps that experts like Hoelzer would like to see the FDA take. Another is a limit on how long antibiotics can be used in feed and water. In addition, critics remain concerned that while medically important antibiotics are no longer allowed for growth promotion, they're still being widely used for disease prevention in food-animals.

The USDA says the reports will provide a baseline to compare how antibiotic use in animal production has changed since the FDA rules went into effect, and enable livestock industries to assess which stewardship measures are being successfully implemented.

For her part, Hoelzer would like to see more data. She pointed to the lack detail on how long farmers are using antibiotics in their animals, and what fraction of animals on each farm are being treated with antibiotics. She would also like to know how many farmers are using alternative treatment options farmers are using to minimize antibiotic use.

""This is a step in the right direction, but we clearly need more data,"" Hoelzer said.

"Trump EPA backs away from smog breaks for Foxconn, Indiana steel mills",https://www.chicagotribune.com,['Michael Hawthorne'],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-met-foxconn-indiana-smog-trump-epa-20190516-story.html,"When the Trump administration exempted parts of the Chicago area last year from federal limits on lung-damaging smog, it delivered a huge financial break to steel mills, chemical plants and other industries that are some of the region’s biggest polluters.

Scott Pruitt, who at the time headed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, also freed the Foxconn Technology Group from spending millions of dollars on pollution-control equipment as it builds a new electronics plant in southeast Wisconsin, just north of the Illinois border in an area with some of the region’s dirtiest air.

But faced with a legal challenge from environmental groups and a coalition of cities and states, including Chicago and Illinois, federal lawyers are having second thoughts about Pruitt’s controversial decision.

In a few densely worded paragraphs buried at the end of a 63-page document, attorneys for the EPA and Justice Department asked a federal appeals court this month for what, in legal terms, amounts to a do-over.

Administration officials aren’t admitting they did anything wrong, the lawyers contend. But they can see EPA data showing the region’s smog problems are getting worse, not better, and that polluters in four counties singled out by Pruitt for special treatment are contributing to chronically dirty air breathed by millions of people.

The court shouldn’t rule against the Trump administration, the lawyers pleaded. Rather, they said, it “could benefit from additional explanations” and the EPA could end up revising its designations.

“These federal attorneys looked at the record, relied on their professional judgment and realized there isn’t any evidence to justify Pruitt’s last-minute switcheroo,” said Howard Learner, executive director of the Environmental Law and Policy Center, one of the nonprofit groups that sued to overturn the EPA’s smog designations in Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin.

By dramatically reducing the size of areas required to crack down on dirty air, Pruitt overruled the agency’s career scientists, a move that saved Foxconn and other polluters from either installing more effective pollution-control equipment, scaling back production to reduce emissions or brokering costly trading agreements with cleaner industries.

Other beneficiaries included then-Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican who made Foxconn the centerpiece of his 2018 re-election campaign. Walker already had wooed the company to Racine County with $3 billion in financial incentives, promises to relax state environmental laws and access to Lake Michigan water.

Walker, who ended up losing to Democrat Tony Evers in November, blamed Chicago for making the air unhealthy to breathe in Wisconsin. But an EPA staff analysis concluded Wisconsin is at least partially responsible for its own smog problems, and documents filed with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources show Foxconn will be a major new source of smog-forming pollution.

Newly released emails show EPA scientists strongly objected to Pruitt’s decision, which they said could not be supported with data despite political pressure from Trump administration officials and then-House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican. The emails were obtained Friday by the Sierra Club and Clean Wisconsin as part of a federal public records request.

“I do not see a sound technical basis for the areas we are being directed to finalize in Wisconsin,” Jennifer Liljegren, an EPA scientist, wrote to colleagues in an April 11, 2018, email. “I will need the wordsmithing of the legal and policy experts if we are really going to do this — I am still in disbelief.”

One of the recipients of that email, EPA scientist Lars Perlmutt, replied, “I have a background in air pollution health effects and more specifically on acute exposures, so for me personally, this is hard to digest and support.”

Another email from Liljegren concluded that Wisconsin polluters are responsible for up to 15 percent of the smog detected by air quality monitors — enough to register violations in all of the areas exempted by Pruitt.

Smog, also known as ground-level ozone, is formed by a reaction between sunlight and pollution from car tailpipes, power plants and factories, fumes from volatile solvents and gasoline vapors. After a scientific review required every five years by the federal Clean Air Act, the Obama EPA tightened the national smog standard in 2015 to 70 parts per billion, down from the 75 ppb limit set during the Bush administration.

Average smog concentrations in the counties at issue exceeded the new federal limit during the past three years, according to monitoring data. In Racine County, for instance, smog levels peaked at 90 ppb last year and averaged 78 ppb between 2016 and 2018, even without Foxconn operating.

More perplexing is Pruitt’s reversal of the EPA staff designation for northwest suburban McHenry County.

Unlike Wisconsin officials, who under Walker insisted the state’s air was clean enough to pass muster, the Illinois EPA had repeatedly included McHenry in its lists of areas required to take additional smog-fighting measures. Monitoring data supports that decision: Smog concentrations in McHenry averaged 72 ppb between 2016 and 2018 and peaked at 77 ppb last year.

But Alec Messina, a former industry lobbyist who headed the state agency under Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, abruptly reversed course after phone conversations with Clint Woods, a top Pruitt aide."
