3 Million Could Lose Food Stamp Benefits Under Trump Administration Proposal,https://www.npr.org,['Pam Fessler'],07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/2019/07/23/744451246/3-million-could-lose-food-stamp-benefits-under-trump-administration-proposal,"3 Million Could Lose Food Stamp Benefits Under Trump Administration Proposal

The Trump administration wants to change the way states determine who qualifies for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits, also known as food stamps. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that 3 million people would lose their food assistance as a result.

The administration says it wants to close what it calls a ""loophole"" that allows states to give benefits to those who would not otherwise be eligible by raising or eliminating income and asset limits. Forty states and Washington, D.C., now take advantage of this option and have done so for many years.

""This proposal will not only save money, but more importantly it preserves the integrity of the program while ensuring nutrition assistance programs serve those most in need,"" Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in announcing the proposed rule, published in the Federal Register. His agency estimates the change would likely save $2.5 billion a year.

But proponents of the current system say it helps low-income families who work but have huge child care, housing and other expenses that leave them with insufficient money to buy food. States now have the flexibility to not cut off benefits as soon as a family's gross income exceeds a certain level, but to more slowly phase out the food aid. The current program also automatically qualifies 265,000 schoolchildren for free lunches. Under the administration's proposal, those children would have to apply separately to continue to get those meals.

""This rule would take food away from families, prevent children from getting school meals, and make it harder for states to administer food assistance,"" said Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, the ranking member on the Senate Agriculture Committee. Stabenow noted that Congress refused to include the proposal in last year's farm bill.

""This proposal is yet another attempt by this administration to circumvent Congress and make harmful changes to nutrition assistance that have been repeatedly rejected on a bipartisan basis,"" she said.

The proposed rule change is one of several the administration has made or is considering that restricts safety net programs for low-income individuals and families.

The public has 60 days to comment on the proposal and opposition is expected to be fierce. Anti-poverty groups see it as part of a much broader campaign by the Trump administration to push people off government aid even as they continue to face financial struggles. The change would likely face a legal challenge if it goes into effect.

Right now, the law sets a gross income cap of 130% of the poverty line for SNAP recipients — about $33,000 for a family of four. But states use something called ""broad-based categorical eligibility"" to allow families getting other assistance to receive some SNAP benefits even if their incomes are as high as 200% of the poverty level, as long as they have other expenses that cut their net incomes below a certain level. States like the option because it gives them more flexibility to help families that have fluctuating incomes and still have trouble buying food.

""These are working families who are just above SNAP's income cutoff,"" said Stacy Dean, vice president for food assistance policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. ""What the [current system] does is say to workers that if you want to work a few more hours, you don't risk losing SNAP because you take the extra shift. So it's promoting work.""

Dean notes that the change would also eliminate benefits for many seniors and individuals with disabilities who would be cut off if their assets exceed $3,500. Many states have waived the asset limit because they argue that it discourages low-income families from saving, and it's a huge administrative burden trying to keep track of a recipient's bank account and other assets.

But that has also led to one high-profile case that the administration and some Republicans repeatedly tout as evidence that the program needs to be fixed. The case involves a wealthy Minnesota man who had extremely low income, but huge assets, and said he applied for and collected SNAP to show that the program is flawed. Dean and others counter that the man intentionally abused the system and that it is highly unusual for someone with so many assets to have so little income, which includes interest on savings and investments.

Perdue called SNAP a ""temporary safety net"" and said the administration wants to help people ""move away from SNAP dependency.""

About 36 million people now receive monthly SNAP benefits. That number has declined steadily since 2013, when it exceeded 47 million."
Mark Esper Confirmed as Trump’s Defense Secretary,https://www.nytimes.com,['Helene Cooper'],07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/23/us/politics/mark-esper-secretary-defense.html,"WASHINGTON — The Senate confirmed Mark T. Esper as secretary of defense on Tuesday, ending the longest period by far that the Pentagon has been without a permanent leader at its helm.

Mr. Esper, an Army infantryman who fought in the Persian Gulf war of 1991 before becoming a lobbyist for the military contractor Raytheon, replaces Jim Mattis, who resigned in December during a dispute over pulling American troops out of Syria.

In receiving the Senate nod, Mr. Esper has succeeded where Patrick M. Shanahan, President Trump’s original pick to replace Mr. Mattis, did not; Mr. Shanahan abruptly resigned last month, before his Senate confirmation hearing was even scheduled, after news reports revealed details of his 2011 divorce.

Mr. Esper now takes control of the country’s 1.2 million active-duty troops and one of the largest militaries in the world as the Trump administration is wrestling with the results of its so-called maximum pressure campaign of economic sanctions on Iran, which has prodded the two adversaries closer to military confrontation."
"Trump Relies on Populist Language, but He Mostly Sides With Corporate Interests",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Jonathan Martin', 'Maggie Haberman']",07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/23/us/politics/trump-working-class.html,"This is all to say Mr. Trump has shown no sign of aggressively pursuing the sort of working-class-oriented measures that his onetime adviser Stephen K. Bannon predicted would build an enduring Republican majority.

To be sure, the unemployment rate has continued to fall under Mr. Trump, reaching a 50-year low. Wage growth has accelerated modestly, and is strongest for the lowest-paid workers in the country. Voters give Mr. Trump higher approval on the economy than on his overall performance in office. But most workers are still gaining less under Mr. Trump than they did during previous times of low unemployment, such as the late 1990s, and fewer than two in five respondents to a SurveyMonkey poll for The New York Times this month said their family was better off financially today than a year ago.

With Mr. Bannon long gone, Mr. Trump is surrounded by conservatives in the White House, such as his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, a former Tea Party congressman who has no appetite for raising the gas tax to pay for an infrastructure bill or to make businesses swallow a minimum-wage increase. In fact, the prospect of a major public works bill has become a running joke among West Wing aides. When midlevel staff members were working on a plan several months ago, Mr. Mulvaney was across the country mocking it during an appearance at the Milken Institute’s Global Conference in California in April.

A deal struck Monday by Ms. Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to set higher spending levels for the next two fiscal years will take still more pressure off the White House to embrace large legislative initiatives — because Mr. Trump will have no more major fiscal deadlines this term to press for the kinds of concessions such legislation always takes.

And the moderates in the building who do have Mr. Trump’s ear, such as Mr. Kushner, are more interested in measures like overhauling the criminal justice system or trying to strike a bipartisan immigration deal than they are eager to notch populist victories that the president could trumpet in the industrial Midwest.

The president’s allies say that his talent is in scorching the opposition, and he is unlikely to deviate much from that task.

“I think he doesn’t mind if it happens, but it’s not his primary focus,” Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, said of racking up policy accomplishments. “His primary focus is to so thoroughly define Democrats as the party of the radical left. I think that matters much more to him than any particular bill.”"
What to expect in Robert Mueller’s testimony about the Trump-Russia investigation,https://www.vox.com,['Jul'],07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.vox.com/2019/7/23/20703923/mueller-testimony-schedule-time-watch-live-stream,"This week, for the first and perhaps only time, former special counsel Robert Mueller will answer questions about his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether President Donald Trump obstructed justice — but it’s unclear how much he’ll say.

On Wednesday, Mueller will testify before the House Judiciary Committee beginning at 8:30 am Eastern, and then before the House Intelligence Committee starting at noon Eastern. Questioning in the first three-hour session will largely focus on obstruction of justice, while the second two-hour session will focus on Russian interference with the 2016 election.

The testimony will be aired on networks such as NBC, ABC, CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, and C-SPAN. Vox will also live-stream it on Twitter and Facebook, and we’ll embed a live stream here when one is available.

Mueller’s testimony comes nearly four months after he completed his investigation, nearly three months after the government released a redacted version of his report, and nearly two months after he spoke publicly about his findings. It’s also at a time when Mueller’s findings have faded from the political conversation somewhat, as the scandal many Democrats once hoped could spur impeachment proceedings and bring down President Trump has not done either.

But many Democrats (and the occasional Republican) have argued that Mueller’s findings were in fact quite damning, and deserve far more public attention and scrutiny. And they think the major public spectacle of Mueller’s testimony could be better than a 448-page report at delivering those facts to the public. Even if, as Mueller has previously suggested, his testimony will only be repeating what’s in the report already.

Why Mueller is testifying to Congress

“I hope and expect this to be the only time that I will speak about this matter,” Mueller said when he addressed the public for the first (and so far only) time in May, just before he stepped down as special counsel. But House Democrats weren’t satisfied — they subpoenaed Mueller in June, in an effort to force him to answer questions before key committees. Despite Mueller’s reluctance, negotiations ensued, and the sides eventually struck a deal for the testimony that will take place Wednesday.

In his May statement, Mueller said that “any testimony from this office would not go beyond our report” — that is, he might try to answer every question by simply restating what his report says, or declining to answer. The Justice Department also sent Mueller a letter urging him to stick to the report itself, and even claiming that talking about internal investigative decisions in more detail could fall under executive privilege.

Mueller’s testimony may not reveal new bombshells. However, it will at the very least provide a high-profile setting for him to restate the findings in his report (which, though it’s a best-seller, many people haven’t read — as of early May, a CNN poll of US adults found only 3 percent of respondents read the whole thing). And it should refocus media attention on those findings. Namely:

That the Russian government tried to help Trump win the 2016 election

That the Trump campaign was eager to benefit from hackings targeting Democrats

That Trump’s campaign advisers had a host of shady ties to Russia

That despite this, the investigation did not establish a conspiracy between Trump’s campaign and Russia to interfere with the election

That six former Trump advisers committed crimes by lying to investigators

And that Trump, once he became president, tried again and again to impede the investigation — though Mueller decided not to outright reach a conclusion on whether this constituted criminal obstruction of justice

What Mueller found on obstruction of justice

The first testimony session, before the Judiciary Committee, will focus on the portion of the report that focused on obstruction of justice. That’s likely because half of the report has by far more material about Trump personally.

There are two broad areas members of Congress can focus on here — questions on Mueller’s factual findings about Trump’s potential obstruction of justice, and questions about his legal analysis and DOJ’s behind-the-scenes decision-making in this fraught probe.

Mueller’s factual findings on Trump’s efforts to impede the investigation

The special counsel examined 10 different instances of possible obstruction; among the key events Mueller collected facts and evidence on are:

Trump tried to get then-FBI Director James Comey to drop an investigation into whether Michael Flynn lied about his Russia contacts (but Comey didn’t do it).

Trump then fired Comey.

Trump tried several times to get then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to reverse his recusal from oversight of the Russia investigation or to rein in the probe (which Sessions didn’t do).

Trump directed then-White House counsel Don McGahn to have Mueller fired (but McGahn didn’t carry this out). Trump later tried to get McGahn to falsely deny this took place.

Trump and his legal team urged key figures in the probe (like Paul Manafort) not to “flip,” attacked those who did flip (like Michael Cohen), and sent messages to Flynn when he was about to flip.

Much of this clearly seems to be aimed at trying to impede the Russia investigation. And while Mueller wrote that the evidence doesn’t establish that all this “was designed to cover up a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia,” he added that Trump could well have had other corrupt motives (such as preventing politically damaging information or separate crimes from coming to light).

This fact pattern was stunning enough that after then-Republican Rep. Justin Amash reviewed this part of the report, he felt compelled to push for Trump’s impeachment. (He has since left the Republican Party.) But many of these details still aren’t widely known, so Democrats are hoping to publicize them more in these hearings.

Mueller’s legal analysis and the Justice Department’s decision-making on obstruction

Then there’s the special counsel’s analysis and decision-making. Mueller’s report examined whether those above Trump actions met the three requirements for whether something can be considered criminal obstruction of justice — whether it involved an obstructive act, whether it had a connection to a pending proceeding, and whether Trump’s intent was corrupt.

But throughout, Mueller avoided coming to an explicit conclusion on whether any of these individual acts — or the combination of them — qualified as criminal obstruction of justice. He said he determined to do this because the Justice Department has held that a sitting president can’t be indicted. “We determined not to apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes,” he writes.

Oddly, however, Mueller also went out of his way to point out that he did not have “confidence” that Trump did not obstruct justice — and claimed that if Trump indeed “clearly did not commit obstruction of justice,” he would say so. The implication was that the evidence against Trump on obstruction shouldn’t be dismissed lightly. Attorney General William Barr, however, did end up dismissing it: After Mueller submitted his report, Barr quickly proclaimed that according to his review of the evidence, Trump’s behavior wasn’t criminal.

This rather unusual sequence of events — Mueller’s decision not to issue a prosecutorial judgment, his decision to say he didn’t have “confidence” in Trump’s innocence, and Barr’s clearing of the president — raises many questions. So Democrats may well press Mueller for information about behind-the-scenes decision-making here, and whether he felt there was political interference by Barr.

What Mueller found on Russian interference and the Trump campaign

In Mueller’s second testimony session of the day, before the House Intelligence Committee, he’ll be pressed about the Russian effort to interfere with the 2016 presidential election and whether any Trump associates were involved in that effort.

Russian election interference: social media propaganda and email hacking

Per Mueller, Russia criminally interfered in the election in two main ways. First, there was a Russian effort to spread social media propaganda that could hurt Hillary Clinton’s campaign and help Trump (as well as sow division in the United States). Second, Russian intelligence officers hacked leading Democrats’ emails and electronic documents, and later either posted them directly or had them provided to WikiLeaks.

But was anyone in the Trump campaign involved? “Ultimately, the investigation did not establish that the Campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election-interference activities,” the Mueller report says.

Now, there is one big loose end involving Mueller’s findings about what happened in 2016. Heavily redacted sections of the report discuss whether Trump associates were involved in the dissemination of those hacked emails. This section discusses longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone’s contacts with WikiLeaks and, apparently, advance information Trump was told. However, Mueller will not be permitted to discuss that material, to avoid prejudicing Stone’s trial on charges of obstruction, making false statements, and witness tampering (which is scheduled for November). So it is not clear whether questioning on this topic will be fruitful.

The Trump campaign-Russia contacts

Beyond the specific election interference conspiracy, Mueller’s report contains a lengthy chronicle of the Russian government’s contacts with the Trump campaign — though none of these ended up being the basis for criminal charges. These include:

Michael Cohen made an effort, approved by Trump, to get the Russian government’s help advancing a project to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. (Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about this effort.)

George Papadopoulos got a tip that the Russian government had “dirt” on Clinton in the form of emails, and had contacts with a Maltese professor and two Russian nationals. (Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about these contacts.)

Paul Manafort had various contacts with Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian national, during the campaign — he shared internal Trump polling data with Kilimnik and discussed the campaign’s strategy with him. (Manafort was convicted of financial crimes mostly related to his past Ukraine lobbying work.)

Carter Page made a trip to Moscow in July 2016, where he gave two speeches and met a Russian deputy prime minister and an official at a Russian oil company. (Mueller concluded that Page’s activities in Russia “were not fully explained” but didn’t charge him with any crimes.)

Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner met with a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower in June 2016 in hopes of getting damaging information about Hillary Clinton. They did not, however, get useful information. (Mueller considered charging this as a campaign finance violation — an effort to get a thing of value from foreign nationals — but concluded there was insufficient evidence.)

After repeated requests from Trump, Michael Flynn reached out to Republican operative Peter Smith about trying to obtain Hillary Clinton’s deleted emails from Russian hackers. (The effort was unsuccessful, and Smith died by suicide in early 2017.)

During the transition period, Flynn reached out to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak to urge him to respond with restraint to the outgoing Obama administration’s new sanctions. (Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about these statements.)

However, this volume of the report says relatively little about Trump himself. It does reveal that Trump had ambitions for a lucrative Russian business deal and was eager to “find” Clinton’s emails. But Mueller revealed no evidence that Trump was personally involved in or aware of most of those other shady contacts.

Overall, rather than any super-spy conspiracy involving the highest levels of the Trump campaign, the Mueller report seemed to tell a story of a series of disorganized contacts and missed opportunities.

None of it makes the Trump campaign look particularly good — and we can expect Democrats to hammer that point home. Expect Republicans, though, to hammer home the point that after a nearly two-year investigation, Mueller did not ultimately charge a conspiracy between any Trump official and any Russian to interfere with the 2016 election."
Emails Show DeVos Aides Pulled Strings for Failing For-Profit Colleges,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Erica L. Green', 'Stacy Cowley']",07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/23/us/politics/dream-center.html,"The Education Department has maintained it did nothing wrong.

“This story is based entirely on a wrongful premise,” the department wrote in a statement. “The full and complete timeline shows Dream Center did not receive any unique benefits from policy decisions made by the department. We simply worked to try and get as many students into a new program as possible. While we did not achieve a perfect outcome, our actions helped thousands of students land on their feet.”

In a response letter to Mr. Scott on Monday, the department’s acting general counsel, Reed D. Rubinstein, submitted documentation that he said contradicted the committee’s “unfair suggestions” that the department tailored its policies to assist Dream Center and were not forthcoming with Congress. “The Department categorically rejects these allegations,” he wrote.

“Dream Center’s management received no special treatment,” he said.

President Trump has moved to deregulate any number of industries, from mining and offshore oil exploration to chemicals and internet providers. But Ms. DeVos’s efforts to get the government off the backs of for-profit colleges have come under particular scrutiny, in part because of the spectacular implosions of for-profit college chains only a few years ago, in part because people who once worked in the sector have led the DeVos deregulatory push.

Dream Center’s collapse was the first of the new deregulatory era. Yet Education Department officials insisted, repeatedly, that its demise had nothing to do with the administration’s policies or efforts. Ms. Jones told Congress that she did not even know of Dream Center’s accreditation problems at the time the company said she was working to get it out of its jam. She also told lawmakers the policy change extending retroactive accreditation had “nothing to do with the Dream Center.”

Those assurances are now being questioned.

“The documents further suggest that department officials were not forthcoming to Congress and the public about the information they had about Dream Center’s status and practices,” Mr. Scott wrote. He is requesting emails, text messages and interviews with several department officials, including Ms. Jones."
Gay U.S. Couple Sues State Dept. for Denying Their Baby Citizenship,https://www.nytimes.com,['Sarah Mervosh'],07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/23/us/state-department-assisted-reproductive-citizenship.html,"The State Department’s focus on biological parentage means that if the source of the sperm and egg do not match married parents, the case can be treated as “out of wedlock,” a designation that comes with a higher bar to transmit citizenship.

Mr. Gregg, who moved to the United States to be with his husband, did not meet a five-year residency requirement. His lawyers say that requirement would not have applied if they had been treated as the married couple they are.

For two married United States citizens, “all the law requires is that one of them lived in America for at least one day,” said Aaron Morris, the executive director of Immigration Equality, which has worked on all three lawsuits.

“Marriage is so fundamental to how you define a family,” he said. “To disenfranchise a little girl of citizenship because she has two dads is invidious discrimination that has been struck down time and time again.”

The State Department declined to comment on Tuesday, citing pending litigation. In court documents, the department has argued that the policy does not discriminate and applies to opposite-sex and same-sex couples alike.

But gay couples argue that they are far more likely to be questioned about their conception methods when applying for citizenship. Immigration Equality said that it had heard from at least three dozen families in similar situations since mid-2017; by the organization’s account, most were same-sex couples.

In court documents, the State Department has said that rules for passing down citizenship for children born abroad are important for preventing fraud and ensuring that children born abroad have a sufficient connection to the United States to warrant citizenship."
USDA rule could affect 3.1M food stamp recipients,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/wireStory/usda-rule-affect-31m-food-stamp-recipients-64508284,"About 3.1 million people would lose food stamp benefits under the Trump administration's proposal to tighten automatic eligibility requirements for the food stamp program.

The Agriculture Department said Tuesday that the rule would close ""a loophole"" that enables people receiving only minimal benefits from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program to be eligible automatically for food stamps without undergoing further checks on their income or assets.

""For too long, this loophole has been used to effectively bypass important eligibility guidelines. Too often, states have misused this flexibility without restraint,"" Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement.

The proposed rule is the latest in the Trump administration's efforts to cut back on the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program or SNAP, the official name of the food stamp program. It also has proposed to tighten work requirements for those who receive federal food assistance.

USDA estimates that 1.7 million households — 3.1 million people — ""will not otherwise meet SNAP's income and asset eligibility prerequisites under the proposed rule."" That would result in a net savings of about $9.4 billion over five years.

An unpublished version of the proposed rule acknowledges the impact, saying it ""may also negatively impact food security and reduce the savings rates among those individuals who do not meet the income and resource eligibility requirements for SNAP or the substantial and ongoing requirements for expanded categorical eligibility.""

Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., called the proposal ""yet another attempt by this administration to circumvent Congress"" and that the effect would be to ""take food away from families, prevent children from getting school meals, and make it harder for states to administer food assistance.""

Congress has rejected previous, similar attempts to change the expanded automatic eligibility provisions, most recently during the farm bill debate in 2018.

Robert Greenstein, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said the proposal could discourage working families with incomes close to the maximum for SNAP participation from seeking more work out of fear that the added wages could make them ineligible for the program.

""The proposed rule would weaken SNAP's role in supporting work while making it harder for families that struggle to get by on low wages to meet their basic needs,"" he said.

About 36 million people participated in SNAP in April 2019, down from more than 38 million a year earlier.

Under current law, states may automatically make people eligible for food stamps, if they meet income and other requirements for TANF. USDA says 43 states have expanded that to include households that it says ""barely participate"" in TANF. The provision is called ""expanded categorical eligibility.""

USDA said the policy has resulted in people receiving food stamps who don't need it and wouldn't qualify under regular program rules.

Ellen Vollinger, legal director of the Food Research & Action Center, said the proposal was troubling and that the government should ""put attention on how to help more people, not undercut supports for them and make their struggle against hunger even harder.""

She said the department didn't seem to address a resulting loss of school meals, which she said the Congressional Budget Office included in its analyses of previous, similar proposals. ""It's another hit on hunger,"" she said.

Under the proposal, to qualify for automatic eligibility, people would have to get at least $50 a month in benefits from TANF for a minimum of six months.

Perdue said the change is necessary for ""preventing abuse of a critical safety net system so those who need food assistance the most are the only ones who receive it.""

The rule, expected to be published in the Federal Register on Wednesday, is open for public comment for 60 days.

Comey's inside man at White House emerges as DOJ inspector general finalizes FISA abuse report,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/comeys-inside-man-at-white-house-emerges-as-doj-inspector-general-finalizes-fisa-abuse-report,"Former FBI Director James Comey had an inside man at the White House, feeding the bureau information about President Trump and his aides in 2017.

Now this individual, who after leaving the government was hired by BuzzFeed to verify parts of British ex-spy Christopher Steele's dossier, may be tied to an investigation into alleged surveillance abuses by the DOJ and the FBI being conducted by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz.

This previously unreported mole in the White House appears in a new report by RealClearInvestigations that explored possible misconduct by Comey for what two U.S. officials described as essentially ""running a covert operation against"" the president even as he was assuring Trump he was not the subject of any investigation.

Anthony Ferrante, a longtime FBI official, worked as a cybersecurity adviser on the National Security Council. Officials said Ferrante was working in the White House even while the FBI held him on reserve status. All the while, he was sharing information about Trump and his aides back to FBI headquarters.

One former National Security Council official said Ferrante's unique position was highly irregular.

“In an unprecedented action, Comey created a new FBI reserve position for Ferrante, enabling him to have an ongoing relationship with the agency, retaining his clearances and enabling him to come back in [to bureau headquarters],” the official said, adding that the NSC division supervisor was ""not allowed to get rid of Ferrante"" and that the arrangement appeared to be ""in direct conflict with the no-contact policy between the White House and the Department of Justice.""

Ferrante left the White House in April 2017, not long before Trump fired Comey as FBI director.

He went on to join FTI Consulting, a business-advising firm headquartered in Washington, D.C. Through this firm, Ferrante was hired by BuzzFeed to investigate the dossier composed by Steele, to try and corroborate the unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia that appear in the research.

Ferrante was replaced in the White House by another FBI official, Jordan Rae Kelly, who signed security logs for Ferrante to enter the White House while he was contracted by BuzzFeed. Kelly left the White House last year and also joined FTI Consulting.

The FBI declined to comment for this report.

The dossier was published by BuzzFeed in January 2017 after reports came out that Comey privately briefed then-President-elect Trump on select allegations from Steele's work at a Trump Tower briefing. This meeting in New York, which came one day after Comey met with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office with some of his top administration officials, is now under scrutiny by Horowitz's team.

In what has become an urgent area of consternation for Republican lawmakers, the FBI relied heavily on Steele's unverified dossier to obtain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants filed to surveil onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. Four FISA warrant applications and renewals were filed from October 2016 through June 2017 against Page. Steele was hired by opposition research firm Fusion GPS and his dossier was funded by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign.

While under contract for BuzzFeed, Ferrante compiled a report that was filed in federal court as part of a lawsuit over the publication of the dossier. He found that internet service providers mentioned in the dossier that were owned by Russian entrepreneur Aleksej Gubarev may have been used by Russian agents to support the hack of the DNC and the campaign chairman of Clinton’s campaign during the 2016 election. Unlike Steele's dossier, Ferrante's report did not directly link Gubarev or his executives to the hacking. “I have no evidence of them actually sitting behind a keyboard,” Ferrante said in a deposition.

It is unclear whether Ferrante is still working for BuzzFeed. A spokesman for the outlet declined to comment on questions from the Washington Examiner about Ferrante. Ferrante did not immediately return an emailed request for comment from the Washington Examiner and a spokeswoman at FTI Consulting declined comment to RealClearInvestigations, as did Comey's attorney.

Horowitz's team has reviewed more than 1 million records and conducted more than 100 interviews, including with Comey and Steele. The information provided by Steele was reportedly interesting or credible enough to justify extending the length of the investigation, which Attorney General William Barr earlier this year had predicted would be complete by May or June.

House Judiciary Committee ranking member Doug Collins said over the weekend he expects the inspector general's report to be released this fall. The RealClearInvestigations report puts a release date sometime in September.

Meanwhile Attorney General William Barr is conducting a review of the origins of the Russia investigation, and he has said he is working very closely with Horowitz. The inspector general can recommend prosecutions, and U.S. Attorney John Durham, whom Barr tasked to lead the review, has the ability to convene a grand jury and to subpoena people outside of the government."
Trump’s new food stamp proposal weaponizes government against poor people,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Paul Waldman', 'Opinion Writer Covering Politics', 'Opinion Writer', 'July At Pm', 'Paul Waldman Is An Opinion Writer For The Plum Line Blog.']",07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/07/23/trumps-new-food-stamp-proposal-weaponizes-government-against-poor-people/,"Opinion writer

The Trump administration has learned that some food stamp recipients may have a few hundred dollars in the bank, and the administration is on it. So it is responding to this emergency by taking steps that could take food stamps away from 3.1 million Americans who rely on them to eat.

This is a story about government and budgets and bureaucracy, but it’s also a story about philosophy. One way to think about it is to ask this question: Which makes you angrier, a child going hungry, or someone getting a government benefit who might be able to do without it?

If you’re a Republican, the answer is almost certainly the latter. In fact, you’d probably be happy to take benefits away from a hundred or a thousand people who need them — or maybe even 3.1 million — if it meant that just one person gaming the system could be stopped.

That’s not to say that Republicans actually want kids to go hungry any more than Democrats want people to game the system and get benefits they don’t need. But there’s a basic difference in what they see as an urgent problem and what they’re willing to live with to solve that problem.

The administration’s proposed rule change is the latest in a series of attacks on the food stamp program, which have included trying to impose stricter work requirements on beneficiaries and restricting eligibility. Sometimes that attack is straightforward, just trying to cut the program. But at other times it employs a favorite Republican tactic: weaponizing bureaucracy against poor people.

That’s what’s happening here. As it stands now, in 43 states if you’re poor enough to be eligible and enroll in other anti-poverty programs, you can be automatically enrolled in food stamps, too. So what the administration wants to do is forbid states from doing that automatic enrollment so people would have to go through a separate application process for food stamps, including asset tests to make sure they don’t own their home or have a bank account with enough money in it to afford a car repair.

In addition — and this is a particularly cruel side effect — by gutting this “broad-based categorical eligibility,” it will also make it harder for states to help people avoid what’s known as the “benefit cliff,” where you can get a small raise at work and suddenly lose all your food stamp benefits, leaving you worse off.

The purpose is clear: If you make people navigate a whole separate bureaucratic process, many of them won’t bother, won’t understand they’re eligible or will make mistakes in the process that get their applications rejected. And presto, you’ve denied benefits to 3 million people.

We’ve seen what this technique produces in places like Arkansas, where the state added work requirements to Medicaid that amounted to little more than a convoluted bureaucratic maze people have to navigate to keep their health insurance. Eighteen thousand Arkansans have lost their coverage as a result.

But Republicans are deeply, deeply concerned that there might be a national epidemic of people gaming the food stamp system. So are there millions of rich folks living in mansions who nonetheless have meager incomes and are therefore able to get the lavish average benefit of $126 per month per person, or $1.40 per meal?

Well, no. If you ask Republicans, they’ll point to … one guy. His name is Rob Undersander, and he wrote an op-ed a few years ago telling how he was able to apply for and receive food stamps despite having savings and property because he’s a retiree with a low income.

Republicans talk about him all the time. Here he is on Fox News. Here he is on the Fox Business channel. Here he is in a video produced for a conservative think tank. Here are multiple Republicans talking about him at a congressional hearing.

How big a problem are millionaire food stamp recipients? Republicans don’t particularly care. The point for them is that one is too many. If there is even a tiny number, it’s so deeply offensive to their sense of justice that it’s worth kicking millions of people off food stamps.

That, to them, is not a moral outrage. After all, it isn’t as though we’re talking about a real injustice, like Donald Trump Jr. having to pay taxes on his inheritance. They’re just poor people. A little hunger will do them good.

State Department yanks data on U.S. tourists harmed in Jamaica,https://www.freep.com,"['Tresa Baldas', 'Published A.M. Et July']",07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2019/07/23/state-department-american-tourists-jamaica/1796973001/,"CLOSE

At a time when tourism fears have escalated in the Caribbean, the State Department has stopped publishing crime data involving Americans harmed in Jamaica — but it won't say why.

For the first time in seven years, the State Department did not list how many Americans were sexually assaulted, robbed, murdered or kidnapped in Jamaica in its 2019 Crime and Safety Report. That information was previously published in reports that were cited in a 2018 Free Press investigation, which found that sexual assaults of U.S. tourists in Jamaica is an historic and unchecked problem, with an estimated one American raped a month.

That's according to State Department data that was publicly available for seven straight years — until now.

The Free Press, which interviewed numerous U.S. victims who said they were sexually assaulted in Jamaica, including four Michigan tourists, asked the State Department multiple times why the 2019 report omits data involving American crime victims in Jamaica. The agency wouldn't explain, beyond saying: “We do not have any other information to share at this time.""

These are the choke marks that an 18-year-old South African au pair says she suffered after being drugged and raped at a Sandals-owned beaches resort in Jamaica on July 4, 2018. She says Sandals paid her American host family $25,000 and silenced them with a non-disclosure agreement (Photo: South African au pair)

But the State Department did warn in its 2019 report that ""rape and sexual assault are serious problems throughout Jamaica, including at resorts and hotels. The use of date rape drugs is possible, even at private parties and resorts.""

The Jamaica 2019 Crime and Safety Report was released in the wake of a tourism scare involving the Dominican Republic, where 10 American tourist deaths have been reported since May. Several more U.S. tourists have reported becoming severely ill while on vacation there, including a Detroit man who landed in Harper Hospital's ICU following his May vacation to the DR.

Jamaica and the Dominican Republic are among nine Caribbean and Central American destinations that the U.S. State Department has issued Level 2 travel advisories for, citing violence and crime. Level 2 means “Exercise Increased Caution.” The other countries on the Level 2 travel advisory list are: The Bahamas, Belize, Colombia, Cuba, Turks and Caicos, Mexico and Guatemala.

There are four categories of travel advisories: “Level 1: Exercise Normal Precautions”; “Level Two: Exercise Increased Caution”; “Level 3: Reconsider Travel” and “Level 4: Do Not Travel.”

Caribbean destinations that are currently deemed safe for travel — they have no travel advisory — are:

Anguilla, Antigua, Aruba, Barbados,

British Virgin Islands

Cayman Islands

Costa Rica, Curaçao, French West Indies, Grenada

Saint Kitts and Nevis

Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines

Countries on the “Level 3, Reconsider Travel” list are:

El Salvador

Honduras

Nicaragua

Haiti

Countries on the “Level 4, Do Not Travel” list are:

Venezuela

While the FBI investigates the Dominican Republic deaths, tourism officials there are working feverishly to dispel concerns about travel safety. So are officials in Jamaica, where an island-wide security audit of resorts was ordered in the wake of the Free Press investigation, which detailed the rapes of two Detroit women who were attacked at gunpoint by a Jamaican resort employee last fall.

Jamaica's Minister of Tourism Edmund Bartlett said in early July that the months-long security audit is complete and that his office is reviewing it. Findings have not yet been released.

“The issue of safety and security is very central to us. We will have further discussions with the (Jamaica Hotel and Tourist Association) as it relates to the recommendations, and together we will craft the new architecture in Jamaica,” Bartlett said at a June tourism meeting.

The audit sought to uncover, among other things, non-compliance by resorts regarding safety incidents. It focused on building safety, personnel, security measures, communication devices and security incident history.

Meanwhile, State Department warnings about sexual violence against women tourists in Jamaica continue.

""If you are a victim of a sexual assault, contact the police and the U.S. Embassy in Kingston as soon as possible,"" the State Department states in its 2019 report, reminding victims that Jamaican hotels and resorts ""should assist you with these communications.""

That message highlighted a key finding in the Free Press investigation.

Numerous victims told the Free Press the resorts ignored or downplayed their fears, discouraged them from going to the police, and in some cases silenced them with free travel in exchange for them signing non-disclosure agreements.

The 2019 State Department report also highlighted this finding by the Free Press: tourists who are sexually assaulted in Jamaica feel justice is out of reach. As one mother told the Free Press three years after her daughter was allegedly raped in a laundry room by a resort lifeguard: ""My daughter will never have justice.""

CLOSE The rapes of two Detroit women at a Jamaican resort has highlighted a pervasive problem on the island getaway: sexual assaults are ignored. Tresa Baldas, Detroit Free Press

Four and a half years after the alleged rapes of the girl and her friend, the case is finally going to trial in Jamaica in December. The victims will testify from a location in the U.S.

The State Department warns about such delays.

""Victims of sexual assault in Jamaica should not expect the same assistance routinely offered in the United States,"" the State Department writes in its 2019 report. ""Rape kits are not always available, and victims must often ask for medication to avoid STD transmission and reduce the chances of pregnancy. An offer of counseling is unlikely.""

Police resources are also limited, the government says.

""Law enforcement shortcomings exist in collection of evidence. Prosecution of rape cases moves very slowly,"" the State Department states, adding: ""Victims may need to return to Jamaica during the legal process.""

Trump Administration Moves To Speed Up Deportations With Expedited Removal Expansion,https://www.npr.org,['Vanessa Romo'],07-22-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/2019/07/22/744177726/trump-administration-moves-to-speed-up-deportations-with-expedited-removal-expan,"Trump Administration Moves To Speed Up Deportations With Expedited Removal Expansion

Enlarge this image toggle caption Gregory Bull/AP Gregory Bull/AP

The Trump administration announced on Monday it is expanding fast-track deportation regulations to include the removal of undocumented immigrants who cannot prove they have been in the U.S. continuously for two years or more.

The change dramatically expands the ability of the Department of Homeland Security to quickly deport certain immigrants without any of the due-process protections granted to most other people, including the right to an attorney and to a hearing before a judge. It is set to go into effect Tuesday and is the latest escalation of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.

""The effect of that change will be to enhance national security and public safety — while reducing government costs — by facilitating prompt immigration determinations,"" DHS said in a notice.

Additionally, DHS stated part of the purpose for the policy revision is to ""harmonize"" existing regulations to apply equally to undocumented immigrants who arrive by land and sea.

Currently, undocumented immigrants who cross into the U.S. by land can be deported without an immigration hearing if they are arrested within 100 miles of the border during the first 14 days after their arrival. Those who arrive by sea can be deported without legal proceedings if they are unable to prove they have been living in the U.S. for two years or more.

But under the latest proposal, all geographical limitations would be lifted and rapid removal proceedings would be applied to all undocumented immigrants who have been in the country for less than two years.

The move is also designed to mitigate a massive court backlog of immigration cases ""and will reduce the significant costs to the government associated with full removal proceedings before an immigration judge."" DHS said that as of June there were 909,034 pending immigration cases. It estimates the average removal proceeding for an undocumented immigrant not being held in detention ""has been pending for more than two years before an immigration judge.""

In early 2017, days after taking office, President Trump issued an executive order directing DHS to expand the use of expedited removal. The order designated recent unauthorized arrivals as a top priority for deportation.

""We plan on challenging the change ... speedily,"" Anand Balakrishnan, Senior Staff Attorney for the ACLU's Immigrant Rights Project told NPR.

Balakrishnan called the policy shift ""extremely sweeping,"" and said it authorizes any Customs and Border Protection officer to determine whether a person has been in the U.S. the requisite amount of time to trigger legal proceedings.

""The only way out of that is for the person to affirmatively prove that they've been here for two years or more. To have that evidence on them at all times,"" he said. ""It puts the burden on every noncitizen to prove their continuous presence.""

He noted, deportations could happen within hours of a person's arrest.

""From what we know about the way expedited removals have been administered in the past, it's been rife with errors,"" Balakrishnan said. ""U.S. citizens have been ordered deported"" and in other cases, people who have lived in the country for more than a decade have also been ejected, he said.

The DHS notice stated unaccompanied children may not be placed in expedited removal under current law. Further, undocumented immigrants can apply for asylum when they are apprehended, potentially delaying an immediate deportation until a credible-fear hearing and a determination is made. People who are deported under expedited removal regulations have no right to appeal.

The pro-immigration American Immigration Council estimates thousands of people could be deported as a result of the expansion."
‘It’s a disaster over there’: Commerce reaches new heights of dysfunction,https://www.politico.com,['Daniel Lippman'],07-22-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/22/wilbur-ross-commerce-department-dysfunction-1424427,"Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross doesn’t hold routine meetings with senior staffers, according to a person familiar with the department’s inner workings, ""Because he tends to fall asleep in meetings."" | Win McNamee/Getty Images Finance & Tax ‘It’s a disaster over there’: Commerce reaches new heights of dysfunction Under Secretary Wilbur Ross, the department is chaotic and adrift.

Constant infighting among top officials. Sudden departures of senior staffers without explanation. A leader who is disengaged and prone to falling asleep in meetings.

The Commerce Department has reached its apex of dysfunction under Wilbur Ross, according to four people with knowledge of the inner workings of the department. The 81-year-old Commerce secretary, who has for months endured whispers that he is on the outs, spends much of his time at the White House to try to retain President Donald Trump’s favor, the sources said, leaving his department adrift.

Story Continued Below

He’s hardly the only top Trump official to seek the president’s approval. But department insiders say they’ve rarely seen Commerce so rudderless — and they say Ross’ penchant for managing upward at the expense of his staff is leading to what one plugged-in observer described as “a disaster over there.”

“With our ongoing trade wars and the census looming, Commerce needs functional leadership to be effective, and right now they just don’t have it,” said Theo LeCompte, a former top Commerce official in the Obama administration who speaks often with former colleagues.

One common complaint: Ross, a successful investor before Trump tapped him as secretary of Commerce, isn’t frequently seen in the building talking to employees or rallying them to do good work.

“He’s sort of seen as kind of irrelevant. The morale is very low there because there’s not a lot of confidence in the secretary,” said a former outside adviser to Commerce who is still in touch with many employees at the department. “He’s not respected in the building.”

Ross doesn’t hold routine meetings with senior staffers, according to a person familiar with the department’s inner workings and a former outside adviser — a departure from past practice that one source attributed to the secretary’s lack of stamina.

“Because he tends to fall asleep in meetings, they try not to put him in a position where that could happen so they’re very careful and conscious about how they schedule certain meetings,” said the former outside adviser. “There’s a small window where he’s able to focus and pay attention and not fall asleep.”

A Commerce official disputed that criticsm, saying that Ross has frequent afternoon meetings, including “long” meetings on the census.

“Secretary Ross is a tireless worker who is the sole decision-maker at the department,"" said Commerce press secretary Kevin Manning. ""He routinely works 12-hour days and travels often, with visits to seven countries and eight states in the last three months to advance the president’s agenda.""

Yet top Commerce officials have pushed to not have Ross called to testify at congressional oversight hearings, according to two sources close to the department, because they fear he isn’t up to the task. “There’s a great deal of effort to shield him from testifying ever again,” said one of the sources.

A Commerce official disputed that and said, “He’s obviously going to have to testify again. … You can’t get through the rest of [congressional appropriations] season without testifying again.”

Ross did testify at an oversight hearing on the census for nearly seven hours in March, and emerged through the ordeal generally unscathed. But according to one person familiar with the department, the consensus among the top ranks of the administration was that it would be best to avoid a repeat appearance.

“There was a great deal of concern to not have him testify expressed from the White House,” this person said, characterizing the instructions as: “‘Don’t do this, people. Don’t do this, he’s probably not the right guy to go there.’”

Ross certainly has other reasons to avoid Congress — namely, the heated dispute between Hill Democrats and the administration over adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201906/3704/1155968404_6052147728001_6051795407001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

In April, Ross offered to send aides to testify on his behalf before a House Appropriations subcommittee, an offer the panel’s Democratic chairman, José Serrano, said showed “stunning disrespect.” Serrano’s Republican counterpart, Robert Aderholt, told Reuters that Ross refused to testify out of “concern that this hearing might focus more on political or legal issues than the budget itself.”

“His relationship with the Hill has deteriorated more and more, and he’s just not interested in dealing with the Hill if he can avoid it,” said a person familiar with the department’s internal discussions.

A Commerce official noted that Ross talked to Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) two weeks ago, and held a party two months ago that a number of senators attended. Another Commerce employee observed, “This administration is very hesitant to do oversight in general or to comply with oversight requests in general.”

There are public signs, however, of apparent unease with Ross as a spokesperson for the administration. At an appearance at the White House in mid-July on an announcement on abandoning the citizenship question in the census, the Commerce secretary stood next to Trump the entire time and was one of three people who didn’t speak. Attorney General Bill Barr, on the other hand, spoke at length.

Ross’ relationship with the White House and with Trump was also damaged by stories that came out in the past 18 months showing that he wasn’t as rich as he had claimed and hadn’t fully divested some stock as he had promised, according to the former outside adviser. (The Commerce official disputed that, arguing that the White House has not cared about these issues.)

Ross’s deputies, meanwhile, are coming under fire of their own as tensions rise withini the department.

Political appointees sometimes close doors right in front of career employees to keep them out of meetings, one former Commerce official in touch with former colleagues said.

Meanwhile, “it’s totally infighting among the politicals,” said another person familiar with the department. “It’s just everybody fighting everybody.” In particular, the relationship between Ross’ office and the legislative affairs team is “clearly broken,” this person said.

Charles “Kolo” Rathburn, who had been acting head of legislative affairs, “was unceremoniously let go” and abruptly left earlier in July, according to a person familiar with Commerce and the outside adviser, who said it had to do with issues of professional conduct in the workplace. Another person familiar with Commerce also confirmed his departure.

“He wasn’t allowed to clean out his office,” said one of the people. Rathburn had replaced Mike Platt, who had left in early May.

A Commerce official said Rathburn, who didn’t respond to requests for comment, is working to pass the bar exam and has an offer for a higher-paying position at a law firm if he does.

Ross Branson, who had been deputy assistant secretary of legislative affairs and was Platt’s deputy, also left Commerce on Friday, according to two people familiar with his departure. He had become “collateral damage,” according to one of the people, and was told that he had to look for a new job. He starts on Monday as head of legislative affairs at the Export-Import Bank, a position that a Commerce official described as “definitely a promotion.” Branson and the Ex-Im Bank did not respond to a request for comment.

Much of the tension inside the building has centered on Earl Comstock, who shepherded Ross’ confirmation on Capitol Hill and is one of the secretary’s top lieutenants as the department's policy director.

The disarray inside Commerce is drawing an intervention from chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and other White House officials, who are trying to figure out how to wrest control from Comstock, who increasingly seems to be involved in everything that happens inside the department.

“Things come to a screeching halt because he demands to be the final decision on everything whether it’s an email that goes out to the Hill or a letter to respond to X, Y and Z,” said a person familiar with Commerce.

Comstock, who didn’t respond to requests for comment, has also been at the center of many of the spectrum battles between the Federal Communications Commission and the departments of Transportation, Education, Commerce and NASA and NOAA, according to an administration official. He has “literally been seeding bad intel and bad information to get other people agitated,” said the official.

He also tried to scuttle a joint White House-FCC summit on 5G, the wireless technology, in April by “calling everyone he could 24 hours before the event trying to get it to be canceled,” this person said. Comstock clashed in particular with former National Telecommunications and Information Administration chief David Redl, who left his post abruptly in May.

Critics of Ross’ leadership at Commerce also have a new target of concern: chief of staff Michael Walsh, who is described by some as inexperienced on policy and difficult to work with.

Walsh didn’t respond to a request for comment, but the Commerce official said that he has good relationships throughout the administration and on the Hill and visits the White House frequently. A second person familiar with Commerce also claimed, “People want his job so they’re spreading bad stuff on him.”

The chaos inside the department has had consequences for some employees.

“There’s great frustration among people who really want to use their skills and talents to help this country and are being marginalized by a White House who doesn’t need to ask any questions because it already thinks it has the answers,” said Roger Fisk, a Commerce official in the Obama administration. “All of that expertise is just lying dormant hiding in plain sight.""

WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency’s inspector general will investigate allegations that William L. Wehrum, the agency’s former air quality chief, violated ethics rules when he met with former clients from his days as a lawyer and lobbyist for the oil, gas and coal industries.

The inquiry will look into whether Mr. Wehrum’s efforts at the E.P.A. to weaken climate change and air pollution standards improperly benefited those former clients, a congressional aide said .

At issue are Mr. Wehrum’s ties to the Utility Air Regulatory Group, a coalition of utilities and trade groups that lobbies on behalf of coal-fired power plants, which he represented as a lawyer at his former firm, Hunton & Williams.

That relationship first drew scrutiny last year after Politico reported that the 25 power companies and six trade groups that make up the coalition paid the firm more than $8 million in 2017 just before President Trump appointed Mr. Wehrum.

Barr delivered a blistering critique Tuesday of encrypted messaging programs, saying they are preventing law enforcement from stopping killings, drug dealing and terrorism, and warned that time may be running out for the tech industry to make changes on its own.

The speech, delivered at the International Conference on Cyber Security in New York, marks a forceful return by the Justice Department to the encryption debate it has shied away from in recent years, after a bruising fight between the FBI and Apple over the locked phone of a dead terrorism suspect.

Since then, Barr said, the situation has gotten much worse.

“As this debate has dragged on, and deployment of warrant-proof encryption has accelerated, our ability to protect the public from criminal and national security threats is rapidly deteriorating,” Barr said in the written version of his speech. “The status quo is exceptionally dangerous, it is unacceptable, and only getting worse.”

[FBI Director renews call for action on encryption]

The FBI and the Justice Department have long decried what they call the “Going Dark” problem — encrypted communications and data storage shielding a growing area of digital information so that it cannot be examined by detectives or federal agents, even with an order from a judge. But their criticism has failed to spur changes by Congress or computer programmers, and current and former law enforcement officials say they are losing ground in the debate.

Cybersecurity experts say encryption is a critical tool to protect consumers’ data from hackers, and that the government can find other ways to gather evidence about criminals. Security experts and technology executives argue that creating the type of access keys sought by law enforcement would create structural weaknesses in their systems that could be exploited by hackers, making everyone’s information less secure.

Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), a longtime digital privacy advocate, denounced Barr’s approach, arguing that the Trump administration is particularly untrustworthy when it comes to safeguarding civil liberties.

“I expect that if we give the attorney general and this president the unprecedented power to break encryption across the board, and burrow into the most intimate details of Americans’ lives, they will abuse those powers,” said Wyden, citing Barr’s authorization in the early 1990s of a sweeping bulk surveillance program, and Trump’s public comments about his political foes.

“What senator in their right mind would give these men the authority to break into the phone of every single American?” Wyden asked in a speech on the Senate floor. “Imagine what kind of information they could gather on their political opponents.”

In his speech, Barr offered examples of what he called the growing danger of encrypted messaging systems used by criminals and killers.

The attorney general said that one Mexican cartel “started using WhatsApp as their primary communication method, preventing U.S. law enforcement from conducting wiretaps that would enable us to locate fentanyl shipments and seize them at the border.”

That same cartel, he said, created a WhatsApp group chat “for the specific purpose of coordinating the murders of Mexico-based police officials. The cartel ended up murdering hundreds of these police officers. Had we been able to gain access to the chat group on a timely basis, we could have saved these lives.”

In response, a WhatsApp spokesman referred to a statement made last year by Gail Kent, an executive at Facebook, which owns WhatsApp: “Cybersecurity experts have repeatedly proven that it’s impossible to create any backdoor that couldn’t be discovered — and exploited — by bad actors. It’s why weakening any part of encryption weakens the whole security ecosystem.”

“Making our virtual world more secure should not come at the expense of making us more vulnerable in the real world. But unfortunately, that is where we appear to be headed.”

Barr’s assertions are likely to be met with considerable skepticism in Silicon Valley, which fought the Obama administration over the encryption issue. After a terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif., the FBI sought a court order forcing Apple to open one of the killers’ locked iPhones. The Justice Department argued there was no other way to access the device that could hold key evidence, but in the midst of the legal fight, the FBI announced it had found a way to hack into the device. As a result, the encryption debate largely subsided, with Congress and the Obama administration reluctant to keep pressing on what seemed to be a losing battle.

More recently, the FBI had offered figures for the number of cellphones recovered in criminal investigations that could not be opened because of encryption. Those figures, however, turned out to be significantly overstated because of an overcounting error by the FBI’s data collection.

[FBI overstated encryption threat figures]

Last year, the FBI acknowledged that while they had repeatedly claimed investigators were locked out of nearly 7,800 devices connected to crimes, the correct number was much smaller, between 1,000 and 2,000."
Column: Trump has turned the Department of Labor into the Department of Employer Rights,https://www.latimes.com,"['Business Columnist', 'Pulitzer Prize-Winning Journalist Michael Hiltzik Writes A Daily Blog Appearing On Latimes.Com.

Scalia — son of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia — had made his reputation in Washington as a lawyer for big corporations resisting labor regulations, after all.

He had helped Walmart overturn a Maryland law mandating minimum contributions by big employers for workers’ healthcare, defended SeaWorld against workplace safety charges after a park trainer was killed by an Orca (he lost that case), and had written extensively against a federal regulation expanding ergonomic safety requirements.

But Scalia’s appointment is best seen not in the context of his own legal career, but in the context of Trump’s assault on worker rights and welfare. Despite his positioning himself during his presidential campaign as a flag carrier for the working class, Trump has rolled back numerous pro-worker regulations from the Obama era and before.

He talked a good game about bringing back manufacturing and coal jobs, but that hasn’t materialized. His steel tariffs are credited with saving some 12,000 steel manufacturing jobs, but at the enormous cost to the economy of an estimated $900,000 per job.

That’s paid by steel users, including automakers and other manufacturers. General Motors says it took a $1-billion hit in 2018 from the tariffs. That contributed to its decision to shed 14,000 jobs globally and to shutter its assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio, costing 900 jobs. Although Trump attacked GM Chief Executive Mary Barra for the decision, he also turned his ire on UAW and AFL-CIO leaders, calling them “not honest people” and blaming high union dues for the Lordstown closing. (Union dues are paid by workers, not employers.)

Hourly wages for rank-and-file workers are up since Trump’s inauguration, but only at a measly rate after inflation. Wages rose about 3.1% in June over a year earlier, but with consumer inflation running at 1.6% during the same period, the real gain for workers was a mere 1.1% in a year. Workers’ share of economic growth remains dismally low and continues to fall under Trump.

The real hubs of Trump’s attack on workers are the Department of Labor and the National Labor Relations Board. These bodies were established to protect worker rights. As we’ve reported before, under Trump they’ve become the advance guard in eviscerating those rights. Through those agencies, writes Pedro Nicolaci Da Costa of the labor-oriented Economic Policy Institute, “Trump is pursuing the most hostile anti-labor agenda of any modern president.”

Under Acosta, the Department of Labor rolled back a rule proposed by the Obama administration expanding overtime pay to thousands of workers misleadingly designated as “supervisors.” The Obama rule would have raised the pay threshold under which workers would be guaranteed overtime pay to $47,476 from $26,660, where it had settled for more than a decade. Trump’s labor regulators propose fixing it at $35,000, reducing the number of covered workers in half, leaving behind about 6 million workers who would have been covered under the Obama proposal.

As Terri Gerstein, a labor expert at Harvard Law School, observed in March, the Trump proposal would work out to less than $17 an hour — not exactly what most would consider “supervisor” pay — and would be silent on fast-food chains’ habit of suspiciously loading up their restaurant workforces with “general managers, assistant managers, night managers, managers for opening and closing and delivery, all paid a weekly salary.”

Trump’s NLRB has reversed the board’s trend toward expanding the definition of “joint employer,” which would have made big franchisers such as McDonald’s jointly liable with their franchisees for violations of employees’ wage and hour rights. Its proposed definition would narrow the joint-employer standard “to the point at which many workers would find it nearly impossible to bring all firms with the power to influence their wages and working conditions to the bargaining table,” according to the labor-oriented Economic Policy Institute.

The Trump administration also has rescinded the Obama-era “persuader” rule, which required employers to disclose their relationships with union-busting law firms. The Labor Department has indicated it will take a hands-off approach to enforcing workplace regulations when employees have agreed to bring workplace disputes to arbitration. That drew an objection from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who observed that affected workers often have been “forced to sign away important legal rights” and therefore are “most in need of federal protection.”

That brings us back to Eugene Scalia, who would be almost certain to continue Acosta’s policies, which included fighting legislation to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour from its woefully outdated $7.25. Scalia’s career has demonstrated his affinity with employers and bankers; back in 2012, the Wall Street Journal labeled him one of the financial industry’s “go-to guys for challenging financial regulations.”

His 2000 campaign against the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s effort to impose more responsibility on employers for ergonomic-related worker injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome gives a good taste of his approach. In an essay for the Cato Institute he lamented that the rule would “require businesses to slow the pace of production, hire more workers, increase rest periods and redesign workstations or even entire operations.” He asserted that OSHA’s intention to expand the rule to home-based work for employers reflected Democrats’ intention to “court union leaders” ahead of the coming presidential election.

The Trump administration is full to the brim of pro-employer front persons. The last place another one is needed is the Department of Labor. Scalia’s appointment to that agency, which is expected to be waved through by the Republican-controlled Senate, will merely continue a void in worker rights in Washington."
How Mueller deputy Andrew Weissmann's offer to an oligarch could boomerang on DOJ,https://thehill.com,[],07-22-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/454185-how-mueller-deputy-andrew-weissmanns-offer-to-an-oligarch-could-boomerang,"The ink was still drying on special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerThis week: Mueller dominates chaotic week on Capitol Hill Top Republican considered Mueller subpoena to box in Democrats Kamala Harris says her Justice Dept would have 'no choice' but to prosecute Trump for obstruction MORE’s appointment papers when his chief deputy, the famously aggressive and occasionally controversial prosecutor Andrew Weissmann, made a bold but secret overture in early June 2017.

Weissmann quietly reached out to the American lawyers for Ukrainian oligarch Dmitry Firtash with a tempting offer: Give us some dirt on Donald Trump Donald John Trump5 things to know about Boris Johnson Conservatives erupt in outrage against budget deal Trump says Omar will help him win Minnesota MORE in the Russia case, and Team Mueller might make his 2014 U.S. criminal charges go away.

The specifics of the never-before-reported offer were confirmed to me by multiple sources with direct knowledge, as well as in contemporaneous defense memos I read.

Two years later, Weissmann’s overture may have far-reaching consequences for the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), here and abroad. His former boss, Mueller, is slated to testify Wednesday before Congress.

The DOJ, Mueller’s office and Weissmann did not immediately respond to emails requesting comment on Monday.

At first blush, one might ask, “What’s the big deal?” It’s not unusual for federal prosecutors to steal a page from Monty Hall’s “Let’s Make a Deal” script during plea negotiations.

But Weissmann’s overture was wrapped with complexity and intrigue far beyond the normal federal case, my sources indicate.

At the time, pressure was building inside the DOJ and the FBI to find smoking-gun evidence against Trump in the Russia case because the Steele dossier — upon which the early surveillance warrants were based — was turning out to be an uncorroborated mess. (“There’s no big there there,” lead FBI agent Pete Strzok texted a few days before Weissmann’s overture.)

Likewise, key evidence that the DOJ used to indict Firtash on corruption charges in 2014 was falling apart. Two central witnesses were in the process of recanting testimony, and a document the FBI portrayed as bribery evidence inside Firtash’s company was exposed as a hypothetical slide from an American consultant’s PowerPoint presentation, according to court records I reviewed.

In other words, the DOJ faced potential embarrassment in two high-profile cases when Weissmann made an unsolicited approach on June 4, 2017, that surprised even Firtash’s U.S. legal team.

To some, the offer smacked of being desperately premature. Mueller was appointed just two weeks earlier, did not even have a full staff selected, and was still getting up to speed on the details of the investigation. So why rush to make a deal when the prosecution team still was being selected, some wondered.

Second, Weissmann’s approach was audaciously aggressive, even for a prosecutor with his reputation.

According to a defense memo recounting Weissmann’s contacts, the prosecutor claimed the Mueller team could “resolve the Firtash case” in Chicago and neither the DOJ nor the Chicago U.S. Attorney’s Office “could interfere with or prevent a solution,” including withdrawing all charges. “The complete dropping of the proceedings … was doubtless on the table,” according to the defense memo.

Firtash’s team suspected Weissmann’s claim was exaggerated. While Mueller had full authority to investigate the Russia case, he wasn’t an independent counsel separate of the DOJ but, rather, a special counsel subject to the attorney general’s oversight.

The third red flag came in how much Weissmann communicated to Firstash’s lawyers about his hopes for the Ukrainian oligarch’s testimony.

Prosecutors in plea deals typically ask a defendant for a written proffer of what they can provide in testimony and identify the general topics that might interest them. But Weissmann appeared to go much further in a July 7, 2017, meeting with Firtash’s American lawyers and FBI agents, sharing certain private theories of the nascent special counsel’s investigation into Trump, his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort Paul John ManafortHow Mueller deputy Andrew Weissmann's offer to an oligarch could boomerang on DOJ Ukrainian officials and Giuliani are sharing back-channel campaign information: report Key numbers to know for Mueller's testimony MORE and Russia, according to defense memos.

For example, Firtash’s legal team wrote that Weissmann told them he believed a company called Bayrock, tied to former FBI informant Felix Sater, had “made substantial investments with Donald Trump’s companies” and that prosecutors were looking for dirt on Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner Jared Corey KushnerHow Mueller deputy Andrew Weissmann's offer to an oligarch could boomerang on DOJ Trump talks to Swedish leader about rapper A$AP Rocky, offers to vouch for his bail Trump: 'We already started' talks to get A$AP Rocky home from Sweden MORE.

Weissmann told the Firtash team “he believes that Manafort and his people substantially coordinated their activities with Russians in order to win their work in Ukraine,” according to the defense memos. And the Mueller deputy said he “believed” a Ukrainian group tied to Manafort “was merely a front for illegal criminal activities in Ukraine,” and suggested a “Russian secret service authority” may have been involved in influencing the 2016 U.S. election, the defense memos show.

Weissmann’s private observations and sharing of prosecutor’s theories went beyond what prosecutors normally do in proffer negotiations and risked planting ideas that could lead the witness to craft his testimony, according to legal experts I consulted.

Remarkably, Firtash turned down Weissmann’s plea overtures even though the oligarch has been trapped in Austria for five years, fighting extradition on U.S. charges in Chicago alleging that he engaged in bribery and corruption in India related to a U.S. aerospace deal. He denies the charges.

The oligarch’s defense team told me that Firtash rejected the deal because he didn’t have credible information or evidence on the topics Weissmann outlined.

But now, as Firtash escalates his fight to avoid extradition, the Weissmann overture is being offered to an Austrian court as potential defense evidence that the DOJ’s prosecution is flawed by bogus evidence and political motivations.

In a sealed court filing in Austria earlier this month, Firtash’s legal team compared the DOJ’s 13-year investigation of Firtash to the medieval inquisitions. It cited Weissmann’s overture as evidence of political motivation, saying the prosecutor dangled the “possible cessation of separate criminal proceedings against the applicant if he were prepared to exchange sufficiently incriminating statements for wide-ranging comprehensively political subject areas which included the U.S. President himself as well as the Russian President Vladimir Putin Vladimir Vladimirovich PutinDemocrats, advocacy groups urge Pompeo to abolish new 'unalienable rights' commission How Mueller deputy Andrew Weissmann's offer to an oligarch could boomerang on DOJ Key Merkel ally set to test Trump amid tensions with Europe MORE.”

After years of litigation, the U.S. Justice Department won a ruling in Austria to secure Firtash’s extradition to Chicago. But then his legal team secretly filed new evidence that included the Weissmann overture, and Austrian officials suddenly reversed course last week and ordered a new, lengthy delay in extradition.

That new court filing asserts that two key witnesses, cited by the DOJ in its extradition request as affirming the bribery allegations against Firtash, since have recanted, claiming the FBI grossly misquoted them and pressured them to sign their statements. One witness claims his 2012 statement to the FBI was “prewritten by the U.S. authorities” and contains “relevant inaccuracies in substance,” including that he never used the terms “bribery or bribe payments” as DOJ claimed, according to the Austrian court filing.

That witness also claimed he only signed the 2012 statement because the FBI “exercised undue pressure on him,” including threats to seize his passport and keep him from returning home to India, the memo alleges. That witness recanted his statements the same summer as Weissmann’s overture to Firtash’s team.

Firtash’s lawyers also offered the Austrian court evidence of alleged prosecutorial wrongdoing.

A key document submitted to Austrian authorities to support Firtash’s extradition was portrayed by DOJ as having come from Firtash’s corporate files and purported to show he sanctioned a bribery scheme in India. In fact, the document was created by the McKinsey consulting firm as part of a hypothetical ethics presentation for the Boeing Co. and had no connection to Firtash’s firm.

Moreover, McKinsey claims in an official statement that it had no knowledge of a bribery scheme by Firtash, and the PowerPoint’s use of the phrase “bribery payments” never came from Firtash or his company and were, instead, hypothetical “assumptions by McKinsey about standard business practices in India,” according to the new Austrian court filing.

Firtash’s U.S. legal team told me it alerted Weissmann to DOJ’s false portrayal of the McKinsey document in 2017, but he downplayed the concerns and refused to alert the Austrian court. The document was never withdrawn as evidence, even after the New York Times published a story last December questioning its validity.

“Submitting a false and misleading document to a foreign sovereign and its courts for an extradition decision is not only unethical but also flouts the comity of trust necessary for that process where judicial systems rely only on documents to make that decision,” Firtash’s American legal team wrote in a statement to me. “DOJ’s refusal to rescind the document after being specifically told it is false and misleading is an egregious violation of U.S. and international law.”

Weissmann long has been a favorite target of conservatives, in part because his earlier work as a prosecutor in the Enron case was overturned unanimously by the U.S. Supreme Court because of overly aggressive prosecutorial tactics. Former DOJ official Sidney Powell strongly condemned Weissmann’s past work as a prosecutor in “Licensed to Lie,” a book critical of DOJ’s pressure tactics.

It is now clear that Weissmann’s overture to a Ukrainian oligarch in the summer of 2017 is about to take on new significance in Washington, where Mueller is about to testify, and in Austria, where Firtash’s extradition fight has taken a new twist.

"CBP rebuked by watchdog, whistleblowers for 'failure' to collect DNA from migrant detainees",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Catherine Herridge', 'Catherine Herridge Is An Award-Winning Chief Intelligence Correspondent For Fox News Channel', 'Fnc', 'Based In Washington', 'D.C. She Covers Intelligence', 'The Justice Department', 'The Department Of Homeland Security. Herridge Joined Fnc In As A London-Based Correspondent.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/cbp-dna-migrant-detainees-watchdog-whistleblowers,"EXCLUSIVE: A top government watchdog has joined whistleblowers in rebuking U.S. Customs and Border Protection for allegedly failing to collect DNA from detained migrants so the samples could be checked against an FBI database for violent crimes.

“U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents and illegal aliens in this country are and have been harmed due to our agency not collecting DNA,” Mike Taylor, one of the government whistleblowers, told Fox News.

The whistleblowers specifically alleged that the DNA pilot program was put on hold during the Obama administration, and efforts to implement it under the Trump administration were derailed.

“There is no current pilot program. It's basically dead in the water,” fellow whistleblower Fred Wynn said.

The whistleblowers filed a complaint in May 2018 with the Office of Special Counsel (which is separate from Robert Mueller’s former office with the same name). On Monday, after inquiries from Fox News, the Office of Special Counsel issued a rare statement.

“OSC fully supports these whistleblowers. While OSC does not typically comment on open investigations, we do want to point out that in this case, the Special Counsel determined there was a substantial likelihood of wrongdoing by CBP for its failure to collect DNA from undocumented detainees and arrestees,” spokesman Zachary Kurz said in the statement.

He said given the “serious law enforcement” and public safety implications, Special Counsel Henry J. Kerner even met with former Acting CBP Commissioner John Sanders and current Deputy Commissioner Bob Perez “urging them to revisit the decision not to collect DNA from CBP detainees and arrestees.”

The OSC statement backed in large part what the whistleblowers exclusively told Fox News about the DNA program that apparently was stalled from the start.

Records shared by the whistleblowers indicated that the program did not go forward under the Obama administration, after then-Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano got a waiver in 2010 from then-Attorney General Eric Holder, citing “severe organizational, resource and financial challenges.”

While the Obama administration put the original testing program on hold, the whistleblowers claimed the project was never meant to be on hold permanently. They said that in 2016 they were assigned to the DNA pilot program but ran into further blocks.

Unlike DNA kits that test whether individuals apprehended at the border are family members, the whistleblowers said the CBP pilot project was designed to take a larger DNA sample that would be run against the FBI’s Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), which covers violent crimes including sexual assault and rape.

Mark Jones alleged that during a 2018 Homeland Security conference call, officials discussed designing the program to be unsuccessful.

“The folks in that conference call said, we'll pick places we can make it fail,” he said, adding that’s what prompted them to reach out to the watchdog agency.

Jones lamented the implications of not taking the DNA program seriously.

“We have a great tool that was mandated by and approved by Congress as a law and we're not using it,” Jones said. “We are allowing ourselves to apprehend individuals and process them and by not taking the DNA sample, we're not giving our law enforcement -- both state and federal -- the additional tool to solve these outstanding crimes.”

Wynn added: “We can speculate that the kind of people who are getting through are the people who have a very good reason for wanting to evade detection, and that suggests individuals with criminal past.”

The whistleblowers demonstrated to Fox News how the old DNA testing kits were time-consuming and involved taking blood, while the new kits relied on a cheek swab and took under a minute.

Their allegations also raised questions about statements and actions at the senior levels of DHS.

Last spring, then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was peppered with questions on Capitol Hill about the program. Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., had pressed Nielsen on the DNA collection of “non-U.S. persons being detained under the United States laws,” calling it a “requirement.”

“We're working on the pilot right now,” Nielsen assured him. “We're in the planning stages and doing it in batches. Some of it is processing. We want to make sure we have the chain of custody.”

But that same month, whistleblowers said, there was a DHS conference call sealing the program’s fate -- though they did not identify the participants by name.

SIX REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS: HERE'S WHAT WE SAW ON OUR TRIP TO THE BORDER

Internal emails reviewed by Fox News raised questions about what now-Acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan knew. At the time of Nielsen’s testimony, in April 2018, McAleenan was head of CBP with direct responsibility.

The emails indicated that in February 2018, one of Nielsen’s senior staffers was alerted to the program’s troubled status. The whistleblowers said Nielsen backed the program and wanted progress.

Last week, Fox News asked a spokesman for the department if McAleenan discussed the issue with Nielsen in 2018, and what steps he took, if any, to implement the program or halt it. On Monday, the department would not comment on leadership discussions but issued a statement saying the program remained on hold.

“In response to further inquiries specific to the DNA collection for CODIS; CBP in coordination with DHS has explored and evaluated the DNA program in relation to the DNA collection for inclusion into CODIS. Upon review, it’s been determined that the exceptions noted in the 2010 waiver remain unchanged. There are currently no plans to change this waiver but DHS is moving forward on a DNA testing pilot to verify familial relationships,” a DHS official said in the statement to Fox News.

According to records reviewed by Fox News, CBP previously had maintained that the nearly-decade-old waiver – from the Obama administration – was still in place, the agency would need another waiver to kick-start the DNA program and detainees were transferred to other government agencies which then took the DNA.

The whistleblowers cast doubt on the last claim. “We know ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) is not collecting... far from collecting DNA from everyone we turn over to them. The numbers are very low, single-digit percentage,” Taylor said.

While the OSC has since weighed in, Kurz said the office did not have authority to conduct its own investigation – but rather, would refer allegations to other agencies and then review a final report.

“OSC is awaiting CBP’s written response to matters discussed in that meeting before continuing with its review of this matter,” Kurz said of the meeting Kerner had with CBP leaders. “Once the investigation is complete, documents associated with this case will be transmitted to the President and Congress, and will be made publicly available on OSC’s website.”"
Justice Department investigating whether Utah A.G.'s Office falsely obtained federal grants,https://www.ksl.com,"['Dennis Romboy', 'Ksl', 'Posted - Jul']",,,,https://www.ksl.com/article/46599809/justice-department-investigating-whether-utah-ags-office-falsely-obtained-federal-grants,"SALT LAKE CITY — The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating whether several state criminal justice agencies, including the Utah Attorney General’s Office, made false statements to obtain federal grants.

The investigation came to light in a recent court filing by the DOJ Office of Inspector General asking a federal judge to force the state to turn over records it has refused to provide.

The DOJ served a subpoena on an assistant Utah attorney general on April 2, but the state has yet to comply, according to documents filed last week in U.S. District Court in Salt Lake City.

“The purpose of the subpoena is to determine whether respondent failed to meet its legal and contractual responsibilities when executing grants with the Department of Justice,” the filing says.

Federal investigators contend the attorney general’s office, Utah Department of Public Safety, Utah Administrative Office of the Courts, Utah Commission on Criminal and Juvenile Justice and Utah Juvenile Justice Services falsely represented job losses due to budget cuts in order to obtain grant funding from 2009 to 2013, according to court documents.

Investigators also allege the state agencies made false certifications of compliance with federal mandates, resulting in them receiving money to which they were not entitled.

In a statement late Monday, the attorney general's office said the case involves conduct that predates Attorney General Sean Reyes and his current leadership team.

“It involves allegations related to numerous state agencies. As part of its constitutional duties, the Utah AGO is representing those agencies in this matter,"" the statement indicated. “The Utah AGO has cooperated with the OIG investigation to the maximum extent allowable under legal and ethical rules and has been following strict orders of this court not to disclose anything publicly.”

“In fact, the federal court overseeing this matter issued an order/gave explicit instructions that our office could not discuss in public/with the media the substantive issues in this case.”

The statement affirmed the attorney general's office does not believe the comment issued Monday was a violation of the instruction not to speak publicly.

The federal court overseeing this matter issued an order/gave explicit instructions that our office could not discuss in public/with the media the substantive issues in this case.

The investigation started in January 2015. Specifically at issue is whether the state supplanted or used federal funds to replace money the state had already appropriated for the same purpose, according to a declaration by Cynthia Roberts, a special agent in the DOJ Inspector General's Office.

Roberts' declaration says the records are needed to ascertain whether the state used the funds appropriately.

The grants came through the DOJ’s Bureau of Justice Assistance and the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, including money for the attorney general’s Internet Crimes Against Children task force. The other state agencies received money from the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program, court documents show.

The federal programs administer grants for state and local governments to reduce violent and drug-related crime, support law enforcement, help crime victims and develop initiatives for juveniles.

The subpoena seeks job creation and retention records, personnel records for workers funded by the grants, documents on hiring and employee transfers and communications regarding complaints, objections inquiries regard job creation retention. It required the state to provide the documents by April 29, but the attorney general’s office “failed to produce a single document,"" the court filing says.

Federal investigators contacted the attorney general’s office “numerous” times by phone and email. The requests were met with promises to produce documents, but no documents have ever been produced, according to the court filing.

The attorney general's office ""repeatedly"" told investigators that various employees were gathering the documents but for some reason were not able to finish the task.

“Because of the importance of the Inspector General’s investigation, the United States requests this court summarily enforce the subpoena,” the filing says.

Lawmaker from a Lyme-plagued district demands to know if DoD scientists ever used infected ticks as weapons,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Ellen Ioanes'],07-22-2019,2019,7,https://www.businessinsider.com/new-jersey-chris-smith-dod-ticks-bioweapons-2019-7,"The US military has a long history of developing dangerous chemical weapons, from Agent Orange, a defoliant that has left Vietnam-era vets with Leukemia and other life-threatening illnesses, to the nerve agent VX, which killed North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's half-brother Kim Jong Nam in minutes in 2017.

But a New Jersey lawmaker is concerned that the Pentagon may be hiding research about developing Lyme disease as a biological weapon, part of an unlikely theory that these alleged experiments led to increased Lyme disease infections in the US.

Rep. Christopher Smith of New Jersey proposed an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which passed the House last week, requiring the Department of Defense Inspector General investigate whether the DoD experimented with using ticks to spread diseases like Lyme between 1950 and 1975.

Smith's amendment is based on the idea that insects infected with Lyme disease may have escaped from government labs at Plum Island, New York, and Fort Detrick, Maryland and then begun infecting the civilian population.

""Lyme Disease is endemic to his District. The recently published book ['Bitten'] leaves questions about tick-borne diseases as bioweapons unanswered,"" Julia Nesta, a spokesperson for Smith, told INSIDER via email. Smith's office did not respond to a request for further information.

Smith's office referred to ""Bitten: The Secret History of Lyme Disease,"" by Kris Newby, a science writer and former Lyme sufferer. ""Bitten"" relies on interviews with the late Willy Burgdorfer, a Swiss-born scientist who worked as a bioweapons specialist for the Defense Department and is credited with discovering the bacteria that causes Lyme disease.

Smith said there was evidence that Burgdorfer and his colleagues ""stuffed ticks with pathogens to cause severe disability, disease — even death — to potential enemies.""

""With Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases exploding in the United States — with an estimated 300,000 to 437,000 new cases diagnosed each year and 10-20 percent of all patients suffering from chronic Lyme disease — Americans have a right to know whether any of this is true,"" Smith said on the House floor.

Newby's book posits that the DoD research facilities could have released diseased ticks into the general population, causing an increase in Lyme disease cases during the middle of the 20th century, according to Newsweek.

Plum Island Fire Department firefighters decontaminate their suits after identifying several hazardous materials during a collective training event at the Plum Island Animal Disease Research Facility, New York, May 2, 2018. The event brought together the resources of several fire departments, the 106th Air Rescue Wing, the 24th Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Team, and the Department of Homeland Security to respond to a simulated containment breach at the research facility Sgt. Harley Jelis / (U.S. Army National Guard / DVIDS

Newby spoke with INSIDER via phone, saying that Burgdorfer's original lab notes and and letters, as well as interviews with the scientist when he was in his 80s and suffering from Parkinson's, suggest that he was putting biological agents like Venezuelan equine encephalitis in ticks. Newby said that the insects that concerned her were those infected with Lyme and another illness — what she calls a ""germ gang bang.""

While Lyme can be very serious if untreated, it is often curable with antibiotics and wouldn't cause an immediate disruption on the battlefield, like VX or other deadly chemical weapons would. Newby said she spoke with a former CIA operative who said he dropped two canisters of infested ticks over Cuba in 1962, during Operation Mongoose.

While Newby said that the operation ""probably didn't work,"" she told INSIDER that ""bug-borne weapons are the perfect weapon"" because they're difficult to protect yourself against, and they don't destroy infrastructure.

Still, ticks are unlikely to have been useful as a weapon. They can't bite individuals with any specificity or on any timeline, and the effects take days or weeks to affect a person's health. There's also little evidence that tick populations in North America were impacted by proximity to these DoD labs.

Dr. Richard S. Ostfeld, a researcher at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem studies, told INSIDER that the tick that spreads Lyme ""was known to exist throughout the eastern United States before the discovery of Lyme disease in the 1970s and 80s, so the evidence regarding the distribution of the tick is not consistent with the notion that it was somehow released on Plum Island.""

Ostfeld also said that Idoxes, or blacklegged, ticks, which carry Lyme, ""are frequently infected with multiple disease agents"" and that ""the main source of these multiple infections in ticks is small wild mammals like white-footed mice and eastern chipmunks.""

The House vote will add $1 million to the Centers for Disease Control's Lyme research budget and require the Pentagon to report on ""whether any ticks or insects used in such experiments were released outside of any laboratory by accident or experiment design.""

The Pentagon Inspector General did not respond to INSIDER's request for comment on this story. The government facilities at Fort Ditrick and Plum Island did not respond to emails seeking comment."
EPA Makes Changes to Refrigerant Regulations,https://www.kdlt.com,[],07-22-2019,2019,7,https://www.kdlt.com/2019/07/22/epa-changes-regulation-to-refrigerant/,"EPA Makes Changes to Refrigerant Regulations

EPA to phase-out Freon in 2020 and replace it with Puron

SIOUX FALLS, SD— There is a change in the air.

Beginning January 1st, the EPA will phase-out the refrigerant R-22, better known as Freon.

Instead, it’ll be replaced by Puron or R410A.

Experts say it’s more environmentally friendly.

“The ozone depletion level of R410A was much less than R22. So, it acted as a refrigerant to replace R22,” said Mark Lamb, service manager for Frisbee’s.

According to Lamb, the air conditioning industry has been preparing for the change for about 5 years.

With R22 being phased out, the price of the refrigerant is going to increase significantly.

“If you have a component built with the R22 system, you’re always going to have to replace R22 back in the system. It’s going to be a much higher cost than R410A,” said Lamb.

In order to tell which refrigerant your air conditioner takes, that can be found on the side of the unit.

Meanwhile, switching to the new system could cost anywhere between $3,000 to $5,000.

But Lamb says that’s still the cheaper route.

Whatever option you choose, you don’t want to mix Freon and Puron.

“At that point, if that did happen and your refrigerants did mix, we would have to take it to a refrigerant recycling company, and they have to actually destroy the refrigerant because they can’t separate,” said Lamb.

This requested increase comes in spite of the fact the 2019 VA budget is just under $200 billion under current non-defense spending levels, which is more than double what the VA budget was over a decade ago. The extraordinary increase in the VA budget has far outpaced the growth of patients and beneficiaries and has occurred during a decline in the overall veteran population.

Ensuring veterans get the care and benefits they earned is a critical part of the social contract our country has made with those who put their lives on the line in our defense. It is therefore vital to our national security to have a properly funded VA. But there is a difference between providing the resources the VA needs to accomplish its mission and raising federal budget levels to spend billions more on the VA without a meaningful assessment of whether those additional funds are needed.

Unfortunately, Congress has too often taken the latter approach, to the detriment of veterans and American taxpayers alike.

In 2014, it was revealed that veterans across the country were dying on secret lists while waiting for VA health care. Some ardent defenders of the VA claimed the long wait times for care were a result of lack of funding. But the Obama administration had massively increased the VA’s budget in the previous five years – growing more than $50 billion from 2009 to 2014. In the aftermath of the 2014 scandal, Congress passed and President Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaConservative former NFL player says Trump met with him to discuss 'black America' Using the VA Mission Act to justify raising federal spending levels is bad for veterans and taxpayers Trump struggles to win over voters reaping economic boom MORE signed into law a measure that gave the VA another $15 billion increase. In subsequent years the VA budget would continue to grow, reaching its current level of nearly $200 billion.

Despite the influx of resources, veterans continued to die on wait lists and receive poor quality care. The reason is simple: Congress and prior presidential administrations refused to thoroughly address systemic issues within the VA that wasted money and hindered its health care delivery. They chose the easier path of just writing the VA a bigger check.

For example, as of 2017, most of the VA’s medical facilities were more than 50 years old. Considering the shrinking size and changing demographics of the veteran population, most of these facilities are not in the best locations to provide the best and most convenient care. Many VA hospitals are operating either at significant under-capacity or over-capacity. For primarily political reasons, Congress prevented the VA from shifting infrastructure resources to account for this dynamic. Instead, the agency has been forced to spend billions maintaining aging and underutilized facilities.

Fortunately, the VA MISSION Act included provisions mandating the VA undertake an infrastructure review to ensure that funds for facilities are spent to best serve veterans and not wasted on unnecessary or outdated buildings. Additionally, the law consolidated the VA’s community care programs and greatly expanded health care choice for veterans. Unlike many past efforts effort to reform the VA, the VA MISSION Act took a different approach then just simply spending more money – it fundamentally changed how the VA delivers health care to veterans.

The current overall federal spending levels provide more than enough budgetary flexibility to pay for any additional expenses incurred by the implementation of the VA MISSION Act. Further raising spending levels to provide additional money for the already-funded VA MISSION Act, as Pelosi is demanding, would set a bad precedent while also disincentivizing further reforms within the VA that would reduce waste and improve care for our veterans.

No one wants to shortchange those who sacrificed in service of our country. But as recent history has shown, simply dumping more money into the VA without real reform serves neither our veterans nor taxpayers. With a $22 trillion national debt posing a growing threat to our national security, additional unnecessary spending puts at risk the future of the very country our veterans fought to defend.

Homeland Security’s cuts in counterterrorism programs assailed,https://www.latimes.com,"['Staff Writer', 'David Willman Is A Reporter For The Los Angeles Times Based In Washington']",07-22-2019,2019,7,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2019-07-22/trump-administration-counterterrorism-cutbacks-criticized,"A senior House member said Monday that he will explore legislation to prevent the Department of Homeland Security from diverting funds from critical research and programs on tracking nuclear material that could be used in a terrorist attack.

Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank), who heads the House Intelligence Committee, said that the gutting of programs intended to thwart potential terrorist attacks involving weapons of mass destruction over the last two years was a “dereliction of duty” and has put the nation at greater risk of potential catastrophic attack.

A recently published Times investigative report revealed that multiple WMD-related programs have been cut back sharply or eliminated since 2017 at Homeland Security, which has primary domestic responsibility for helping authorities identify and block chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats.

“Reducing staffing and capabilities to respond to WMD attacks, including nuclear terrorism, is shortsighted at best, and could be devastating in the event of an attack,” Schiff said in a statement.

According to an aide, Schiff is considering a legislative remedy within Homeland Security’s pending congressional appropriation.

Schiff sponsored legislation in 2010 that authorized the creation of the National Technical Nuclear Forensics Center at Homeland Security to strengthen detection and tracing capabilities that might deter a hostile foreign state from slipping radiological or nuclear material to terrorists.

Over the last two years, the center’s leadership has left and its staff has shrunk from about 14 to three, one of multiple shifts and cutbacks in the counterterrorism programs at Homeland Security.

“That the Trump administration is letting that capability wither away ... is a dereliction of duty,” Schiff said in a written statement.

Among the programs affected was an elite Homeland Security “red team,” which previously conducted dozens of drills and assessments each year to help federal, state and local officials detect such potential threats as an improvised nuclear device concealed in a suitcase, or a cargo ship carrying a radiation-spewing dirty bomb.

Another Homeland Security unit had helped lead up to 20 WMD-related training exercises each year with state and local authorities. The unit participated in fewer than 10 such exercises last year and even fewer so far this year.

The department’s International Cooperation Division, which worked closely with foreign counterparts and the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency to track and stop the smuggling of dangerous nuclear materials overseas, has been disbanded.

In an interview Sunday, John Roth, who served as Homeland Security’s inspector general from 2014 to 2017, said that the reported shifts and cutbacks merit congressional scrutiny.

“My recommendation would be rigorous oversight hearings and investigations of what’s going on,” said Roth, a former federal prosecutor and Justice Department official.

The WMD-related cutbacks and shifts have been directed by James F. McDonnell, whom President Trump appointed to successive Homeland Security positions in 2017 and 2018.

McDonnell declined through a spokeswoman to be interviewed about the changes, and Homeland Security did not answer written questions about the matter. The department didn’t respond to a request for comment Monday regarding Schiff’s remarks.

Roth said he believes the WMD-related developments likely stem from turmoil at the top of Homeland Security. Since taking office, Trump has gone through two secretaries of Homeland Security and the department now is led by an acting secretary.

Several other top-level appointive positions at Homeland Security remain unfilled, including the deputy secretary and the undersecretary for management.

“When you have significant vacancies in key leadership positions,” Roth said, “you’re basically going to get people who do whatever they want, and aren’t being held accountable.”

The Times reported that $162.2 million — about 40% of the money Congress appropriated last year for the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office, which McDonnell heads — went unspent. That should be a “huge red flag” to Homeland Security’s most senior leaders, Roth said.

“Every dollar obligated to one component is unavailable to others,” Roth noted. “I would be asking some hard questions.”"
"Oh, how Europe hates Republican presidents",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/oh-how-europe-hates-republican-presidents,"The revelation of U.K. Ambassador Kim Darroch’s view on President Trump is a timely reminder of how biased Europe is against the American Right.

For people who deem themselves to be sophisticated and nuanced, European leaders, their followers, and the European media are little more than sophomoric and predictable when it comes to judging U.S. presidents. Darroch’s opinions aren’t problematic because they are negative towards Trump; rather, they are problematic because they are utterly predictable and therefore contain little useful information for U.K. leaders.

I’ve spent a good deal of time over the last 15 years working with Europeans, spending time in Europe, advising Europeans across the continent, and hosting European media members in the U.S. during presidential and midterm elections. That extensive exposure to European elites has led me to these conclusions.

Over the last 40 years, the U.S. has elected six presidents, four Republicans and two Democrats. With the exception of George H.W. Bush, who presided over Ronald Reagan’s third term and the collapse of the Soviet Union, Europe’s knee-jerk reaction to the remaining U.S. presidents has fit too nicely into two categories.

Specifically, if the U.S. president was a registered Democrat like Bill Clinton or Barack Obama, Europe swooned with praise over his election and found little to fault in his presidency. If, however, the U.S. president was a registered Republican like Reagan, George W. Bush, or Trump, then Europe predicted the end of the world due to his election and found little to praise in his presidency. The same goes for those men and women who ran, but lost. Democrats Jimmy Carter, Walter Mondale, Michael Dukakis, Al Gore, John Kerry, and Hillary Clinton were all deemed superior candidates in Europe; Republicans Bob Dole, John McCain (the pre-anti-Trump version), and Mitt Romney were viewed as threats to the world order.

Obama’s selection to receive the Nobel Peace Prize before he even did anything as president is the prime example of European irrationality over Democratic presidents. Yes, of course, Obama’s election to the presidency was historic, but the world didn’t become more peaceful by that election. Its mildly coincidental that Carter and Gore also got Nobel Peace Prizes for failing to secure the peace, yet Reagan and Bush 41 received no accolades for ending the Cold War and defeating the Soviet Union, thereby freeing tens of millions from the yoke of communism and ushering in an era of relative global peace.

Moreover, Europeans gush over the intellectual prowess of Democratic U.S. presidents despite little evidence that figures like Clinton or Obama are mental giants. In stark contrast, Republican presidents are always deemed dimwitted despite as much or more evidence of their intellectual prowess. For every Bush 43 verbal slip, there is an Obama gaffe to match. Except for Midwesterner Reagan who went to a small Illinois college, the rest attended Ivy League schools with the elite of America. Europeans can quibble over how each got in or how he did once in, but, again, the quibbling always ends up with the Democrat being brilliant and deserving and the Republican being dumb and privileged.

Finally, on the issue of foreign policy, Europeans believe Democratic presidents are always reasoned peacemakers who fully understand the delicate balance of the international order and the importance of supranational organizations. They also believe Republican presidents are reckless cowboys, warmongers, and heavy-handed dolts incapable of comprehending how to navigate the international stage and who wrongfully disdains global groups.

Yet, it was Obama who used drones to kill so many, including Americans abroad without due process. And it is Trump trying to extricate America from Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan. Trump’s efforts to stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons (it didn’t cease trying to after signing a worthless deal with Obama) and to bring North Korea into the 21st century should be applauded. Instead, Europeans charge the anti-interventionist Trump wants a war with Iran (read: they want to protect their corporate contracts with Iran) and belittle every move he makes to defang Kim Jong Un.

No matter how the coin lands in Europe, Democrats always win, and Republicans always lose. It just isn’t possible that every Democratic U.S. president is great and every Republican president is terrible. That overly simplistic European view is boring, old, and beyond ready for the ash heap of history.

Perhaps the transatlantic alliance would be stronger if Europeans stopped worshipping Democratic presidents and denigrating Republican presidents. Such caricatures are good for movies, perhaps, but not for allies.

Opinion: VA secretary uses religious liberty to delay veterans' claims,https://www.sctimes.com,"['Patricia Wilson', 'Times Writers Group', 'Published P.M. Ct July']",07-22-2019,2019,7,https://www.sctimes.com/story/opinion/2019/07/22/va-secretary-uses-religious-liberty-delay-veterans-claims-agent-organge-vietnam-korea-court-battle/1796376001/,"CLOSE

The Department of Veterans Affairs issued a press release July 5 announcing the extension of Agent Orange claims for “Blue Water Navy” veterans.

Agent Orange was the toxic herbicide used to clear plants and trees in battle zones in Korea and in Vietnam. Vietnam veterans who served offshore of Vietnam between Jan. 9, 1962-May 7, 1975, and veterans who served in or near the demilitarized zone in Korea from April 1, 1968-Aug. 31, 1971 are eligible for benefits.

The 2019 Blue Water Navy Veterans Act was signed into law June 25. According to the VA press release, 420,000 to 560,000 Vietnam veterans may be considered Blue Water Navy Veterans. The law goes into effect Jan 1. Korean War veterans in their late 80s may not live long enough to collect these benefits.

VA Secretary Robert Wilkie stated, “VA is dedicated to ensuring that all veterans receive the benefits they have earned.” Wilkie further stated the VA will not begin to process the claims until Jan. 1 “we are working to ensure we have the proper resources in place to meet the needs of our Blue Water Veterans community and minimize the impact on all veterans filing for disability compensation.”

Wilkie fails to mention the VA denied these claims for years, and fought a bitter court battle before Congress could finally pass the bill.

VA benefit claim representatives will not begin to deal with a backlog estimated to be 420,000 to 560,000 claims until Jan. 1 because they do not have to comply until that date.

Wilkie found a cause, which is of such importance, that he issued a press release on July 3 to let the public know the VA is overhauling religious and spiritual symbols to protect the religious liberty of veterans effective immediately.

The reason given for this urgent action by Wilkie is “to make sure that all our veterans and their families feel welcome at VA no matter their religious beliefs.”

In what universe have veterans been beating the doors of their local VA Medical Center and demanding Bibles?

Veterans know every VA medical center has an all-faith chapel or meditation room. A VA may also have a reflection garden, hall of harmony, or corners of meditation, depending on the size of the VA facility. At smaller clinics, VA personnel have a list of local religious leaders to assist a veteran in need of spiritual care.

Like many of my sister and brother veterans, I have spent time in VA waiting rooms to see a health provider. In over 15 years of care from various VA medical centers across the country, I have never witnessed a veteran being upset or on a rant because a Bible was not sitting on a table with the rest of the reading materials.

The waiting room conversations revolve around the weather, what branch of the military you served in and when. Veterans also tend to relate their personal experiences in getting care at the VA and if they have had problems with their benefit claims.

Nothing gets the attention of the public quicker than to mention religion. Wilkie is using this as a distraction from the backlog of claims.

Jeremy Redmon of the Atlanta Journal Constitution, in a July 14 article, cited the fact that, “the backlog just to achieve eligibility for VA care is 317,157 claims.”

Veterans know they have religious freedom. We all took the same oath to protect and defend the Constitution, which guarantees that freedom among others. Veterans want their claims for eligibility processed, their disability claims handled in a fair and timely manner, and health care they earned.

When I walk through the doors of Building 1 at the St. Cloud VA, I am not there for a prayer meeting. I am there to receive the best possible health care from one of the better VA centers in the country.

Let us handle our religious beliefs Secretary Wilkie. You get busy and light a fire under the VA to process the paperwork that will grant veterans the care they need now!

This is the opinion of Patricia Wilson, a veteran and a resident of St. Cloud. Her column appears on the fourth Tuesday of the month.

Justice Department investigating whether Utah Attorney General's Office falsely obtained federal grants,https://www.deseretnews.com,"['Dennis Romboy', 'Dennis Has Spent The Past Years Covering Government', 'Human Services.', 'Romboy Deseretnews.Com']",07-22-2019,2019,7,https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900080783/utah-attorney-generals-office-false-federal-grants-justice-department-investigation.html,"SALT LAKE CITY — The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating whether several state criminal justice agencies, including the Utah Attorney General’s Office, made false statements to obtain federal grants.

The investigation came to light in a recent court filing by the DOJ Office of Inspector General asking a federal judge to force the state to turn over records it has refused to provide.

The DOJ served a subpoena on an assistant Utah attorney general on April 2, but the state has yet to comply, according to documents filed last week in U.S. District Court in Salt Lake City.

“The purpose of the subpoena is to determine whether respondent failed to meet its legal and contractual responsibilities when executing grants with the Department of Justice,” the filing says.

Federal investigators contend the attorney general’s office, Utah Department of Public Safety, Utah Administrative Office of the Courts, Utah Commission on Criminal and Juvenile Justice and Utah Juvenile Justice Services falsely represented job losses due to budget cuts in order to obtain grant funding from 2009 to 2013, according to court documents.

Investigators also allege the state agencies made false certifications of compliance with federal mandates, resulting in them receiving money to which they were not entitled.

In a statement late Monday, the attorney general's office said the case involves conduct that predates Attorney General Sean Reyes and his current leadership team.

“It involves allegations related to numerous state agencies. As part of its constitutional duties, the Utah AGO is representing those agencies in this matter,"" the statement indicated. “The Utah AGO has cooperated with the OIG investigation to the maximum extent allowable under legal and ethical rules and has been following strict orders of this court not to disclose anything publicly.”

“In fact, the federal court overseeing this matter issued an order/gave explicit instructions that our office could not discuss in public/with the media the substantive issues in this case.”

The statement affirmed the attorney general's office does not believe the comment issued Monday was a violation of the instruction not to speak publicly.

The investigation started in January 2015. Specifically at issue is whether the state supplanted or used federal funds to replace money the state had already appropriated for the same purpose, according to a declaration by Cynthia Roberts, a special agent in the DOJ Inspector General's Office.

Roberts' declaration says the records are needed to ascertain whether the state used the funds appropriately.

The grants came through the DOJ’s Bureau of Justice Assistance and the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, including money for the attorney general’s Internet Crimes Against Children task force. The other state agencies received money from the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program, court documents show.

The federal programs administer grants for state and local governments to reduce violent and drug-related crime, support law enforcement, help crime victims and develop initiatives for juveniles.

The subpoena seeks job creation and retention records, personnel records for workers funded by the grants, documents on hiring and employee transfers and communications regarding complaints, objections inquiries regard job creation retention. It required the state to provide the documents by April 29, but the attorney general’s office “failed to produce a single document,"" the court filing says.

Federal investigators contacted the attorney general’s office “numerous” times by phone and email. The requests were met with promises to produce documents, but no documents have ever been produced, according to the court filing.

The attorney general's office ""repeatedly"" told investigators that various employees were gathering the documents but for some reason were not able to finish the task.

“Because of the importance of the Inspector General’s investigation, the United States requests this court summarily enforce the subpoena,” the filing says."
Austin Housing Authority Buys Private Apartments to Rent to Section 8 Tenants,https://nextcity.org,[],,,,https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/austin-housing-authority-buys-private-apartments-rent-to-section-8-tenants,"“The need for this program far exceeds available resources.”

That was how the Housing Authority of the City of Austin put it when it reopened its waitlist for Housing Choice Vouchers last September for the first time in four years. The Housing Choice Voucher program, which was previously known as Section 8, helps low-income families make up the difference between the cost of rent on the private market and what they’re able to afford. In 2014, the last time the Authority opened the waitlist, it got 20,000 applicants. It whittled them down to 2,500 through a lottery. It was expecting to do the same again last year, randomly selecting another 2,000 applicants just to get in the line for a voucher.

But even when a family gets a voucher, says Michael Gerber, president and CEO of the housing authority, they may find it very difficult to find a landlord who will accept it. As Next City has reported before, Texas landlords are allowed to reject tenants based on their source of income. And like a lot of growing cities, Austin is facing a critical shortage of affordable housing across the board, which is especially acute at the lowest end of the income scale.

“While a housing authority I don’t think has a responsibility for fixing all of [the housing shortage], we certainly feel a responsibility to try to address it as best we can,” Gerber says. “It’s hard to say to that resident, ‘Here’s a housing choice voucher. We know you’re not going to be able to use it.’”

So as part of its effort to make more housing available to voucher holders, the housing authority is continuing to expand a strategy of acquiring housing units on the private market and making some of them affordable for low and moderate-income people. Recently, the housing authority, in partnership with the affordable-housing investment group Community Development Trust, bought a 452-unit apartment complex in Southeast Austin, as the Austin American-Statesman reported. The authority is planning to rent the units to tenants earning no more than 80 percent of median family income, which works out to $48,200 for an individual or $68,800 for a family of four. And it’s planning to market at least 15 percent of the units to voucher holders and tenants receiving assistance through HUD’s Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing program.

The project, called The Bridge at Asher Apartments, is pushing into more valuable real-estate territory than a lot of the Authority’s other projects, Gerber says. It’s adjacent to a growing commercial area, and none of the other properties in that area were accepting housing choice vouchers, according to Gerber. It’s also near high-quality schools, which is why the Kresge Foundation and the National Housing Trust supported the project with a $4 million grant from the HOPE Fund, which helps establish low-income housing near good schools. It’s also a shorter commute to downtown, where the jobs are, Gerber says.

“We’re excited to be there,” Gerber says. “It’s a big property, and it’s a challenging property, but it’s an exciting property for us and it’s getting awfully close to those southern suburbs which are becoming so desirable.”

The Austin Housing Authority recently purchased this property, The Bridge at Asher Apartments, in partnership with Community Development Trust. It will rent the units to families holding Housing Choice Vouchers (also known as Section 8).

Adrianne Todman, CEO of The National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials (NAHRO), which represents housing authorities and community development agencies, says that most public housing authorities currently focus on preserving the public units in their ownership and building new projects with federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credits. The Housing Authority of the City of Austin has done a good job of acting as a proactive housing provider in the city, Todman says.

“Austin is looked at as one of the most innovative agencies in the country, and it has solid leadership,” Todman says.

In many places, Todman says, city leaders have seen public housing and housing authorities as something that’s outside their purview — “something that’s happening over there,” she says. But as affordable housing becomes an issue that is impacting more people in more places at different income levels, some cities are starting to look to their housing authorities as assets, she says. Some housing authorities — like the King County Housing Authority near Seattle — have been able to acquire housing on the private market and convert or preserve it for lower-income residents.

“For most housing authorities, that is not something that they do, but where it’s being done it’s being done really well,” Todman says. “And one of the goals we have at NAHRO is helping other groups learn how to really become a local player.”

In Austin, the city council and the mayor have also brought a productive focus to issues of housing affordability, Gerber says. This past spring, the city council passed a plan called Affordability Unlocked, which creates incentives in the former of greater density and looser regulations for projects that are geared toward tenants earning less than 60 percent of the median income, as Next City has reported. And last fall, voters approved a $250 million bond intended to finance affordable housing construction and preservation. Those programs dovetail with the housing authority’s acquisition strategy, Gerber says. At another project, the authority was able to use the Affordability Unlocked rules to reduce the number of parking spaces to what it believes the residents there will actually need and expand the amount of green space on the site and the size of a connected community center, Gerber says. And it plans to apply for funds from the most recent housing bond, which it has not done in the past, he says.

Many policies in Austin and elsewhere are focused on incentivizing private developers to construct affordable housing. But public housing authorities serve a group of residents whose needs are greater than the market is likely to ever provide, Gerber says. The typical voucher holder in Austin earns less than $13,000 a year, according to Gerber, and the authority disproportionately serves seniors, people with disabilities, families with children, and people transitioning out of homelessness. Acquiring more property will help it find new ways to serve those people, Gerber says.

“We are a piece of the affordability puzzle in Austin,” he says. “We’re trying to do our part.”"
DHS hikes threshold for investors to buy 'golden visa' into U.S.,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Stephen Dinan']",07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jul/23/dhs-hikes-threshold-investors-buy-golden-visa-us/,"Investors looking to buy their way into a pathway to citizenship in the U.S. will have to pony up far more money in the future, under a new regulation Homeland Security posted Tuesday.

The standard investment will now be $1.8 million, up from $1 million, and the discount rate for people who invest in economically troubled areas will be $900,000, up from $500,000 under the old rules.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services also said it’s tightening rules to prevent people from abusing the definition of economically troubled areas.

The changes are to what’s known as the EB-5 visa, which rewards people willing to invest their money in the U.S. with green cards. They must meet an investment minimum and show their money is responsible for creating or sustaining jobs.

The program has been rife with reports of fraud, and the investment amounts have not kept up with inflation.

Acting USCIS Director Ken Cuccinelli said Monday the program had “drifted” away from its original goals. The new rules, he said, will restore the direction Congress intended.

“Our reforms increase the investment level to account for inflation over the past three decades and substantially restrict the possibility of gerrymandering to ensure that the reduced investment amount is reserved for rural and high-unemployment areas most in need,” he said.

Many countries have what’s known in the wealthy migrant community as a “golden visa,” or a chance to earn residency by investing in that nation.

The $500,000 minimum investment for the U.S. has been at the low end of the scale.

France’s program, for example, required a 10 million Euro investment that would create or save at least 50 jobs.

Spain asked for a 1 million Euro deposit in a Spanish bank or investment in a company, or else a purchase of 2 million Euro of Spanish public debt.

The U.K., meanwhile, asked for a 2 million pound investment to gain temporary residence. The British program, which had become particularly sought-after by wealthy Russians and Chinese, came under fire over corruption allegations last year.

In the U.S., the EB-5 program has become a significant source of funding for real estate development projects — and has produced some high-profile instances of fraud, including ski resorts in Vermont that regulators described as Ponzi schemes.

The Government Accountability Office and the Securities and Exchange Commission have both been active in warning of fraud.

The EB-5 program regularly comes up for review in Congress, and some key critics, including Sen. Chuck Grassley, the most senior Republican in the Senate, had tried to force changes. His efforts met with resistance.

Mr. Grassley on Tuesday praised President Trump and USCIS for making progress where Congress had failed.

“By implementing these EB-5 rules, he is keeping his word to drain the swamp and bring new opportunities to rural America as well as communities in need,” Mr. Grassley said. “This rule not only brings more integrity to our immigration system, it also brings new jobs to America.”

Grassley and others have raised the possibility of a legislative response to the FOIA rule, decrying what they call a culture of secrecy coming from the federal government.

Lawmakers and media outlets have been vocal in their concerns about the rule, saying it would limit access to information by giving political appointees more power to determine whether documents are “responsive” to a requester's query.

EPA spokesman Michael Abboud said the agency ""has no plans to withdraw the finalized rule"" in a Monday statement to The Hill.

""As we have said this rule will enhance transparency and efficiency of responses to FOIA requests. Allegations made that the rule is changing the political appointees role in FOIA are false and irresponsible,"" Abboud said.

The senators said the rule would give political appointees, including the administrator, the power to issue final determinations whether to release or withhold documents in response to FOIA requests.

“Expressly affirming appointees’ authority to issue final determinations may embolden future senior officials and increase the chances — under any administration — that final FOIA determinations are unnecessarily delayed or driven by political considerations rather than the law,” they wrote.

They were also concerned by an aspect of the rule that would allow political appointees to hold back portions of records, something they say does not fit under the current exemptions allowed by law and also violates a recent court decision that requires turning over a full record once it has been deemed responsive.

“You could have a situation where there is a pile of documents that the FOIA officer thinks is responsive and have a political appointee overrule them and say, 'I don’t think those documents are responsive because that’s not exactly what that person was looking for,’” Matt Topic, government transparency and First Amendment lawyer at Loevy & Loevy, a Chicago-based firm that specializes in civil rights, previously told The Hill. “There's a lot of opportunity to screw around with that.""

Earlier this month, the Society for Environmental Journalists along the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and 37 other news media organizations sent a letter to the EPA asking it to suspend the implementation of the FOIA rule in order to allow a public comment period.

Environmental groups have also pushed back against the rule.

“Any politicization of FOIA undermines its core functions of enabling the public to inform itself on what its government is up to, and to hold officials accountable for those actions,” the groups wrote in the letter, saying they were “concerned that this new rule will unduly impair the public’s right and ability to apprise itself of important agency actions.”"

Falling asleep during meetings. An unsuccessful attempt to screw over Democrats. Not being as rich as previously claimed.

Thousands Freed From Prison Custody As DOJ Implements Sentencing Reform Law,https://www.npr.org,['Carrie Johnson'],07-19-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/2019/07/19/743502961/thousands-freed-from-prison-custody-as-doj-implements-sentencing-reform-law,"Thousands Freed From Prison Custody As DOJ Implements Sentencing Reform Law

Updated at 4:11 p.m. ET

More than 3,100 people will leave Bureau of Prisons custody starting Friday, part of what Justice Department officials call ""a truly monumental effort"" to comply with the First Step Act, a criminal justice law passed by Congress last year.

Most of the offenders being freed have been convicted of drug-related crimes and have been living in halfway houses across the United States in preparation for their release, acting BOP chief Hugh Hurwitz told reporters at a news conference in Washington.

About 900 of the inmates are subject to detention by local authorities or immigration officials, and their fate will be up to states or the Department of Homeland Security, he said.

The Justice Department announced that 250 more inmates who are elderly or terminally ill have transitioned into home confinement or compassionate-release programs since President Trump signed the law last December.

Those programs existed in some form before the First Step Act, but advocates for prisoners and their families said they were used only sparingly and now are somewhat easier to access.

""The department intends to implement this law fully and on time, with the goal of reducing crime, enhancing public safety and strengthening the rule of law,"" said Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen.

Authorities also unveiled a new risk assessment tool designed to identify prisoners who could benefit from prison programming that would allow them to win credits that count toward early release under the law.

Inmates will be reassessed every six months under that new program.

In a joint statement, Sens. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said they would ""vigilantly"" review the new risk assessment system.

""It's critical that the assessment does not disproportionately designate minorities as having a higher risk of reoffending,"" the senators said.

Questions about implementation

The Justice Department enlisted a think tank, the Hudson Institute, to assist with the assessment effort. But that decision has come under fire from key Democrats in Congress.

""The Hudson Institute and its leadership have opposed sentencing reform, opposed the First Step Act's reforms, and authored an article entitled 'Why Trump Should Oppose Criminal Justice Reform,' "" as House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and subcommittee chairwoman Karen Bass, D-Calif., said earlier this year.

""We are concerned that the selection of a biased organization lacking requisite expertise may reflect a lack of intent to diligently and effectively implement the bipartisan criminal justice reforms,"" they said.

Advocates seeking to overhaul the federal system welcomed news Friday that the Justice Department is moving ahead to implement the First Step Act. But they said they have ongoing concerns about funding and oversight, and they want Congress to hold the administration accountable.

Attorney General William Barr has been the subject of criticism that he holds outdated views about crime and punishment from the earlier era when he served as attorney general.

""There's a lot of skepticism over whether this Justice Department is going to fully implement the law,"" said Inimai Chettiar, legislative and policy director for the Justice Action Network.

""We definitely believe that Congress needs to step in and ensure that this is happening and to also fully fund the law because the only way that these recidivism reduction programs are going to be effective is if they are fully funded.""

Still, groups that work with inmates and their families said that whatever its failings, the First Step Act is making a difference.

""Every day of freedom is important,"" said Kevin Ring, president of the group Families Against Mandatory Minimums. ""We're happy for the families who get to welcome home their loved ones a few weeks or months early."""
A sad day for agriculture: Unnecessarily moving USDA research arm,https://thehill.com,[],07-22-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/454094-a-sad-day-for-agriculture-unnecessarily-moving-usda-research-arm,"It’s now official — the Kansas City area has been selected for the new home of USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) and Economic Research Service (ERS). Many of us in the agricultural research community are still in a state of shock. Soon after the announcement, we saw the secretary meeting with affected personnel who turned their backs on him.

These developments are jolting.

ERS and NIFA were created with much debate and careful, respectful deliberation by all parties who had a stake in them. It is perplexing how such fundamental changes can be proposed intelligently by USDA with little or no input by any party in a very “hurry up” time frame.

ADVERTISEMENT

Having studied the history of how the USDA, the Land-grant university system, and our agricultural research, education and extension system came to be, USDA’s actions are truly unprecedented. Even though the legislation that created the Land-grant university system was passed during the heat of the U.S. Civil War, there were many, many debates and discussions about the legislation. The agricultural research system was formalized in 1887 following over 16 years of debate, discussion, and after some 14 states had initiated some form of agricultural research effort.

If allowed this move would be detrimental to our agricultural research effort in the long run, but more concerning is the lack of recognition, appreciation, and respect by the secretary for agricultural research and the agricultural research community.

Regardless of how we have arrived at this situation — and where it ends up — we must find a way out that re-engages all parties such that they can work collegiately in support of American agriculture. With Secretary Perdue not listening to agricultural research experts or USDA employees, we need the leadership of Congress. The House appropriations committee — through the leadership of Rep. Sanford Bishop (D-Ga.) — has moved forcefully to block the relocation in a fiscal 2020 bill.

The U.S. Senate does not yet have a fiscal 2020 bill for USDA. So far, however, the Senate majority has shown little appetite to stand up to the secretary and advocate for the agencies or the integrity of USDA science. Even if the Senate does match or agree to the House language blocking the moves, the fiscal 2020 appropriations bill for USDA is months from being finalized and Perdue is working to use non-federal funds — effectively skirting congressional input — to complete the moves this fiscal year.

I simply refuse to believe we are unable to find a workable solution that will enable all parties to work collegiately for American agriculture.

ADVERTISEMENT

Recently, I proposed that Perdue and the president of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU) co-chair a joint commission that would consider and address all aspects of the agricultural research effort including the secretary’s relocation of NIFA and ERS. Perdue and APLU should engage the National Academy of Sciences to convene a panel that includes agricultural research leaders to conduct an in-depth review and study to chart a course for agricultural research in the future. It should be developed with ample opportunity for input by all parties who have a stake in agriculture. Such studies have been effective, indeed transformative, on a variety of topics, including agriculture.

Congress should mandate USDA to fund such a study and delay any relocation until it is completed. If Perdue succeeds however in sidestepping Congress to achieve the moves — or if the Senate allows Perdue’s upheaval of the USDA research arm — Congress should still mandate the USDA-funded study to get American agricultural research back up on its feet.

Gale Buchanan was USDA chief scientist and undersecretary for Research, Education, and Economics under President George W. Bush and dean of agriculture at the University of Georgia. He is the author of “Feeding the World: Agricultural Research in the Twenty-First Century” (2018) and “Branch Research Stations in Agriculture: History, Development, Operation, and Future” (2019)."

Their primary mission is not to protect the profitability of the chemical industry or even farmers who may find chlorpyrifos an affordable and convenient product but have other pesticide alternatives available to them. A 2014 EPA assessment warned that even relatively low exposure to the chemical can have disastrous consequences on youngsters. Shouldn’t Corteva Agriscience, its maker, be forced to prove its safety rather than allow the rest of us to be guinea pigs?"

Ocasio-Cortez confronted Acting Homeland Security Secretary McAleenan about images of her ""violent rape"" from a secret Facebook group. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – After a week fielding racist attacks from President Donald Trump, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez questioned Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan about the whereabouts of Border Patrol agents who threatened her in a secret Facebook group.

The intense and personal line of questioning Thursday happened as McAleenan appeared before the House Oversight and Reform Committee to testify about his role in separating migrant children from their families and worsening conditions at the migrant detention centers along the southern U.S. border.

He was also asked several times about a secret Facebook group of current and former Border Patrol agents that contained more than 10,000 members and included posts mocking migrants and the deaths of children in custody and suggesting harm to Democratic lawmakers. After the group's existence was revealed by a ProPublica report, McAleenan announced DHS was investigating the ""disturbing"" and ""inexcusable"" posts.

""Did you see the posts planning physical harm to myself and Congresswoman Escobar?"" Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., asked McAleenan. ""Yes,"" he answered. ""And I directed an investigation within minutes of reading the article.""

""Did you see the images of officers circulating Photoshopped images of my violent rape?"" Ocasio-Cortez continued. ""Yes I did,"" McAleenan responded.

'A kennel for dogs': Lawmakers hammer acting DHS chief Kevin McAleenan over migrant detention facilities

McAleenan did not specifically say whether those Border Patrol agents were still on the job after Ocasio-Cortez, a freshmen lawmaker known for her progressive policies and large following on social media questioned whether they were still ""responsible for the safety of migrant women and children.""

He said several agents have been put on administrative duties while the investigation continues, saying ""I don't know which ones correspond to which posts and we've ordered cease and desist orders to dozens of more.""

McAleenan shot back after Ocasio-Cortez asked about whether the separating of children and families led to a ""dehumanizing culture"" within Customs and Border Protection. ""We do not have a dehumanizing culture at CBP,"" he said touting that the agency, ""rescues 4,000 people a year"" and is ""committed to the well-being of everyone that they interact with.""

He said the posts were ""unacceptable"" but ""I don't think it's fair to apply them to the entire organization or that even the members of that group believed or supported those posts.""

The hearing came after days of President Trump attacking Ocasio-Cortez and three other freshmen Democratic lawmakers, all women of color who are critical of his administration and its policies.

CLOSE President Trump says he ""felt a little bit badly"" about the chants of ""send her back"" that erupted at his North Carolina rally. USA TODAY

It started Sunday when Trump sent a series of tweets suggesting Reps. Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.; Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.; and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., should ""go back"" to where they came from.

The House passed a resolution condemning the racist comments on Tuesday as the president faced widespread criticism over the remarks, which he doubled down on at the White House and on Twitter throughout the week.

He singled out the four women Wednesday evening during a rally in North Carolina and his supporters started chanting ""send her back"" as the president brought up Rep. Omar, who is originally from Somalia and became one of the first two Muslim women in Congress when she was elected in the 2018 midterms. Omar is a naturalized U.S. citizen.

Trump distanced himself from the chants on Thursday, saying, ""I disagree with it"" and ""I wasn't happy with that message.""

Dunn says state prison issues detailed in DOJ report are being addressed,https://www.al.com,"['William Thornton', 'Wthornton Al.Com']",07-22-2019,2019,7,https://www.al.com/news/montgomery/2019/07/dunn-says-state-prison-issues-are-being-addressed.html,"Alabama Department of Corrections Commissioner Jeff Dunn said today that he is optimistic following the first meeting of The Governor’s Study Group on Criminal Justice Policy in Montgomery.

Dunn said he thinks a “fact-based and data-driven” examination of the many issues affecting Alabama’s prison system will help alleviate some of the issues.

“I don’t know that we want to prescribe policy positions, but I do think we need to gather the data, look at the facts and then let that drive our decision-making and our analysis of what policy options we would need,” Dunn said.

Gov. Kay Ivey last week announced the group, chaired by former Alabama Supreme Court Justice Champ Lyons. Its members said today the panel plans to examine ongoing issues and tackle policy initiatives to improve prison conditions, reform sentencing, address future needs and reduce recidivism.

The Alabama Department of Corrections is still dealing with the fallout from an April Justice Department report which detailed an atmosphere of violence in the state’s men’s prisons that investigators said violates the U.S. Constitution. Dunn said the department has already taken steps to address some of the report’s issues.

For example, he said, ADOC consulted with the National Institute of Corrections, an arm of the Justice Department that assists federal, state, and local corrections agencies.

“They came down, they visited our system, we had extensive meetings with them,” Dunn said. The institute is now in the process of coming up with a plan for the department, he said.

Other action includes a series of ongoing prison sweeps for contraband at several DOC facilities, he said. Last week, more than 350 law enforcement officers and 150 correctional officers conducted a predawn sweep for contraband at Donaldson Correctional Facility in Bessemer, recovering weapons, drugs, cell phones and alcohol. It was the fourth such sweep this year.

Dunn said he did not know the outcome of a portion of the DOJ investigation that is still ongoing. In late May, ADOC surrendered documents that the DOJ said dealt with reports of excessive force and sexual abuse against inmates by correctional officers. It was the only part of the DOJ investigation that had not been completed by the time of its April report.

“Our focus right now is what we’re responsible for,” he said. “We are working through the panoply of issues with them and you have to take each one in detail.”

Dunn said legislative action earlier this year to increase pay for correctional officers will also help in addressing violence and contraband issues, issues cited in the DOJ report. Early response to the pay increases have been encouraging, as far as in recruiting new corrections officers.

Dunn said the department has seen a “significant increase in the number of applicants and the number of individuals showing up” at on-site recruiting events. Still, it probably won’t be until October before the department can get a better picture of how recruiting is affecting staff turnover.

“We track it monthly, but to get a really good accurate snapshot we tend to take it on the fiscal year,” he said. “I think it will be a very positive trajectory that we’re on.”"
U.S. State Department says concerned by reports of Chinese interference in South China Sea,https://www.reuters.com,"['Nandita Bose', 'Min Read']",07-20-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-southchinasea/u-s-state-department-says-concerned-by-reports-of-chinese-interference-in-south-china-sea-idUSKCN1UF0EM,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department said on Saturday it is concerned by reports of China’s interference with oil and gas activities in the South China Sea, including Vietnam’s long-standing exploration and production activities.

“China’s repeated provocative actions aimed at the offshore oil and gas development of other claimant states threatens regional energy security and undermines the free and open Indo-Pacific energy market,” the State Department said in a statement.

Vietnam on Friday accused a Chinese oil survey vessel and its escorts of violating its sovereignty and demanded that China remove the ships from Vietnamese waters.

Vietnam and China have for years long been embroiled in a dispute over the potentially energy-rich stretch of waters in the South China Sea.

On Wednesday, two U.S.-based think tanks reported that Chinese and Vietnamese vessels had engaged in a standoff lasting several weeks near an oil block in Vietnam’s exclusive economic zone. Neither Beijing nor Hanoi have directly confirmed or denied the reports.

“The United States firmly opposes coercion and intimidation by any claimant to assert its territorial or maritime claims,” the State Department said.

“China should cease its bullying behavior and refrain from engaging in this type of provocative and destabilizing activity,” it added.

The State Department also pointed to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s comments earlier this year when he said, “by blocking development in the South China Sea through coercive means, China prevents ASEAN members from accessing more than $2.5 trillion in recoverable energy reserves.”

The State Department also said that China’s growing pressure on ASEAN countries to accept provisions that seek to restrict their right to partner with third party companies or countries further reveal its intent to assert control over oil and gas resources in the South China Sea.

“China’s reclamation and militarization of disputed outposts in the South China Sea...including the use of maritime militia to intimidate, coerce, and threaten other nations, undermine the peace and security of the region,” it said."
DOJ tells Robert Mueller 'any testimony must remain in the boundaries of your public report',https://www.cnn.com,"['David Shortell', 'Jessica Schneider', 'Manu Raju', 'Paul Leblanc']",07-22-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/22/politics/doj-has-not-seen-robert-mueller-opening-statement/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Justice Department wrote a letter to Robert Mueller on Monday about his upcoming congressional hearing, telling the former special counsel his testimony must adhere to the 448-page report he issued earlier this year.

The testimony, the letter stated, ""must remain within the boundaries of your public report because matters within the scope of your investigation were covered by executive privilege.""

The letter, sent in response to Mueller's request for guidance about his testimony, is signed by Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer.

Mueller is scheduled to testify before the House Judiciary and Intelligence panels Wednesday morning beginning at 8:30 a.m. ET. The former special counsel has been a reluctant witness, and is appearing before subpoena . Democrats plan to push Mueller on several aspects of his investigation as well as the question if he would recommend charges against President Donald Trump were he not the President.

The statement, which will likely not be released until Mueller starts his testimony, did not have to be cleared through the Department of Justice and no officials from the department, including Attorney General William Barr, have seen the document, Popkin said.

Popkin did not comment on how much or how long Mueller has been preparing, but would confirm that Wilmer Hale -- a Washington, DC, law firm -- has allowed Mueller and ""a small group of folks who worked with him at the special counsel's office"" to use some unoccupied office space for the purpose of preparation.

""If you look at him and his career, he is someone who comes to the table fully prepared and he's going to be ready on Wednesday,"" he said.

In Monday's letter, Weinsheimer quotes from Mueller's public statement in May where he indicated his reluctance to testify, and notes that the Department of Justice does not typically allow prosecutors to appear before Congress and discuss their cases.

""As the Attorney General has repeatedly stated, the decision to testify before Congress is yours to make in this case, but the Department agrees with your stated position that your testimony should be unnecessary under the circumstances,"" Weinsheimer wrote.

Weinsheimer told Mueller that DOJ policy prevents him from commenting on the legal conclusions his office made ""with respect to uncharged individuals, other than information contained within the portions of your report that already have been made public."" Weinsheimer also said Mueller should not testify about portions of the public report that have been redacted or about uncharged third parties.

All of the people preparing Mueller have spent the last two years working with him at the special counsel's office investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. The individuals helping Mueller prepare are some of the top people from that office, though their names haven't yet been released.

Mueller's testimony is expected to be in line with the public statement he made on May 29 wherein he stated charging Trump was not an option that his office could consider, Popkin said. Mueller also used his public statement to make clear his desire to not testify before Congress.

""I hope and expect this will be the only time I will speak to you in this manner,"" he said.

""It's important the office's written work speaks for itself,"" Mueller added of his report, which was delivered in March to Barr. ""The report is my testimony.""

""If you listen to that statement, he made it clear that you can basically expect him to stick to the report,"" Popkin added.

Mueller will also submit a statement for the record to the committee, but that will be the redacted report and nothing else.

""He was subpoenaed obviously and he's made it clear that's why he will be there,"" Popkin said when asked about Mueller's frame of mind ahead of the hearing.

""Other than that, any information on his demeanor and tone will have to wait until Wednesday,"" he said.

While Mueller has made clear his intention to not extrapolate beyond his report, Democrats hope pointed questions during testimony will offer new context that could deal a blow to Trump.

As a sign of the importance Democrats are placing in Mueller's testimony, members on the House Judiciary Committee are planning to hold a two-hour mock hearing Tuesday afternoon ahead of the Mueller hearing Wednesday, according to a source briefed on the plan.

This comes days after Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee held their own mock session, as did Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee, as CNN reported last week.

The House is out of session Monday, so there have been scant in-person meetings among the members. That will change Tuesday as members on both committees plan to go behind closed doors for a final round of deliberations and preparations to make sure they are on the same page ahead of the high-stakes Wednesday hearing.

Mueller's 448-page report , which was released in April, detailed numerous cases in which Trump asked his aides to take actions that would have obstructed the investigation, but stated they were unsuccessful because the aides refused his orders.

Valley veteran reaches out to ABC15 after feeling let down by Phoenix VA,https://www.abc15.com,[],07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.abc15.com/news/region-phoenix-metro/central-phoenix/valley-veteran-reaches-out-to-abc15-after-feeling-let-down-by-phoenix-va,"PHOENIX — When it comes to treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD, the U.S. Department of Veteran's Affairs consider themselves among the best. Those involved in the program here in Phoenix tell us, the Valley is nationally renowned for the PTSD care they offer veterans.

At the Phoenix VA, the post-traumatic stress disorder clinical team works with veterans and service members who have experienced traumatic events in their lives.

According to statistics ABC15 has obtained from the U.S. Department of Veteran's Affairs, the veteran suicide rate in Arizona was significantly higher than the overall national suicide rates. The mental health call center at the Phoenix VA healthcare system reports handling 40,000 calls in 2018. Staff credit their team for helping save dozens of lives.

With so much passion and dedication put towards mental health resources in the community, Phoenix VA staff said they were surprised to hear the story of a veteran who reached out to ABC15, saying he was disappointed with how he had been treated when he tried to seek help for PTSD.

Brent Phillips is a marine corporal who medically retired after getting injured in Iraq. Phillips was part of task force Scorpion and entered Iraq in 2003 with the first wave of marines in the country. The injuries he suffered during an ambush while moving through Iraq cost him an eye and earned him a Purple Heart, a military decoration awarded in the name of the President to those wounded or killed while serving on or after 1917.

Phillips said his team was 'moving fast' up north through Iraq, and were conducting a mission at a water treatment facility. On his way out, Phillips and his unit were fired upon by insurgents. Phillips said he was hit by four rocket-propelled grenades or RPG's.

Phillis said he was stuck in the vehicle and remembered all four explosions. He was eventually able to climb out and get on top of the vehicle, where he ""engaged the enemy."" Phillips said he could barely see anything due to his injuries, and used a blinking technique he was taught when sprayed with tear gas during training to fight back.

""I engaged the enemy until I was completely blinded due to the blast injuries to my face,"" said Phillips.

He was flown to Germany for treatment. The military flew his family there to be by his bedside. After recovering, Phillips said his doctors were able to get an ""FDA compassion waiver"" to perform experimental surgery on his eye.

He blamed follow up care at the VA for the surgery ultimately not working, but what Phillips wanted to discuss more than the eye he lost was the PTSD he lived with for years before he worked up the courage to ask for help.

""I thought I could handle it on my own,"" said Phillips.

He described the slightest sound or sight as triggering flashbacks or memories that reminded him of his ambush, or the sights he saw in Iraq.

Phillips described driving into a desolate part of Scottsdale one night, where the lights hitting the road reminded him of a place he had been to in Iraq.

""I would grip the steering wheel, instantly start smelling the sulfur. I could hear some of the noises. I've heard of amputees explaining ghost pain, and I would feel things like where the shrapnel went in, where I had the cuts,"" explained Phillips.

He finally decided to seek help.

""I realized I was out of control. I couldn't control myself anymore. I couldn't control the anger, the flashbacks, and the nightmares were becoming more severe and more numerous,"" said Phillips.

He said the hardest part about opening up about his experiences initially was talking about them with someone who had never been deployed. He didn't know if he would be judged.

Phillips said he started and stopped treatment a few times, and each time there was a new counselor, he had to open up to all over again.

At one point, Phillips said the only thing he discussed with his counselor during their sessions was if the medication was working. He called those visits ""medication check-ups.""

The last time Phillips said he went to the VA for treatment, he was told he would have to see someone in another state.

""During the appointment process I was told that my doctor had left and due to a shortage of counselors in the VA system, my doctor was going to be out of Los Angeles,"" said Phillips.

He was upset but decided to show up for the appointment.

""The whole time this is going on, I'm like why am I here. Why am I opening up to a TV monitor?"" Phillips said he walked out mid-appointment and never went back again.

ABC15 asked Phillips if he had reached out to supervisors of the PTSD clinic or management at the VA to let them know his concerns. He said he had not.

""In my eyes, it is now okay, so I am not important to the system. That they would just put me in front of a monitor,"" said Phillips. ""I did not feel like I had a choice. It was what it was. I was told they had a shortage of doctors; I understood they had a shortage of doctors,"" he added.

Phillips said he felt telehealth type programs might be good for some people, but it did not work for him.

ABC15 took Phillip's concerns to top officials at the Phoenix VA.

Dr. Brandi Luedtke, a clinical psychologist, and PTSD clinic program manager acknowledged it was a big deal for a veteran to come in and open up about their experiences.

""It does take a lot of courage to come into our clinic and share some of those experiences,"" said Luedtke.

She explained that the Phoenix VA had been offering telehealth in the PTSD clinic since 2010, and the program worked really well for those veterans who lived in rural areas, so they did not have to drive 2-3 hours just for an appointment with a counselor.

Dr. Luedtke expressed surprise at this veteran's story and said she hoped to hear from him again.

""I would have loved to have clarified how this route happened and make sure that we get him hooked up with services. We do know how difficult it is. If one treatment program is not working, we always encourage the veteran, please share with us if the symptoms are worse or you don't feel like this is a good fit,"" said Luedtke.

Dr. Kris Kratz with the Phoenix VA psychology department said he planned to look up the veteran's patient file and look into his concerns.

""Any concern like that is something incredibly important for us to be aware of and to be able to address it at an individual level with that veteran,"" said Kratz.

""Mental health at the Phoenix VA is committed to providing exceptional healthcare and positive veteran experience. If neither of those two things is met it's important for us to address that, look into their record, and make any corrections if there are corrections that need to be made,"" he added.

Dr. Kratz said counselors at the VA are handling about thirty patients a week. Some of them are in for assessments, others in for treatment. Kratz acknowledged that it was a heavy workload.

""We certainly can continue to add more staff. That is probably true for all the services given our growth rate,"" Kratz said.

Numbers ABC15 has obtained from the U.S. Department of Veteran's Affairs show the Phoenix VA eligibility office averaging 270 new enrollees per week, with a high of 390 in a week. 2018 was a record-setting year in Phoenix with more than 95,000 new unique veterans enrolled in the program.

A spokeswoman for the VA provided ABC15 with the following statement:

""Because of privacy laws, we can’t share anything specific to this Veteran’s care. However, as we mentioned on Friday, we have a team of providers who have dedicated their lives to care for veterans. In this case, one of those providers is reaching out to this veteran so that they can collaboratively find the right treatment for him.""

VA officials said the average wait time for a veteran who is seeking help for PTSD is about two weeks right now. Those in crisis can use same day services in mental health during regular business hours in person, via phone, or through MyHealthVet secure messaging.

The VA also has a ""Be Connected"" program that offers 24/7 support. You can get more information at https://www.beconnectedaz.org or call 1-866-4AZ-VETS.

Those in crisis can also call the veteran's crisis line 24 hours a day, seven days a week. That number is 1-800-273-8255. Press one to talk to a counselor. You can also chat with a counselor at veteranscrisisline.net or text them at 838255."
"For 50 Years Since Apollo 11, Presidents Have Tried to Take That Next Giant Leap",https://www.nytimes.com,['Peter Baker'],07-19-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/19/us/politics/apollo-11-anniversary-presidents.html,"WASHINGTON — At his star-spangled Independence Day extravaganza this month, President Trump singled out Gene Kranz, the legendary Apollo flight director. “Gene,” the president said, “I want you to know that we’re going to be back on the moon very soon — and someday soon, we will plant the American flag on Mars.”

What could be more American than vowing to go to the moon and beyond on the Fourth of July? For Mr. Trump, it was a chance to channel his inner John F. Kennedy, who first made the moon the nation’s goal — to make the sort of bold promise that appeals to his own sense of greatness and to wrap himself in a part of Americana akin to baseball and apple pie.

But Mr. Trump is the 10th president since Kennedy to put his stamp on the space program and the latest to aim for the stars with more brio than blueprint. After the Apollo program ended, other presidents promised to go back to the moon — or send humans to Mars or even land astronauts on asteroids. None did, unwilling or unable to obtain the financing necessary, and it remains uncertain whether Mr. Trump will, either.

As the nation on Saturday celebrates the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing, the story of presidents and space exploration in the subsequent five decades is one of fascination, frustration and futility, an unrequited romance as star-struck chief executives dreamed of recapturing the magic of Kennedy’s moonshot without summoning the resources or the national will that made it possible in 1969, almost six years after his death."
EPA permits agricultural use of the pesticide chlorpyrifos until at least 2020,https://www.foodsafetynews.com,"['Dan Flynn', 'U.S. Department Of Agriculture', 'Bill Marler', 'Francine L. Shaw', 'July', 'Powered By']",07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2019/07/epa-permits-agricultural-use-of-the-pesticide-chlorpyrifos-until-at-least-2020/,"The federal Environmental Protect Agency has tossed another petition calling for a ban on the agricultural pesticide chlorpyrifos.

Two years ago, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt denied requests fo revoke all tolerances or maximum residue levels for food and cancel all chlorpyrifos registrations.

EPA is once again allowing farmers to continue using the pesticide in their fields under strict label instructions for its use. Chlorpyrifos was banned for home use almost 20 years ago. Until then it was used on residential lawns and golf turf as a structural termite control agent.

Farmers have used it to control leafage and ground insects since Dow Chemical first registered it for use in the United States. USDA reports chlorpyrifos assists in growing as many as 50 kinds of crops.

Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue praised EPA for once again keeping chlorpyrifos available on the farm. “For more than 50 crops, chlorpyrifos is the only line of defense and a cost-effective crop protection tool for farmers,” Perdue tweeted out. “We appreciate the @EPA’s support of American farmers and producers in its commitment to fact-based regulatory oversight of crop protection tools.”

EPA again found the scientific evidence isn’t strong enough to justify completely removing the pesticide from the market. Chlorpyrifos’ registration, however, is coming up for a complete review with a statutory deadline of 2022.

Issues raised in the failed petitioners in the past few years will be a be re-visited during that review, including some research that has linked chlorpyrifos to causing brain damage in children.

Activist groups like Earthjustice, claim the scientific evidence that chlorpyrifos harms children’s brains is “overwhelming.” Whether that damage occurs at the residual levels that might occur in fresh fruits and vegetables is likely another questions.

Those who do want chlorpyrifos banned whether they wish to participate in EPA review, take the issue to federal court or both.

States bans of chlorpyrifos are occurring in New York State and Hawaii. New York’s ban takes effect on Jan. 2, 2020 with use on apple tree trunks extended for an extra year. And Hawaii’s bans the bug killer beginning in 2021. Other states may follow on their own.

EPA’s previous assessment found dietary and drinking water risks for the current uses of chlorpyrifos. But it put off the scientific review of neurodevelopmental effects the 2022 study.

It is possible under the current label uses that chlorpyrifos residues on food crops can exceed the safety standard under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA). And there is a risk to workers who mix, load, and apply chlorpyrifos on the fields. Water exposure from both non-food and food use is also a concern.

The Obama administration in October 2015 moved to revoke all food residue tolerances for chlorpyrifos. The action came in response to a petition filed by the National Resources Defense Council and the Pesticide Action Network North America.

USDA and the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture objected to EPA’s methodology. So did the federal Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP), which is set up under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).

The SAP provides the EPA Administrator with advice on pesticides and pesticide-related issues.
