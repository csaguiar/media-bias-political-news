British ambassador who called Trump 'inept' has Theresa May's 'full support',https://www.foxnews.com,"['Lukas Mikelionis', 'Downing Street', 'Lukas Mikelionis Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/british-ambassador-trump-inept-may-full-support,"Outgoing Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday issued a statement of support to Britain’s ambassador to the U.S. after President Trump cut off contact with him amid the leak of diplomatic cables.

May backed ambassador Kim Darroch amid the controversy over leaked diplomatic cables in which he disparaged Trump, including calling him “inept.”

Downing Street said Darroch “continues to have the prime minister's full support,” adding that “We have made clear to the U.S. how unfortunate this leak is” and that “the selective extracts leaked do not reflect the closeness of, and the esteem in which we hold, the relationship.”

""Sir Kim Darroch continues to have the prime minister's full support.” — Downing Street

“At the same time we have also underlined the importance of ambassadors being able to provide honest, unvarnished assessments of the politics in their country,” the spokesman added.

In the leaked documents, Darroch described the Trump administration as “diplomatically clumsy and inept” and said he doubted it would become “substantially more normal.”

The memo was one of several documents published by the Mail on Sunday in which Darroch apparently made other highly negative statements about the government of Britain's closest ally.

Trump on Sunday called Darroch ineffective and said “he has not served the U.K. well.”

He followed up on Twitter Monday to attack both Darroch and May – announcing that he won’t work with the ambassador anymore.

“I have been very critical about the way the U.K. and Prime Minister Theresa May handled Brexit. What a mess she and her representatives have created. I told her how it should be done, but she decided to go another way,” he wrote in a tweet.

“I do not know the Ambassador, but he is not liked or well.... thought of within the U.S. We will no longer deal with him,” he added.

While the leak prompted awkwardness between the two countries that tout the “special relationship” and some called upon the government to recall Darroch, senior Conservative Party figure and former Foreign Secretary William Hague said the government was right to back him.

“You can’t change an ambassador at the demand of a host country,” Hague told the BBC. “It is their job to give an honest assessment of what is happening in that country.”

Obamacare in Jeopardy as Appeals Court Hears Case Backed by Trump,https://www.nytimes.com,[],07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/health/obamacare-appeals-court.html,"NEW ORLEANS — A federal appeals court panel will hear arguments Tuesday on whether a federal judge in Texas was correct in striking down the Affordable Care Act, a case with enormous stakes not only for millions of people who gained health insurance through the law but for the political futures of President Trump and other candidates in the 2020 elections.

The case, which could make its way to the Supreme Court ahead of those elections, threatens insurance protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions and many other sweeping changes the 2010 law has made throughout the health care system.

It was filed by a group of Republican governors and attorneys general against the federal government, which carries out the law. But the Trump administration refused to defend the full law in court and this spring said it agreed with the ruling that the law’s requirement for people to buy insurance was unconstitutional, and that as a result, the entire law must be dismantled.

That has left a group of 21 states with Democratic attorneys general to intervene to defend the law, along with the House of Representatives, which entered the case after Democrats won control of the chamber last fall."
Florida fisherman says Trump's environmental moves helped turn his business around,https://www.foxnews.com,"['David Montanaro', 'David Montanaro Is An Editor With Fox News.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/florida-fisherman-trump-environmental-moves-helped-turn-his-business-around,"A Florida fisherman delivered a full-throated endorsement of President Trump's environmental policies Monday at the White House, crediting the administration's efforts with helping turn his business around.

Bruce Hrobak, the owner of Billy Bones Bait and Tackle in Port St. Lucie, Florida, joined ""Fox & Friends"" Tuesday to explain how the administration helped combat the ""red tide"" of toxic algae that was devastating his business.

""The president loves everybody and I just don't get why people give him a hard time. He's a great guy and I was proud and honored to meet him,"" said Hrobak, who shouted ""Trump 2020"" into the microphone at the end of his show-stealing appearance.

Hrobak made the president and the audience laugh a few times, joking that his wife isn't ""yelling at him as much"" and that his father looked a little bit like Trump.

Hrobak said his business suffered in recent years because people were scared away by the toxic algae, which has now subsided near his bait shop. He also touted the administration's efforts to speed up repairs on the Herbert Hoover Dike.

""He wouldn't allow all this money to go improving things if he didn't care. That's my personal opinion,"" he said.

In a White House speech that exhaustively documented his administration's environmental efforts, Trump issued a new denunciation of the Green New Deal championed by top Democrats including New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, saying the proposal would devastate the economy and hit minorities the hardest.

UNIONS WARN GREEN NEW DEAL MAY LEAD TO POVERTY

The address was aimed at publicizing the often under-reported work by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as well as firing a political shot across the bow of Democrats who largely have dominated the conversation on climate change and related issues.

It came as polls have shown Americans increasingly voicing concern over the environment.

""We have only one America. We have only one planet,"" Trump said at one point. But, ""while we're focused on practical solutions, more than 100 Democrats in Congress now support the so-called Green New Deal. Their plan is estimated to cost our economy nearly $100 trillion -- a number unthinkable, a number not affordable even in the best of times.""

UH-OH -- AUTHOR OF GREEN NEW DEAL COST STUDY SLAMS AOC, SANDERS FOR MISINTERPRETING DATA

Democrats, however, dismissed the president's environmental record, with presidential candidates Sen. Bernie Sanders and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee slamming Trump's rollback of Obama-era regulations.

“President Trump’s record on the environment is pathetic and an embarrassment to the world,” Sanders, I-Vt., wrote. “This is a man who still thinks climate change is a ‘hoax.’ He better start listening to scientists and not his friends in the fossil fuel, chemical, and big agribusiness industries.”

Inslee, who has made climate change the central issue for his campaign, tweeted throughout the event.

""As Trump touts his administration’s environmental ‘accomplishments,’ a reminder that the EPA is run by a coal lobbyist, Interior is run by an oil lobbyist and Energy is run by someone who wanted to abolish the department,"" he tweeted.

Judge Blocks Trump Rule Requiring Pharma Companies To Disclose Drug Prices In TV Ads,https://www.npr.org,[],07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/2019/07/09/739770699/judge-blocks-trump-rule-requiring-pharma-companies-to-say-price-of-drugs-in-tv-a,"Judge Blocks Trump Rule Requiring Pharma Companies To Disclose Drug Prices In TV Ads

Enlarge this image toggle caption Susan Walsh/AP Susan Walsh/AP

A federal judge on Monday stopped a Trump administration initiative that would have required drugmakers to reveal the sticker price of their drugs in television ads.

Under the rule, if a medicine's list price was more than $35 a month, it would have to be stated during the commercial. The challenge, opponents say, is that a drug's list price and estimates of what people can expect to pay vary widely depending on coverage.

The rule was blocked hours before it was set to take effect, the latest setback for the White House as Trump administration officials continue to search for ways to pressure pharmaceutical companies into lowering their prices — a proposal made by the Trump administration in the runup to last November's midterm election.

The decision from U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington, D.C., ruled that the Department of Health and Human Services does not have the regulatory power to make drug manufacturers include the cost of drugs in television commercials.

Mehta wrote that in halting the rule, the court was not questioning its wisdom, but resting the issue on the law set by Congress in the first place.

""That policy very well could be an effective tool in halting the rising cost of prescription drugs. But no matter how vexing the problem of spiraling drug costs may be, HHS cannot do more than what Congress has authorized,"" Mehta wrote.

Critics pointed out that the rule was toothless, since there was no enforcement mechanism spelled out for when a company did not comply. Instead, the rule relied on the private sector to police itself.

The television-ad rule had the support of both the Trump administration and consumer rights advocates.

That said, patient advocate groups told NPR that while holding drugmakers accountable for prices is welcome, they remained skeptical that drug companies could be shamed, as the administration intended, into lowering their prices.

Last month, groups including drug manufacturers Merck, Eli Lilly and Amgen sued the Trump administration over the rule, arguing that it would violate the companies' free speech rights.

AARP, which represents older Americans, expressed disappointment on Monday over the court's ruling.

""Today's ruling is a step backward in the battle against skyrocketing drug prices and providing more information to consumers,"" the group said. ""Americans should be trusted to evaluate drug price information and discuss any concerns with their health care providers."""
Trump 'dossier' author grilled by Justice Department watchdogs: sources,https://www.reuters.com,"['Mark Hosenball', 'Min Read']",07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia/trump-dossier-author-grilled-by-justice-department-watchdogs-sources-idUSKCN1U410I,"(Reuters) - Federal lawyers probing the origins of the investigation of ties between Russia and President Donald Trump’s campaign have interviewed the author of a “dossier” that alleged misconduct between Trump and Moscow, prompting the lawyers to extend their inquiry.

Three attorneys from the Inspector General’s office of the U.S. Department of Justice met in person in early June with dossier author Christopher Steele in Britain, said two sources with direct knowledge of the lawyers’ travels.

The interview with Steele, a former top spy on Russia for Britain’s Secret Intelligence Service, or MI6, took place while Trump was in London for a formal state visit with Queen Elizabeth and a meeting with UK Prime Minister Theresa May.

Steele’s dossier, made public in 2017, alleged that Moscow attempted to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and that there was potential collusion between Russia and Trump’s campaign, along with other unverified and salacious claims about the president.

The Justice Department’s inspector general has been examining the earliest stages of an FBI investigation of Trump, his former 2016 presidential campaign rival Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, Russia and former Trump adviser Carter Page.

Inspector General Michael Horowitz, whose office is an internal Justice Department watchdog, launched his probe in March 2018 amid allegations by Republican lawmakers that the FBI erred in seeking a warrant to monitor Page.

Trump has described the Steele dossier as “bogus” and Republicans have long sought to discredit the FBI’s investigation, which was later taken over by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller. His final report on Russia and the Trump campaign was released in redacted form in mid-April.

In that same month, Attorney General William Barr, who now heads the Justice Department, told a congressional committee that the Horowitz probe would be completed by May or June.

One of the two sources said Horowitz’s investigators appear to have found Steele’s information sufficiently credible to have to extend the investigation. Its completion date is now unclear.

A key focus of the Horowitz probe is whether the FBI followed proper procedures when it applied for a warrant with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA) to secretly conduct surveillance on Page and his ties to Russia.

Declassified documents show that the FBI cited information in Steele’s dossier when it asked the secretive FISA court in late 2016 for a warrant to eavesdrop electronically on Page, a U.S. businessman with interests in Russia.

Horowitz’s office in Washington declined to comment.

A spokesman for Orbis Business Intelligence, Steele’s London investigations firm, declined to comment.

UK government agencies declined to disclose whether they were in contact with Horowitz’s team in London.

Moscow repeatedly rejected accusations of interfering in the election.

Mueller’s report, released on April 18, said that Russia did meddle in the election in an attempt to boost Trump’s candidacy. It said Trump campaign officials had multiple contacts with Russian officials. But it found insufficient evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy between the campaign and Moscow.

The report also described numerous attempts by Trump to impede Mueller’s inquiry, but it stopped short of declaring that he committed a crime. Mueller during his inquiry brought charges against 34 people, including Russian agents and ex-Trump aides.

Page, a foreign policy adviser during Trump’s campaign, drew scrutiny from the FBI, which said in legal filings in 2016 that it believed he had been “collaborating and conspiring” with the Kremlin. But he was not charged.

Investigators working for Mueller in September 2017 twice interviewed Steele, who also gave written testimony to the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee in August 2018. That panel and other committees of Congress have taken up where Mueller left off after his investigation ended."
"Bill Clinton 'knows nothing' about financier Jeffrey Epstein's 'terrible crimes,' former president's spokesman says",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bill-clinton-knows-nothing-about-financier-jeffrey-epsteins-terrible-crimes-former-presidents-spokesman-says,"Bill Clinton ""knows nothing"" about the ""terrible crimes"" linked to Jeffrey Epstein, the former president's spokesman said Monday, in Clinton's first statement after new sex-trafficking charges were lobbed against the wealthy financier.

An indictment alleging sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy was unsealed Monday morning against Epstein, the wealthy and politically connected financier who pleaded not guilty during his initial appearance in a New York City federal court. Prosecutors alleged that Epstein, the 66-year-old wealthy hedge fund manager arrested on Saturday, preyed on ""dozens"" of victims as young as 14.

""In 2002 and 2003, President Clinton took a total of four trips on Jeffrey Epstein’s airplane: one to Europe, one to Asia, and two to Africa, which included stops in connection with the work of the Clinton Foundation,"" the statement said. ""Staff, supporters of the foundation, and his Secret Service detail traveled on every leg of every trip. He had one meeting with Epstein in his Harlem office in 2002, and around the same time made one brief visit to Epstein’s New York apartment with a staff member and his security detail. He’s not spoken to Epstein in well over a decade, and he has never been to Little St. James Island, Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico, or his residence in Florida.”

Separately, claims in court showed that President Trump may have flown on the jet at least once, as well.

CUSHY PLEA BARGAIN WITH EPSTEIN WAS SO BAD IT BROKE THE LAW, JUDGE RULES

Meanwhile, Attorney General Bill Barr said he has recused himself from the matter ""because one of the law firms that represented Epstein long ago was a firm I subsequently joined for a period of time.""

On Saturday evening, Christine Pelosi, a Democratic National Committee official and daughter of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, warned conspicuously that it is ""quite likely that some of our faves are implicated"" in the ""horrific"" sex-trafficking case.

""This Epstein case is horrific and the young women deserve justice,"" Pelosi tweeted. ""It is quite likely that some of our faves are implicated but we must follow the facts and let the chips fall where they may - whether on Republicans or Democrats.""

For his part, Trump previously called attention to Clinton's dealings with the financier.

""Nice guy -- uh, got a lot of problems coming up, in my opinion, with the famous island, with Jeffrey Epstein,"" Trump told Fox News' Sean Hannity in 2015, referring to Clinton's connections with Epstein. ""A lot of problems.""

Meanwhile, Trump biographer Tim O'Brien this weekend reposted an excerpt fom a 2002 profile of Epstein in New York Magazine, in which Trump told a reporter, ""I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.""

Trump banned Epstein from his Mar-a-Lago estate “because Epstein sexually assaulted an underage girl at the club,” according to court documents filed by Bradley Edwards, the lawyer who has represented several Epstein accusers. That claim has not been confirmed by Trump or Mar-a-Lago.

Epstein appeared Monday in a hearing that lasted about 30 minutes wearing a blue prison top with a brown T-shirt underneath, in addition to orange slip-on sneakers. Prosecutors said in the 36 hours since Epstein's arrest, multiple attorneys and several individuals have come forward and said they were victims, none of whom had previously been spoken to.

FORMER FBI OFFICIAL: INDICTMENT OF JEFFREY EPSTEIN IS 'PLACEHOLDER,' EXPECT DOZENS MORE CHARGES IN NEAR FUTURE

Epstein allegedly created and maintained a ""vast network"" and operation from 2002 ""up to and including"" at least 2005 that enabled him to ""sexually exploit and abuse dozens of underage girls"" in addition to paying victims to recruit other underage girls.

""This allowed Epstein to create an ever-expanding web of new victims,"" U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said at a news conference.

Berman added that nude photographs ""of what appeared to be underage girls"" were discovered at Epstein's Manhattan mansion during a search following his arrest Saturday. The hundreds of photos were discovered in a locked safe, according to officials.

Prosecutors also allege Epstein ""worked and conspired with others, including employees and associates"" who helped facilitate his conduct by contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with the 66-year-old at his mansion in New York City and Palm, Beach, Fla.

At Epstein's multi-story mansion on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, prosecutors said that victims would be escorted to a room with a massage table where they would perform a massage on him.

""The victims, who were as young as 14 years of age, were told by Epstein or other individuals to partially or fully undress before beginning the 'massage,'"" prosecutors wrote. ""During the encounter, Epstein would escalate the nature and scope of physical contact with his victims to include, among other things, sex acts such as groping and direct and indirect contact with the victim's genitals.""

In Monday's court appearance, prosecutors said that the massage room in New York was set up exactly as how the alleged victims described it 15 years ago.

CHRISTINE PELOSI WARNS IT'S 'QUITE LIKELY THAT SOME OF OUR FAVES ARE IMPLICATED' IN 'HORRIFIC' EPSTEIN CASE

Victims would be paid hundreds of dollars in cash by either Epstein or one of his associates or employees, according to prosecutors. The 66-year-old also allegedly ""incentivized his victims"" to become recruiters by paying the victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each girl brought to him.

""In so doing, Epstein maintained a steady supply of new victims to exploit,"" federal prosecutors said.

FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge William Sweeney said that Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey at 5 p.m. on Saturday ""without incident."" Epstein is now being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, a federal jail near the Manhattan courthouse where he appeared Monday afternoon.

Former DOJ Lawyer Says Census Drama Put Attorneys in “Completely Untenable” Position,https://slate.com,['Jeremy Stahl'],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/07/trump-census-william-barr-john-roberts-lawyer-change.html,"Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts on Jan. 20, 2017 in Washington. Joe Raedle/Getty Images

The latest bizarre twist in the Census citizenship question case came on Sunday when the Department of Justice announced that the entire team of lawyers defending the government’s position in ongoing litigation would be replaced. The highly unusual move was confirmed on Monday in a series of court filings. It is likely at the behest of career officials uncomfortable with the government’s position moving forward, according to former DOJ attorneys. The lawyers on the case told the courts last week that the administration would stop trying to add the citizenship question to the census, but were quickly forced to reverse that position after President Donald Trump tweeted that reports of the decision to back down were “fake.” The sudden change in lawyers suggests there is some internal recognition that the government’s latest census stance has become untenable.

Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec announced the change on Sunday, declaring that Attorney General William Barr “is confident that the new team will carry on in the same exemplary fashion [as the previous team] as the cases progress.”

The government has been tight-lipped about the reasons behind the switch. According to multiple former DOJ officials, however, the move would have only come if the attorneys who had been working on the case had profound reservations about the task ahead and asked to be removed.

“It’s an extremely unusual thing for an entire office to take itself off of a case in the middle of a case,” one former DOJ attorney, who worked under this administration, told Slate. “[These are] attorneys with the highest standards of integrity and highest standards of professionalism. I can only imagine they were in the very difficult position of being forced to contradict factual representations they had made previously.”

“That the entire office is being substituted out really indicates […] something strange,” the former attorney, who requested anonymity due to concerns about professional repercussions, added.

Another former DOJ official also speculated to the New York Times that the unusual move was likely because the original legal team was refusing to reverse course.

“There is no reason they would be taken off that case unless they saw what was coming down the road and said, ‘I won’t sign my name to that,’ ” Justin Levitt, a former senior official in the Justice Department under President Barack Obama, told the New York Times on Sunday.

The Times further confirmed that not only would career officials from the DOJ’s federal programs branch—the branch normally responsible for defending administration policies in court—be leaving the case, but a completely new branch would be taking over.

Indeed, it has become clear over the past week that the DOJ would need to argue positions that completely contradict those previously taken in court by the original team. Last month, the Supreme Court remanded the decision about the citizenship question back to the Commerce Department after Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the court’s more liberal wing to determine that the department had unlawfully “contrived” its reason for adding the question to the census. Since the justices essentially ruled the original explanation—that the question was added to aid enforcement of the Voting Rights Act—was a lie, any renewed effort to add the question would require DOJ attorneys to acknowledge their past position had been false and represent that a new one was the true motivation all along.

Faced with this challenge, both the DOJ and Commerce Department seemed to take Roberts’ ruling as their cue to drop the case last week, even representing in court that the 2020 census forms would be printed without the question and no further attempts to add it would go forward. DOJ lawyers reportedly spent the July Fourth holiday scrambling to find a new justification that would pass legal muster following Trump’s comments to the contrary.

The final substantive legal filing from the old legal team came on Friday, when that team argued in court that a renewed equal protection claim was now “moot” because of the Supreme Court’s decision, and thus that discovery should not go forward in a reopened equal protection claim in Maryland. That element of the case was revived late last month after the uncovering of previously secret evidence that the citizenship question had been concocted to offer “a disadvantage to the Democrats” and be “advantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic Whites.” After that evidence was found, Maryland District Judge George Hazel reopened the discrimination claim, and on Friday he ordered renewed discovery on that question to begin immediately and run through Aug. 19.

Administration attorneys had repeatedly insisted in court that they had a firm deadline of July 1 to print the census forms. Now, the new lawyers will apparently have to concede that this deadline was not real. Solicitor General Noel Francisco, for example, had told the Supreme Court that a decision in the case had to be made by the end of June, rejecting claims by opponents of the citizenship question that the form could be finalized as late as Oct. 31 without additional congressional appropriations. As former Office of Legal Counsel attorney Marty Lederman has written, now that the deadline has come and gone, DOJ attorneys will have to go into court and essentially say, oops, just kidding, we can do this without further funds from Congress after all.

“Being in a position now to deny those statements is something that would have been really untenable,” the former DOJ attorney told Slate. “From the point of view of the court hearing the case, they’re going to hear some set of attorneys making some argument that ‘you should ignore everything we’ve been saying for the last year plus,’ and that’s going to be a difficult sell for whoever’s making it.”

The administration apparently thinks it will be easier for a new set of lawyers to argue the new position than the specific attorneys who had previously argued the opposite. “An administration official said the new legal team may find it easier to argue the administration’s new position,” the Associated Press reported on Monday.

Indeed, the former DOJ attorney said, being “in the position of contradicting factual positions they themselves have made to the court for those particular attorneys would just be a completely untenable position for them to be in.”"

""We cannot, as some Democratic candidates for president now propose, publicly embrace a policy not to deport those who enter or remain in this country illegally unless they commit a crime. This is tantamount to a public declaration (repeated and amplified by smugglers in Central America) that our borders are effectively open to all; this will increase the recent levels of monthly apprehensions at our southern border -- about or more than 100,000 -- by multiples,"" Johnson wrote in a Washington Post column.

""For the same reason, we cannot formally decriminalize unauthorized entry into this country, though first-time illegal border crossers are, in fact, rarely prosecuted for that misdemeanor (except for last year's disastrous ""zero-tolerance"" policy).""

Johnson, who served under Obama from 2013 to 2017, wrote that Americans deserve ""straight talk"" on the issue of illegal immigration, touting the previous administration's handling of the problem. He said the Obama administration ramped up assistance to Central American countries and prioritized the deportation of felons.

Johnson defended House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., against far-left critics who claimed she was defeated by Republicans after the House passed a more moderate bill to deal with the influx of migrants at the southern border.

""Give her a break. Those who govern in a democracy know that progress requires compromise, and the speaker made the obvious calculation that it was more important to deliver prompt help to those facing inhumane conditions on the border than it was to delay and hold out for everything House Democrats wanted,"" he wrote, pointing to an overall ""alarming trend"" on both sides of the aisle.

""To win support from a vocal and committed segment of a major party's base -- and simply for the sake of a good applause line -- candidates for office now espouse extreme policy proposals that are unworkable and have no hope of winning the broad support of Congress and the people they represent,"" he argued, adding those who put forth policies that have no chance of becoming law are ""doing a disservice to our democracy.""

""Here is a radical proposal: a presidential candidate who is willing to educate, enlighten and tell voters the hard truths.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez fired back Saturday night after Pelosi criticized her and other far-left freshmen congresswomen for voting against a $4.6 billion border bill that President Trump signed into law on Monday.

“All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world,” Pelosi said. “But they didn’t have any following. They’re four people and that’s how many votes they got.”

Ocasio-Cortez criticized the Democrats who decided to vote along with Republicans on the spending plan to address issues at the U.S.-Mexico border.

“I don’t believe it was a good idea for Dems to blindly trust the Trump admin when so many kids have died in their custody. It’s a huge mistake,” she wrote. “This admin also refuses to hand over docs to Congress on the whereabouts of families. People’s lives are getting bargained & for what?”"

The Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank, said Monday that the U.S. government could run out of money in two months if Congress doesn't raise the debt ceiling. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News)

The U.S. government could run out of money to pay all of its bills by early September if Congress doesn’t rush to raise the debt ceiling, a think tank said Monday, a time frame that could force lawmakers to act much sooner than planned.

The Bipartisan Policy Center said that the Treasury Department could breach the borrowing limit in two months because the government has brought in far less tax revenue this year than was projected. The BPC uses economic models to forecast the government’s ability to pay its bills, and its estimates are often studied by the White House and congressional leaders.

In May, it had projected that Treasury would have until October or November before it ran into debt ceiling problems.

[Hiring rebounds in June, easing fears of a U.S. recession]

Congressional negotiations to raise the debt ceiling bogged down in recent weeks, with some leaders hoping to package a debt limit increase with a broader budget package. Those talks have faltered amid disagreements with the White House, and it is unclear when they plan to hold a vote.

But if lawmakers heed the BPC’s warning about the debt ceiling, they could be forced to raise the borrowing limit before a lengthy break in August. Senior GOP senators said Monday that the new projected timeline could increase pressure on Congress to act.

“That could change the dynamic,” said Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.). “We cannot default. That would send chaos through the financial markets.""

G. William Hoagland, a senior vice president at the BPC, said tax revenue, particularly money paid by corporations, has lagged far behind estimates and has provided Treasury much less cash than expected. When the government collects less money in taxes, it has less money to pay its bills. Typically, it would address this by borrowing more money, but its ability to do this is limited because Congress hasn’t raised the debt limit.

Even though there have been numerous political showdowns over the debt ceiling, Congress and the White House have never breached the limit. Financial experts have projected that failing to raise the debt ceiling could lead to a stock market crash and a spike in interest rates. The Treasury is expected to run a deficit of roughly $900 billion this year because spending far outpaces tax collection, and borrowing costs would also shoot higher.

BPC officials said it was difficult to pinpoint when exactly the Treasury would run out of money. While they said there was a “significant” chance the government would run out of funds in the first half of September, they said the more likely scenario is that it would have enough until sometime in October. If Treasury can make it through early September, it is expected to receive billions of dollars in tax payments that are due in late September, giving it a bit more flexibility. They said it’s difficult to pinpoint precisely when the debt ceiling would be breached because hundreds of billions of dollars come in and out of the government each month.

Still, Hoagland said, lawmakers “might want to seriously consider quicker action than waiting until early October.”

“We just want to raise the red flag to be very cautious and careful about what action they may want to take before too long,” he said.

[‘This doesn’t look like the best economy ever’: 40% of Americans say they still struggle to pay bills]

The government makes millions of payments each month, from Social Security benefits to interest payments on its debt. During a debt ceiling standoff with Congress, the Obama administration considered prioritizing payments to minimize the disruption for financial markets. But Democrats and Republicans have stressed that there is no way to contain the fallout from a debt ceiling breach given that U.S. debt is considered to be one of the safest investments.

BPC officials outlined twin risks if the debt ceiling isn’t increased. They said it could lead to a cessation of benefits for millions of Americans, particularly the elderly, but also a stock market crash that could hurt the investments of millions of Americans.

Congress is scheduled to go into recess for much of August and not return until after Labor Day weekend in early September. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has urged Congress to raise the debt ceiling for months, but his overtures have not been met with much enthusiasm by Democrats or Republicans. He has also told lawmakers that the debt ceiling could be breached in September.

The looming debt ceiling threat has caused growing concern on Capitol Hill, especially since it nearly coincides with a Sept. 30 deadline when the federal government will begin to shut down unless new spending legislation is passed. Lawmakers also want to avert onerous spending caps that threaten to slash $126 billion from domestic and military budgets early next year absent a deal.

But there are differences between Republicans and Democrats -- and between GOP lawmakers and the Trump administration -- over the best way to proceed. Trump administration officials recently proposed raising the debt ceiling while extending existing federal spending levels for a year, but Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) called that approach “unacceptable” because the Pentagon wouldn’t get enough money. At the same time, Republicans have chafed at Democrats’ demands for higher domestic spending levels.

All that has left the path forward unclear even as lawmakers express increasing urgency as their annual August recess approaches.

“I think we need to hustle to a (budget) caps deal as soon as we possibly can and include the debt limit in it, no doubt,” Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) said Monday evening after emerging from a Senate GOP leadership meeting where the issues were discussed. “I don’t think it’s in anybody’s best interest to have that fight in September up against the deadline.”

In 2018, Congress suspended the debt ceiling until March 2019. Because that date has passed, Treasury has taken numerous steps to avoid defaulting on obligations by moving money around or delaying certain costs. But Treasury will eventually run out of ways to buy more time.

The U.S. government spends more money than it brings in through revenue, and it covers the difference by borrowing money. It borrows by issuing debt, but it can do so only up to a limit set by Congress."
An Executive Order Can’t Fix Trump’s Census Problem,https://www.theatlantic.com,['Peter M. Shane'],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/executive-order-cant-fix-trumps-census-problem/593449/,"The third is that every statute that authorizes the executive branch to do something also puts limits on that power. Lawful executive action must respect those limits, what I call in my administrative-law classes an administrator’s “zone of discretion.” For example, the Census Act requires the secretary of commerce to submit, at least three years before the census date, a report containing the secretary’s “determination of the subjects proposed to be included in the census, and the types of information to be compiled.” The secretary must then submit, at least two years before the census date, a report containing the secretary’s “determination of the questions proposed to be included” in the census. Should the secretary of commerce decide just a year before the census date to ask each person his or her favorite Beatles song, the question would be impermissible because it was not reported to Congress in time.

Finally—and this is the speed bump over which the Commerce Department stumbled—under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, responsible officials must also, at the time a decision is made, offer a nonarbitrary, non-capricious explanation for choosing their strategy for carrying out their statutory authority. This requires at least that the proposed administrative action be a rational way of carrying out the mission Congress has assigned the executive, and that the rationale be clearly explained at the time of an agency decision. In the case of the citizenship question, the Department of Commerce failed to take this step, which is why a 2020 citizenship question is now on hold. Even if such a question could have been asked, in principle, consistent with the secretary’s zone of discretion, the failure of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to offer a non-pretextual rationale for the citizenship question tripped him up in the courts. As euphemistically summarized by Chief Justice John Roberts for a Supreme Court majority, the secretary offered a “contrived … explanation for agency action that is incongruent with what the record reveals about the agency’s priorities and decision making process.”

The executive branch now has an obvious logic problem: It must generate a non-pretextual agency explanation to justify an action to which it already committed itself without any such explanation. The Justice Department’s public flailing-about for a new rationale looks like the very definition of “arbitrary and capricious.” But whether or not such a rationale can now be found and belatedly attached to the census question, a presidential order cannot make the job easier.

For one thing, a presidential order cannot expand the secretary’s zone of legal discretion to determine the contents of the census. Just as important, an executive order cannot relieve the commerce secretary of his obligation to proceed based on a nonarbitrary rationale rooted in his statutory mission. “The president wants me to ask this question” would not be an adequate reason. Nothing in the statute empowers presidential whim."
Barr says DOJ would back Mueller if he decides not to testify,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/william-barr-robert-mueller-testify-census-question,"Attorney General William Barr said in an interview Monday that the Justice Department would support Robert Mueller if he decides he ""doesn't want to subject himself"" to questioning from congressional Democrats at a planned July 17 hearing.

Barr's comments raised the dramatic possibility that Mueller would pull out of the questioning at the last minute -- a potential coup for Democrats, as some Republicans and commentators have said Mueller's testimony could end up revealing fundamental problems with his now-closed investigation.

Although Mueller no longer was a DOJ employee, the Trump administration could still limit testimony about decisions made while he was special counsel. Barr indicated the Justice Department would seek to block any attempt by Congress to subpoena members of the former special counsel's team but did not say Mueller's testimony would be restricted in any way.

At the same time, a Mueller pullout would avert an unnecessary ""public spectacle,"" Barr told The Associated Press, given that Mueller has stated publicly that his exhaustive report on 2016 foreign election interference spoke for itself.

Trump attorney Jay Sekulow, however, has countered that Mueller's remarks could be necessary. Sekulow, in a Fox News op-ed last month, pushed for answers as to when exactly Mueller learned there was no evidence of collusion between the Trump team and Russia -- and why Mueller's team hinted in sworn court filings even late into the investigation that such collusion remained a tantalizing possibility.

TRUMP ATTY JAY SEKULOW: HERE'S THE QUESTIONS MUELLER MUST BE ASKED ON JULY 17

""I'm not sure what purpose is served by dragging him up there and trying to grill him,"" Barr asserted. ""I don't think Mueller should be treated that way or subject himself to that, if he doesn't want to.""

Mueller's 448-page report, released with redactions in April, found no proof that the Trump campaign conspired with Russian actors to influence the election, despite multiple outreach efforts by Russians, and did not reach a conclusion on whether President Trump obstructed justice.

Even so, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, tweeted Monday that Barr's remarks were ""no surprise.""

""Barr misled the public about Mueller's report, and wants his own deception to stand,"" Schiff wrote, referring to Barr's decision to release an initial summary of Mueller's report shortly before publishing the complete, redacted version. ""The public has a right to hear the truth, from Mueller himself, about Trump's misconduct and ongoing national security risks.""

In a news conference this past May, Mueller defended Barr's decision to release the summary: ""At one point in time, I requested that certain portions of the report be released,"" Mueller said. ""The attorney general preferred to make the entire report public all at once. We appreciate that the attorney general made the report largely public, and I certainly do not question the attorney general's good faith in that decision.""

MUELLER SUBPOENA COULD BACKFIRE ON DEMOCRATS, SAY POLITICAL, LEGAL EXPERTS

Barr's additionally said he still saw a legal path forward for requiring 2020 Census respondents to declare whether or not they're citizens. The Justice Department announced Sunday it was putting together a new legal team to spearhead its effort to ask the citizenship question after the Supreme Court temporarily blocked the move.

The justices said the administration's justification for the question ""seems to have been contrived,"" but implied they would consider additional arguments from the White House.

The new legal team, named in court papers, included Deputy Assistant Attorney General David Morrell, a former Trump White House lawyer and law clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas; Christopher Bates, who previously worked for Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch, and four career Justice Department attorneys: Glenn Girdharry, Colin Kisor, Christopher Reimer and Daniel Schiffer.

James Burnham, a top lawyer in the department's civil division who had been leading the team, had told Barr that a number of people who'd been litigating the case preferred ""not to continue during this new phase,"" the attorney general said.

Barr would not detail the new team's precise plans, though a senior official told The Associated Press that Trump was expected to issue a memorandum to the Commerce Department instructing it to include the question on census forms. Barr said he didn't have details on why the attorneys didn't want to continue, but ""as far as I know, they don't think we are legally wrong.""

Many Democrats have said a citizenship question would deter illegal immigrants from filling out census forms. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Monday that Trump wanted to add the demand for citizenship information because he wanted to ""make America white again.""

Census data counts all residents, including illegal immigrants, and is used to determine congressional apportionments and the makeup of the Electoral College. Although illegal immigrants cannot vote, their children become citizens automatically if born in the United States under a practice known as birthright citizenship -- which the Trump administration separately has called into question.

OPINION: WHY ENDING BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP IS CONSTITUTIONAL

The Trump administration has argued it wanted the citizenship question included to aid in enforcing the Voting Rights Act, which protects minority voters' access to the ballot box. However, Chief Justice John Roberts joined the court's four more liberal members in last month's Supreme Court decision, openly skeptical about that justification.

Pelosi, meanwhile, said in a letter to colleagues that the full House would be moving forward with a vote to hold Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt of Congress after the administration failed to comply with subpoenas regarding the census question.

Barr spoke to the AP after touring a federal prison in Edgefield, South Carolina, where he met with inmates and staff members to discuss the criminal justice reform law that Congress approved and Trump signed into law last year.

Separately, Barr revealed that he recused himself from the Jeffrey Epstein criminal case ""because one of the law firms that represented Epstein long ago was a firm I subsequently joined for a period of time.""

An indictment alleging sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy was unsealed Monday morning against Epstein, the wealthy and politically connected financier who pleaded not guilty during his initial appearance in a New York City federal court. Prosecutors alleged that Epstein, the 66-year-old hedge fund manager arrested on Saturday, preyed on ""dozens"" of victims as young as 14.

DOJ files to halt Trump suit demanding financial documents,https://www.foxnews.com,[],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/president-trump-financial-documents-department-of-justice,"The Justice Department on Monday challenged a federal judge's decision to allow a case accusing President Donald Trump of profiting off the presidency to move forward, asking an appeals court to take up the case instead.

Justice lawyers asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to overrule a federal judge and instead allow for a mid-case appeal or to dismiss the case outright, calling the case dealing with a Revolutionary War-era clause ""extraordinary.""

The government lawyers also want the court to suspend legal discovery recently approved by U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan, which would force Trump-related entities such as his New York and D.C. hotels, Trump Tower, the Trump Organization, and Mar-a-Lago Club to turn over business tax returns, receipts and other documents.

Justice lawyers said in the filings that answering their 37 subpoena requests in the interim, by July 29, would cause Trump ""irreparable injury"" and distract him from his official duties.

CUOMO SIGNS BILL ALLOWING CONGRESS TO GET TRUMP TAX RETURNS

This is the second time Justice lawyers have petitioned a higher court to take up a case dealing with the emoluments clause, which bans government officials from accepting foreign gifts and money without Congress' permission. Last December, the federal appeals court agreed to hear a similar case out of a Maryland federal court that had also reached such a point. In the meantime, a stay on proceedings was also allowed.

The lawsuit was brought by nearly 200 congressional Democrats led by Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York, who is also chair of the House Judiciary Committee. It argues that Trump has been accepting gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval. Trump, unlike modern presidents before him, has declined to fully divest from his businesses.

""Our goal is simple and straightforward -- stopping President Trump from putting a `For Sale' sign in Russian on the door to the Oval Office,"" Blumenthal said in a statement Monday. ""Unsurprisingly, the Trump Administration is still seeking to delay, delay, delay, but we are confident that the D.C. Circuit will recognize the well-reasoned logic of the District Court, and allow discovery to proceed.""

The Trump Organization did not immediately return requests for comment.

RUSH LIMBAUGH: 'EUROPEAN ELITES' THREATENED BY 'MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN'

The filing of a writ of mandamus is considered an ""extraordinary remedy,"" according to the Justice Department's website, which ""should only be used in exceptional circumstances of peculiar emergency or public importance.""

Among the judges who sit on the appeals court, includes chief judge is Merrick B. Garland, whose nomination by President Barack Obama to the Supreme Court was not allowed to be heard by Republicans.

The filing seeking for a writ of mandamus comes two weeks after Sullivan ruled against Justice Department lawyers who sought a mid-case appeal to a higher court and a stay on proceedings. For Justice to succeed at the appeals level, they must meet a demanding standard that would partly rest on showing Sullivan's decisions to be clearly wrong and that there's no adequate alternative for relief in the case.

They have argued that the court has ignored ""unique separation-of-powers concerns"" involved in having members of one branch of government conducting discovery against the president in his official capacity. The government also wrote in their filing that the legislature itself must bring such a case, ""not an amalgam of individual legislators or even a single chamber of a bicameral body.""

The case argues that the president has received foreign government favors, such as Chinese government trademarks for his companies, payments for hotel room stays and event-space rentals by representatives of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and proceeds from Chinese or Emirati-linked government purchases of office space in Trump Tower.



SEAN SPICER: 2020 ELECTION IS CHOICE BETWEEN TRUMP'S ECONOMIC PROSPERITY AND DEMS' LEFT TURN TOWARD SOCIALISM

Ethics experts say the constitutional emoluments clause was created by the Founding Fathers to ensure that government officials act with the interests of the American public in mind instead of their own pocketbooks.

Unlike prior presidents, Trump chose not to divest from his assets and he remains the owner of the Trump Organization, a sprawling business empire with 550 entities in more than 20 countries that include branded hotels, golf courses, licensing deals and other interests. His Washington, D.C., hotel is near the White House and has become a magnet for foreign governments, previously hosting groups tied to Kuwait, Bahrain, Turkey, Malaysia and Saudi Arabia.

The District of Columbia case is one of three that argues the president is violating the emoluments clause, but this case is notable because the plaintiffs in this suit -- members of Congress -- are mentioned in the clause itself. The Democrats' attorneys have argued that Congress not only has a right but is required, as part of their jobs, to weigh in on potential emoluments to Trump such as a $6.5 million condo purchase by the Qatari government or a Chinese-government owned company's investment in a project that will include a Trump-branded hotel and golf course in Indonesia.

Justice Department lawyers argued in court papers that the Democrats suing the president are not being injured by him at all but by their colleagues in Congress, who have refused to take up the emoluments issue. And the government has contended that Trump's business activity such as hotel room earnings don't qualify under the constitutional definition of emoluments.

Blumenthal said the subpoenas seeking information in the case are ""targeted"" to get information that ensures the president isn't avoiding his constitutional responsibility to ask Congress to approve any emoluments. The aim of the subpoenas is to trace ownership interests and money flowing to Trump from foreign governments and their representatives.

The subpoenas were seeking the terms governing the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust and related information, and aimed to determine trademarks granted to Trump or his companies by foreign governments since Jan. 20, 2017, and all pending applications for foreign trademarks.

The Justice Department asked the court in its filing Monday for a ruling regarding their request for a stay on the subpoenas by July 22 -- one week before the official response deadline -- ""in order to provide time to seek relief from the Supreme Court if necessary,"" an indication that the governments attorneys may be willing to elevate the case to the highest court if there is any indication they won't succeed at the appeals court."
Why the latest USDA report offers little good news for farmers,https://www.accuweather.com,[],,,,https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/why-the-latest-usda-report-offers-little-good-news-for-farmers/70008768,"July 08, 2019 Why the latest USDA report offers little good news for farmers

By John Roach, AccuWeather staff writer July 08, 2019, 4:42:51 PM EDT



The latest Crop Progress from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) offered little comfort to U.S. farmers dealing with a difficult planting season. For the fourth straight week, the condition of corn and soybeans was rated below 60%.

The rain and flooding that has impacted Corn Belt farmers has affected the percentage of corn considered “good” or “excellent” in 18 key corn-producing states. That number this week is 57%; the first rating of the season was 59%, followed by consecutive weeks at 56%. The condition of corn rated “good” or “excellent” last year at this time was 75%.

The condition of soybeans in 18 soybean-producing states considered “good” or “excellent” is 53%, compared to 54% last week. That figure was at 71% this time last year.

The bad news continues for Illinois, which is joined by Iowa as the top corn-producing states, typically accounting for about one-third of the U.S. crop, according to the USDA. The condition of corn in Illinois rated ""good"" or ""excellent"" is just 37%, even lower than last week’s rating of 42%.

Other states with particularly poor corn condition data this week include Missouri (28%), Ohio (34%) and Indiana (38%). Those three states also had low percentages for the condition of soybeans, too: Ohio (28%), Missouri (35%) and Indiana (37%).

Next week’s numbers may not be much better.

“The weather overall for the heart of the Midwest for the next 10 days is slightly negative,” said AccuWeather senior meteorologist Jason Nicholls. “There’s not a whole lot of rain, but the temperatures will be favorable because it will be somewhat warmer than normal. It does look like they’ll get some helpful rains later next week.”

A new AccuWeather analysis predicts there will be 13.03 billion bushels of corn produced this year. That would be the lowest total since 2012 when 10.76 billion bushels of corn were harvested. In 2018, the total was 14.42 billion bushels.

The USDA’s 2019 corn production estimate as of June 28 is higher, at 13.88 billion bushels.

New Human Rights Panel Raises Fears of a Narrowing U.S. Advocacy,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Edward Wong', 'Eileen Sullivan']",07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/us/politics/state-human-rights.html,"WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced Monday that he was installing a human rights advisory panel in the State Department, and named a conservative law professor as its chairwoman, to review and tighten the agency’s definition of human rights and ensure it is grounded in the “nation’s founding principles” and a 1948 United Nations declaration.

The State Department already houses an internal bureau that oversees human rights issues. But the new panel, which Mr. Pompeo said would examine “the role of human rights in American foreign policy,” will not be managed by the bureau and was created without substantial input from its experts and officials.

“International institutions designed and built to protect human rights have drifted from their original mission,” Mr. Pompeo said. “As human rights claims have proliferated, some claims have come into tension with one another, provoking questions and clashes about which rights are entitled to gain respect.”

The announcement, along with a blunt commentary by Mr. Pompeo that was published in The Wall Street Journal on Sunday, raised worries among human rights advocates and Democratic lawmakers that Mr. Pompeo is moving to curtail State Department advocacy for some rights, particularly ones related to women’s health and reproduction and gay and transgender issues."

The Department of Homeland Security made the request last week and is waiting to get approval from the Pentagon, according to an agency spokesperson.

DHS officials are looking to send troops from the Texas National Guard.

“Governor Abbott has consented to the use of the National Guard to support CBP,” said the DoD spokesperson in a statement.

The additional 1,000 National Guard members would be a major boost to President Trump’s policing of the US southern border. There were already 6,000 troops in the region as of April — 2,100 of whom were members of the Guard, The Hill reports.

Trump has gotten criticized recently over the conditions at federal detention centers along the border, with Democratic lawmakers calling them terrible and “disgusting.”

Environmental groups fight EPA's new FOIA rule,https://thehill.com,[],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/452066-environmental-groups-fight-epas-new-public-records-restrictions,"A coalition of environmental groups pushed back Monday against a new Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule that could restrict access to public records.

The new EPA rule, the details of which were first reported by The Hill, allows the administrator and other political appointees to review all materials requested under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) process.

“Any politicization of FOIA undermines its core functions of enabling the public to inform itself on what its government is up to, and to hold officials accountable for those actions,” the groups wrote in the letter, saying they were “concerned that this new rule will unduly impair the public’s right and ability to apprise itself of important agency actions.”

The groups that signed the letter, including the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Union of Concerned Scientists and many others, have asked Wheeler to withdraw the rule, saying it would be improper to implement it without giving the public a chance to weigh in on its impacts.

EPA’s new rule is similar to the controversial process employed by the Department of the Interior, which also lets political appointees review FOIA requests before they are released to the requester.

Critics of the rule at EPA and Interior have highlighted the potential for abuse.

“Aside from this requirement intuitively granting political staff heightened opportunities to interfere with FOIA requests, it is difficult to see how this change could possibly improve the Agency’s FOIA efficiency or enhance the public’s lawful access to information,” the groups wrote in their Monday letter.

There is already talk in Congress of using legislation to limit the review of public records documents by non-FOIA staff, something the agencies refer to as an “awareness review.”

“Transparency laws like the Freedom of Information Act help provide access to information in the face of an opaque and obstinate government. Unfortunately, a recent Supreme Court ruling and new regulations at EPA and the Department of Interior are undermining access,” Sen. Chuck Grassley Charles (Chuck) Ernest GrassleyGraham open to investigating Acosta-Epstein plea deal Taxpayer advocate heading to greener pastures GOP senators decline to criticize Acosta after new Epstein charges MORE (R-Iowa) said in a late June speech on the Senate floor.

“The public’s work ought to be public. So, I’m working on legislation to address these developments and promote access to government records.”

Sen. Ed Markey Edward (Ed) John MarkeyKatherine Clark quietly eyes leadership ascent Environmental groups fight EPA's new FOIA rule UN official: US can't ignore that climate change will force 120 million people into poverty MORE (D-Mass.) is also considering legislation in response to the new rules.

“The new regulation does not grant any additional authorities to 'reject' FOIA requests by claiming 'no records.' A response that yields 'no records' is simply a request in which a search has been conducted and no responsive records are found, it is a frequent determination that has existed since the passage of the FOIA, and has been available to any official authorized to issue FOIA determinations. This new regulation brings EPA into compliance with the law, which the Obama administration ignored,” an EPA spokesman said last month.

In Monday’s letter, the groups contend that holding back documents from a FOIA request is illegal.

“The law is clear that FOIA does not permit agencies to withhold a record or a portion of a record “on the basis of responsiveness,” they wrote.

EPA and Interior have said the FOIA rules are a necessary update to congressional changes to the FOIA law in 2016.

While the EPA administrator and other political appointees have had the ability to grant or deny FOIA requests, doing so under the “basis of responsiveness” and “no response” option is a new addition in the forthcoming rule.

A blanket explanation for non-responsive materials could make it harder for groups or individuals to legally challenge any of EPA’s decisions to withhold documents, because it will be more difficult to prove why they were withheld. A person appealing their FOIA response would not know if any documents were withheld under a “no records” response.

“You could have a situation where there is a pile of documents that the FOIA officer thinks is responsive and have a political appointee overrule them and say, 'I don’t think those documents are responsive because that’s not exactly what that person was looking for,’” said Matt Topic, government transparency and First Amendment lawyer at Loevy & Loevy, a Chicago-based firm that specializes in civil rights when the rule was first unveiled in late June. “There's a lot of opportunity to screw around with that.""

Other major changes in the rule include a decision to no longer allow EPA regional offices to handle initial FOIA requests. All requests instead must first be sent to the agency’s National FOIA Office, which will then delegate the requests to the proper office.

Any requests sent first to regional offices by members of the press, the public or any organizations will not be redirected and won’t be considered received.

“EPA expects to improve the efficiency and consistency of its intake and assignment processing, including more consistent and earlier outreach to requesters, through centralizing these functions into one office at the Agency,” the EPA said in a statement when it first announced the rule change."
State Department launches panel focused on human rights and natural law,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Carol Morello', 'National Reporter Focusing On Foreign Policy', 'State Department', 'July At Pm']",07-06-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/state-department-to-name-panel-focused-on-human-rights-and-natural-law/2019/07/06/3bfe001e-9f54-11e9-b27f-ed2942f73d70_story.html,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in past remarks about the creation of his Commission on Unalienable Rights, said he felt it was important to evaluate “how we think about human rights inside of our efforts in diplomacy.” (Jacquelyn Martin/AFP/Getty Images)

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday announced the creation of an advisory commission on human rights that has engendered controversy since it was proposed.

Pompeo said the Commission on Unalienable Rights “will provide the intellectual grist of what I hope will be one of the most profound re-examinations of inalienable rights in the world since the 1948 Universal Declaration.”

The panel will be headed by Mary Ann Glendon, a Harvard Law School professor who wrote a book about the United Nations’ 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Pompeo was Glendon’s research assistant when he studied law at Harvard. Glendon is also a former U.S. ambassador to the Vatican.

Besides her academic research, Glendon is known for her antiabortion views. At the 1995 U.N. World Conference on Women in Beijing, she fought successfully to keep abortion from being listed as a human right.

In thanking Pompeo for the appointment, Glendon said this is a time when “basic human rights are being misunderstood by many, manipulated by many and ignored by the world’s worst human rights violators.”

Some civil rights groups expressed concerns that the new commission could become a vehicle to chip away at same-sex marriage and abortion rights. Jamil Dakwar, head of the ACLU’s Human Rights Program, said it is an attempt to redefine human rights and “to roll back decades of progress in achieving full rights for marginalized communities.”

When the panel was first outlined in an internal State Department memo, the proposed chair was Robert P. George, a Princeton University professor who was a co-founder of the National Organization for Marriage, which opposed same-sex marriage, and a prominent antiabortion advocate.

A State Department official said that George will not be on the commission and that the panel will not weigh in on either issue.

“They will not make any pronouncements on gay marriage and abortion,” said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to preview plans for the commission.

Its work is likely to be heavily scrutinized, nevertheless. The commission’s job is to provide “fresh thinking about human rights discourse where such discourse has departed from our nation’s founding principles of natural law and natural rights,” according to a notice published in May in the Federal Register.

The mention of natural law, a philosophy that all human beings are endowed with certain rights, set off alarm among advocates of legal abortion and same-sex marriage. The phrase is used by those who argue that basic human rights — such as free speech and the expectation that governments should not torture people — are made vulnerable when social goods such as education, health care and clean water are elevated to the characterization of human rights.

Daniel Philpott, a University of Notre Dame professor who was initially mentioned as a potential commission member, said that natural law reflects a concern that human rights have gone off the rails, in part because of abortion and claims about marriage rights.

“The idea is these claims of human rights are not based upon natural law or the truth of the human person,” he said. “In a sense, these are false claims to human rights. It brings down the cause of human rights in general. Why should we pursue other human rights if human rights can be anything one faction or party advocates them to be?”

Last month, five Democratic senators sent Pompeo a letter expressing concern about the commission’s focus on natural law, calling it “a term sometimes used in association with discrimination against marginalized populations.”

Proponents of a reassessment say perceptions of what qualifies as a human right have evolved since the days when it took a gross abuse, such as a gulag or apartheid, to raise significant concern. Pompeo appeared to endorse that view, saying the commission will ask the most basic of questions.

“What does it mean to say or claim that something is in fact a human right?” he said. “How do we know or how do we determine whether that claim, that this or that is a human right? Is it true and therefore ought it to be honored?”

The commission is composed of experts, philosophers and human rights activists from every political persuasion. Pompeo said their deliberations will be grounded in the nation’s “founding principles” and those included in the U.N. document on human rights.

“Every once in a while we need to step back and reflect seriously on where we are, where we’ve been and whether we’re headed in the right direction,” he said.

Pompeo bemoaned the continuing human rights violations that persist seven decades after the declaration was drafted and said multinational institutions that are supposed to police human rights have not proved up to the task amid confusion on what constitutes a human right.

“We must therefore be vigilant that human rights discourse not be corrupted or hijacked or used for dubious or malignant purposes,” he said.

The commission will get input from the State Department’s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor (DRL), which already produces annual reports rating countries on their records for human rights and religious liberty. Critics have wondered whether the volunteer panel will undermine the bureau, which for more than four decades has been responsible for holding abusive governments to account.

“We don’t need this commission,” said Michael Posner, the State Department’s assistant secretary for DRL from 2009 to 2013. “What we need is for the U.S. government, the secretary of state and the president to abide by and uphold international human rights standards we already have adopted.”

Modern human rights law is rooted both in religious concepts and experience. Many of the basic principles are embedded in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, which in turn formed the basis for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations after World War II and the Holocaust.

William L. Saunders, a human rights scholar at Catholic University who also was mentioned as a potential commission candidate, said that getting input from experts outside of government is sensible.

“I would think the Universal Declaration will guide and shape reflection by the new commission,” he said in an email.

Pompeo has spoken out about human rights abuses in some countries, including China’s detention of Uighur Muslims, Iran’s treatment of religious and ethnic minorities, and the repressive policies of Cuba and Venezuela.

“The distinctive mark of Western civilization is the belief in the inherent worth of human beings, with the attendant respect for God-authored rights and liberties,” Pompeo said in a May speech at the Claremont Institute. “Indeed, the Declaration says that ‘all men are created equal.’ And we ought to help nations protect these first things — and human rights, as well.”

Critics, however, have faulted him for not saying more about abuses committed by governments friendly to the United States. The administration’s response to last year’s killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi remains a particular concern.

“When Mr. Khashoggi gets murdered in Turkey and we know there’s a senior Saudi leader, the crown prince, involved, we ought to be saying something about it,” said Posner, the former DRL head. “When the government of the Philippines is executing thousands of people, we ought to be saying something. When a free press is denied a place in Turkey, we ought to say something.

“That’s what diplomacy is about,” he said. “That’s what DRL has done for 40-some years. The idea that we need fresh thinking or need to somehow revise and rethink what the principles are flies in the face of that history and experience.”"
Department of Education not National School Board,https://www.nationalreview.com,"['Yuval Levin', 'Andrew C. Mccarthy', 'George Will', 'John Fund', 'Brian T. Allen', 'Madeleine Kearns', 'Jim Geraghty', 'Alec Dent', 'Jonah Goldberg', 'Jack Fowler']",07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/the-department-of-education-is-not-a-national-school-board/,"(Jonathan Alcorn/Reuters)

Last week, Joe Biden joined the bandwagon of Democrats (started by Elizabeth Warren this year) promising to name a public-school teacher to be Secretary of Education if he wins the presidency. It’s an easy commitment to make in front of a teachers’ union audience, and it wouldn’t be all that odd to do it—several past presidents of both parties have named former public-school teachers to the job.

But the promise is another example of a thoroughly bipartisan misconception about the work of the federal education department. Even if they haven’t been former teachers, nearly every education secretary since the Department of Education was created in the Carter years has been someone with expertise or experience in K-12 education—whether as an educator, administrator, reformer, or policymaker. But the Department of Education actually has a lot more say over higher education than primary or secondary schooling, and its work has suffered from the lack of focus on higher ed over the years. If we must have a Department of Education, it could at least be run by someone who knows something about higher education.

The American system of primary and secondary schools is gloriously decentralized. There are about 130,000 K-12 schools in America, about three-quarters of which are public schools. The latter are governed by about 13,000 different school districts across the 50 states. These districts have enormous power over curriculum and staffing decisions, and the states have most of the remaining power over education policy.

The federal role in K-12 education is strongest in circumstances where racial or other discrimination triggers legally-mandated responses. Otherwise, the federal government uses some levers of conditional funding under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act—a Great Society law that has been updated every few years since. Recent updates include the No Child Left Behind Act and the Every Student Succeeds Act. These have given the federal government more leverage over time, but its power is still greatest at the margins. Federal dollars are about 8 percent of K-12 education funding, and the Department of Education doesn’t really shape primary and secondary education policy.

We should all be glad about that. And a teacher who wants to influence education policy would be better advised to run for school board or for the state legislature than to go to Washington.

But unfortunately, the federal Department of Education does play a critical role in setting the direction of American higher education. Here too, its power comes mostly from the leverage created by federal dollars, but that leverage is immense, especially because of the student-loan system. And it has meant that the federal government has played a central role in driving the tuition inflation that plagues higher ed and in creating all manner of policy trouble besides.

Price inflation in higher education has been massively exacerbated by the basic structure of federal policy in this area, which might be best described as simultaneously subsidizing demand and restricting supply.

The subsidization of demand is done through student aid, which has been too open-ended and has risen with tuition, thereby creating upward pressure on costs. This leverage over funds has also given the Department of Education lots of informal power to drive policy through nudges and “suggestions” in a variety of areas. The Obama administration’s notorious “Dear Colleague” letters are a prominent example.

The restriction of supply, meanwhile, has been a function of accreditation, which the incumbent players in American higher education have used to restrict new entrants and new uses of technology. Accreditation is technically a private process, run by a group of NGOs, but because it is the means by which schools become eligible for students with federal loans and grants, the Department of Education has enormous power over it, essentially accrediting the accreditors.

All of this gives the Secretary of Education a lot of opportunities to improve (or to worsen) higher-ed policy—both by working with Congress to change the law and by working directly to change the department’s policies. Higher-ed policy is badly in need of reforms, getting those right could make a huge difference, and the Secretary of Education would be a key figure in making that happen. The Trump administration has taken some useful steps in this direction, but there is lots more to be done.

So a president who wanted to do something useful in education policy would be wise to appoint an education secretary who knows something about higher education, rather than just one who will say nice things about primary and secondary schools."

The Pentagon has not yet approved the request, which was made last week.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) has agreed to the use of the National Guard to assist CBP at the border, said Maj. Chris Mitchell, a Pentagon spokesperson.

""Supplemental holding support is requested for CBP holding facilities located at Donna and Tornillo, Texas,"" he said.

""These holding facilities house single adult migrants who have illegally entered the United States, been processed by CBP, and are awaiting transfer to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facilities. These holding facilities will be owned, operated, and managed by CBP.""

DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

There were 6,000 troops at the border as of April, 2,100 were members of the National Guard.

The DHS request comes as the Trump administration has received increasing criticism for the treatment of migrants detained at the border.

The Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General recently released two reports detailing conditions in El Paso, Texas, and Rio Grande, Texas, facilities. The government watchdog found severe overcrowding, migrants being held too long and dirty conditions at many of the facilities.

The administration has deflected the criticism, saying stemming the flow of immigrants is a priority.

Apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border plummeted by 28 percent from May to June, the DHS estimates."
James Comey’s daughter named to Jeffrey Epstein prosecution team,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,['Ap Photo Richard Drew'],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/comeys-daughter-named-to-epstein-prosecution-team,"The Justice Department team that is leading the prosecution of alleged child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein includes the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey.

Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said at a press conference Monday that Maurene Comey is part of the public corruption unit handling the case against the well-connected and wealthy businessman.

Maurene Comey, an assistant U.S. attorney, was named alongside Alex Rossmiller and Alison Moe as the prosecutors assisting Berman with the case. James Comey, who was fired as FBI director in 2017 by President Trump, had been a U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York before he became deputy attorney general under President George W. Bush.

Last year, James Comey said his wife Patrice “very much wanted Hillary Clinton to be the first woman president” and that he was pretty sure that his four daughters, if not all five of his children, had also wanted Clinton to defeat Trump in 2016.

“There was a lot of passion in this house for Hillary Clinton,” Comey said.

Comey also said his wife and daughters participated in the Women’s March the day after Trump’s inauguration.

Epstein was charged by prosecutors with conspiracy and with sex trafficking of underage girls, and faces up to 45 years behind bars. Prosecutors consider him a flight risk and have asked a judge to keep Epstein behind bars pending his trial.

During the raid on Epstein’s Manhattan mansion, investigators say they seized an “extraordinary volume” of photographs of apparently underage girls."
Reluctant witnesses in FISA abuse probe agree to talk to DOJ inspector general,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Catherine Herridge', 'Catherine Herridge Is An Award-Winning Chief Intelligence Correspondent For Fox News Channel', 'Fnc', 'Based In Washington', 'D.C. She Covers Intelligence', 'The Justice Department', 'The Department Of Homeland Security. Herridge Joined Fnc In As A London-Based Correspondent.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/reluctant-witnesses-in-fisa-abuse-probe-agree-to-talk-to-doj-inspector-general,"Key witnesses sought for questioning by Justice Department Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz early in his investigation into alleged government surveillance abuse have come forward at the 11th hour, Fox News has learned.

Sources familiar with the matter said at least one witness outside the Justice Department and FBI started cooperating -- a breakthrough that came after Attorney General William Barr ordered U.S. Attorney John Durham to lead a separate investigation into the origins of the bureau’s 2016 Russia case that laid the foundation for Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe.

While the investigative phase of the inspector general’s long-running probe is said to be complete, the sources said recent developments required some witnesses to be reinterviewed. And while Barr testified that he expected the report into alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) abuse to be ready in May or last month, multiple sources said the timeline has slipped.

""The wheels of inspector general investigations move very, very slowly,"" former senior DOJ official Tom Dupree told Fox News.

Dupree, who served as deputy assistant attorney general from 2007 to 2009, does not have firsthand knowledge of the current IG case but is familiar with the process. He added, ""Like any investigation, you talk to one person, something that person tells you sends you back … to the first person, so it can be a very extensive, exhaustive process, because you are constantly picking up leads, interviewing former sources and navigating complex questions of classified information.""

Late-breaking information is known to delay such investigations. Horowitz’s office similarly encountered new evidence late in the process of the IG review into law enforcement decisions during the 2016 Hillary Clinton email investigation. In this case, additional FISA information came to light late in the process – including October 2016 contact (first reported by The Hill and confirmed by Fox News) between a senior State Department official and a former British spy Christopher Steele, who authored the infamous and salacious anti-Trump dossier.

The State Department contact with Steele was relayed to a senior FBI official. The timeline matters because about two weeks later, the FBI and DOJ used Steele's unverified research, paid for by the DNC and Clinton campaign, to secure a surveillance warrant against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. At the very least, it's been argued, Steele's contact with another government agency should have been a red flag for the FBI because it may have violated his confidential human source agreement.

Steele was later fired by the FBI over his media contacts before the 2016 presidential election. The Page surveillance warrant is the central issue of the DOJ IG’s review.

With the timeline for Horowitz’s report not public, one of the wild cards is the final review by the FBI and DOJ, which includes classification issues and could take weeks.

A spokesman for Horowitz would not comment on the report's status. But during largely unrelated testimony in November, Horowitz offered some guidance for the timeline of the FISA abuse probe in response to questions from GOP Rep. Jim Jordan.

""What I can say is given the volume of documents we've had and the number of witnesses it looks like we'll need to interview, we are likely to be in the same sort of general range of documents and witnesses as the last report,"" Horowitz said, referring to his team's review of the Clinton email case. ""It wouldn't surprise me if we are in that million or so plus range of documents and a hundred-ish or so interviews. The last review, as you know, took us about … 16 months or so.""

If that same guidance holds, the window for completion would begin this month, though it remains unclear how much the DOJ/FBI review and the additional interviews could delay the process."
It's time to think more seriously about the implications of elderly presidents,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/its-time-to-think-more-seriously-about-the-implications-of-elderly-presidents,"Should he win reelection and complete his full second term, President Trump will surpass Ronald Reagan as the oldest person to ever hold the office. But Trump's age is hardly ever talked about, because leading Democrats Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders would be older than Reagan at the start of their presidencies.

As medical science improves and life expectancy increases, more and more candidates may be willing to test the limits of age. And there's nothing in the law that prevents them from running and winning. While one could argue that it should ultimately be up to the voters to decide whether somebody is fit to serve, there are clear issues with this test.

One is that the U.S. Constitution set the minimum age to be president at 35. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of the most influential voices in her party, is unable to join the two dozen other candidates seeking the party's nomination. Even if Democratic primary voters wanted to support her, they could not. So if she can't run simply because she's too young, is it stripping Americans of any more of a choice by saying they can not vote for somebody who would be in their 80s during a first term?

The second issue is that even if they wanted to, there's a lack of objective information available for voters to determine whether somebody is physically and mentally unfit to serve out a term in office. Candidates are not required to submit medical information, and both Trump (with his ridiculous doctor's note) and Hillary Clinton (with her pneumonia cover-up) were opaque about their health in 2016.

So, one other solution short of age limits would be to require a more specific set of medical information from candidates for office.

There also may need to be a more specific explanation, with measurable health metrics, of the circumstances under which the 25th Amendment can be invoked. Section 4 of the amendment reads, ""Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President."" But that is incredibly open-ended and subject to interpretation.

None of these (age limits, medical disclosure requirements, revisiting the 25th Amendment) might really be a workable solution. But given that it's becoming more common for elderly candidates to run for president, we should be thinking about the problem in a serious matter. Even if a candidate looks vigorous on the campaign trail, a lot can happen within four years in a demanding job, and, in general, somebody in their 80s is going to be at a significantly greater risk of having some sort of adverse physical or mental health decline within that period. This should be a serious part of our political discourse at a time when so many elderly candidates are seeking office."

The move to pull the invitation for Ambassador Kim Darroch came after Mr. Trump tweeted that his government “will no longer deal with” the diplomat.

Mr. Darroch missed out on a glittering dinner in the ornate “Cash Room” at Treasury, adjacent to the White House, featuring a guest list of Fortune 500 CEOs and international financiers.

At the dinner, Mr. Trump called the Amir a great friend of the U.S. and thanked him for building a U.S. military base there.

“Better your money than ours,” the president joked.

“This is a who’s who of people in business,” Mr. Trump said of the attendees.

Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin hosted the dinner for Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, on the night before the emir meets on Tuesday with Mr. Trump at the White House.

The president said Tuesday’s meeting will be big, “from defense to purchases and trade, and I know everything’s going to be very positive.”

Qatar has been embroiled in a public feud with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt, who have accused Doha of backing Islamist militants and Iran.

Among the guests at the dinner were Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenberg; Trump confidante Thomas Barrack, chairman and CEO of Colony Northstar; Ron Burkle, co-founder of The Yucaipa Companies; Michael Corbat, CEO of Citigroup; Bob Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots and a Trump friend; Eli Miller, managing director of Blackstone Group; Brian Moynihan, chairman and CEO of Bank of America Corp.; Michael Ovitz, former president of Walt Disney Company; David Rubenstein, co-founder of The Carlyle Group; Edward Breen, chair and CEO of DowDuPont; John DeGioia, president of Georgetown University; Raytheon Chairman Tom Kennedy; Milken Institute Chairman Michael Milken; Steven Mollenkopf, CEO of Qualcomm Inc.; Lorenzo Simonelli, CEO of General Electric; Patrick Soon-Shiong, owner of the Los Angeles Times; Randall Stephenson, chairman and CEO of AT&T; Chevron chairman and CEO Michael Wirth; Christine Lagarde, managing director and chairman of the International Monetary Fund; and World Bank President David Malpass.

DHS Official Defends Conditions at Border Patrol Stations,https://www.snopes.com,['Associated Press'],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.snopes.com/ap/2019/07/08/dhs-official-defends-conditions-at-border-patrol-stations/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan on Sunday defended conditions at U.S. Border Patrol stations following reports of crowded and unsanitary conditions that have heightened debate about President Donald Trump’s immigration policy, a trademark issue for his reelection campaign.

“It’s an extraordinarily challenging situation,” McAleenan told ABC’s “This Week.”

The Homeland Security Department’s internal watchdog provided new details about the overcrowding in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley, the busiest corridor for illegal crossings. The report said children at three facilities had no access to showers and that some children under age 7 had been held in jammed centers for more than two weeks. Some cells were so cramped that adults were forced to stand for days on end.

Government inspectors described an increasingly dangerous situation, both for migrants and agents — a “ticking time bomb,” in the words of one facility manager. The report echoed findings in May by the department’s inspector general about holding centers in El Paso, Texas: 900 people crammed into a cell with a maximum capacity of 125; detainees standing on toilets to have room to breathe; others wearing soiled clothing for days or weeks.

In tweets, Trump went further than McAleenan in defending his administration’s response, accusing the news media of “phony and exaggerated accounts” but without providing evidence.

“Border Patrol, and others in Law Enforcement, have been doing a great job. We said there was a Crisis – the Fake News & the Dems said it was ‘manufactured,'” Trump wrote. Federal detention centers “are crowded (which we … brought up, not them) because the Dems won’t change the Loopholes and Asylum. Big Media Con Job!”

Democrats faulted Trump for not offering an immigration overhaul that could pass a divided Congress.

“The president is acting like we are some weak, pathetic country,” said Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, a Democratic presidential candidate. “We have the ability to treat human beings humanely. We have the ability to lead our hemisphere in a discussion about how to deal with this refugee crisis,” he said on “Fox News Sunday.”

McAleenan said that since the first of the year, 200 medical providers have been added to facilities, including personnel from the U.S. Coast Guard and the Public Health Service Commission Corps.

“We have pediatricians in border patrol stations for the first time in history trying to help address conditions where children are coming across 300 a day in … April and May,” McAleenan said.

“We’ve built soft-sided temporary facilities. These are spaces that are much more appropriate — high ceilings, more room for children and families. We’ve put them both in Donna, Texas, in South Texas as well as in El Paso to provide additional space. … We’ve bought buses to transport people to better places.”

McAleenan disputed news reports, including those by The Associated Press, of especially troubling conditions at a border station in Clint, Texas, where a stench was coming from children’s clothing and some detainees were suffering from scabies and chickenpox.

“There’s adequate food and water,” he said. “The facility’s cleaned every day, because I know what our standards are and I know they’re been followed because we have tremendous levels of oversight. Five levels of oversight.

“Inadequate food, inadequate water and unclean cells. None of those have been substantiated.”

He said everyone in the chain of command is worried about the situation of children detained at the border. He said that on June 1, his department had 2,500 children in custody, including 1,200 who had been there for more than three days. As of Saturday, McAleenan said there were 350 children, and only 20 have been in the department’s custody for more than three days.

“So that’s huge improvement based on the resources we asked for from Congress and were finally given,” he said.

Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., told NBC’s “Meet the Press” that he is stunned when administration officials say that reports on the conditions are unsubstantiated.

“I’m just like, ‘What world are they living in?'” Merkley said, citing government and news reports. “From every direction you see that the children are being treated in a horrific manner. And there’s an underlying philosophy that it’s OK to treat refugees in this fashion. And that’s really the rot at the core of the administration’s policy.”

Separately, McAleenan addressed questions about U.S. Border Patrol agents who are under fire for posting offensive messages in a “secret” Facebook group that included sexually explicit posts about U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and dismissive references to the deaths of migrants in U.S. custody. The existence of that group was reported Monday by ProPublica. Prior to that, few people outside the group had ever heard of it.

He said an allegation about such activity was investigated in 2016. “Discipline was meted out on an agent that made an offensive post on that website,” he said."

The DOJ’s Office of Inspector General, led by Michael Horowitz, released the summary on Monday. The probe concluded that the DEA group supervisor “violated DEA policy” by “repeatedly meeting with the CS alone,” including at the source’s home. The inquiry also found that the group supervisor “went on two personal trips” with the source and let the source visit the group supervisor’s family and friends.

“None of these individuals were made aware that the group supervisor’s companion was a DEA confidential source who was participating in drug trafficking investigations involving violent criminals,” the DOJ inspector general wrote. “In so doing, the group supervisor deceived these individuals and exposed them and their families to potential danger.”

DOJ’s watchdog also concluded that the DEA assistant special agent in charge signed off on improper payments and failed to properly manage the group supervisor.

The report said “criminal prosecution was declined” by the Justice Department.

Horowitz’s investigation into alleged FISA abuse has reportedly concluded, although last-minute witnesses and a tricky classification process mean it may be a while until the report is released."
"Census farce: Trump, Barr and the Justice Department make a mockery of the law",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Jennifer Rubin', 'Opinion Writer Covering Politics', 'Policy', 'Foreign', 'Opinion Writer', 'Jennifer Rubin Writes Reported Opinion For The Washington Post.']",07-07-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/07/07/census-farce-trump-barr-doj-make-mockery-law/,"Opinion writer

The Supreme Court found late last month that the administration’s explanation for inclusion on the 2020 Census of a question asking about citizenship didn’t match the facts. In other words, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross lied when he said the Justice Department had initiated the process by asking for such a question to enforce the Voting Rights Act, a blatant misrepresentation.

Last week, things got even worse. The Post reports:

Government lawyers said in a filing Friday that the Justice and Commerce departments had been “instructed to examine whether there is a path forward” for the question and that if one was found they would file a motion in the Supreme Court to try to get the question on the survey to be sent to every U.S. household.

The administration, you see, just hasn’t figured out what that non-pretextual excuse is. Its position now raises several questions, including: 1) Did the Justice Department lie to the courts to get an expedited Supreme Court hearing by claiming the issue had to be resolved by June 30 and 2) Did the president give the game away when he told reporters the question was needed for reapportionment? As The Post reports, “Trump’s statement could give additional heft to information discovered in May suggesting the administration worked with a Republican redistricting strategist who saw the question as a way to give Republicans and non-Hispanic whites an electoral advantage.”

Ian Bassin, executive director of the nonpartisan nonprofit Protect Democracy, tells me, “There’s a term for trying to create a structural political advantage for ‘Republicans and non-Hispanic whites,’ and that term is ‘white power.’ And we now know that’s been the purpose all along for adding a citizenship question to the census.”

President Trump seems to think that by invoking “executive order,” he can make his legal problem disappear. Wrong. The Supreme Court disallowed the question for now and sent it back for the “real reason” for including the question. He cannot shout “Executive order!” and cure his legal problem.

Moreover, we know from evidence belatedly uncovered that the real reason was to produce a census that favored white voters and hence the Republican Party (thereby acknowledging that the party’s political survival is entirely dependent on artificially inflating the white share of the electorate). The government actually tried to halt discovery in a Maryland lawsuit over the census question while it comes up with a new explanation, a cheeky move slapped down by U.S. District Judge George J. Hazel. They want to keep litigating the real reason for the citizenship question? Fine, let’s have at it.

Constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe observes, “The district court’s refusal to go along with the antics of the Justice Department’s legal team has been a reassuring reminder that this dictator-admiring president has not yet succeeded in breaking the judicial guardrails completely.” However, Tribe argues that Trump “has left little doubt about his willingness to do so if he senses at any given moment that it would serve his theatrical or political interests — interests that he seems incapable of distinguishing.”

There is good reason for the plaintiffs to be optimistic about their chances. “The court vacated the Voting Rights Act rationale as a contrived pretext,” Thomas Wolf, counsel with the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, told The Post. “What they’re trying to do now is the textbook definition of a pretext — telling the court, ‘We plan to do this but we don’t know why yet.’”

As Tribe points out, “Among the many things wrong with the government’s disgraceful game is that [the] president has today made absolutely clear that his sole purpose in trying to circumvent the Supreme Court’s recent decision by inserting a citizenship question in the census one way or another is to reduce the political power of areas with a relatively high proportion of noncitizen residents (read: nonwhites) — perfectly lawful residents, despite Trump’s reference to them as ‘illegals.’” This, of course, amounts to “flatly violating the 14th Amendment’s mandate in Section 2 that such power be allocated among the states in proportion to their actual population.”

The entire debacle raises serious questions about the credibility and honesty of the Justice Department. “The Trump administration lied to the courts about the real reason for the citizenship question. And they got caught by the Supreme Court,” Mimi Rocah, a former federal prosecutor, tells me. “Now Trump has directed DOJ lawyers to come up with some other lie. No DOJ lawyer should sacrifice her integrity with the courts for this or any administration.”

Trump’s contempt for the rule of law and blatant dishonesty would not continue without the help of underlings. And they must do some serious soul-searching. “There are some things no DOJ lawyer can do. One of those is make arguments in court that are untrue in order to benefit the political whims of a president,” Joyce White Vance, a former prosecutor, says. “If DOJ’s leadership, the [attorney general,] the deputy AG, the solicitor general and the head of the Civil Division [don’t want to be] complicit in violating the duty of candor DOJ lawyers owe to the court, then they should resign on principle and in protest.”

They won’t resign en masse, of course, because the professional and ethical expectations have been so diminished in this administration that the unimaginable is now standard operating procedure for both political appointees and career lawyers.

“Make no mistake: The government lawyers — appointees and civil servants alike — who are spending this weekend trying to cleanse the record of this fact and salvage this plan are employing their legal skills in the service of white power,” Bassin says. “That’s not just a violation of their oath of office, it’s an abdication of the basic morality on which we all as human beings are ultimately judged. They don’t have to do this. We all make choices.”

The long-term reputation of the Justice Department may be severely damaged by these types of episodes. “A self-respecting DOJ official, whether a political hire or a long-serving civil servant, would resign rather than make arguments that treat the federal judiciary with such disrespect simply to humor the president or his lackey in the office of attorney general,” Tribe observes. Because they have not chosen that course, the next president and attorney general will have their hands full rehabilitating the department and reestablishing professional norms.

As Trump continues to mow down one democratic norm after another and tries to defy Congress and the courts on a regular basis, one has to reevaluate the efficacy and urgency of impeachment. “To refrain from promptly beginning formal impeachment proceedings against a president who conducts his office in this chaotically lawless manner, on top of everything else he has done, would be an abdication of constitutional responsibility,” Tribe asserts.

At the very least, this new example of deceitful lawyering should be added to the list of topics for House Judiciary Committee hearings.

U.S. says its producers harmed by some structural steel imports,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-steel/u-s-producers-harmed-by-some-structural-steel-imports-commerce-department-idUSKCN1U32GV,"FILE PHOTO: A worker walks past rolls of steel wires at a factory in Nantong, Jiangsu province, China July 3, 2018. REUTERS/Stringer

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Monday said domestic producers were being harmed by imports of fabricated structural steel from China and Mexico, and that it would instruct the customs agency to collect cash deposits from importers of such steel.

The U.S. Commerce Department said it had found that imports from Canada were not being unfairly subsidized.

Mexico said in a statement that a U.S. countervailing duty investigation of Mexican fabricated structural steel was an “ordinary” anti-dumping probe with no relation to earlier tariff threats by U.S. President Donald Trump.

Mexico added that its economy ministry would defend the interests of the companies under investigation, and that it had been actively participating in anti-subsidy procedures since early 2019. It did not give further details in the statement.

The preliminary subsidy determination does not endanger ratification of the new North American trade deal, Mexico’s deputy foreign minister for the region, Jesus Seade, said on social network Twitter.That deal was designed to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement that governs more than $1.2 trillion of mutual trade.

The U.S. International Trade Commission said in March that imports of fabricated structural steel from Canada, China and Mexico were harming domestic producers.

Fabricated structural steel is used in major building projects, such as bridges, buildings, parking decks and ports. An industry trade group had filed a petition asking for the trade case to be launched.

In 2018, the United States imported $722.5 million worth of fabricated structural steel from Canada, $897.5 million worth from China and $622.4 million worth from Mexico, according to the Commerce Department.

The department is expected to make its final ruling on the imports around Nov. 19."

Trump's EPA stands up for consumers and freedom by standing up to the ethanol lobby,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/trumps-epa-stands-up-for-consumers-and-freedom-by-standing-up-to-the-ethanol-lobby,"President Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency took a step toward draining the swamp by curbing the amount of corn ethanol being forced into our economy by the crony capitalist ethanol mandate.

Big Corn is exploding with shock and dismay, as are corn-friendly lawmakers. But the White House shouldn’t heed the objections of these subsidized corporate moonshiners. Instead, he should lean on Congress to go further and reduce the ethanol mandate to zero.

Ethanol is a fuel alcohol derived from plants, in this country mostly from corn. Without federal support, there would be a very small market for ethanol, which is less powerful than gasoline, typically more expensive, cannot be shipped by pipeline, and tends to corrode engines.

The federal renewable fuel standard, also known as the RFS and the ethanol mandate, is King Corn’s current gravy train. The mandate requires refineries to blend a certain amount of ethanol into their gasoline. The EPA has some leeway on this score, and the agency has used it to protect consumers rather than the ethanol lobby.

The fuel standard requires at least 15 billion gallons of “conventional biofuels,” basically corn ethanol, for 2020. The ethanol lobby wanted the Trump administration to require more ethanol than even the law requires. Trump’s EPA further infuriated the industry by issuing exemptions for small refineries, which often struggle to get their hands on the amounts of ethanol required to meet the mandates.

The corn lobby angrily denounces these exemptions as “small refinery bailouts,” in the words of Geoff Cooper, president of the Renewable Fuels Association. Consider for a moment the perverse sense of entitlement here. An organization representing for-profit businesses, firms engaged in enterprise and supposedly proud of their product, calls it a ""bailout"" when a potential customer is granted limited freedom to not buy their product.

This is how crony capitalism not only distorts the economy and corrupts our politics (watch the Democratic presidential candidates bow before the altar of ethanol in Iowa these days), but how it also corrupts our businesses.

We understand that some of ethanol's biggest champions are powerful. We understand that Trump's political allies include some ethanol hustlers. And we understand the desire to help farmers, especially at a moment when tariffs are unfairly hurting them.

But if Trump cares about the economy, and about draining the swamp, he will not give into King Corn's demands. In fact, he should go in the other direction.

Trump should call on his friends in Congress to kill the ethanol mandate. Pass and sign a law winding the mandate down from its 15 billion gallons down to zero gallons in 2025. At the same time, scrap the mandate for ""advanced"" biofuels. If these fuels are so great, then consumers will buy them without a mandate.

That's how capitalism works, even if the swamp wants it to work differently."
The Justice Department Hasn’t Found a New Reason for the Census Citizenship Question—but Trump Has,https://slate.com,['Mark Joseph Stern'],07-05-2019,2019,7,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/07/justice-department-census-citizenship-question-trump.html,"President Donald Trump boards Air Force One before departing from Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland on Friday. Mandel Ngan/Getty Images

The Department of Justice revealed on Friday that it’s still searching for a new justification for a census citizenship question that might pass legal muster. And while it rummages around for that rationale, the DOJ asked a federal judge to delay discovery into the allegedly discriminatory motives that produced the citizenship question, a request he promptly denied. Meanwhile, Donald Trump revealed his actual reason for wanting a citizenship question on the census—and it contradicts statements his own solicitor general made to the Supreme Court.

Welcome to the ongoing clown show of census 2020.

Friday’s DOJ filing was expected to provide a new reason for the citizenship question, after SCOTUS ruled that its previous rationale was bogus. (Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who oversees the census, said the question was necessary to better enforce the Voting Rights Act, a claim that does not make sense and is contradicted by the record.) Trump ordered administration officials to devise this new pretext just one day after they told a court they had dropped their quest for the citizenship question.

That about-face created difficulties in the ongoing case before U.S. District Judge George Hazel. The Supreme Court blocked the citizenship question because it was illegally supported by pure pretext, not because it was discriminatory. In June, however, plaintiffs uncovered new evidence that seemed to indicate the purpose of the question was to diminish Hispanics’ voting power. In light of these materials, Hazel reopened discovery in the case to let plaintiffs pursue their equal protection claim, a decision affirmed by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

Had the Trump administration simply dropped the citizenship question, this case would be moot. But Trump has refused to give up on the question, so this case should, in theory, move forward, with discovery commencing as soon as possible.

On Friday, though, DOJ attorneys asked Hazel to pause discovery while they develop a different justification for the citizenship question. They argued that, by “providing a new rationale,” they will have magically cleansed the question of any discriminatory intent. For support, they cited Trump v. Hawaii, in which the Supreme Court held that any prejudiced motives undergirding Trump’s initial travel ban had been washed away by its third iteration. The DOJ, in other words, believes that Trump v. Hawaii prohibits courts from examining illegal motives behind the original citizenship question once it issues a new rationale for that question.

None of these shenanigans will please Chief Justice John Roberts.

Hazel did not agree, rejecting the DOJ’s request on Friday in an order allowing discovery to move forward. And for good reason.* It would be much more difficult to engage in animus-laundering here, where the administration’s first justification for the citizenship question has already been shot down. Trump officials are now openly contriving a new rationale, beginning with their conclusion and working backward to find some pretext that SCOTUS might accept. The administration must uproot the entire legal structure upon which the citizenship question stands—unlike in the travel ban case, where the stated purpose (national security) was always the same. Any animus attached to rationale No. 1 will surely taint rationale No. 2 when both are fruit of the same poisonous tree.

It is also pretty shocking to see the DOJ take its time in crafting a new pretext when it repeatedly told the Supreme Court that it had to finalize the census forms by June 30. The administration used this deadline to leapfrog over the court of appeals and get a swift Supreme Court ruling. Now that urgency has vanished, creating the inescapable impression that the DOJ lied to SCOTUS about its alleged timeline in a game of chicken that it unexpectedly lost. (The government is already printing census forms without a citizenship question, so any alteration at this late date will cost a huge sum of money.)

Finally, the Justice Department is not being helped by Trump, who acknowledged on Friday that the “number one” reason for a citizenship question is “for districting.” Presumably, Trump means that he wants to let states draw districts by counting only citizens of voting age, not all persons—a scheme that would dramatically boost white voting power. (It has been neither permitted or prohibited by SCOTUS.) That’s a troubling concession, because Solicitor General Noel Francisco told the Supreme Court that using citizenship data for redistricting was not the purpose of the census citizenship question. Once again, Trump is telling a very different story from the narrative carefully crafted by DOJ attorneys.

None of these shenanigans will please Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote the opinion blocking the citizenship question on the first go-round. With every reversal and misrepresentation, the Trump administration is making it more difficult for Roberts to uphold the question under a new rationale. The DOJ will eventually contrive a new pretext that will likely get laughed out of court. It is destroying its own credibility to pursue what has become a feeble and humiliating vanity project for the president.

Update, July 5, 2019, at 3:48 p.m.: This article has been updated to note that Hazel allowed discovery to move forward."

(J. David Ake/AP)

The Justice Department is swapping out the lawyers who had been representing the administration in its legal battle to put a question about citizenship on the 2020 Census, possibly signaling career attorneys’ legal or ethical concerns over the maneuvering ordered by President Trump.

The department announced the move in a statement, which was issued after The Washington Post inquired about whether the career lawyers on the team planned to withdraw. A person familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said that at least some of the career attorneys harbored concerns about the administration’s handling of the case — although the nature of those concerns and how widespread they were could not immediately be learned.

“As will be reflected in filings tomorrow in the census-related cases, the Department of Justice is shifting these matters to a new team of Civil Division lawyers going forward,” Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said. “Since these cases began, the lawyers representing the United States in these cases have given countless hours to defending the Commerce Department and have consistently demonstrated the highest professionalism, integrity and skill inside and outside the courtroom. The attorney general appreciates that service, thanks them for their work on these important matters and is confident that the new team will carry on in the same exemplary fashion as the cases progress.”

The shift in lawyers will be reflected in simple withdrawal and appearance notices filed in court, a Justice Department official said. The official said the entire team on the case — both those in political positions and career employees who have served multiple administrations — will be replaced with political and career lawyers from the department’s Civil Division and Consumer Protection Branch. Several career members of the team declined to comment to The Post.

That the department also replaced those in political jobs signals there could have been other factors in the staffing shift beyond concern from career employees. At least one political official, James Burnham, had no objection to continuing on the case but supported the move to go with a new team, according to a Justice Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters.

The staffing change comes as the department is moving toward what some analysts say is increasingly unsteady legal ground in its bid to add the citizenship question, despite a Supreme Court decision that would seem to bar it from doing so.

[Trump administration scrambles to save citizenship question on census]

Less than a week ago, the Justice and Commerce departments had effectively conceded defeat, saying they were printing the census without the citizenship question and acknowledging even internally that the Supreme Court had given them no other choice. But the surrender infuriated Trump, who ordered the lawyers to do an about-face and come up with ways to keep the fight alive.

Trump said Friday that he was mulling an executive order to get the question added — a move pushed by some of his conservative allies, although legal analysts have said it would be unlikely to succeed in court. The forms for the 2020 Census are still being printed without a citizenship question. Those opposed to adding it fear it would drive down the count of minorities, which is important because census results are used for allocation of funds and congressional redistricting. The Commerce Department referred a reporter seeking comment for this article to the Justice Department.

The Justice Department sits in an atypical position inside a presidential administration, enjoying a measure of independence for its law enforcement operations while also defending the president’s policy agenda when it is challenged in court. Department lawyers can sometimes be put in a position of arguing that particular policies are legal, even if they would not personally support them.

The census case, though, seems to have become something beyond that. Justice Department lawyers had told those suing to block the citizenship question from being added that the 2020 Census would be printed without it, and internally, they thought they had no other options. When Trump tweeted Wednesday that the case was “absolutely moving forward,” some lawyers on it were blindsided.

Appearing that day before a federal judge in Maryland, Justice Department attorney Joshua Gardner explained how he had always “endeavored to be as candid as possible with the Court” but that he did not know what was on Trump’s mind.

“The tweet this morning was the first I had heard of the President’s position on this issue, just like the plaintiffs and Your Honor,” Gardner said to the judge, a transcript shows. “I do not have a deeper understanding of what that means at this juncture other than what the President has tweeted. But, obviously, as you can imagine, I am doing my absolute best to figure out what’s going on.”

The case is not the first instance of a dramatic shake-up among Justice Department lawyers on a high-profile case in the Trump administration. Last year, a senior career Justice Department official resigned in the wake of the administration’s move to stop defending a key provision of the Affordable Care Act.

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan defended his department’s treatment of migrants detained at the southern border on Sunday and pushed back against reports of squalid conditions at border patrol facilities including the station in Clint, Texas.

“This is an extraordinarily challenging situation. We had an overflow situation with hundreds of children crossing every day. That’s why we were asking for funding for Health and Human Services, to provide adequate bed space so those children could be moved from that immediate border processing into a more appropriate setting for children,” McAleenan told ABC’s “This Week.”

“So, I’m not denying that there are challenging situations at the border. I’ve been the one talking about it the most,” he continued. “What I can tell you right now is that there's adequate food, water, and that the reason those children were at Clint station in the first place is so they could have medical consolidated; they had shower facilities — for over a year there’s been showers there. So, this is why we try to provide a better situation for the brief time they’re supposed to spend at the border.”

McAleenan’s remarks came after a report published Saturday by The New York Times and the El Paso Times detailing conditions at the Clint station as “the stuff of nightmares” — including “outbreaks of scabies, shingles and chickenpox” among detained migrant children. The report also states that Border Patrol leadership “knew for months that some children had no beds to sleep on, no way to clean themselves and sometimes went hungry.”

McAleenan insisted Sunday that the Clint station remains sanitary and is cleaned daily, adding: “I know what our standards are, and I know they're being followed because we have tremendous levels of oversight.” He also dismissed as unsubstantiated allegations of “inadequate food, inadequate water and unclean cells” at the facility, and said that his department has “no evidence that children went hungry.”

Asked about reports that Border Patrol agents have raised alarms about the conditions at the Clint station, McAleenan responded: “Of course we’re worried about it. Everyone in the entire chain of command was worried about the situation for children.”

Later on Sunday, President Donald Trump defended agencies’ handling of migrants, calling The Times’ report part of a “Big Media Con Job!”

“The Fake News Media, in particular the Failing @nytimes, is writing phony and exaggerated accounts of the Border Detention Centers,” the president wrote in a series of posts on Twitter. “First of all, people should not be entering our Country illegally, only for us to then have to care for them. We should be allowed to focus on ..... United States Citizens first. Border Patrol, and others in Law Enforcement, have been doing a great job.""

“We said there was a Crisis — the Fake News & the Dems said it was ‘manufactured,’” he continued. “Now all agree we were right, but they always knew that. They are crowded (which we.....brought up, not them) because the Dems won’t change the Loopholes and Asylum. Big Media Con Job!”

A DHS inspector general’s report on Tuesday found “dangerous overcrowding and prolonged detention of children and adults” at migrant detention centers, prompting Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) to call Wednesday for the firing of top Customs and Border Protection officials."
The Department of Defense needs Mark Esper — and a few policy changes,https://thehill.com,[],07-07-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/451617-the-department-of-defense-needs-mark-esper-and-a-few-policy-changes,"Just over halfway through the Trump administration’s first term, the military is getting its third secretary of Defense in Mark Esper. Although the U.S. military is the finest fighting force in the world, even the best need consistent leadership. Fortunately, the Department of Defense (DOD) is receiving a great leader in Esper. He is superbly qualified, by experience and temperament — a family man, combat veteran infantry officer, West Point graduate, defense industry and policy expert, and an intellectual with high-level Pentagon civilian leadership experience.

Esper understands the importance of civilian leadership and how to bring sustainable change in policy, strategy and modernization for the military. However, he does face significant challenges to defend, deter and defeat, if necessary, enemies of the United States — and some of those challenges are at home.

The U.S. focus on counterterrorism not only shifted resources away from modernization of military force planning, structure and technology, it enabled other nation states to challenge, if not close, the competitive edge of the U.S. military. The overemphasis of strategy and resources on Afghanistan and Iraq, President Obama’s withdrawal from Iraq (precipitated by an unnecessary invasion of Iraq), and a botched Libya plan enabled America’s adversaries to recognize the changes in the world order. In addition, America’s adversaries took advantage of the divisive state of U.S. politics. Bottom line, America was being outflanked by its competitors.

Chinese alternatives to American values of democracy, rule of law, human rights and a free-market economy are creating a new economic cold war that will face off the United States and its partners and allies against those of China. Through strategic diplomacy, China has extended its influence into Africa and Latin America, while using the People’s Liberation Army as a capitalist tool to strengthen Chinese influence. China’s “One Belt, One Road” initiative presents even deeper regional influence across the Middle East and into Europe.

Vladimir Putin Vladimir Vladimirovich PutinUkraine's new president deserves additional Western support The Department of Defense needs Mark Esper — and a few policy changes Trump's coarseness, Democrats' shrillness do US foreign policy no favors MORE, meanwhile, aims to return Russia to its legacy where governments must consider Russian perspectives or actions in any region. Russian influence continues to gain in Eastern Europe, where Putin sees NATO as his biggest threat to regional influence. Putin has inserted Russian diplomacy and military power in the Middle East, through Syria and Iran, in order to have a seat at the table. And, surprisingly, Russia returned to the table with the Taliban to counter U.S. influence in this region as well. Most concerning is that Russia and China increasingly are allying themselves diplomatically.

The Middle East could be spiraling toward regional war. Iran, with Russian support, presents the single greatest threat to any region’s stability because of its revolutionary rhetoric, desire for nuclear weapons, hatred of Israel and the historic Shia-Sunni divide. The violence and destruction caused by ISIS, the United States’s haphazard withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement, an unprecedented number of refugees, and belligerent rhetoric and actions, particularly involving the Strait of Hormuz, have created a powder keg.

So, what should the new secretary of Defense do?

First, American society needs robust dialogue on what it expects its all-volunteer force (AVF) to do and how big the military should be to protect the United States. The AVF is more professional and experienced in its purpose, but it is not completely positive. A large AVF is costly to taxpayers. Its personnel costs possibly crowded out necessary long-term defense spending on weapons, infrastructure and technology advances. It struggles to compete in a highly competitive labor market, and has created a warrior caste among Americans.

The United States should not take the position that it’s in a state of perpetual conflict, which has been expressed by military and political leaders. This perspective results in overuse of the military as an instrument of government power and stresses the AVF to points of concern for American society.

Second, the U.S. must get out of Afghanistan now. We should have left after destroying most of al Qaeda following 9/11. No one can predict with any certainty of intelligence that another terrorist attack will emanate from Afghanistan; there are plenty of ungoverned spaces and financiers in the world that can make that happen. We should instead put more resources and effort into developing an alliance with India and reinforcing the Indo-Pacific strategy.

Third, modernization and acquisition changes to policy and process must occur faster, while taking acceptable risk in current readiness. DOD must hedge its bets and focus on threats to the survival of the U.S. Constitution and its values, and not every emerging character of conflict in the world. Right now, the U.S. military is doing too much at one time. The United States must invest in high-end technological capabilities such as cyber offense and defense, advanced aircraft, hypersonic weapons, directed energy and 5G telephony to counter future threats. DOD must shed its propensity to make incremental changes if it is going to transform for the future.

Fourth, the U.S. must reinforce European states and NATO to confront emerging threats. The biggest threat emanates mainly from Russian aggression, evidenced by its actions in Crimea and Ukraine, disinformation operations through digital media, and its increased foreign military activity in places such as the Black Sea. NATO, however, faces other threats such as uncontrolled migration, cyber threats and attacks, and Chinese strategic competition.

Fifth, the Indo-Pacific region must remain a strategic priority in order to maintain U.S. regional balance of power because of China’s assertive posture and overall global trade. American isolationist policies are hampering the development and maintenance of U.S. alliances and partnerships in response to China’s rise. U.S. presence and interaction with India, Japan, South Korea, Australia and other Southeast Asia countries will hedge against China’s economic and military rise and reconstruct the regional order.

As secretary of Defense, Esper clearly will face a difficult set of circumstances for the next few years. He is a great choice — the right leader for the job. His partnership, however, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard PompeoThe Hill's Morning Report - House Democrats clash over next steps at border Overnight Defense: Iran exceeds deal's uranium enrichment limit in latest breach | Admiral confirmed as top Navy officer resigning | DHS requests 1,000 more National Guard troops at border Pompeo launches controversial commission to examine 'unalienable rights' MORE, his West Point classmate, must remain a priority. If Pompeo keeps the State Department engaged and in the lead, he will give Esper the best chance to transform and rightsize a more technologically proficient, high-intensity fighting force that is utilized more appropriately in protecting the United States.

The department cannot continue to have temporary leadership when it has the blood and treasure of American fathers and mothers deployed in combat zones. A Senate-confirmed secretary must be present to make the critical decisions presented to our armed forces daily. Congress should step up now and immediately confirm Esper.

Department of Agriculture suspends bee population research,https://nypost.com,['July'],07-07-2019,2019,7,https://nypost.com/2019/07/07/department-of-agriculture-suspends-bee-population-research/,"The US Department of Agriculture has angry beekeepers buzzing after suspending data collection on the insects’ decline.

The agency blamed cost cuts, CNN reported Saturday.

An annual department survey, inaugurated in 2015, gathers data on the number of honeybees per state, including those lost due to symptoms of colony-collapse disorder.

“The decision to suspend data collection … was necessary given available fiscal . . . resources,” the agency said.

Department of Labor reports trucking employment on the rise,https://www.ccjdigital.com,['Commercial Carrier Journal'],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.ccjdigital.com/new-figures-from-labor-department-show-trucking-employment-upswing-in-recent-months/,"CCJ‘s Indicators rounds up the latest reports on trucking business indicators on rates, freight, equipment, the economy and more.

New data released by the Department of Labor on Friday presents a rosier picture of trucking employment through the first half of 2019 than originally indicated by earlier, preliminary data. Instead of a lackluster 400 jobs added since January — compared to the nearly 50,000 between December 2017 and December 2018 — the DOL’s upwardly revised numbers indicate the for-hire trucking industry added 7,300 jobs on a seasonally adjusted basis in 2019’s second quarter and 11,700 jobs since the beginning of the year.

According to the DOL’s monthly Employment Situation Report, the second-quarter upswing was capped by a 4,300-job uptick in June. The U.S. economy as a whole added 224,000 jobs in June, and the unemployment rate climbed a tenth of a percent to 3.7 percent.

Employment in the for-hire trucking industry totaled 1.519 million in June — a gain of 36,800 jobs from the same month last year.

The transportation and warehousing sector as a whole in June added 23,900 jobs, according to the DOL, while major freight producing sectors like manufacturing and construction added 17,000 jobs and 21,000 jobs, respectively."

Small Businesses Win Defense Department Contracts,https://businessjournaldaily.com,[],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://businessjournaldaily.com/small-businesses-win-defense-department-contracts/,"YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio — Jerry Kirila, founder and president of Kirila Fire Training Inc., glances upon a list of 82 destinations printed on the rear panels of one of the company’s red mobile units, about the size of a large charter bus.

Among places listed are Lackland Air Force Base, Texas; March Air Force Base, Calif.; Tyndall Air Force Base, Fla.; McGuire Air Force Base, N.J.; Camp Butler, Japan; Ramstein Air Base, Germany; and the Youngstown Air Reserve Station in Vienna. A host of other locations follow, from Saipan to Turkey.

“There are tons of more places,” Kirila says. “We just ran out of room.”

Most of the business at Kirila Fire Training – about 70% – is done with the U.S. Department of Defense, Kirila says. Indeed, the company was founded 12 years ago based on doing business with the military. The Hartford Township company designs, manufactures, installs and maintains fire-training systems used at defense installations throughout the world as well as civilian sites such as airports.

“We’re now a global operation, and we became that because of the DOD,” Kirila says.

Kirila Fire Training Inc. represents a sector of the regional economy that has developed a distinct relationship with the defense industry, which translates into millions of dollars worth of business every year.

Manufacturers, contractors and distributors across the region are vital links in a supply chain that keeps the armed forces prepared and equipped with the resources necessary to defend the country.

While weapons systems and aircraft command most of the attention, the government must also rely on those contractors that manufacture and supply bolts, hoses, small components, construction services and everyday items that collectively allow the defense industry to operate effectively.

During fiscal 2018, companies in Mahoning, Trumbull and Columbiana counties secured $44.9 million worth of business with the Department of Defense, according to USASpending.gov. Thus far in fiscal 2019, these counties had $10.7 million worth of defense work on their books, according to the site.

In western Pennsylvania, companies in Lawrence County registered $1.6 million in DOD business during fiscal 2018 and stood at $150,580 through fiscal 2019. Meanwhile, companies in Mercer County saw $3.2 million worth of business with the Defense Department and secured $149,157 through fiscal 2019.

A sizeable chunk of defense contracts awarded to Trumbull County companies has gone to Kirila, which specializes in training military personnel on how to respond to fire emergencies on aircraft and vehicles. The company manufactures and fabricates mock aircraft, towers and vehicles and equips them with a patented ignition system that can spark blazes inside and outside the craft.

A mock aircraft made at Kirila’s fab shop awaits completion. The unit is slated to be transported to an air base where ground crew receive firefighting training.

During a morning in late spring at the company complex in Harford Township, workers were putting the final touches on one mock aircraft, while the skeleton of another was under construction in an adjacent building. These structures, along with the company’s ignition systems, are primarily shipped to U.S. Air Force bases all over the country, where flight and ground crews receive training on how to combat fires.

Kirila mobile units serve as a part office, part living quarters for those employees who travel across the country to install these systems, he says.

“We just did a large project at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida for the fire and research lab there,” Kirila says. He estimates there are just three other companies in the country that have the capabilities Kirila commands. “We’re pretty busy,” he says.

Trumbull County companies secured $20.3 million in business from DOD in fiscal 2018 and have posted $481,720 worth of business thus far in 2019.

“We’ve been awarded more than 85 projects from the federal government since 2009, and more than half of those projects were with the Department of Defense,” says Dawn Ochman, president of Dawn Inc., a design, construction and renovation business in Warren.

“These contracts are the lifeblood of our business, even more so when the economy is not doing well and very few dollars were being spent in commercial construction,” she says. “In the past 10 years, about 95% of our sales were with the government.”

More recently, Dawn Inc. was awarded a $3 million contract to perform renovation work at the Pittsburgh Air Reserve Station, according to USASpending.gov.

Ochman says securing work for DOD is challenging at first, especially for a small business. Once a company proves itself and maintains a solid track record with the government, subsequent business comes more easily.

“Customers including the DOD want to see strong past performance not just in construction, but in government contracting,” Ochman says. “Once you have a few successful projects under your belt, you become a much bigger player in this arena.”

Doing business with the Department of Defense is much different than dealing with the private sector, Ochman elaborates.

“We’ve spent as long as two years planning for a proposal submission to the government,” she says. “If awarded, we then have the opportunity to bid on work for the customer for another 60 months. This is not typical in commercial construction.”

Manufacturers and service providers across Mahoning County also have realized a steady business with DOD. In fiscal 2018, companies in Mahoning County did $11.2 million worth of business with the Department of Defense and have secured $4.5 million in contracts through fiscal 2019.

The scope of these companies is diverse.

Corcon Inc., an industrial-painting company based in Coitsville Township, is in the midst of a multi-year contract valued at $6.8 million, while Valley Food Systems Inc., Youngstown, repeatedly wins new business with the DOD through the company’s A-rations program, which supplies packaged meals to the National Guard.

Other companies, such as Salem-Republic Rubber Inc. in Sebring, manufacture items specifically designed for defense applications.

“We’ve been working with the military over the last seven years, and it’s really kicked off over the last three,” says James Dunchuck, vice president of sales and marketing at Salem-Republic. “We positioned ourselves with some of the things we did in 2015 and 2016 to open up some of these opportunities,” he says.

Salem-Republic manufactures industrial hoses and accessories used as support equipment for commercial and military aviation, Dunchuck says. About three years ago, the company refocused its attention on engineering and sales directed toward winning more business with the government.

The company has attracted the attention of the DOD because of a particular hose known as an air start duct, Dunchuck says. These hoses are used by ground crews to supply fixed-wing aircraft with pressurized air that helps kick-start the turbines of the plane.

“We are one of two manufacturers of that product worldwide,” he says. The duct system also comes with hose couplings and scuffers – spiral coverings that slide over the duct hose to prevent abrasive wear since they are repeatedly used on flight decks and tarmacs.

Contracts with the DOD can range between several thousand dollars to longer-term deals of $1 million and $1.5 million that could stretch over three years, Dunchuck says.

Salem-Republic Rubber Inc. employs about 70.

“The future for us is refining our approach in ground-support equipment,” Dunchuck says.

Meanwhile, the company continues to work on improving its internal operations and strives to become more efficient as it increases market share. “We’re a qualified underdog in this arena,” he observes.

Other local companies provide services to the DOD to save that agency money. For example, the government often chooses to contract with companies that are capable of refurbishing heavy-duty equipment instead of buying new vehicles or other machines.

“We’re working on a couple of different projects,” says Ken Timmings, manager at KTSDI in North Lima. The company is most active in the DOD’s service-life extension program, or SLEP. “They have an aging fleet of vehicles and there are two cost scenarios – that is to purchase new or to rebuild under SLEP,” he says.

That’s where KTSDI comes in. The company can take a vehicle the military uses and take it down to the bare bones, rebuild that vehicle and place it into service in like-new condition.

“There are different SLEPs going on all the time,” Timmings says. ”It’s a common method to look at their fleets.”

Recently, the DOD put out a request for proposal to recondition rough-terrain container handlers, Timmings says.

“We’re involved in the powertrain components and electronic steering for that,” he says, noting the company has worked with other contractors on similar programs. “A lot of work is done on-site; but they also send components to us and we send them back refurbished.”

Companies such as KTSDI are able to recondition parts or vehicles for 60 to 90 cents on the dollar when compared to new purchases, he notes. “It’s a fraction of the cost,” he says.

Most of the work KTSDI does with defense involves new-vehicle technology. “We’ve done work with all the branches of the military and traveled to locations from Alaska to Guam,” Timmings says.

Still, even work with the DOD or other government agencies isn’t always a sure thing, Timmings says. “It’s either feast or famine,” he says. “It comes in very little at a time or it comes in a lot.”

"The Trade Struggles To Move On From June 30 USDA Report, Analyst says",https://www.agriculture.com,[],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.agriculture.com/markets/analysis/the-trade-struggles-to-move-on-from-june-30-usda-report-analyst-saysf,"The Trump administration has coined the terminology fake news when it comes to some reporting of events and articles regarding the administration.

One has to wonder if the Acreage Report issued on June 30 by the National Agricultural Statistics Service was nothing more than fake news as well.

With extraordinary weather circumstances prohibiting planting progress, the expectation for accurate report data was heightened, and yet the USDA knowingly released the June 30 Acreage Report expecting to resurvey producers in July.

It was not until well after the report was released did they indicate that a resurvey, if necessary, would occur in July.



If necessary?

On June 2, 33% of the corn crop had yet to be planted (latest crop planting ever). Heavy rains continued to pound parts of the Midwest. The survey asked farmers if they intend to plant. Having their back up against the wall in early June, they would likely say yes. Prices were rallying, and they would plant if possible. Common sense should have prevailed.

The USDA could have delayed the survey. Or, at a minimum, issued a disclaimer prior to the release of the report, stating a resurvey would occur due to lack of accurate data. This would have been the responsible and correct approach, providing the marketplace with a more intentional plan to provide full transparency.

Instead, they let the market respond to incredibly negative news, which sent prices limit lower. On March 31, farmers said they intended to plant 92.8 million acres of corn. The June 30 report indicated 91.7 million, or a decline of 1.1 million acres.

It is estimated, potentially, that Illinois alone could have close to 1 million acres of prevent plant. Concerns in Indiana, Ohio, the Dakotas, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Missouri suggest a much, much larger number of acres in jeopardy of not being planted, perhaps 5 to 7 million.



The USDA knew they had less than realistic information. They released it, only to then backtrack. The agriculture community deserves a better process of providing timely and accurate information than was exhibited last Friday. What is the point of releasing a “fake” report?



Regardless of their intentions, this is another example of unexpected price moves. Prices move on facts, rumors, and “fake” news. No one knows for sure where prices will go. Prior to any report, we encourage customers to plan for the unexpected. Positioning yourselves for all scenarios is time well spent.

Justice Department shaking up legal team on census case,https://www.staradvertiser.com,['Associated Press'],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.staradvertiser.com/2019/07/08/breaking-news/justice-department-shaking-up-legal-team-on-census-case/,"WASHINGTON >> The Justice Department is shaking up the legal team fighting for the inclusion of a citizenship question on the 2020 census but offered no specifics on why the change was being made.

The change announced Sunday comes days after the department vowed to continue to try to find a legal path forward to include the question on the census. The Trump administration has faced numerous roadblocks to adding the question, including a ruling from the Supreme Court that blocked its inclusion, at least temporarily.

President Donald Trump said last week that he was “very seriously” considering an executive order to get the question on the form. The government has already started to print the census questionnaire without the question.

The Justice Department is expected to file court papers today that show a new team of lawyers will take over.

“Since these cases began, the lawyers representing the United States in these cases have given countless hours to defending the Commerce Department and have consistently demonstrated the highest professionalism, integrity, and skill inside and outside the courtroom,” Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said in a statement.

A department spokeswoman declined to comment when asked whether the change had been ordered by Attorney General William Barr.

A Justice Department official told The Associated Press that the new team would consist of both career and politically appointed attorneys. James Burnham, a top lawyer in the department’s civil division, would no longer be leading the litigation team, said the official, who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity to discuss the matter ahead of the court filing.

An administration official said the new legal team may find it easier to argue the administration’s new position. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official wasn’t authorized to speak on the record.

The Trump administration has argued that the question was being added to aid in enforcing the Voting Rights Act, which protects minority voters’ access to the ballot box. But Chief Justice John Roberts joined the court’s four more liberal members in last month’s Supreme Court decision, saying the administration’s justification for the question “seems to have been contrived.”

The U.S. Census Bureau’s own experts have said a citizenship question would discourage immigrants from participating in the survey and result in a less accurate census that would redistribute money and political power away from Democratic-led cities where immigrants tend to cluster to whiter, rural areas where Republicans do well."
