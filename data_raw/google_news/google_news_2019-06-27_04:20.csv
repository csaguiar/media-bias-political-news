Weeks of Talks Led a Reluctant Mueller to Testify,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Nicholas Fandos', 'Eileen Sullivan']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/us/politics/trump-mueller-testimony.html,"Mr. Mueller staked out his position in an 11-minute address — his first and only public appearance as special counsel — in the Justice Department briefing room. Congress could force him to testify, he said, but warned he “would not go beyond our report.”

“It contains our findings and analysis and the reasons for the decisions we made,” Mr. Mueller said. “We chose those words carefully, and the work speaks for itself. And the report is my testimony. I would not provide information beyond that which is already public in any appearance before Congress.”

Talks about his testimony had begun after Mr. Barr released a redacted version of Mr. Mueller’s report in April. They slowed after Mr. Mueller left his post as special counsel and no longer had easy access to a coterie of staff and official government channels for negotiating, people involved in the discussions said. Democrats ultimately turned to Jonathan R. Yarowsky, a partner at Mr. Mueller’s former law firm of WilmerHale who also previously worked for the Judiciary Committee, to serve as an intermediary to Mr. Mueller’s closest aides, according to the congressional official directly involved.

WilmerHale also made office space available to Mr. Mueller as he negotiated, Robert T. Novick, a managing partner, said on Wednesday.

By mid-June, the patience of Democratic activists and lawmakers on Capitol Hill was wearing thin. The White House was blocking witness after witness called to testify on Capitol Hill and threatened to go on stonewalling “illegitimate” oversight by Democrats as long as needed.

Democrats tried to impress upon Mr. Mueller’s team that they would subpoena him if he did not agree to terms and demand that he appear on two consecutive days for much longer sessions, said the senior official involved in the talks, who was not authorized to speak by name. And though Democrats understood his position, they made clear that Congress and the public disagreed with the view that a Justice Department prosecutor need never speak and that Mr. Mueller had a responsibility to clear the public record about his work.

By Tuesday evening, both sides agreed to the more limited setting under subpoena. Rather than risk letting details of the agreement leak out, Mr. Nadler and Representative Adam B. Schiff, the Intelligence Committee chairman, decided to announce the terms in a statement at 9 p.m."
Reddit Quarantines Pro-Trump Subreddit r/The_Donald Over Anti-Police Threats,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Will Sommer'],06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.thedailybeast.com/reddit-quarantines-pro-trump-subreddit-the_donald-over-anti-police-threats,"Reddit quarantined the “The_Donald” subreddit on Wednesday, citing threats made on the popular forum for Trump supporters against law enforcement officers.

“Recent behaviors including threats against the police and public figures is content that is prohibited by our violence policy,” a Reddit spokesperson said in a statement. “As a result, we have actioned individual users and quarantined the subreddit.""

The new quarantine was brought on by anti-police threats posted on The_Donald. Some users had apparently encouraged violence against law enforcement, angry that officials in Oregon were trying to bring back GOP state senators who fled the state to avoid voting on a climate-change bill. In a note to The_Donald moderators, Reddit administrators said they had “observed this behavior in the form of encouragement of violence towards police officers and public officials in Oregon.”

It’s not clear what posts prompted the quarantine, but on Monday, Media Matters detailed a number of anti-police messages posted on The_Donald.

One user posted that they would have “no problems shooting a cop trying to strip rights from Citizens.” Another wrote that “rifles are the only way we're going to get any peace in our lives ever again.”

With roughly 754,000 subscribers, The_Donald is one of the largest forums for Trump fans on the internet, and by far the largest on Reddit. The site became so prominent in the Trump movement that Trump himself answered questions from the forum’s members during the 2016 campaign.

Trump digital strategy director Dan Scavino monitors The_Donald for ideas, Politico reported in May, and Trump has tweeted meme videos from the site.

The_Donald plays a key role in the right-wing ecosystem online, according to Becca Lewis, a Stanford doctoral student who studies online subcultures on the right. The_Donald posters take memes from more extreme forums like 4Chan or Gab and bring them to the subreddit, where they can picked up by more mainstream politicians and pro-Trump personalities.

“You get these things that start out just with smaller audiences, and then in part through The_Donald end up reaching millions and millions of people,” Lewis said.

As part of the quarantine, Reddit users will see a content warning before accessing the subreddit. In the past, quarantines against other subreddits have made them harder to find, and sometimes serve as a prelude to being banned from the site entirely.

The_Donald was controversial on Reddit long before Wednesday's quarantine. Prior to the 2017 Unite the Right white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, The_Donald moderators pinned a post encouraging members to attend the rally to the top of the page. The subreddit’s users regularly vote content from white supremacists and other extremists to the forum’s frontpage. The subreddit was also an early hotbed for conspiracy theories about murdered Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich, with The_Donald posters regularly claiming without evidence that Rich was murdered by Hillary Clinton.

Lewis believes the quarantine is a “step in the right direction,” but comes “too little, too late.”

“It has become a hotbed for disinformation, harassment, calls for violence, and conspiracy theories in the form of memes and other forum-style posts,” Lewis said of The_Donald.

In its message to the subreddit’s moderators, Reddit asked for them to take action to prevent further threats being posted on the forum. One The_Donald moderator, “shadowman3001,” fumed after receiving the note, claiming the quarantine was political.

“It would seem they've set up an impossible standard as a reason to kill us before the 2020 election,” the moderator wrote.

In emails to The Daily Beast, The_Donald moderator “sublimeinslime” said the quarantine was “unexpected” and said it could drive some The_Donald members to other social media platforms.

“As hard as our moderators work in a position in which they are not paid, it is somewhat of an insult as we are faced with the burden of correcting this,” the moderator said.

Other pro-Trump figures, including Fox News host Tucker Carlson and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, have also appeared in the forum to interact with subscribers.

The quarantine provoked outrage across the pro-Trump internet. A self-described “memesmith” named “Carpe Donktum,” whose videos Trump has reposted on Twitter, declared the quarantine to be “ABSOLUTE BULLSHIT.”"

My political differences with this president and his accomplices in Congress — and now on the Supreme Court — are only part of the reason. Indeed, those differences may not be the lesser reason, and that, for me, says a lot.

For me, the reason is that the country, or large segments of it, seems to be acquiescing to a particular form of evil, one that is pernicious and even playful, one in which the means of chipping away at our values and morals grow even stronger, graduating from tack hammer to standard hammer to sledgehammer.

America, it seems to me, is drifting toward catastrophe. Donald Trump is leading us there. And all the while, our politicians plot about political outcomes and leverage. Republican politicians are afraid to upset him; Democratic politicians are afraid to impeach him.

One thing that should never be underestimated is a politician’s clawing instinct toward self-preservation. These disciples of flexibility have learned well that the trees that remain standing are those that bend best in the storm."
"Sony, Microsoft, And Nintendo Come Out Against Trump’s Tariffs On Gaming Consoles",https://kotaku.com,"['Ethan Gach', 'About The Author', 'Kotaku Staff Writer. You Can Reach Him At Ethan.Gach Kotaku.Com']",,,,https://kotaku.com/sony-microsoft-and-nintendo-come-out-against-trump-s-1835878667,"Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo have joined forces to tell the U.S. government that its newly-proposed tariffs on goods imported from China would hurt consumers, put jobs at risk, and stifle innovation, according to a joint letter sent by the companies to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.



As part of its ongoing trade war with China, the Trump administration has proposed $300 billion in tariffs, or taxes on foreign goods, on most consumer goods. This would include a 25 percent tariff on video game consoles. “For those purchases that do go forward despite tariffs, consumers would pay $840 million more than they otherwise would have,” the console manufacturers argue, citing a report by the Trade Partnership Worldwide economic group.



In the joint letter dated June 17, the companies say that 96 percent of video game consoles imported by the U.S. are manufactured in China and that due to the custom hardware inside of them, they can’t easily be made elsewhere. “The video game console supply chain has developed in China over many years of investment by our companies and our partners,” the companies say. “It would cause significant supply chain disruption to shift sourcing entirely to the United States or a third country, and it would increase costs—even beyond the cost of the proposed tariffs—on products that are already manufactured under tight margin conditions.”



They go on:



“Each video game console comprises dozens of complex components sourced from multiple countries. A change in even a single supplier must be vetted carefully to mitigate risks of product quality, unreliability and consumer safety issues. Tariffs would significantly disrupt our companies’ businesses and add significant costs that would depress sales of video game consoles and the games and services that drive the profitability of this market segment.”

The companies don’t speculate what the 25 percent tariff would do the the prices that consumers will pay at the cash register, but they do argue that the effects of the increased costs would be felt throughout the industry, including by companies both big and small who make games.



“Because of the deep interdependence of video game consoles and game software, and due to the price sensitivity of video game console purchasers, tariffs on video game consoles would not only harm our companies, consumers, and retailers, but will also disproportionately harm the thousands of small and medium-sized software and accessory developers in the United States,” the companies say. “Thus, these tariffs would have a ripple effect of harm that extends throughout the video game ecosystem.”

It’s still not completely clear if and when the new round of tariffs will go into effect. Trade talks between the U.S. and China are currently ongoing, and yesterday Bloomberg reported that the new tariffs could be suspended from going into effect if progress is made at the Group of 20 summit taking place in Osaka, Japan this weekend."
Trump allies pressuring DHS chief to resign,https://www.politico.com,"['Ted Hesson', 'Nancy Cook']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/26/dhs-chief-immigration-1557047,"Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, who took over the post less than three months ago, is under heavy criticism from prominent Trump allies. | Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Photo employment & immigration Trump allies pressuring DHS chief to resign The turmoil mirrors a chaotic situation along the southern border.

Hard-liners inside and outside the Trump administration are pressing for the removal of President Donald Trump’s acting Homeland Security secretary amid a rolling leadership purge that began in April and shows no signs of ending, according to five people in the Trump administration and four former Department of Homeland Security officials.

Kevin McAleenan, who took over the post less than three months ago, is under heavy criticism from prominent Trump allies, including former Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Thomas Homan, who might become the administration’s immigration czar.

Story Continued Below

Following the purge of three other immigration officials since the April resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, McAleenan stands accused of disloyalty to the Trump White House’s hard line on immigration because of a perception that he didn’t support ICE raids targeting migrant families scheduled to begin last weekend.

Acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner John Sanders, a McAleenan ally, said Monday that he’ll resign effective July 5. Sanders did not offer a public explanation for his resignation.

Several critics of the administration, including former DHS officials, have characterized the latest shakeup as another instance of White House senior adviser Stephen Miller seizing an opportunity to fill key immigration posts with allies. But one senior administration official said the president also agrees with these stances.

“The two issues the president is driving the train on at all times are trade and immigration,” the official said. “There is disbelief inside the administration that we can’t enforce the law and people are trying to find the right personnel who will do it and not look for ways out of it.”

Miller and DHS did not respond to requests for comment. The White House press office also did not immediately respond to a request for comment on McAleenan.

The turmoil mirrors a chaotic situation along the southern border, where thousands of migrants are arriving each day and detained children are being denied basic necessities like toothbrushes and soap. Current and former DHS employees complain that the leadership turnover and attendant jostling for power have slowed the government’s ability to respond to what is now widely recognized to be a crisis.

“It’s awful for morale,” said one current CBP official. “Whoever’s going to be confirmed to acting [commissioner] next, we’re back to square one, getting a new person briefed. … It’s like starting all over in a transition.”

Homan suggested on “Fox & Friends” that this week’s planned ICE raids were delayed because McAleenan leaked information about them.

“You’ve got the acting secretary of Homeland Security resisting what ICE is trying to do,” Homan said. “In The Washington Post or in numerous media outlets, he does not support this operation, and I tell you what, if that’s his position, then he’s on the wrong side of this issue. You don’t tell the men and women of ICE, a day before they go out there and do this operation — ‘Look, this story was leaked.’ They gave the locations of the cities, the day it was supposed to start, how many targets.”

Homan spoke while sitting in front of a DHS seal, looking like a government official — something he has not been since June 2018. The seal was in a room set up in the basement of his Virginia home, according to two former DHS officials. Trump told Fox News on June 14 that Homan would be his new “border czar,” but Homan said a day later that the announcement was “kind of premature” and indicated that he hadn’t yet decided whether to take the job. An administration official said Wednesday that Homan has not yet been given a clear description of what the job would entail.

“Homan’s getting paid a lot better as border czar of Fox News than border czar of the White House,” said Ali Noorani, executive director of the pro-migrant National Immigration Forum. “And he kind of has the same job, to go on Fox News and carry the administration’s message.”

Several administration officials and hard-line immigration advocates have targeted McAleenan in recent days, arguing behind the scenes that he’s too liberal to run DHS because he served under President Barack Obama and has donated money in the past to Democratic candidates and organizations. Conservative media outlets, including the Washington Examiner, have run critical stories to amplify that narrative.

Brandon Judd, president of a union that represents Border Patrol agents and a Trump ally, also torched McAleenan in a Fox News op-ed over the weekend.

Judd — who has attacked McAleenan in the past for being insufficiently committed to Trump — said that if McAleenan did leak information about the raids, then he “was inexcusably willing to put the public at risk and law enforcement officers in harm’s way in order to further his own agenda.”

“There is no question that the president is sensitive to the lack of progress in resolving this crisis at the border and frustrated with the pace of changes, and it has become increasingly evident that one of the main reasons for the lack of progress is because Kevin McAleenan has been reluctant to take action that would more effective,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the restrictionist Center for Immigration Studies. “A lot of ideas proposed have been bottled up by him and his front office.”

The Trump White House assumed McAleenan could work with Democrats on Capitol Hill to secure more funding and policy changes, since he’s worked under both Republican and Democratic administrations, Vaughan said. But “he has not been able to deliver on those things.”

Within the past month Trump installed a pair of vocal immigration hard-liners in key immigration positions, naming Mark Morgan acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Ken Cuccinelli acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Both had drawn the president’s attention by making provocative statements about immigration on Fox News; Morgan, for instance, said he could tell whether a migrant child would later join MS-13 merely by looking into that child’s eyes.

Morgan appears already on the move. POLITICO and other outlets reported Tuesday that he’s expected to be named the new acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, although the White House has not made an official announcement.

Cuccinelli, meanwhile, scored a coveted perk during his first month that his predecessor, Francis Cissna, never enjoyed. Trump designated him to be one of 10 officials to get a government-funded car to drive him from his Virginia home to USCIS headquarters.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201906/3778/1155968404_6044370239001_6044253724001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404""

A USCIS spokesperson confirmed that Cuccinelli had been granted the benefit, but said that he “is currently driving himself to the office.”

Both newly installed officials occupy new “principal deputy director” positions created at their respective agencies to allow them to serve in an acting capacity under the 1998 Federal Vacancies Reform Act — a bureaucratic sleight-of-hand that could circumvent the confirmation process.

Cuccinelli, a former Virginia attorney general and head of a conservative political action committee, would face a hard road to confirmation in the Senate because he backed challenges to mainstream Republicans in recent years, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Morgan would at the least face strong Democratic opposition.

“I think the White House is looking for a certain model,” said one current administration official. “Cuccinelli and Morgan have been on Fox every day. I don’t think you’ll ever see Sanders up there.”

The latest personnel shake-up happened just days after the administration caught flak for its treatment of roughly 300 migrant children at a Texas facility who were filthy, hungry, and largely unsupervised, according to lawyers who interviewed some of them.

Several conservative immigration advocates said the DHS shake-up was unrelated to the ensuing public outcry, and instead had been brewing for weeks. Moving Morgan to CBP sets the stage for the administration to now get rid of McAleenan, one advocate said.

“Things have not changed at DHS since Nielsen left,” said a top official at a restrictionist immigration organization. “I disagreed with them getting rid of Francis Cissna but right now, they are looking in the right place.”

But “having all of this churn and not having stable leadership makes it very difficult to address the problems,” said Leon Fresco, former deputy assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's Office of Immigration Litigation. “Whenever you change a leader, you automatically lose a month as the person gets acclimated.”

Top Clean-Air Official Plans To Step Down From EPA Post Amid Ethics Probe,https://www.npr.org,['Vanessa Romo'],06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.npr.org/2019/06/26/736290295/top-clean-air-official-plans-to-step-down-from-epa-post-amid-ethics-probe,"Top Clean-Air Official Plans To Step Down From EPA Post Amid Ethics Probe

Enlarge this image toggle caption Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post/Getty Images Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post/Getty Images

Bill Wehrum is stepping down as the Environmental Protection Agency's chief air quality official at the end of the month, amid mounting scrutiny over possible ethics violations.

EPA Administrator Andrew Andrew Wheeler said Wednesday that Wehrum's departure as the head of the agency's Office of Air and Radiation is both voluntary and expected.

""While I have known of Bill's desire to leave at the end of this month for quite sometime, the date has still come too soon,"" Wheeler said in a statement.

Wehrum was confirmed to the EPA post in November of 2017. Since then, he has been regarded as the architect of some of the Trump administration's most controversial climate policies, overseeing efforts to roll back regulations that limit air pollution. One casualty was the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, which just last week was replaced by the Affordable Clean Energy regulation — new rules that allow more greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.

""I applaud Bill and his team for finalizing the Affordable Clean Energy regulation last week and for the tremendous progress he has made in so many other regulatory initiatives,"" Wheeler said.

Wehrum also crafted a proposal that would weaken future fuel economy standards for cars and trucks.

""Bill Wehrum oversaw the most relentless rollback of clean air, climate and health safeguards in EPA's history,"" said the Natural Resources Defense Council's John Walke, who is the clean air director of the group's climate and clean energy program. He called on the agency to ""return to its mission to protect Americans' health and air quality, and take strong climate action.""

Allegations of ethical violations dogged Wehrum throughout his EPA tenure, related to his former work as a lawyer and lobbyist for a number of the same companies the agency regulates — including some of the country's largest coal, oil and petrochemical companies.

Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee launched a probe into Wehrum's conduct in April, seeking to find out if he or his deputy, fellow former lobbyist David Harlow, may have loosened air pollution rules to help their former clients in the energy sector.

In a letter to eight utility companies and Wehrum's former lobbying firm, House Democrats on the Energy Committee said they were concerned that ""the Office of Air and Radiation's agenda appears remarkably similar to the substantive agenda"" of the firm's utilities clients. They added, ""These allegations have raised substantial questions regarding whether Mr. Wehrum and Mr. Harlow are properly carrying out the [Clean Air Act] as directed by Congress or instead changing agency policies to benefit former clients.""

Wehrum is the latest Trump administration official to leave the environmental agency under a cloud of scrutiny. Former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt who resigned after reports that he misused his power and spent far more taxpayer money than his predecessors had on travel and security expenses.

With Wehrum's exit, his deputy, Anne Idsal, will take over his responsibilities."

""There are no legal moves that are being made here,"" Sekulow said to CNN's Jake Tapper on ""The Lead.""

Sekulow said he expected Mueller's testimony to mirror the special counsel's report, and said it ""certainly would be inappropriate"" if Mueller made any new revelations in his testimony.

Sekulow would not say if the President has read the full report, but said Trump's legal team has ""reviewed it more than once."" He called the report ""convoluted"" and ""very hard to follow.""

The President's lawyers are not actively preparing for an impeachment, Sekulow said.

"In New Turf War, Treasury Dept. Seeks Control of Secret Service",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Alan Rappeport', 'Zolan Kanno-Youngs']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/us/politics/secret-service-treasury.html,"WASHINGTON — Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is seeking to wrest control of the Secret Service from the Department of Homeland Security and has been lobbying President Trump to back such a move, according to administration officials.

The discussions between the Treasury Department, the White House and high-ranking Secret Service officials have taken place over the past year and have intensified in recent months, as Mr. Trump has pressed homeland security officials to focus on stemming immigration and ousted some for failing to do so.

The president supports the idea of moving the Secret Service back to the Treasury Department, where it was housed until 2003, according to people familiar with the discussions. The agency, which had been part of Treasury for more than 100 years, was transferred as part of the Homeland Security Act, which sought to consolidate security agencies after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

Some senior officials at the Department of Homeland Security have been pushing back against the move, concerned about losing an agency that has cybersecurity and investigative components. The department, which oversees the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, is responsible for protecting the country against cyberattacks and ensuring election security, in addition to enforcing immigration law."
Homeland Security chief’s future uncertain after a right-wing media assault,https://qz.com,[],,,,https://qz.com/1652219/dhs-head-mcaleenan-could-be-out-after-a-right-wing-assault/,"After another tumultuous shakeup, all three US agencies responsible for immigration policy are being led by new officials. Now there’s growing concern that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees it all, might soon need to find a new leader too.

US president Donald Trump named Kevin McAleenan, a lawyer and former chief of Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the new head of DHS on April 7. He replaced beleaguered secretary Kirsten Nielsen. Earlier, McAleenan pushed for a wall and oversaw family separation on the southern border. Now he may not last through the month because he’s seen as too liberal, former and current government officials warned this week.

“I don’t see him hanging on the way they have been trashing him,” one former DHS official who had visited the White House this week told Quartz.

The trashing has been public, part of a pattern that’s become familiar in the Trump administration. In recent days, a series of right-wing outlets have run increasingly critical articles about McAleenan. This culminated with Fox & Friends hosts declaring on June 25 that McAleenan “seemed like he was guilty” of leaking information about a planned immigration raid. But the president himself had first tweeted about the raid a week before, and other officials had spoken to reporters about it even earlier in the month.

In sign of how tenuous McAleenan’s job is, he didn’t learn about the latest shake-up within his department—the June 25 resignation of CBP director John Sanders—until he read it in the press, a former DHS official said. McAleenan’s spokesman and the White House declined to comment on the situation. The DHS director remains focused on the job. He met with Congress members yesterday (June 25) and is traveling in Guatemala today.

Ur Jaddou, the director of DHS Watch, an independent watchdog group, and a former lead counsel with US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), said that McAllenan’s future can be summed up by one word: “Chaos.”

“I know it sounds a bit dramatic, but this agency has been through so much leadership change, it’s impossible for the quarter million employees of DHS to know what to do,” she said.

The department employs some 230,000 people and manages CBP, US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Together they are integral to the successful resolution of the current immigration crisis in the US.

US president Donald Trump’s crackdown on immigration comes as a surge of migrants—many of them families seeking asylum— cross the country’s southern border. Detention centers are dangerously overcrowded, and several asylum seekers have died in US custody in recent months. For now, McAleenan remains at the top of the department managing all this (and much more) with a $50 billion annual budget.

Death by right-wing media

In other presidencies, a flurry of critical news articles coming from one extreme end of the US political spectrum wouldn’t be a threat to a top official, especially the head of a crisis-ridden agency crucial to national security like DHS. But in the Trump administration, a right-wing media firestorm—even when based on misleading information and anonymous jabs—is often the precursor to White House personnel and policy changes.

That’s particularly true on immigration. Trump’s anti-immigration advisor Stephen Miller has a history of pushing negative information he thinks could hurt officials he considers enemies to the right-wing press, Quartz reported in April.

Francis Cissna, the Trump-appointed former head of USCIS was the last victim of a media swarm. He left in May, a month after unnamed sources told the Associated Press his job was in jeopardy and that Miller was orchestrating a purge at the Department of Homeland Security.

The next day came a signature Miller move—an article by the right-wing Washington Examiner’s immigration reporter, which relied almost entirely on a single anonymous source. Cissna, the source claimed, was a “deep state” employee obstructing Trump’s immigration vision. “When Kelly left, they never took the bad people with them. Everyone makes bad hiring decisions, [but] you don’t leave them on,” an unnamed former official told the paper.

Cissna’s office had crafted more than a dozen new proposed regulations to lawfully limit visas and restrict who can become US citizens, but clashed with Miller over how fast they could be pushed into law. He resigned on May 24 in a statement that used the words “lawful,” “law,” or “rule of law,” seven times.

One former DHS official briefed on the situation said that neither Trump, nor vice president Michael Pence, nor Trump chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, ever spoke directly to Cissna about performance concerns.

“There were never any calls, no emails, no questions, nothing,” the former official said.

Instead, Cissna was asked to resign by a White House official calling from a plane, as Trump flew to Japan.

From a “leaker” to a liberal

The drumbeats against McAleenan started June 22, when the Washington Examiner accused him of sabotaging a series of planned ICE raids targeting several major US cities. The paper reported that McAleenan leaked information about the plans to the Washington Post, citing a June 21 article in which they were first reported.

Trump himself had tweeted that ICE would soon be rounding up “millions of illegal immigrants” days before:

And early in June Mark Morgan, the new head of ICE, tipped off a small group of reporters to the new strategy, saying ICE would be “going after individuals who have gone through due process, who have received final orders of deportation.”

Politico’s early-morning Playbook reported the upcoming raids before the Washington Post on June 21, citing a former DHS official. Both NBC and CNN published similar articles the same day. Only the Washington Post, long a thorn in Trump’s side, was named by the paper.

In a Fox News op-ed on June 24, Brandon Judd, the president of the National Border Patrol Council, the union for border agents, repeated claims that McAleenan leaked the planned raids to the Washington Post, and piled on the criticism of the department head.

“As it pertains to actual border security, Mr. McAleenan has been an utter failure,” he wrote. “By definition, Kevin McAleenan should be considered anti-Trump.”

That doesn’t reflect his on-the-job performance. McAleenan was one of three DHS officials to recommend the family separation policy that forced thousands of kids to be separated from their parents, the ACLU says, citing an internal memo. He also defended the use of tear gas against protesters on the border. He backed the need for a border wall on Fox News and to Congress in March.

Nonetheless, other outlets, including Conservative Review, got out the knives. Then on June 25 the Washington Examiner took a look at McAleenan’s campaign donation history and found he has contributed to Democrats. For pro-Trump conservative media, that means he’s done.

“For a man who runs an agency tasked with securing our border, he’s donated for years to the one political party that’s made it known that enforcing immigration laws is not a priority: the Democratic Party,” the conservative website Town Hall wrote.

Bill Wehrum is leaving his post as the Environmental Protection Agency's top air policy official. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)

Bill Wehrum spent only a year and a half as the Environmental Protection Agency’s top air official before announcing plans to resign Wednesday amid scrutiny over possible violations of federal ethics rules.

But during that time, Wehrum served as one of the chief architects of the Trump administration’s efforts to shrink the ambition and reach of the EPA, and to retreat from President Obama’s push to slash emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. He oversaw efforts to ease regulation of the coal industry, slow requirements that cars and trucks become more fuel efficient and overhaul how the agency calculates costs and benefits to favor industry.

EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler’s announcement Wednesday did not cite a specific reason for the departure of Wehrum, who as an attorney represented power companies seeking to scale back air pollution rules. But Wehrum has privately expressed concern about how an ongoing House Energy and Commerce Committee probe was affecting his former law firm, Hunton Andrews Kurth, according to individuals familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.

“While I have known of Bill’s desire to leave at the end of this month for quite sometime, the date has still come too soon,” Wheeler said Wednesday, praising Wehrum for “his service, his dedication to his job, the leadership he provided to his staff and the agency, and for his friendship.”

Environmental groups, Democrats on Capitol Hill and other critics were quick to celebrate Wehrum’s departure, calling him an integral part of the “swamp” that President Trump had vowed to drain in Washington.

“William Wehrum was emblematic of the administration’s struggles to remain ethical,"" Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said in a statement. ""While it’s a good thing that Wehrum’s potential ethics problems will no longer affect the agency, the tone is set at the top, and if the EPA is to clean up the mess started by Scott Pruitt, the Trump administration needs to get serious about policing its ethical failures.”

Wehrum, who was confirmed in November 2017, is the latest Trump appointee to depart after coming under investigation for possible misconduct. Four Cabinet members — EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, and Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin — have all left under an ethics cloud, along with other senior staffers such as Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator William “Brock” Long.

Interior’s Office of Inspector General is currently investigating seven current or former top appointees for improperly engaging with their former employers or clients on department-related business, including Secretary David Bernhardt. Bernhardt has denied any wrongdoing, and the other officials have not commented publicly on the allegations.

The Energy and Commerce Committee launched its inquiry of Wehrum after The Washington Post reported in February that questions had been raised about his compliance with the Trump ethics pledge, which requires political appointees to recuse themselves from specific matters involving their former employers and clients for two years. If an appointee does meet with a former client, the pledge dictates that the gathering should be open to all interested parties — a requirement that has been interpreted to mean four other participants who were not clients.

Less than one month after joining the EPA, Wehrum met with two former clients at his old firm without consulting in advance with ethics officials, even though they had cautioned him about such interactions. That same month, Wehrum weighed in on a decision that appeared to benefit a former client, DTE Energy.

Wehrum, who heads the air and radiation office at the EPA, acknowledged both incidents in an interview with The Post but said he had determined that he did not violate federal ethics rules.

“I have, from day one, tried to be absolutely strict and assiduous as to what I do about complying with my ethical obligations,” Wehrum said, “because it doesn’t do me any good, and it doesn’t do the agency any good, to be doing things that people see as unethical.”

Still, the fallout from the disclosure about Wehrum’s ties to his former firm and the utility industry by The Post and other outlets — including Politico, the New York Times and E&E News — has continued to reverberate. The Utility Air Regulatory Group, a collection of power companies that paid Hunton Andrews Kurth millions in membership dues, disbanded earlier this year.

Wehrum has said he represented the group as its own entity, rather than the individual utilities that made up its membership. But investigators on Capitol Hill have explored whether he and his former firm represented the power companies as well, according to one person familiar with the inquiry, raising the prospect that Werhum’s meetings could have violated ethics rules on multiple counts. The individual spoke on condition of anonymity because it is ongoing.

Both Wehrum’s supporters and his critics say that he has accomplished some of industry’s long-sought goals. In doing so, he has rolled back some of President Barack Obama’s most sweeping air policies. Last week the EPA finalized a rule targeting power plants that cuts carbon emissions by less than half of what experts say is needed to avoid catastrophic global warming. He has advanced other controversial proposals as well, including one that would slow efforts to improve gas mileage for cars and light trucks. Another would limit how the EPA calculates public health benefits in proposed regulations, which could make it tougher to limit pollution sources.

“No assistant administrator at EPA had more on their plate than Bill,"" Ross Eisenberg, vice president of energy and resources policy at the National Association of Manufacturers, said in a statement. ""He executed the job with a steady hand and got big things done.”

But what some industry officials saw as Wehrum’s reasonable measures to reduce the regulatory burden on companies, critics describe as undermining the agency’s mission to protect public health and the environment.

“It is, at the very least, going to take years to undo the damage that has been done,” said John Coequyt, global climate policy director for the Sierra Club.

In a phone interview, Coequyt said that as Wehrum returns to the private sector, corporate clients could face blowback for enlisting Wehrum’s help. “We believe he’s toxic to their interests, and anyone who hires him will be publicly criticized for doing so.""

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), who joined other Democrats in February in asking EPA’s inspector general to investigate Wehrum, predicted that he would end up representing one of the companies that has sought regulatory relief from Trump’s EPA.

“I can’t wait to see where Bill Wehrum lands once he’s out the door,” Whitehouse said in a statement. “What do you bet it’s with one of the fossil fuel interests he has served so well as air chief, delivering one big handout after another?”"
This new ruling from the Supreme Court protecting vulgar patents is a win for free speech,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/the-supreme-courts-new-ruling-protecting-vulgar-patents-is-a-win-for-free-speech,"The Supreme Court’s June 24 decision Iancu v. Brunetti centers around a case that’s hard to describe, but not due to its legal complexity. Instead, this litigation is difficult to discuss because it involves language we usually try to avoid in polite company. The petitioner was Erik Brunetti, the founder of a clothing line. He named his brand using a combination of letters that, when read together, sound just like the past tense of the F-word.

Brunetti sought trademark protection for his company name with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, but it denied the patent. It did so under a provision of the Lanham Act that stipulates no trademarks shall be granted that contain “immoral” or “scandalous” matter.

In Iancu, the Supreme Court decided that this part of the Lanham Act violated the First Amendment’s protections for free speech. As far as content is concerned, the majority opinion said the First Amendment barred any governmental restrictions, declaring that “government may not discriminate against speech based on the ideas or opinions it conveys.”

The part of the Lanham Act in question, the court concluded, did just so. Justice Elena Kagan noted a number of examples of decisions to grant and deny trademarks that appeared content-based. For instance, accepted trademarks often involved statements opposing drugs, but many rejected applications explicitly or implicitly approved of their use. Kagan argued that the difference here boiled down to agency approval or disapproval of certain drugs. Doing so “distinguishes between two opposed sets of ideas: those aligned with conventional moral standards and those hostile to them.” This constituted an unconstitutional form of viewpoint discrimination, the court decided.

This point makes sense if we keep in mind Justice Samuel Alito’s warning in his concurring opinion. He argued that “our decision is not based on moral relativism but on the recognition that a law banning speech deemed by government officials to be ‘immoral’ or ‘scandalous’ can easily be exploited for illegitimate ends.” Alito is exactly right.

To distinguish between free speech and moral relativism, we must understand the role speech plays in our lives. Aristotle described the capacity for speech as the defining quality of humanity. Speech, which he described as the use of reason in communication, comprised the means by which we discuss and decide questions of justice and the common good. To deny the role of speech in these questions denied our humanity, leaving coercion and violence as the sole remaining means of decision-making.

Moreover, speech played an even greater role under representative government. We live in a political community where legitimate rule stems from the consent of the governed. But how do the people form and express our opinions? Ultimately by voting. Yet voting is only the end point of a process of deliberation about what is best for society, and speech is essential to that process and thus to legitimate governance itself. Alito’s concurring opinion echoed these points, asserting that “[v]iewpoint discrimination is poison to a free society.”

At the same time, the court left open the possibility that government could place some restrictions on how a person can communicate ideas.

Our laws can recognize and enforce basic rules of civility and decorum. Far from violating free speech, such rules respect and enhance it, for speech itself assumes a respect between the speaker and the audience. It assumes, finally, that we should govern where possible by persuasion, not violence.

Furthermore, Alito’s concurring opinion added another category for restriction — when words fail to communicate any idea at all. Alito noted that Brunetti’s word choice “as commonly used today, generally signifies nothing except emotion and a severely limited vocabulary.” This point, too, kept the First Amendment in line with its fundamental purpose of protecting the free expression of ideas for the purpose of peaceful self-government. If words or actions possessed no articulation of ideas, then they do not fall under the First Amendment.

Alito’s opinion thus noted that declaring the Lanham Act void did not necessarily vindicate the trademark sought in this case. A more narrow law could potentially deny the trademark in question as “not needed to express any idea” and remain constitutional. It could recognize that, far from a benefit to social discourse, “[t]he registration of such marks serves only to further coarsen our popular culture.” The laws could both protect free speech and a moral order.

Thus, the Iancu decision marked a victory for truly free speech. It rightly protected the robust exchange of ideas necessary to our humanity and to free government. But it left more to be done to cultivate the best, moral conditions for such exchanges, conditions grounded in civility and decorum. However, the court rightly left that vindication where it belongs — in the halls of Congress.

Attorney General William Barr wows Justice Dept crowd with bagpipe playing,https://www.cbsnews.com,"['Emily Tillett', 'Emily Tillett Is A Politics Reporter', 'Video Editor For Cbs News Digital']",,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stoic-attorney-general-william-barr-wows-doj-crowd-with-bagpipe-playing/,"Attorney General William Barr took a break from his day job to showcase one of his hidden talents during an event with U.S. attorneys. Seated on stage Wednesday during the Justice Department event, the nation's top law enforcement official disappeared behind a curtain as a group of Pipes and Drums bagpipers from the New York Police Department, the Emerald Society, assembled in front of the auditorium stage.

Barr re-emerged onstage and tucked a bagpipe under his arm as the crowd of government attorneys laughed and applauded. A low drum beat sounded and the traditional bagpipe march ""Scotland the Brave"" began with Barr joining in. The crowd gave him a standing ovation at the end of the performance.

Barr explained that this was the first time he had played since his daughter's wedding. He found out that the Emerald Society pipers were coming as a surprise for him -- so he thought he would surprise them by bringing his bagpipes.

The attorney general's bagpipe playing is far from just a hobby. According to Pipes and Drums Magazine, Barr takes the bagpipe very seriously -- he's been playing since before his legal career began. Barr was a member of the now defunct U.S.-based Grade 2 Denny & Dunipace Pipe Band – which later evolved into the Scottish & Irish Imports and City of Washington – from the early-1980s until the early-1990s. Barr played with the band in a number of competitions, including the World Championships.

Soon afterward, Barr joined the Bush administration to serve his first stint as attorney general, effectively putting his competitive piping career on hold.

Barr later went on to serve as a board member of the U.S. Piping Foundation, an organization that supports competitions for bagpipers, from January 2017 to December 2018.

EPA will resume work on Pebble,https://mustreadalaska.com,"['Author', 'Suzanne Downing', 'Mine Pebble']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://mustreadalaska.com/epa-will-resume-work-on-pebble/,"The Environmental Protection Agency is resuming work to lift water pollution restrictions that it put on the Pebble Project during the Obama Administration, Must Read Alaska has learned.

News of the announcement also leaked out of the EPA to Bloomberg News this morning, causing the stock of Northern Dynasty, the parent company of the Pebble Partnership, to jump by 28 percent in morning trading.

The move opens up the real possibility of a partner coming into the project, which has been in the EPA limbo file since 2014, when former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy put a pre-emptive ban on Pebble’s ability to file for a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permit.

In 2017, then-EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said he would life the ban on the Pebble permit process. But then he reinstated it a few months later.

Today, the agency is again proceeding on lifting those restrictions. This comes just days before the end of the public comment period on the draft environmental impact statement.

An announcement regarding Pebble is expected at today’s meeting of the Resource Development Council, which has its annual membership luncheon in Anchorage. One of the speakers is Joe Balash, Assistant Secretary of the Department of the Interior.

It also comes on the day that President Trump is expected to touch down in Anchorage at Joint Base Elmendorf Richardson, and meet with Gov. Michael Dunleavy, on Trump’s way to Japan.

Trump's protocol chief suspended amid investigation,https://www.channel3000.com,['Michelle Kosinski'],06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.channel3000.com/news/politics/national-politics/trumps-protocol-chief-suspended-amid-investigation/1089454626,"CNN

Washington, D.C. - President Donald Trump's protocol chief, Sean Lawler, has been suspended indefinitely just ahead of the G-20 meeting in Japan pending the outcome of a State Department investigation into his conduct, according to multiple State Department officials with direct knowledge of the matter.

Two State officials told CNN that Lawler was called into the office of the deputy secretary on Monday afternoon and told he needed to leave due to the status of the investigation.

On the same afternoon, senior staff in the protocol office met with State Department management and were told that Lawler had to leave over personnel issues, according to the officials.

They were also told in this meeting that their new acting chief of protocol is Mary-Kate Fisher, and her acting deputy is Cathy Fenton, who served as social secretary in the George W. Bush White House and also handled social affairs‎ for Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush. State Department sources said both are highly respected.

One of the State Department officials described what multiple others told CNN was a pattern of behavior on Lawler's part. ""In my decade of government service, I have never seen someone so unprofessional, abrasive and rude as him,"" the official said. ""His bad behavior was terrible, and it was obvious. I personally saw it myself, as did a good chunk of the office.

""For example, in a recent meeting -- a very routine planning meeting -- when he asked a question, if he didn't like the answer, he would immediately raise his voice, get angry, start using profanity, and use the 'F word.'

""Then, a moment later, like the flip of a switch, he'd calm himself down and it would be like nothing happened. This has happened before. Many times. And everyone would talk about it after. Their reaction was, 'What the hell just happened? Did he just start screaming at someone younger, or a woman, or an African American, in an extremely derogatory, condescending fashion? Did he just use the 'F word' several times? Did that really just happen?'""

Bloomberg was first to report that Lawler's conduct was being investigated.

""A large chunk of the protocol office was aware of this behavior for a long time. They're surprised, to be honest, that this hadn't been dealt with sooner,"" according to the State Department official. ""It's stressful enough, just trying to get work product done.""

""His behavior made itself clear not just around the office—but on trips with the President, in bilats, and engagements with the White House,"" the official added.

Lawler has been in office more than 18 months. He did not respond to multiple requests by CNN for comment.

Neither the White House nor the State Department has officially commented."
"Border official resigns amid uproar over migrant children - WBNS-10TV Columbus, Ohio | Columbus News, Weather & Sports",https://www.10tv.com,[],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.10tv.com/article/border-official-resigns-amid-uproar-over-migrant-children-2019-jun,"HOUSTON (AP) — The acting head of U.S. Customs and Border Protection resigned Tuesday amid an uproar over the discovery of migrant children being held in pitiful conditions at one of the agency's stations in Texas.

Acting Commissioner John Sanders' departure deepened the sense of crisis and added to the rapid turnover inside the agencies responsible for enforcing President Donald Trump's hardline immigration priorities as the U.S. deals with record numbers of migrant families coming across the border.

In a message to employees, Sanders said he would step down on July 5. He did not give a reason for leaving.

Advertisement - Story continues below

""Although I will leave it to you to determine whether I was successful, I can unequivocally say that helping support the amazing men and women of CBP has been the most fulfilling and satisfying opportunity of my career,"" he said.

Hours after Sanders' departure became public, two officials told The Associated Press that he was being replaced by Mark Morgan, who was named acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement just last month. The officials were not authorized to speak publicly about the move and declined to be identified.

In an interview last week, Sanders blamed the problems in detention on a lack of money. He called on Congress to pass a $4.5 billion emergency funding bill to address the crisis — legislation the House was planning to take up Tuesday.

At the White House, Trump said that he did not ask for Sanders' resignation — adding that he doesn't think he has ever spoken to the man — but that he is ""moving some people around into different locations"" amid the crisis.

While activists welcomed Sanders' departure, Trump defended U.S. border authorities, saying, ""The laws are so bad and the asylum rules and laws are so bad that our Border Patrol people, who are so incredible, aren't allowed to do their jobs.""

The unprecedented surge of migrant families has left U.S. immigration detention centers severely overcrowded and taxed the government's ability to provide medical care and other attention. Six children have died since September after being detained by border agents.

After he was picked to lead ICE, Morgan, the new acting director, showed a willingness to deport families during enforcement sweeps. However, past Trump immigration officials hesitated over concerns about logistics and the public's reaction.

The Trump administration has faced a barrage of criticism in recent days over conditions inside the Border Patrol facility in Clint, Texas, first reported by The Associated Press: inadequate food, lack of medical care, no soap, and older children trying to care for toddlers.

In one case reported in Clint, attorneys said a 2-year-old boy without a diaper was being watched by older children. Several youngsters had the flu. Many were separated from extended family members like aunts and uncles who brought them to the border; others were teenage mothers with babies.

As word of the children's plight got out, people moved by their stories started showing up the station's doors to donate boxes of diapers and even a Cookie Monster stuffed toy. They were not allowed in the building. Customs and Border Protection says it has enough supplies, but was checking with lawyers to see if it could accept donated items.

An official from Customs and Border Protection said Tuesday that the majority of the roughly 300 children detained at Clint last week had been moved to facilities operated by the Office of Refugee Resettlement. The official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity, wouldn't say exactly how many.

But around the same time Sanders announced his resignation, his agency said officials had moved more than 100 children back to the station.

The human costs of the migrant surge were driven home this week by a searing photo of the bodies of a Salvadoran man and his nearly 2-year-old daughter, face down in shallow water along the Mexican side of the Rio Grande. On Sunday, two babies, a toddler and a woman were found dead on the Texas side, overcome by the sweltering heat.

Trump said he is ""very concerned"" about conditions at the border but claimed without evidence that things are ""much better than they were under President Obama, by far"" and in ""much better shape than it ever was"" — an assertion immigration activists said is simply not true.

""We did not have the kind of overcrowded conditions for unaccompanied kids in Border Patrol holding cells like we saw in Clint,"" said Michael Bochenek, a lawyer from Human Rights Watch.

Previously CBP's chief operating officer, Sanders was named acting commissioner in April after the agency's previous leader, Kevin McAleenan, became acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Other key DHS agencies also have interim or acting directors, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

Morgan, who also served as chief of the Border Patrol, a subsidiary of CBP, under President Barack Obama, is now expected to be replaced as ICE's acting leader by Matthew Albence. Albence served as acting director earlier this year after the departure of another former leader, Ronald Vitiello.

ICE on Saturday delayed an operation to sweep U.S. cities and arrest hundreds of people accused of flouting orders to leave the country, days after Trump tweeted about the upcoming crackdown. Former ICE acting director Thomas Homan, a Trump administration ally, then went on television to accuse McAleenan of leaking information about the operation because he opposed it.

CBP is the agency that apprehends and first detains migrant parents and children crossing the Mexican border.

CBP's facilities at the border were almost all built when most people crossing into the U.S. illegally were single adults. Now, the agency is apprehending tens of thousands of parents and children weekly. It recorded 84,500 apprehensions of adults and children traveling together in May.

In the wake of Sanders' resignation, Democratic Rep. Bennie G. Thompson of Mississippi, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, lashed out at the administration's immigration policies and ""bad actors in the White House.""

""There is simply no excuse for the horrific conditions children and families are being held in at the border,"" he said.

Jennifer Quigley, director of refugee advocacy for Human Rights First, called on Congress to hold hearings on the youngsters' treatment.

""Trump administration officials need to be held accountable for the disgraceful response to the situation at the border,"" she said in a statement. ""This is only the tip of the iceberg. We need a full accounting of how children came to be caged in filthy and unsafe conditions."""
Justice Department sues Omarosa for not submitting financial forms,https://nypost.com,['June'],06-26-2019,2019,6,https://nypost.com/2019/06/26/justice-department-sues-omarosa-for-not-submitting-financial-forms/,"The Justice Department has filed a lawsuit against former White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newman for allegedly failing to file a required financial disclosure report after her 2017 firing.

The civil complaint alleges that the former “Apprentice” star “knowingly and willfully” failed to “file the required public financial disclosure report after her employment terminated with the Executive Office of the President.”

The suit claims that Manigault Newman was given a “post-government employment briefing” in December 2017, after her firing, in which “she was advised of her obligation … to file a termination financial disclosure report” within 30 days as part of the Ethics in Government Act.

Manigault Newman, who served as director of communications for the office of public liaison during her government tenure, allegedly ignored multiple email requests from the Justice Department, as well as the White House Counsel’s Office, reminding her to complete and return the requested documents.

A White House attorney had emailed the controversial reality star after the 30-day deadline had passed to warn that she might face a $200 late filing fee, but she continued to not respond to repeated efforts to get in touch with her.

The offense is punishable by a fine of $50,000, which the government is requesting the ex-White House staffer be charged.

The former Trump ally saw her relationship with the president go up in flames after she was fired by John Kelly and began releasing tapes of encounters she had with other Trump officials.

After her ouster, media reports began circulating that Manigault Newman had been physically dragged out of the White House after her contentious termination.

She denies those allegations, but that didn’t keep her from becoming a Trump target on social media.

In a statement, Manigault Newman’s lawyer John Phillips told The Post: “The White House chooses to abuse process and use the Department of Justice to carry out retaliation. The lawsuit alleges that Omarosa Manigault Newman ‘knowingly and willfully’ failed to file a report. This is untrue.”"
Veterans Affairs whistleblowers call for end to culture of retaliation,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/veterans-affairs-whistleblower-notified-termination-day-congressional-testimony/story?id=63922369,"A Department of Veterans Affairs health care worker said she received a letter from the agency on Monday notifying her that she would be terminated, just one day before she was scheduled to testify at a congressional hearing about how the VA treats other whistleblowers.

Baltimore psychologist Minu Aghevli said she received the letter, which outlined the VA Maryland Health Care Center's proposal to terminate her employment, after working for the agency for nearly 20 years and raising concerns for years about the quality of patient care and manipulating wait lists in opioid treatment programs. In an earlier letter, the VA says she was facing disciplinary action for treating a patient at a non-VA hospital and violating the agency's code of conduct, but she and her lawyer argue the agency is retaliating against her for raising concerns about problems within the department.

The agency denies that the notice was related to her testimony.

The VA has faced dozens of complaints from whistleblowers who say they were retaliated against for raising concerns about the quality of medical care for veterans or actions by agency officials, according to the agency that handles whistleblower complaints from federal employees. Aghevli and two other whistleblowers from the agency testified in front of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee on Tuesday saying the agency has a culture of trying to silence or punish people who report problems.

C-SPAN

Aghevli called the termination proposal scary, because she said it appears to be a warning shot to ward off other potential whistleblowers.

""This feels obviously retaliatory, but worse than that I feel like I'm being used as a threat against other employees who might think about speaking up about patient care concerns and I resent that. I do not want to be used as a pawn,"" she testified on Tuesday.

Aghevli first reported concerns over hospital waitlists in 2014, just as a national scandal erupted over wait times, amid allegations patients had died waiting for care at a VA facility in Phoenix.

""In order to reduce the waitlist, I was instructed to improperly remove veterans from the electronic waitlist by scheduling fake appointments for them in an imaginary clinic,"" Aghevli said in remarks she prepared to share with Congress on Tuesday. ""This clinic was not tied to any provider or location, nor did it actually correspond to any real visits...The veterans scheduled for these fictitious appointments were not actually receiving VA care.

""The VA also pressured me to artificially reduce the number of patients on the waitlist through other improper means,"" she added.

The VA's internal watchdog has investigated concerns about wait lists in opioid treatment facilities in Maryland, though it does not specify if it was prompted by Aghevli's complaint. The inspector general's inquiry published in 2018 confirmed that the VA's opioid program transferred veterans waiting for treatment to another list where they essentially wouldn't be counted. In an earlier report, the agency said they would improve internal controls by 2017 to ensure that all patients receive treatment.

Aghevli said the VA has ""engaged in continuous retaliation"" against her in an apparent effort to oust her from the agency ever since she first reported her concerns, including being stripped of patient-care privileges and assigned to do ""menial administrative tasks.""

""Two months ago, I was told that my clinical privileges are being suspended. So since that time I have been forbidden from having any clinical contact with patients and I was assigned to pretty menial administrative tasks,"" she said. ""It felt like I was put in a position where I would be especially visible to other staff to make it sort of a publicly humiliating situation.""

A letter from her legal team to the Office of Special Counsel -- which aims to safeguard federal employees, especially whistleblowers -- says Aghevli received the ""notice of proposed removal"" on June 24.

""The notice of proposed removal was issued immediately after the Agency learned that Dr. Aghevli's disclosures would be the subject of a front-page story in USA Today and that she would be testifying before Congress,"" her legal team wrote in the letter to OSC.

""The reasons set forth by the Agency for proposing Dr. Aghevli's removal are without merit and cannot be the actual reasons for proposing her removal.""

Aghevli did not send ABC News a copy of the letter because she said wanted to send her official response first.

Aghevli, who served as the former coordinator of the department's opioid addiction treatment program in Baltimore, said hospital officials cited in the letter an ongoing matter with a patient's follow-up care and gave her several business days to respond. In her testimony on Tuesday, she said her privileges were suspended in April because she visited a high-risk patient in a local hospital after he overdosed, and that the patient disclosed he attempted suicide after leaving the VA facility.

Aghevli declined to offer specific details about the April incident, citing potential patient privacy concerns, but she said it involved a ""high risk veteran"" who had visited the hospital’s emergency room in the past.

""So basically, what they say is I shouldn't have followed up with this high risk veteran in a community hospital, despite everything the VA says about following up with high risk veterans,"" she said. ""The VA says that we should engage them, keep them involved in care and provide proper mental health treatment.""

In a statement, the VA Maryland Health Care System said the notice of proposed termination was not related to her scheduled testimony on Tuesday.

""Dr. Aghevli will have an opportunity to respond to the proposed action, and a regional VA leader will decide whether to uphold it or mitigate it after ensuring all procedural protections in the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act have been met,"" it said in a statement, adding ""identifying as a whistleblower doesn’t shield someone from accountability when they have failed to uphold VA’s values and committed clear instances of misconduct.""

Another VA whistleblower who testified Tuesday, Katherine Mitchell a physician and consultant for the VA in Arizona, said she has faced continued retaliation even after the concerns she raised were addressed. She was one of the first people to raise concerns in 2014 about officials manipulating wait lists and jeopardizing care for veterans in Arizona.

She said she's seen a lot of improvement in patient care at the VA but that there's still a culture where some agency leaders make it difficult for people concerned about behavior that could be dangerous for patients to come forward.

Mnuchin: 'We were about 90% of the way' on China trade deal and there's a 'path to complete this',https://www.cnbc.com,['Holly Ellyatt'],06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/26/mnuchin-says-us-china-trade-deal-was-90-percent-complete.html,"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC on Wednesday the U.S. and China were close to a trade deal, and he's optimistic that progress can be made during weekend talks between President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping. ""We were about 90% of the way there [with a deal] and I think there's a path to complete this,"" he told CNBC's Hadley Gamble in Manama, Bahrain. He said he's confident Trump and the Chinese president can make progress in stalled trade talks at the Group of 20 meeting. ""The message we want to hear is that they want to come back to the table and continue because I think there is a good outcome for their economy and the U.S. economy to get balanced trade and to continue to build on this relationship."" He did not provide any detail on what the final 10% of an agreement might entail, or what the sticking points are to completing a deal.

Trump is meeting his Chinese counterpart on Saturday at the G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan. The outcome of the meeting could be pivotal for the global economy and financial markets, which has been rattled by 18 months of trade tensions between the economic giants and an escalation of tariffs on each other's imports. Officials have yet to negotiate a breakthrough, but there are hopes that a meeting between the two presidents could help the discussions. A Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey of investors found that about two-thirds expect no deal this weekend, but there would be no new tariffs either. ""I'm hopeful that we can move forward with a plan,"" Mnuchin told CNBC. ""President Trump and President Xi have a very close working relationship. We had a productive meeting at the last G-20."" At their meeting in December at the G-20 in Buenos Aires, Trump and Xi reached a truce in the trade war, but talks in May broke down, and the countries added additional tariffs. Mnuchin said he was hopeful a deal could be struck by the end of the year but said ""there needs to be the right efforts in place."" Dow futures jumped after Mnuchin's comments and signaled a higher open for Wall Street Wednesday.

Slowing growth

Talks between the U.S. and China broke down in May because China reportedly did not want to commit to changes in its laws to help allay U.S. concerns about intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers and currency manipulation. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has previously played down hopes for a Trump-Xi breakthrough this weekend, saying in mid-June that ""the most that will come out of the G-20 might be an agreement to actively resume talks."" The trade war has impacted the Chinese and U.S. economies, despite both presidents insisting otherwise. In April, the International Monetary Fund lowered its global growth forecast for 2019 to 3.3%, down from an earlier forecast of 3.5%, citing ongoing global trade tensions as the rationale for the downgrade."
FedEx sues the US government over Huawei ban confusion,https://www.theinquirer.net,[],06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3077964/fedex-sues-us-gov-over-huawei-ban-confusion,"FedEx is lining up to take on the US government

PARCEL FLINGER FedEx has launched a lawsuit against the US government arguing that it isn't its place to screen packages for products banned under export rules.

The suit was filed in the aftermath of an incident which saw a number of packages containing Huawei devices 'mishandled' by the company, with one unit actually refused for delivery.

FedEx has argued that its 'common carrier rights' have been breached by being forced to assume liability for handling packages covered by laws such as the recent White House Executive Order which effectively bans Huawei from the US.

In a message to the Department of Commerce, FedEx argued that ""the increasing use of restrictions on exports and imports by the Commerce Department in various geopolitical and trade disputes creates just an impossible burden on FedEx and common carriers.""

In one specific incident, a UK tech journalist sent a Huawei handset to colleagues in the US via FedEx, only to have it returned due to ""a government issue"". FedEx later admitted it had made an error by refusing.

Meanwhile, Bejing authorities also began investigating FedEx after two packages bound for China were diverted to the US.

In a statement, the company said: ""FedEx is a transportation company, not a law enforcement agency,"" whilst the lawsuit argues that the rules ""essentially deputize FedEx to police the contents of the millions of packages it ships daily even though doing so is a virtually impossible task, logistically, economically, and in many cases, legally,"".

A US government spokesman said: ""We have not yet reviewed the complaint, but nevertheless look forward to defending Commerce's role in protecting US national security,"".

FedEx has said that Huawei is just one significant example of a wider issue for carriers in the 21st century. It also demonstrates just how unclear the rules over Huawei's US ban actually are, and they don't seem to be getting much clearer. μ"
"Trump DHS Secretary McAleenan gave to solely Democrats for years, FEC filings show",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,['Screenshot Via Federal Election Commission'],06-24-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-dhs-secretary-mcaleenan-gave-to-solely-democrats-for-years-fec-filings-show,"Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, who was accused of sabotaging the Trump administration's deportation operation because of a personal opposition to the plan, has given for years solely to Democratic causes, according to federal records.

Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council, wrote in an op-ed Monday that the secretary and his wife's donations only to Democratic politicians and organizations over the past 12 years could explain why McAleenan allegedly leaked a nationwide Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid to the media last week, forcing the administration to cancel the extensive undertaking after months of planning.

""He has proven his political leanings in his actions, including his campaign contributions,"" Judd wrote in a Fox News op-ed. ""By definition, Kevin McAleenan should be considered anti-Trump.""

McAleenan had no giving history until the 2008 presidential election, Federal Election Commission data shows. He made 11 contributions from $100 to $600 totaling $3,000 to then-Sen. Barack Obama between November 2007 and November 2008. One $100 donation was rescinded.

The Trump-appointed Cabinet member gave $67.10 to the DNC Services Corporation/Democratic National Committee in October 2008, then $3,300 to the same entity in November. Two weeks later, that large donation was rescinded, according to Federal Election Commission records.

At the time of the 2007-2009 donations, McAleenan was working for the Department of Homeland Security as U.S. Customs and Border Protection's area port director at Los Angeles International Airport, his LinkedIn page shows.

In February 2008, he left the public sector and joined the Sentinel HS Group.

McAleenan gave again in late 2008 and early 2009, a total of $300 in two donations to Justin Oberman, a founding member of the Transportation Security Administration who ran as a Democrat to fill the vacant Illinois House seat left behind by Obama's newly installed White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel.

McAleenan rejoined Customs and Border Protection in 2010 as deputy assistant commissioner of field operations. He was promoted in 2012 to assistant commissioner.

Federal Election Commission data shows Corina Avalos McAleenan, whom the acting secretary married in 2002, gave a total $888 in two $444 donations to Obama for America and Obama Victory Fund 2012. The assistant commissioner did not give to any person or group that cycle.

Kevin McAleenan also made six contributions between 2009 and 2014 totaling $182.50 to ActBlue, a nonprofit organization that fundraises for Democratic candidates and organizations.

During the 2016 presidential election, the then-deputy commissioner of Customs and Border Protection did not pledge money to any political candidate, but his wife made three donations totaling $505 to Hillary for America in July 2016, shortly after Clinton had clinched the party's nomination and Donald Trump had won the Republican nomination.

McAleenan was tapped by Trump in January 2017 to serve as acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner. He was confirmed by the Senate the following spring.

Judd said the commissioner's job performance should serve as additional evidence of how his political ideology has affected results, most notably the continued surge of people illegally crossing into the U.S., including asylum-seekers.

""Mr. McAleenan’s bio and job performance fill in the rest of the gaps,"" Judd wrote. ""His actions in office have been detrimental to both border security and President Trump’s expressed mandate to end illegal immigration and the catch-and-release program. And while these two issues alone are enough to warrant a vote of no confidence from his subordinates, it was his willingness to put his own agenda above the safety and security of the general public and law enforcement personnel that made it a slam dunk."""
U.S. sues ex-Trump aide Omarosa,https://www.aol.com,"['Aol Staff', 'Jonathan Stempel']",06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.aol.com/article/news/2019/06/25/us-sues-ex-trump-aide-omarosa/23756471/,"June 25 (Reuters) - The United States on Tuesday sued Omarosa Manigault Newman, the former aide to President Donald Trump and reality television star, saying she knowingly failed to file a required public financial disclosure report after she left the White House.

The government is seeking a civil fine of up to $50,000 from Omarosa, who spent 11 months as director of communications in the White House Office of Public Liaison before her December 2017 dismissal.

According to the complaint, Omarosa violated the Ethics in Government Act by failing to file the report, which was required because her salary was above a $124,406 cutoff, despite several oral and written reminders from White House ethics lawyers.

Representatives for Omarosa, as she is typically known, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A lawyer who has represented her in other matters did not immediately respond to similar requests.

Omarosa initially shot to fame as a contestant in the first season of Trump's reality TV show ""The Apprentice"" in 2004, and became one of Trump's most visible African-American supporters during his successful 2016 presidential bid.

But she had what appeared to be an ambiguous role at the White House, where the New York Times said she was a difficult colleague and had been on former chief of staff John Kelly's ""no fly list"" of aides he deemed unfit to attend serious meetings.

After leaving the White House, she appeared on the CBS reality show ""Big Brother,"" drawing attention for condemning Trump and his administration.

Omarosa also published a memoir, ""Unhinged: An Insider's Account of the Trump White House,"" last August.

According to the complaint filed with the federal court in Washington, D.C., Omarosa's financial disclosure report had been due by Jan. 18, 2018, one month after she left the White House.

The complaint said the White House later referred the matter to the Department of Justice, and the lawsuit was authorized on March 17, 2019, nearly a year after Omarosa had twice acknowledged receiving reminders to file the report.

The Treasury Department will conduct an investigation into the circumstances leading to a delay in the production of a new $20 bill featuring a portrait of slave-turned-slave-emancipator Harriet Tubman.

In a letter to Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., released Monday, acting Inspector General Rich Delmar explained the inquiry will be folded into a larger examination of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing's project management processes for new note design that was already in the works.

""As part of this work, we will interview the stakeholders involved in the new note design process,"" Delmar wrote.

In 2016, the Treasury Department announced it would replace former President Andrew Jackson's face with that of the famed abolitionist by 2020. As NPR reported, the update would have made Tubman the first woman since Martha Washington to appear on an American currency note and the first African American. But last month, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced the redesign will be delayed until 2028.

Schumer called on the department to launch an investigation last week, specifically asking for a review of ""the involvement of other participants in the interagency process related to the redesign — including the Secret Service, Federal Reserve, and the White House — to ensure that political considerations have not been allowed to infect the process for designing American currency.""

Delmar noted the review will seek interviews with officials, including senior executives from Treasury, BEP, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), United States Secret Service and the Board's Currency Technology Office.

He added it will take approximately 10 months.

""If, in the course of our audit work, we discover indications of the employee misconduct or other matters that warrant a referral to our Office of Investigations, we will do so expeditiously,"" Delmar said.

Before he was elected, President Trump was critical of a redesign that would eliminate Jackson's image, saying the move was motivated by ""pure political correctness.""

Jackson ""represented somebody that really was very important to this country,"" Trump said in a Today show interview. He suggested it would be ""more appropriate"" to put Tubman's image on a note of different denomination."
New EPA rule could expand number of Trump officials weighing in on FOIA requests,https://thehill.com,[],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/450169-new-epa-rule-would-allow-more-administration-officials-to-weigh-in-on-foia-requests,"More political appointees at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) could soon have the authority to weigh in on public information requests.

The rule is expected to be published in the Federal Register as early as Wednesday and will not allow for a public comment period.

ADVERTISEMENT

According to the new language in the FOIA rule signed by EPA chief Andrew Wheeler last week, the administrator and other officials would be allowed to review all materials that fit a FOIA request criteria, known as responsive documents, and then decide “whether to release or withhold a record or a portion of a record on the basis of responsiveness or under one or more exemptions under the FOIA, and to issue ‘no records’ responses.”

Lawyers outside the agency who specialize in FOIA requests say the “no records” response could lead to a situation where records seekers are being told there are no documents meeting their search criteria, even if they were found by EPA staffers who handle FOIA requests, with those documents ultimately withheld by political appointees.

“It’s allowing political appointees to make the decision that records someone has presumably identified as being responsive are not actually responsive. That theoretically would allow sensitive documents, that the agency doesn't want to send you, to withhold those records -- and that should shake out eventually in a lawsuit if that's what's happening,” said Matt Topic, government transparency and First Amendment lawyer at Loevy & Loevy, a Chicago-based firm that specializes in civil rights.

EPA strongly disputed that interpretation, saying the new rule does not grant appointees the ability to label responsive documents as non-responsive.

“The new regulation does not grant any additional authorities to 'reject' FOIA requests by claiming 'no records.' A response that yields 'no records' is simply a request in which a search has been conducted and no responsive records are found, it is a frequent determination that has existed since the passage of the FOIA, and has been available to any official authorized to issue FOIA determinations. This new regulation brings EPA into compliance with the law, which the Obama administration ignored,” said Michael Abboud, EPA spokesman.

Topic, who reviewed the text of the rule, said it’s common for FOIA officers at government agencies to initially find responsive documents to requests that other officials later dispute in terms of qualifying for public release.

He said the new language in the EPA rule suggests officials may have the opportunity to prevent release of the documents on the basis that they don’t meet the criteria, and are therefore non-responsive.

“You could have a situation where there is a pile of documents that the FOIA officer thinks is responsive and have a political appointee overrule them and say, 'I don’t think those documents are responsive because that’s not exactly what that person was looking for,’” he said. “There's a lot of opportunity to screw around with that.""

EPA officials who would be authorized to make that decision include the administrator, deputy administrators, assistant administrators, deputy assistant administrators, regional administrators, deputy regional administrators, general counsel, deputy general counsels, regional counsels, deputy regional counsels and the inspector general or delegates of those individuals, according to the final rule.

The latest version differs from the previous rule, which granted the same rights to the “head of an office, or that individual's designee.”

A blanket explanation for non-responsive materials could make it harder for groups or individuals to legally challenge any of EPA’s decisions to withhold documents, because it will be more difficult to prove why they were withheld. A person appealing their FOIA response would not know if any documents were withheld under a “no records” response.

“It’s exceptionally difficult to litigate on the ‘basis of responsiveness.’ There is no record,” said Kevin Bell, staff counsel at Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility. “FOIA litigation is always pretty one-sided, there is no discovery … now they are just saying, ‘Oh, it’s not responsive. Oh, we don’t have to tell you.’”

Bell equated EPA’s new FOIA rule to a similar regulatory action unveiled earlier this year at the Interior Department, called an “awareness review,” which allows political appointees 72 hours to review documents that mention them by name prior to release.

“It seems like EPA is doing about the same thing,” he said. “On the ‘basis of responsiveness’ and ‘no records responses’ are both things that we've seen in the environmental FOIA community time and again.""

EPA officials characterized the rule change as a much-needed update to regulations as stipulated by 2007, 2009 and 2016 congressional updates to FOIA processing. The Obama administration failed to change its FOIA regulations as charged by Congress, and the new rule brings EPA into compliance.

“The changes in today’s rule bring EPA’s regulations into compliance with non-discretionary provisions of the amended statute and reflect changes in the agency’s organization, procedure, or practice,” said a senior career EPA official who helped devise the regulation.

Critics argue the new rule specifically bestows more powers on political appointees to weigh in on specific FOIA cases.

“This new notice turns that upside down by substituting a wide array of political appointees for the career officials that heretofore have responded to FOIA requests for records in the possession of their offices,” said John Walke, senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

“The rule changes, for the first time, place an army of EPA political appointees as the gatekeepers for determining whether Americans receive responsive government records in response to FOIA requests.”

The EPA official said the change to the “final determinations” authority in EPA’s new rule largely combines two previous FOIA rules and is not a significant change.

“This provision is not intended to be broader than the old regulations, which covered the subject in several provisions,” the official said.

“The old regulations state that ‘the head of an office, or that individual’s designee, is authorized to grant or deny any request for a record of that office or other agency records when appropriate.’ All positions listed in the updated regulations fall within the ordinary meaning of ‘the head of an office, or that individual’s designee,’” the official added.

While the EPA administrator and other political appointees have had the ability to grant or deny FOIA requests, doing so under the “basis of responsiveness” and “no response” option is a new addition in the forthcoming rule.

Other major changes in the rule include a decision to no longer allow EPA regional offices to handle initial FOIA requests. All requests instead must first be sent to the agency’s National FOIA Office, which will then delegate the requests to the proper office.

Any requests sent first to regional offices by members of the press, the public or any organizations will not be redirected and won’t be considered received.

“EPA expects to improve the efficiency and consistency of its intake and assignment processing, including more consistent and earlier outreach to requesters, through centralizing these functions into one office at the Agency,” according to a statement provided by EPA on the rule change.

The agency official described the change as a way to align regional office FOIA responses with the national office.

“We took a look across the agency and saw there were different practices as to how they reached out to requesters in the first instance after a request has come in. We saw an opportunity to create greater uniformity. One of the practices we’ll be adopting as this goes into effect is reaching out consistently to FOIA requesters with an initial letter,” the official said.

Bell warned that the new order could allow EPA political appointees to better control the documents ultimately released by regional offices. He said regional offices often have less political pressure to withhold more responsive materials.

“This is just making sure that every FOIA request that gets reviewed gets taken down the hall or next door to Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerTop EPA official stepping down amid ethics probe Trump pick brings scrutiny to 'revolving door' between Pentagon, industry Overnight Energy: New EPA rule could expand officials weighing in on FOIA requests | Trump plan to strip conservation fund gets bipartisan pushback | Agriculture chief downplays climate concerns MORE's office,” Bell said. “Basically, anytime a FOIA request goes up to the administration you can extend however long it will take and reduce what you get back.”

The EPA official said the changes would neither speed up nor slow down the FOIA process. Under President Trump Donald John Trump2020 Democrats spar over socialism ahead of first debate Senate passes .5 billion border bill, setting up fight with House 'Teflon Don' avoids the scorn of the 'family values' GOP — again MORE, the agency has experienced a huge uptick in FOIA requests and major backlog in processing, which has been exacerbated in some instances by a lack of funding to hire new staff to help with those requests.

“I don’t think this will change the speed or response at all. We’re trying to be consistent with outreach to requesters and not anticipating this will slow down our response,” the senior official said. “Our aspiration is to come into compliance with the statue, in the most straight and most direct way possible, without coming into any discretionary changes with the statue.”

The EPA has come under criticism for its handling of FOIA requests under Trump’s presidency. Last fall, agency heads clashed with top Democratic lawmakers over an admittance by then acting EPA Administrator Wheeler’s chief of staff to investigators with the House Oversight and Reform Committee that certain FOIA requests were put under more intense scrutiny because they were “politically charged.”

In a letter to lawmakers at the time, Kevin Minoli, the EPA’s principal deputy general counsel, defended the EPA’s decision to notify senior officials throughout the FOIA process regarding high-profile requests.

“This ‘awareness review’ process does not itself violate FOIA and can be completed without causing undue delay,” Minoli said.

The plaintiffs, represented by Harvard Law School's Project on Predatory Student Lending and Housing & Economic Rights Advocates, accuse the Department of Education under DeVos of failing to implement an Obama-era regulation known as ""borrower defense, "" which allows students to have their federal student loans cancelled if their school misled them or engaged in other misconduct.

""The law is clear: Students who experienced fraud should not be required to pay back federal loans that should never have been made by the Department in the first place,"" said Toby Merrill, director of Harvard Law School's Project on Predatory Student Lending.

Catherine Rampell: Those aren’t the emails we should be looking for,https://www.sltrib.com,"['Catherine Rampell', 'The Washington Post']",06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2019/06/25/catherine-rampell-those/,"President Trump would like to make someone’s email a central issue in the 2020 election, just as it was in 2016.

I’m on board — though I disagree with which someone we’re talking about.

We should be laser-focused on newly discovered private emails between a high-ranking census official and a GOP operative, and what they reveal about a long-term Republican conspiracy to rip political representation and financial resources from Democrats and people of color.

Thanks to recent court filings, we've learned that the late Thomas Hofeller, a Republican strategist and gerrymandering savant, helped devise a scheme to rig the political system in favor of his party for years, perhaps decades. The plan hinged on an innocuous-sounding addition to the decennial census — a new question about citizenship.

Adding this question could help Republicans in two ways. First has to do with how legislative districts are drawn.

The Constitution says federal congressional seats must be apportioned by total population, but states have some leeway in how they draw their state and local legislative districts. Currently, they generally do so based on equally sized groups of people, as measured by total population. As Hofeller described in a secret 2015 study, data from a census citizenship question could instead help states draw districts around the citizen voting-age population.

Redrawing the legislative map this new way, the study concludes, would dilute the political power of Democrats and Hispanics and ""be advantageous to Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites.""

Second, adding a citizenship question would likely make households with immigrants or ethnic minorities much less likely to participate in the census at all.

Sure, filling out the decennial census is mandatory, and census data must legally be kept confidential. But these groups have reason to worry about how their information would be used, given how the current president has demonized and threatened to deport them.

In unrelated 2017 survey testing, respondents expressed fears that immigration authorities might come after them or other members of their households; some worried about the ""Muslim ban""; some offered fake names and birth dates.

Those fears are likely to worsen if every household is asked to report on the citizenship status of every occupant. A new paper from career U.S. Census Bureau officials estimated that, if the question were added, the census self-response rate for households with at least one noncitizen would be eight percentage points lower than for all-citizen households, all else equal.

Article continues below

The end result is that public officials wouldn't have to pretend these people don't exist when they draw electoral maps, as with the proposed switch from total population to citizen voting-age population (a change that might get blocked in courts anyway).

According to official census records, they actually wouldn’t exist, period.

That would mean fewer congressional seats for, say, California, regardless of how the legislative map within California got drawn. It would also mean fewer federal funds for areas with large immigrant or ethnic-minority populations, as census data helps determine how hundreds of billions of dollars get allocated each year.

Hofeller's unpublished study would have remained secret had his estranged daughter not recently discovered his old hard drives and given them to a voting-rights group. These materials showed that portions of the 2017 Justice Department letter that provided the supposed legal rationale for adding a citizenship question — an obviously bogus explanation involving the Voting Rights Act — were taken verbatim from Hofeller's study.

Faced with this new electronic paper trail, which appeared to contradict statements administration officials had made under oath, the administration at first appeared indignant. It improbably claimed there was no evidence that there was even a connection between the Hofeller study and the Census Bureau.

And then, in another recent court filing, plaintiffs challenging the citizenship question dropped another bombshell: Hofeller had been emailing with Christa Jones, now the chief of staff to the deputy director at census. For years.

The messages show that Jones, while a census employee, communicated with Hofeller from both her government email and a separate private account about census-related and redistricting issues since at least 2010. At one point, shortly before the 2015 study was done, she specifically flagged a Federal Register notice for comment on the Census Bureau's 2015 Content Test, saying that it could ""be an opportunity to mention citizenship.""

The Supreme Court heard a challenge to the citizenship question this spring — before these Hofeller bombshells dropped — and a decision about its legality is expected this week. Given these lies, damned lies and (would-be) statistics, the court should have little choice but to block this tainted question from being asked.

"NASA, Homeland Security receive D- grades on IT issues",https://thehill.com,[],06-26-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/450520-nasa-homeland-security-receive-d-grades-on-it-issues,"The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) were both awarded D- grades on their information technology management efforts in a biannual scorecard of federal agencies.

The House Oversight government operations subcommittee released version 8.0 of the Federal IT Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) scorecard in a hearing on Wednesday.

The scorecard gave IT scores to two dozen agencies, as well as individual scores for each agency in areas such as cybersecurity, the modernization of technology and transparency and risk management.

The scorecard has been required since 2014 as part of the FITARA Act, which requires multiple federal agencies to boost IT security and modernization efforts. It was first published in November 2015, with the most recent previous scorecard released this past December.

While DHS and NASA both received the lowest grades, the Department of Education, the Small Business Administration, the General Services Administration, and the National Science Foundation tied for the top overall grade of a B+. No agency received an A overall score.

Scores most stayed stagnant from December, with five federal agencies increasing their scores, 14 keeping the same scores and five seeing lower scores. DHS was among those to have its grade cut, going from a C- to a D-, while the departments of Agriculture and Defense were among those that saw the most improvement since December.

Most agencies appeared to struggle most in cybersecurity, with only the National Science Foundation receiving an A in that category.

The departments of Health and Human Services, Agriculture, and Commerce all received Fs on cyber issues. Software licensing, by comparison, was the area where agencies most excelled, with 20 receiving As.

Subcommittee Chairman Gerald Connolly (D-Va.) said during the hearing that the scorecard “reflects the improvements agencies have made in implementing” the FITARA Act, and said the law would help agencies protect themselves against cyber attacks.

Subcommittee Ranking Member Mark Meadows Mark Randall MeadowsHouse panel votes to subpoena Kellyanne Conway over Hatch Act testimony Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump to appear at fundraiser for Jim Jordan: report GOP moves to block provision banning use of Defense funds for border wall MORE (R-N.C.) told witnesses at the hearing, including officials from the Office of Management and Budget and the Government Accountability Office, that the committee is working to ""attach dollars both as penalties and rewards"" for agencies.

“We want everyone to understand that scorecards are meaningful to us and eventually they are going to be meaningful to the agencies,"" he said."

EPA changes transparency rules,https://www.cnn.com,"['Gregory Wallace', 'Ellie Kaufman']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/26/politics/epa-foia-rule/index.html,"(CNN) The Environmental Protection Agency is making changes to its transparency rules that include explicitly granting the administrator the authority to decide which public records the agency will release or withhold.

The change in the Freedom of Information Act rule comes without the normal process of public input. It was not announced but instead was placed in the Federal Register for formal publication.

The rule change appears to allow, for example, the administrator to personally review his own documents, such as emails and calendars, and decide what to release and what to withhold, though he still must comply with the applicable laws governing the release of public documents. At federal agencies, that process is typically in the hands of career employees and attorneys.

The EPA says it has fielded an unprecedented level of requests under the Trump administration, and some of its disclosures under FOIA have resulted in embarrassing revelations about agency leadership and actions.

Political appointees at the Trump administration EPA have taken a keen interest in the handling of FOIA requests, even acknowledging instances where the process was tinged with political influence. Chief of staff Ryan Jackson testified last summer that he and aides would slow-walk ""politically charged"" requests, according to congressional Democrats.

SoilWeb App 2.0 Offers Valuable Soil Info on the Go,https://www.usda.gov,"['Posted Tammy Cheever', 'Dee Ann Littlefield', 'Usda Nrcs In']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2019/06/26/soilweb-app-20-offers-valuable-soil-info-go,"Technology Posted by Tammy Cheever and Dee Ann Littlefield, USDA NRCS in Conservation

SoilWeb brings multiple soil data sources together to provide key soil-related information on the go.

Have you ever wondered about the soil you are standing on, at any given spot in the United States? Curious about what soil type it is? How about if the soil is easy to dig? If the soil is ideal for supporting the weight of a house or a barn? Or simply, if it will help you grow better tomatoes?

Thanks to an innovative mobile app, the world’s largest soil survey data base is available on the go. The USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service and the University of California at Davis recently announced that the SoilWeb app, version 2.0, is available as a free download from Google Play (Android) and the Apple app store (iOS). The app was created through a partnership between NRCS and UC Davis.

With its embedded GPS system, SoilWeb provides convenient, instantaneous soil information from the exact soil the user is standing on. The app gives users greater accessibility to NRCS’ soil survey information that has been collected across the United States since the late 1890s. The app presents the data in mobile form, helping users make better-informed decisions about the location they are researching.

A soil sample with a sharp shooter can provide a real life visual of the soil profile image detailed in the SoilWeb app.

The information can inform insurers about flooding frequency and builders about if the location could be suitable for roads, basements, or septic tanks. The agricultural real estate industry, farmland owners, and farmers interested in renting or purchasing land commonly need information about soil productivity and land capability. Knowledge of soil is also important to home gardeners and landscapers. Although soil survey information can be used for general farm, local, and wider area planning, a professional onsite evaluation is needed to supplement this information in some cases.

Location accuracy settings allow users to select between standard accuracy (less accurate and uses less battery power) and high accuracy (more accurate but may use more battery power). The location auto-refresh feature allows users to access soil maps and data real-time even as they travel about their property.

Users can simply click “Get Soil Data” on the app’s home screen and get detailed soil survey data for that spot. Furthermore, they can get information on soil taxonomy, soil series descriptions, soil property depth profiles, land classification ratings, hydraulic and erosion ratings, forest productivity, and soil suitability ratings.

The “Details” tab in the soil series description offers robust site information indicating if the site is a good location for a pond as determined by slope and water-holding capacity. This feature can also determine if site is suitable for cropland, including the type of crops it is best suited for and even the types of plants one could expect to find at that location – from trees to forbs to grasses. This is especially helpful for long range management plans for the property.

Soil suitability ratings provide customer reports based on a user’s interest. Categories include agriculture, forestry, engineering, irrigation, urban/recreation, soil contamination awareness, and wildlife. This portion of the app displays what the soil could be best suited for and provides information on how to manage the land for best productivity.

The app was developed by NRCS Soil Scientist Dylan Beaudette, in 2010 when Beaudette was a Ph.D. student at UC Davis, along with Anthony O'Geen, UC Davis professor and Cooperative Extension specialist. Through an agreement between NRCS and UC Davis, contractor Mike Walkinshaw was able to devote the last 12 months to bringing the app up to current standards with new features. The app accesses NRCS’ Web Soil Survey information, with is an accumulation of valuable soil information the agency has been collecting since the 1890s.

When producers look out across their fields and pastures, they have a good idea of what is growing above the ground. But it is soil underneath that really drives their management systems. The better farmers and ranchers understand the soils beneath their land, the more they can improve the production capability on their land.

The SoilWeb app offers this and more from the convenience and ease of a mobile device. Download it today. It’s free and we know it will become an important tool in your farming toolbox.

SoilWeb app offers detailed information about plants likely to be found in the area, offering a great opportunity for landowners to do a pasture walk and plant identification."
USDA approves $4.85 million loan for Dorr-Leighton wastewater expansion,https://www.mlive.com,"['Michael Kransz', 'Mkransz Mlive.Com']",06-26-2019,2019,6,https://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/2019/06/usda-approves-485-million-loan-for-dorr-leighton-wastewater-expansion.html,"DORR, MI -- The United States Department of Agriculture has approved a $4.85 million loan to help double the size of the Dorr-Leighton Wastewater Treatment Plant.

Though approved, treatment plant officials say they have to complete a number of further steps before the loan is finalized.

The expansion of the wastewater treatment plant serving Dorr and Leighton townships is needed because the plant is nearing capacity amid continued growth, according to Jeff Miling, Dorr Township supervisor and co-chair of the wastewater authority board.

Wastewater officials say the plant serves about 500 customers, which includes homes, businesses and multi-residence properties, such as an apartment complex and trailer park.

The USDA, in a press release Wednesday, June 26, said the plant upgrades are needed to meet Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy regulations.

Miling said he’s unaware of any regulatory violations and that USDA is likely referring to the plant being near the capacity at which EGLE officials require an expansion.

“We were getting close to 80 percent of capacity of our plant,” he said.

The expansion project will cost an estimated $5 million, Miling said. Wastewater officials say that if the loan comes through, bidding on the project could happen later this year.

The approved loan for the Dorr-Leighton plant is one of five announced Wednesday.

“This announcement includes more than $13 million in critical infrastructure assistance across the Lower Peninsula to ensure clean water and safe sewer systems in rural areas,” said USDA Rural Development State Director for Michigan Jason Allen."

(Lucy Nicholson/Reuters)

The Department of Justice official pictured in a viral video clip debating what specifically constitutes “sanitary conditions” under a court decision governing the detention of minors has received “several” death threats since the clip’s contents were reported by a number of news outlets last week, DOJ spokeswoman Kerri Kupec told National Review on Monday.

An edited version of Sarah Fabian’s Tuesday testimony before a panel of Ninth Circuit judges was published on Twitter by NowThis News on Friday under the headline: “A Trump official tried to argue that detained children don’t need soap, toothbrushes, or beds to be ‘safe and sanitary’ while in Border Patrol custody.”

A number of media outlets, including the The Hill and the Huffington Post, then highlighted the videos as evidence of the Trump administration’s willful mistreatment of migrants.

Fabian did not argue that children held in federal custody should not be given basic toiletries — as the viral headlines suggest — but rather suggested that the Flores Settlement agreement, a 1997 court ruling which governs the conditions under which minors can be held in federal custody, does not explicitly require the provision of those specific items.

Furthermore, Fabian’s testimony was related to a challenge of a 2017 ruling that U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, under President Obama, violated Flores by failing to provide children with basic sanitary products. The judge presiding over that case found that those items should be provided under Flores and recommended the appointment of a special monitor to ensure CBP provided the items going forward.

The treatment of migrants at CBP holding facilities has received greater scrutiny in recent weeks amid reports that CBP and the Department of Health and Human Services, which assumes custody of the migrants after they are processed by CBP, are unequipped to safely house and provide medical care for the overwhelming number of asylum-seekers arriving at the border each day.

Administration officials have asked Congress for additional funding to address what they claim has become a crisis at the southern border. They have also pleaded for legislative reforms that would grant CBP agents greater latitude to immediately deny entry to asylum seekers if their claims are clearly illegitimate. Under current law, CBP agents must admit virtually all asylum seekers pending an immigration hearing, which as many as 90 percent of them fail to appear for.

Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced last week that the Senate will vote in the coming days on a $4.5 billion aid package designed to address the government’s inability to adequately shelter the more than 100,000 asylum-seekers that have begun arriving at the southern border each month."
Rep. Michael McCaul: The border crisis is real – Democrats need to stop playing politics with people's lives,https://www.foxnews.com,['Michael Mccaul'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/rep-michael-mccaul-border-crisis-immigration-democrats-house-politics,"Our immigration system is in desperate need of reform. As a Congressman from Texas, the most recent House Homeland Security Committee Chairman, and former a federal prosecutor, I have seen firsthand, after many visits to the southern border, how dire the situation has become.

In May, Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) apprehended nearly 150,000 individuals attempting to cross our southern border illegally. The Secretaries of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have pleaded with Congress to act.

Republicans have put forth legislative solutions to alleviate this humanitarian crisis. Yet, Democrats continue to block solutions at every turn. If Democrats truly wanted to help vulnerable populations, they would not have waited until this week – when the crisis is at a breaking point – to act.

ICE RELEASES LIST OF ACCUSED MURDERERS, RAPISTS PROTECTED UNDER STATE'S SANCTUARY LAW

Republicans have been trying to address issues along our southern border, long before this current migration crisis. During the last Congress, I introduced the Securing America's Future Act with Congressman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., It would have provided a solution for DACA recipients and $25 billion for border security, while also addressing our outdated asylum laws by closing the legal loopholes which have unfortunately functioned as a magnet to drug cartels and human traffickers. This bill offered real solutions but was voted down by every single Democrat.

This Congress, as the crisis has materialized, House Republicans put forth the Border Crisis Supplemental Appropriations Act. This bill is a common-sense solution that would provide $3.3 billion in assistance to include shelter capacity for unaccompanied children, $1.1 billion in resources to combat human smuggling and trafficking, and $178 million to ensure adequate pay for our law enforcement officers on the front lines of this crisis. Yet, Democrats have rejected it 18 separate times from coming to the floor for a vote.

Last week, my colleagues in the Senate offered a bipartisan bill that passed the Senate Appropriations Committee 30-1 that would have immediately provided humanitarian aid for children and families.

Instead, the House Majority ignored a strong bipartisan product and chose to appease the radical left with a bill that doesn’t address the crisis, but rather impedes the legislative process.

Once again, the Democratic majority is playing politics with people’s lives, while the crisis at our southern border worsens by the minute.

At this rate, we are on track to potentially hit 1,000,000 apprehensions at the border this year. With these record numbers, those who truly need assistance will be forced to wait years for a court date, while others are gaming the system, using children as their free ticket into our country.

While Democrats have been stonewalling Republican funding efforts, CBP has seen their average daily number of unaccompanied children climb from 870 children on May 1, to more than 2,300 children in recent days. These children are then supposed to be turned over to HHS, so they can receive the attention they need while in the care of the federal government. However, HHS has a fraction of the necessary bed space to care for these children, forcing them to wait in CBP facilities that were not intended to care for children.

CBP is tasked with ensuring the United States can facilitate lawful trade and travel, but because of the overwhelming influx of migrants, they are often unable to perform these duties. We simply do not have the capacity, personnel, or resources to handle the number of migrants arriving at our southern border. According to DHS, Border Patrol agents currently spend more than 50 percent of their time caring for families and children and provide an average of 70 hospital trips every day for urgent care.

As we continue to see an unprecedented number of children arriving at our border, our federal programs are hemorrhaging money to provide humanitarian care to these children. If we do not act immediately, we will run out of the necessary funding in the coming weeks.

Our federal departments, void of an emergency appropriation from Congress, will be required by law to halt these programs. Essentially, the departments will operate these programs as if there has been a government shutdown: providing only essential services to protect life and safety.

The United States is a beacon of hope and a land of opportunity especially for those who are fleeing dangerous scenarios in their home countries to seek legitimate asylum. That is why I support immediate humanitarian assistance.

Soon, members on both sides of the aisle will have to finally do their jobs – secure our borders, fix our broken immigration laws, and lead with true compassion while honoring the rule of law.

Inspector General wants to know if USDA concealed worker safety data,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Kimberly Kindy', 'National Investigative Reporter', 'Kimberly Kindy Is A National Investigative Reporter For The Washington Post.

Under a proposed new system, plant owners would be allowed to run pork plant slaughter lines as fast as they want. (Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News)

The Office of Inspector General is evaluating whether the U.S. Department of Agriculture concealed information and used flawed data to develop and promote a new hog inspection system that would shift many food-safety tasks from federal inspectors to pork industry employees.

The USDA’s inspector general, Phyllis Fong, notified 16 members of Congress on Friday that her office has launched the probe in response to concerns the lawmakers raised in March, according to a letter obtained by The Washington Post.

Under the proposed new system, plant owners would be allowed to run pork plant slaughter lines as fast as they want, a provision that has worker safety advocates concerned that worker injury rates would rise. The USDA said in a proposed rule — which if finalized would create the new system — that its data shows worker injury rates probably would be lower than those at traditional plants where limits are placed on line speeds.

Sen. Richard J. Durbin (Ill.), the second-highest-ranking Senate Democrat, and more than a dozen other Democrats sought the inspector general’s probe after two university experts reviewed the USDA’s data and analysis and concluded “it is impossible” for the department to “draw any statistically valid conclusion about worker injury rate differences.”

The data was not released until months after the 60-day public comment period for the rule had closed in April 2018 and only after Freedom of Information Act requests were filed by a Texas State University researcher and a worker safety advocacy group, the National Employment Law Project.



Durbin, who says he worked in a slaughterhouse for a year as a college student, said Monday he is glad the inspector general is heeding his request, adding that line speeds are “directly linked to worker safety.”

“Bowing to the meatpacking industry, the USDA relied on sketchy data to justify a major inspections change that could create unsafe working environments at pork processing plants in America,” Durbin said in a prepared statement for The Post. “I am concerned that the USDA also tried to hide this data from the public.”

[Pork industry soon will have more power over meat inspections]

Debbie Berkowitz, a worker-safety expert with the law project, asked USDA officials to extend the public comment period to allow others to examine and remark on USDA’s data and its worker safety analysis, records show. No extension was granted.

A Post analysis of the public comments showed that out of 84,000 public remarks made on the rule, 87 percent were either opposed or expressed negative opinions about the proposal. In numerous instances, groups asked for additional information to properly evaluate the proposal.

“The bottom line here is USDA is rushing this rule through and really abandoning any effort to be transparent,” Berkowitz said in an interview.

USDA declined to comment on the Inspector General probe. In earlier statements, it has said the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, not USDA, has the “statutory and regulatory authority to promote workplace safety and health.”

Berkowitz, who was OSHA chief of staff during the Obama administration, said the USDA does not “police companies about worker safety.” However, she said, “They should not be in the business of giving a green light to something that could cause further injury to workers.”

Illness rates for people who work in the meatpacking plants — including carpal tunnel syndrome and tendinitis — are 16 times higher than the average for all other industries, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The proposed hog-slaughter rule is based on a study that began 20 years ago, ultimately including five large plants. Efforts to expand the program have sputtered under past administrations, but Trump administration officials have pushed forward with the rule and hoped to finalize it this summer.

The USDA expects 40 of 612 hog plants will use the new system. Collectively, agriculture officials say, these plants will account for 90 percent of the pork produced in the United States.

In her letter to Durbin and other lawmakers, Fong said her office will seek to determine whether the USDA did the following: complied with federal public transparency requirements; made information about its preliminary analysis on worker safety clearly accessible to the public during the comment period; adhered to the department’s own data quality guidelines; came to a reasonable determination about the reliability of OSHA injury data; and consulted with OSHA and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health as it developed the rule.

The inquiry is expected to be complete by the end of the year, an inspector general spokeswoman said.

On Tuesday, the House of Representatives passed a 2020 appropriations bill that provides funding for USDA. However, the bill also requires that the Inspector General perform a more extensive data review before any funds are used for the new inspection system.

That requirement, proposed by Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.), would also include an examination of USDA data the department used to conclude that pork produced under the new system would be as safe as pork produced at plants using the traditional inspection system. It would also examine data USDA used to conclude the increased line speeds would not impact animal welfare. DeLauro called the proposed rule a “giveaway to large corporate meatpackers.”

In response to the inspector general’s probe, DeLauro said it is “an important first step toward ensuring the swine inspection rule changes are based on sound science by opening an investigation into the department’s use of flawed worker safety data. However, the OIG must expand their investigation to encompass all data USDA used to develop the proposed rule — as would be required by a provision I included in this year’s USDA funding bill.”

In an earlier statement, the North American Meat Institute, an industry group that supports the proposal, said: “This rule is founded on years of sound scientific data and experience. NAMI supports risk-based, science-driven food safety systems. Consumers deserve no less.”

10-year Treasury yield falls below 2% after weak consumer confidence data,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/25/us-treasury-yields-lower-ahead-of-powells-speech.html,"The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell below 2% on Tuesday as investors looked for safety following the release of much weaker-than-expected confidence data.

Short-term rates rose off their lows, however, following comments from St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard and Chairman Jerome Powell.

The yield traded at 1.994% as of 3:33 p.m. ET. The 2-year rate held steady at 1.736% while the 30-year bond yield declined to 2.52%.

Bullard said Tuesday he doesn't believe the U.S. central bank needs to lower borrowing costs by 50 basis points at its next meeting despite his push to cut rates last week.

""Just sitting here today, I think 50 basis points would be overdone,"" Bullard told Bloomberg News. ""I don't think the situation really calls for that, but I would be willing to go 25 (basis points).""

In a speech in New York, Powell reiterated that inflation — or how much prices rise throughout the economy — continues to run below the central bank's 2% objective.

""The crosscurrents have reemerged, with apparent progress on trade turning to greater uncertainty and with incoming data raising renewed concerns about the strength of the global economy. Our contacts in business and agriculture report heightened concerns over trade developments,"" he said at the Council on Foreign Relations.

The central bank leader also said in prepared remarks that the Fed ""is insulated from short-term political pressures — what is often referred to as our 'independence.'""

""Congress chose to insulate the Fed this way because it had seen the damage that often arises when policy bends to short-term political interests. Central banks in major democracies around the world have similar independence,"" he added.

Those comments may allude to President Donald Trump's recent attacks on the Fed and its monetary policies, which he believes are preventing stronger economic growth and keeping a lid on the stock market. Trump has also said the central bank's interest rate strategy undermines the administration's negotiating position in trade deliberations with China.

The Conference Board's consumer confidence index fell to 121.5 in June, reaching its lowest level since September 2017. Conference Board senior director Lynn Franco said escalating trade fears appear to have ""shaken consumers' confidence.""

""Those survey readings of higher consumer confidence were just a lot of hot air as it turns out,"" Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG, said in a note. ""If the Fed had had this almost ten point drop in the confidence number last week it may well have tipped the scale and led them to cut interest rates."""

DOJ official defends herself over testimony about migrant treatment that went viral,https://thehill.com,[],06-25-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/450350-doj-official-defends-herself-over-testimony-about-migrant-treatment,"A senior litigation counsel with the Justice Department is defending herself on social media after going viral in a video of court proceedings arguing that specific items such as soap and toothbrushes would not necessarily be required for some migrant detainees under a 1997 settlement.

Attorney Sarah Fabian went viral last week when she appeared to argue in defense of the Trump administration's operation of facilities that require migrants including children to sleep on concrete floors with just an aluminum foil blanket as covering. NBC News reported Tuesday that Fabian wrote on Facebook that she was sorry that her comments “struck a nerve.""

“I think that many many people believe I was in court Tuesday arguing against providing certain hygiene items to kids,” Fabian reportedly wrote in a private Facebook post shared to NBC News by her friends.

“I do not believe that’s the position I was representing,"" she reportedly added later.

“I will say that I personally believe that we should do our very best to care for kids while they are in our custody, and I try to always represent that value in my work,” she added in the post. “A vast majority of the work that I do is not public, but I strive to help people by my participation in the process.”

Fabian's court appearance was part of the Trump administration's legal effort to overturn a lower court's decision in 2017 that found that a group of migrant children were forced to sleep in conditions not considered ""safe and sanitary"" under the Flores Settlement, a 1997 court settlement that lays out the guidelines for treatment of migrants in the care of the U.S. government.

The Trump administration has argued that the the 2017 decision, which found that children were given inadequate food and dirty water while being cared for by U.S. officials, imposed “new substantive requirements” not laid out by the 1997 Flores settlement."
Democrat Senators Come Out Against DOL ‘Joint Employer’ Rule,https://news.bloomberglaw.com,[],,,,https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/democrat-senators-come-out-against-dol-joint-employer-rule,"Six of the seven senators running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020 voiced their “strong opposition” to the Labor Department’s proposal to narrow liability for franchised businesses and companies that rely on temps and other contractors.

“The proposed interpretation would violate the language and intent of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and weaken the enforcement of wage-and-hour protections on behalf of many of the most vulnerable workers in the country, directly contradicting DOL’s mission,” Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), and several other Democratic heavyweights said in a June 25 letter to Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta.

The DOL proposed a new joint employer regulation—or interpretive rule—in April, seeking to narrow the circumstances when multiple companies can be considered “joint employers” of a group of workers. The Obama administration had looked to expand the scope of joint employer liability. The DOL said in April that its new proposal would reduce uncertainty about which businesses are responsible for workers’ employment protections and any associated liability for violating labor laws.

“As the prevalence of contracting, temporary staffing, and franchising arrangements has ballooned throughout the American economy, it is increasingly important that companies that share responsibility for workers are held liable for wage theft, child labor abuses, and other violations of federal wage-and-hour law that too often devastate the financial security of working families,” the senators wrote, noting that the 3-million temp-worker contingent across the country is “disproportionately made up of African American and Latino workers earning significantly less than other groups.

The joint employer issue is a flashpoint for franchised and gig economy companies and worker advocates. The comment period on the joint employer proposal ended June 25.

The DOL’s proposal also drew attention from a group of Democratic attorneys general and the largest business association in the franchise sector, the International Franchise Association. The IFA argues that long-accepted practices in franchising shouldn’t be considered evidence of joint liability.

“The Department of Labor has put forward a rule that can add much-needed clarity for franchise businesses,” IFA Senior Vice President of Government Relations Matt Haller said in a June 25 announcement. “An expanded joint employer standard has cost the economy billions and slowed down hiring and job growth—this rule is a major step toward righting that wrong.”

Officials from 18 states including New York, California, North Carolina, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and the District of Columbia wrote to Acosta to oppose the rulemaking.

“The experiences of many of the undersigned state Attorneys General (“State AGs”) in enforcing labor laws and protecting workers argue strongly against adopting the Proposed Rule,” the prosecutors wrote. “Based on our collective experience, we believe that the Proposed Rule does not adequately reflect today’s workplace relationships, in which growing numbers of businesses are changing organizational and staffing models by outsourcing functions to third” parties.”

The DOL regulation is considered an interpretive rule because Congress hasn’t directly authorized the agency to define joint employment. Critics have suggested the eventual policy will be subject to legal challenges.

The letter from Congress also was signed by Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio); Patty Murray (D-Wash.); Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.); Dick Durbin (D-Ill.); Ben Cardin (D-Md.); Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.); Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.); and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.)."
"The risk of traveling to every country in Africa, according to the US State Department",https://www.businessinsider.com,['Ellen Cranley'],06-24-2019,2019,6,https://www.businessinsider.com/africa-vacation-travel-warnings-us-state-department-2019-6,"The US State Department's public travel advisories let Americans know what countries are safe to travel to and which ones they should be wary of.

With at least five Americans reported dead in the Dominican Republic in the past three months, it's worth checking these alerts before going on your next international vacation.

The State Department uses four levels of travel guidance to let Americans know what to expect in each country:

Level 1 - Exercise normal precautions;

Level 2 - Exercise increased caution;

Level 3 - Reconsider travel;

and Level 4 - Do not travel.

Fourteen countries around the world are designated ""do not travel,"" mostly because of ongoing armed conflicts. In Africa, six countries are designated Level 4.

Here are the travel advisories for every country in Africa, ranked from most to least risky based on the State Department's designation levels."

Emails obtained by The Times showed the EPA was concerned that data collected by the space agency could cause “confusion” and might “overlap” with its own analysis — which was showing only a few isolated spots of concern.

His LinkedIn profile lists “June 2019” as the end of his Treasury job, without providing a specific date. Bloomberg wrote last week about Phillips’ departure.

Phillips’ LinkedIn profile now says: “He supported Secretary Mnuchin in the development of policy for comprehensive housing finance reform.”

What it doesn't say: Oversaw the privatization of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

Phillips, the ultimate Wall Street insider, was seen by some as the great hope for reforming and releasing the government-sponsored enterprises, or GSEs, from government conservatorship. In a New York Times story last month saying he planned to leave, Phillips said he would return to Wall Street but didn’t have a job lined up yet. His LinkedIn profile doesn’t list a current position.

Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Mark Calabria said earlier this month that he hoped Treasury’s plan to release Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would come by the end of June. The White House is reviewing a draft of the proposal, Bloomberg reported last week, citing people familiar with the matter. The two mortgage giants guarantee more than half of the outstanding residential mortgages in the U.S., according to Federal Reserve data.

The departure of Phillips “matters” to the prospects of getting Fannie and Freddie back to anything resembling the footing they had before the housing crisis a decade ago, Jaret Seiberg, Managing Director at Cowen Group, said in a note to clients on Friday.

“Phillips was one of the few senior folks at Treasury with the clout to negotiate on GSE reform,” Seiberg wrote in the note. “While we believe he finished the Treasury white paper on GSE reform before he left, his departure means that Phillips cannot push the National Economic Council to approve the document. More broadly, Mnuchin has few other senior advisers and he devotes much of his time to trade disputes. The argument is that Mnuchin simply lacks the time and energy needed to advance a housing finance reform plan given the controversy that will surround any plan to recap and release Fannie and Freddie.”

After more than three decades at Wall Street firms, some of it spent as a mortgage trader, Phillips joined the Trump administration in 2017. He left a position as managing director at BlackRock to become Mnuchin’s top housing advisor. Prior to BlackRock, he held managing director positions at both Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, according to LinkedIn.

Last year, Phillips said in a speech at the Mortgage Bankers Association’s annual conference in Washington D.C. that the Trump administration wants to end the government takeover of Fannie and Freddie that began in July 2008 during the financial crisis.

“The administration advocates ending the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and returning them to private ownership,” Phillips said. “Their charters should be removed from statute and their operations should be overseen by the primary regulator that has the authority to approve additional guarantors to introduce competition into the secondary mortgage market.”"
