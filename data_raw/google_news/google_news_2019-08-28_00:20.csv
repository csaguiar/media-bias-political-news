Attorney General William P. Barr is planning a holiday treat for his boss.

Last month, Barr booked President Trump’s D.C. hotel for a 200-person holiday party in December that is likely to deliver Trump’s business more than $30,000 in revenue.

Barr signed a contract, a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Post, for a “Family Holiday Party” in the hotel’s Presidential Ballroom Dec. 8. The party will feature a buffet and a four-hour open bar for about 200 people.

Barr is paying for the event himself and chose the venue only after other hotels, including the Willard and the Mayflower, were booked, according to a Justice Department official. The official said the purpose of Barr’s party wasn’t to curry favor with the president.

Barr holds the bash annually, and it combines holiday festivities and a ceilidh, a party featuring Irish or Scottish music.

“Career ethics officials were consulted, and they determined that ethics rules did not prohibit him from hosting his annual party at the Trump hotel,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the party is not a Justice Department event.

Barr’s decision to book his boss’s hotel marks the latest collision between Trump’s administration and his business, which the president no longer operates but from which he still benefits financially.

Trump said Monday that he was likely to hold next year’s Group of Seven international summit at his golf resort in Doral, Fla. Already the federal government and GOP campaigns have spent at least $1.6 million at his properties since he entered office, according to a Post analysis, though the actual figure is likely to be higher because of the difficulty of obtaining up-to-date records.

Barr, the nation’s top law enforcement official, has previously faced criticism for adopting language that hews closely to Trump’s. For example, special counsel Robert S. Mueller III complained that Barr’s characterization of his investigation — which closely mirrored the president’s — “did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance” of Mueller’s final report. Experts have cited that and other examples in questioning Barr’s independence from the president.

“It creates the appearance that high-level political appointees or allies of the president may feel like they need to spend money at the president’s businesses as a show of loyalty, and that is something that makes me deeply uncomfortable and should make taxpayers deeply uncomfortable,” said Liz Hempowicz, director of public policy at the nonprofit Project on Government Oversight.

The Trump Organization declined to comment. Representatives from the Willard Hotel declined to comment, citing the company’s privacy policy. A spokeswoman for the Mayflower Hotel did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Barr’s decision to book the Trump hotel is noteworthy, in particular, because Justice Department attorneys are defending the president’s business in court. Trump’s D.C. hotel has hosted a number of foreign governments as clients, business that has generated two lawsuits, one from the attorneys general of Maryland and D.C. and the other from about 200 Democratic members of Congress.

Both cases are being considered in federal court, and the Justice Department is defending the president’s position that he has not run afoul of the anti-corruption provisions in the Constitution called the domestic and foreign emoluments clauses.

D.C. Attorney General Karl A. Racine (D), a plaintiff in one of the emoluments cases against Trump, said Barr’s plans make him fear “that all this does is it normalizes conduct of presidential supporters or would-be supporters, who clearly know a clear avenue to curry favor with the president and that is to do business with the president’s business.”

White House aides, including inside the White House Counsel’s Office, have warned Trump and Cabinet officials against making official visits to his properties.

Barr’s event falls into a different category. It isn’t an official event — it’s a party. His contract requires that he spend $4,500 to rent the ballroom — space designed by Ivanka Trump before she joined her father in the White House — and $135 per person for a buffet and open bar, a number that is likely to change after Barr chooses a menu for the event.

[What Attorney General Barr said vs. what the Mueller report said]

Walter Shaub, a former director of the Office of Government Ethics who has been an outspoken critic of Trump’s ethics record, called Barr’s decision to book Trump’s hotel “one of those things that doesn’t violate the rules, but it’s really troubling.”

“He keeps sending signals that his loyalty is to a politician and not to the country,” Shaub said. “And it’s part of an ongoing erosion of credibility at the Department of Justice.”

It’s difficult to determine whether Barr will pay market rate for the event, as the Justice Department official asserted he would. The contract, sent to Barr at his Northern Virginia home, calls for a minimum of $100 per person for food and beverage before adding 35 percent for taxes and tip. It requires that Barr pay at least $31,500, even if he cancels the event.

The hotel’s publicly available menu lists a “banquet dinner” as costing $115 per person for two hours plus $30 for each additional hour. A hosted bar costs $29 for the first hour per person and an additional $12 per hour for each additional hour. If Barr opts for that level of service at those prices, the food and beverage bill for 200 guests would probably top $45,000.

Hotels typically have lots of available space on Sunday nights, leading them to offer less expensive rates. A contract the hotel signed with Virginia Women for Trump for a Monday event in the summer of 2018, obtained separately by The Post, required a $3,050 room rental fee and a $39,000 banquet fee for a much larger group, 818 people, though it did not include an open bar.

Hempowicz said that if Barr receives a discount from the hotel, it would give other Americans dealing with the Justice Department reason for concern, whomever the party is for.

“If the attorney general gets a discount while the Justice Department defends the hotel in court, that is not how the justice system is supposed to work and it’s not how the Department of Justice is supposed to work,” she said.

Trump privately clashed with G7 leaders over reinviting Putin,https://www.cnn.com,"['Pamela Brown', 'Kevin Liptak']",08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/27/politics/donald-trump-g7-vladimir-putin-fight/index.html,"Biarritz, France (CNN) A sharp and sometimes bitter disagreement broke out between President Donald Trump and several G7 leaders over whether to allow Russia back into their club during a welcome dinner on Saturday, according to two diplomatic officials and a senior US official with knowledge of the exchange.

Trump, as he did in public over the course of the summit, ardently advocated for it, the officials said. As the leaders discussed issues like Iran and fires in the Amazon rainforest, Trump interjected and asked why Russia should not be included in the talks, given its size and role in global affairs.

That met sharp resistance from some of the leaders, principally German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. They argued Russia had grown more anti-democratic since it was ejected in 2014 for its incursion into Ukraine, disqualifying it from rejoining the G7.

The dispute amounted to one of the most heated moments of this weekend's G7. Afterward, Trump publicly insisted the gathering was marked by displays of unity and cooperation. While the leaders did hold amiable discussions throughout both the dinner and other sessions, the exchange on Russia was notable for the fiercely argued views on both sides, the officials said.

During the dinner, Trump argued repeatedly that his predecessor Barack Obama was to blame for ejecting Russia from the group, according to one of the diplomatic officials, echoing a view he has expressed publicly. He told reporters on Monday that Obama was ""outsmarted"" by Russian President Vladimir Putin during the invasion of Crimea.

Why some lesbians don’t want Pete Buttigieg to be president,https://www.politico.com,['Maggie Severns'],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/27/lesbians-pete-buttigieg-2020-president-1475900,"Several lesbian activists say that while they are glad South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is running for the Democratic nomination, they most want a woman to be president in 2020, after Hillary Clinton’s stinging loss in 2016. | Mary Schwalm/AP Photo 2020 Elections Why some lesbians don’t want Pete Buttigieg to be president Lesbian political activists are divided over which glass ceiling to aim for in the 2020 presidential race.

Campbell Spencer, a lesbian and political consultant, moved to Washington in the 1990s to work in LGBTQ advocacy. She wooed gay and lesbian voters for Al Gore, worked a stint in the Obama White House and now serves on the board of the LGBTQ Victory Fund, which this year issued its first-ever endorsement of a presidential candidate: Pete Buttigieg.

But so far, Kamala Harris has wowed Spencer more than any other candidate in the race.

Story Continued Below

“Mayor Pete, he’s a trailblazer,” Spencer said in an interview. “But I’m one of these women who thinks we are way overdue for having a woman in the White House. That’s a lens through which I’m going to filter my decision.”

Buttigieg, the openly gay mayor of South Bend, Ind., has drawn notable support from gay voters and donors for his presidential bid. But interviews with a dozen prominent Democrats in the LGBTQ community spotlight a remarkable collision of goals and ideals in the community of lesbian political activists this year. As the 2020 field slowly winnows, people are divided over which glass ceiling to break first.

The majority of the women POLITICO interviewed for this story did not want to speak on the record, citing a desire not to damage Buttigieg’s campaign. But especially when compared with the laborious ascent of Hillary Clinton, Buttigieg’s swift rise in national politics hints of male favoritism, some said. Others applauded his run — but feel more strongly about the need to elect a female president.

“It feels like a slap in the face to just go directly to the white gay guy, when for decades you’ve been trying to elect a woman and it didn’t happen last time,” said one lesbian Democrat who works in national politics. “If Pete Buttigieg is elected it won’t feel like a vindication of Hillary Clinton. If a woman is elected, it will.”

LGBTQ voters made up a relatively small 6 percent of the electorate in the 2018 midterm elections but voted overwhelmingly for Democratic candidates, according to exit polls. And gay donors are a formidable source of campaign funds in the Democratic Party: One in six of Barack Obama’s top campaign bundlers in 2012 were openly gay, according to a Washington Post analysis at the time.

The LGBTQ community has been an important launch pad for Buttigieg’s presidential bid. He has fundraised at the homes of several prominent gay donors — such as television producers Ryan Murphy and Richie Jackson, each of whom have hosted Buttigieg for events in their homes this year — and received campaign checks from power players including Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes and lesbian megadonor Laura Ricketts.

But the broad 2020 Democratic field includes historic diversity and choice for LGBTQ voters looking for new representation in the White House, or at least on the Democratic debate stage.

“There are black gay men and Latina lesbians — we have all these identities,” said Annise Parker, the former Houston mayor who is now president and CEO of the LGBTQ Victory Fund. “I talk to donors who are really glad that Pete’s running, but want Julián Castro to be on the debate stage. Or who say, ‘I want Cory Booker or Kamala Harris to be on stage.’ I say that’s a great thing.”

Parker, who became the first lesbian elected to lead a major American city only a decade ago, said she plans to vote for Buttigieg. But she also feels the pull of electing the first female president.

“As a woman, as a lesbian, as someone who was all in for Hillary Clinton and as someone who was a historic first myself, I would love to see a woman at the top of the ticket,” Parker said.

“And talking with other women inside the community and not, we understand the importance of Pete’s candidacy — but dammit, we’re half the population. It’s time” for a woman president, Parker continued.

Several lesbian donors and activists interviewed by POLITICO said they see in this election a continuation of the gender politics of 2016, when Clinton’s nomination was a vindicating moment for many Democratic women — and Trump’s position as the GOP nominee heightened the stakes of the race, as well as the burn of Clinton’s loss.

“To have a woman candidate finally running for president was extraordinarily galvanizing to substantial portions of the women’s community and the lesbian community,” said Elyse Cherry, a Massachusetts-based lesbian community activist and former member of Clinton’s New England finance committee. “When she lost, people were even more galvanized.”

Cherry pushed to build a movement for same-sex marriage in Massachusetts, starting in the early 1990s when the idea was a political outlier. She chaired the board for MassEquality, which advocated for the state’s gay marriage law and worked to guard it from challenges in the years after it was enacted.

Cherry plans to vote for her senior senator, Elizabeth Warren.

“Having a woman, finally, as our president is important to me,” Cherry said. “The mistake is to suggest that we all stay in one lane — for example that if you’re gay you should be supporting gay candidates, or if you’re a woman you should be supporting women candidates.”

LPAC, an organization that focuses on building power among LGBTQ women, has not endorsed a candidate, but its endorsement discussions will begin at an upcoming board meeting, the group’s president Stephanie Sandberg said, adding that there is a ""strong possibility"" that LPAC will endorse a candidate.

Nabeela Rasheed, a Chicago-based lawyer and activist backing Buttigieg, said “there is absolutely a conversation that’s happening” among lesbian donors in her area about the value of supporting a female candidate over Buttigieg.

“I don’t think the county is ready for a West Coast Democrat, and a female at that. And I don’t think this country can take an East Coast female either. They need someone who understands Main Street,” Rasheed said. So Rasheed — who is of Pakistani descent — has been raising money for Buttigieg and trying to introduce as many women of color to his campaign as possible.

Buttigieg surprised observers by surging to national prominence this spring and raising $24 million between early April and the end of June, the most money of any candidate in the field.

One foundation for his success was a bloc of openly gay male donors and fundraisers who threw their support behind his campaign early in the race. Among the people who have already raised more than $25,000 for Buttigieg’s campaign were Terrence Meck, co-founder of the nonprofit The Palette Fund; and Alex Slater, founder of the Washington, D.C.-based Clyde Group.

Other high-profile gay donors, such as software entrepreneur Tim Gill and philanthropist David Bohnett, have donated to former Vice President Joe Biden, who was an early proponent of same-sex marriage in Washington.

Kelly Dermody, a former Hillary Clinton bundler and employment lawyer who has represented women in sexual harassment cases, said that while Buttigieg’s candidacy is “exciting,” federal lawmakers who are running have more experience.

Dermody is backing Harris, who she believes is the strongest candidate, in part because of her experience as a woman and person of color. She said that one highlight of the 2020 campaign for her has been Harris’ husband, Douglas Emhoff, a frequent presence at campaign stops and an unbridled booster of his wife on social media.

“It’s just been really nice seeing him at various events and see what it looks like to have a female leader have the support of a strong male partner,” Dermondy said. “He has his own job and he’s a real star lawyer in his own world, but he also has embraced this [campaign].”

Chaffetz on possibility of charges against Andrew McCabe: DOJ is 'horrific' at holding itself accountable,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Joshua Nelson', 'Joshua Nelson Is A Freelance Reporter For Fox News.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/chaffetz-andrew-mccabe-doj-horrific-holding-themselves-accountable,"Fox News contributor and former Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz said on Tuesday that the Department of Justice is “horrific” when it has to hold itself accountable, as prosecutors mull whether to pursue charges against former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.

“Now they got a decision to make — are they going to hold the Department of Justice people accountable to the same degree that they do the rest of the world? And so far they’ve shown no backbone to be able to do so,” Chaffetz told “America's Newsroom.”

A source close to the process said that McCabe has had a “target on his back” because of the Justice Department inspector general findings against him over actions during the Hillary Clinton email investigation, as well as his role in the surveillance warrants against President Trump's campaign associates during the Russia investigation. McCabe is a former deputy and acting director of the FBI.

EX-FBI DEPUTY DIRECTOR ANDREW MCCABE SUES DOJ OVER DISMISSAL

Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired McCabe in March 2018 after the Justice Department inspector general report found he had repeatedly misstated his involvement in a leak to The Wall Street Journal regarding an FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation.

“Ultimately he was fired for cause, multiple occasions, [for] lying ... some of the times under oath,” Chaffetz said.

The New York Times, which first reported the developments Monday, said McCabe’s lawyers recently met with DOJ attorneys who would handle a prosecution — an indication of a possible indictment.

McCabe's legal team and the Justice Department declined to comment. The U.S. Attorney's Office in D.C. has not responded to a Fox News request for comment.

“The deputy assistant director was recommended for criminal prosecution by the inspector general and the DOJ said ‘we’re not going to prosecute. They’re not going to prosecute or go after Mr. Comey,” Chaffetz said.

He went on to say, “And for somebody who is so senior within the Department of Justice, they know better and it wasn’t one mistake. This happened on multiple occasions. That’s why he [McCabe] was fired and there are a lot of us that believe he should be prosecuted.”

McCabe was recently hired as a paid contributor by CNN.

Joe Walsh Says Trump Is ‘Unfit’ to Be President. Some Say the Same About Him.,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Matt Stevens', 'Annie Karni']",08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/27/us/politics/joe-walsh-president-racist-tweets.html,"Mr. Walsh has not deleted his offending tweets, choosing instead to apologize for some of them. But his long, searchable trail means Mr. Walsh has spent the opening days of his campaign addressing his own record rather than mounting a coherent attack on Mr. Trump.

“I wouldn’t call myself a racist, but I would say, John, I’ve said racist things on Twitter,” Mr. Walsh said in an interview with the MSNBC host John Heilemann on Monday.

The difference between him and the president, Mr. Walsh said in an interview with ABC, is that Mr. Trump has “never apologized for anything he’s done or said.”

But asked by The Washington Post about a tweet in which he deployed an expletive used by Mr. Trump to describe Haiti, Mr. Walsh said that while his word choice was perhaps “a little too provocative,” he stood by his description.

Amid his media blitz, Mr. Walsh received bad news about his own radio broadcast. In a statement Monday, Salem Radio Network announced that it would exercise its right to cancel national distribution of Mr. Walsh’s radio program, effective in 30 days.

A company official said any broadcaster who becomes a bona fide candidate for office must leave the air or risk exposing stations to the Federal Communications Commission’s equal time provision, under which any other declared candidate could demand airtime equal to that afforded to Mr. Walsh.

Mr. Walsh has tried to portray himself as someone who experienced an awakening — a firebrand populist who contributed to a divisive climate that helped elect Mr. Trump, but who was now putting his own career on the line to atone for his role in the Trump ascendancy."
Homeland Security moves $155 million from FEMA disaster relief for immigration enforcement,https://www.cnn.com,"['Geneva Sands', 'Priscilla Alvarez']",08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/27/politics/fema-immigration-enforcement-dorian/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Trump administration plans to shift at least $155 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency disaster relief fund to support its policy of returning some migrants to Mexico.

The Department of Homeland Security has informed Congress it will reprogram and transfer $271 million in total to its immigration enforcement agency from elsewhere in the department, including the FEMA money, according to documents obtained by CNN.

The moves comes as Tropical Storm Dorian nears hurricane strength as it approaches Puerto Rico.

Last week, the administration announced its intention to hold migrant families indefinitely, aimed at scrapping a settlement that put a 20-day limit on family detention.

DHS notified Congress of its plan to reprogram and transfer funds from agencies over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, DHS' enforcement arm, on July 26, according to a DHS official. The department plans to transfer around $116 million for ICE detention beds, as well as transportation and deportation, the official said.

The department will not pull funds for detention beds from the US Secret Service, the Office of the Inspector General, and the Office of Intelligence and Analysis.

""In this case, this is a must-pay bill that needed to be addressed,"" said the official.

""We would not say that this is with no risk,"" said the official, who added that it was done in ways to ""minimize the risk"" to agencies that are losing funding.

FEMA said in a statement to CNN, ""This transfer of funds to support the border emergency will leave a remaining balance of $447 million in the DRF (Disaster Relief Fund) Base account. Based on DHS and FEMA's review of historical emergency spending from the DRF Base account, this amount will be sufficient to support operational needs and will not impact ongoing long-term recovery efforts across the country. The DRF Majors account, which provides funding for ongoing recovery efforts, including those supporting communities impacted by the 2017 disasters, has a current balance of approximately $27 billion and is not impacted by the reprogramming.""

It's not uncommon for departments, including DHS, to reprogram funds. DHS, in particular, has previously reprogrammed funds for detention beds, for example.

The reprogramming of money to Immigration and Customs Enforcement is sure to receive pushback from Democratic lawmakers who've criticized the agency.

In a letter to acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, Democratic Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard of California, chair of the House Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, opposed the reprogramming of funds, saying she had ""significant concerns about the intended use of funds"" and the shifting of funds from other components.

House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson said in a statement that the administration is ""flouting the law and Congressional intent to fund its extremist indefinite detention immigration policies.""

""Taking money away from TSA and from FEMA in the middle of hurricane season could have deadly consequences. Congress should work to undo the damage this Administration is continually doing to our homeland security infrastructure,"" the Mississippi Democrat added.

DHS plans to transfer $23.8 million from the Transportation Security Administration for immigration enforcement, according to a document obtained by CNN.

Earlier this year, funds for additional detention beds -- as the administration has repeatedly pushed for -- became a sticking point in appropriations negotiations.

Democrats argued that by allowing ICE to up the number of detention beds, the agency would have the capacity to pursue a broader population of undocumented immigrants, including those without criminal records. But Republicans view the number of detention beds as central to limiting the release of detained undocumented immigrants into the US as they await hearings.

In the end, the spending bill included funding for an average 45,274 detention beds per day, with the intent to return to 40,520 by the end of the fiscal year, which is the level funded in the last fiscal year, but short of the administration's request of 52,000 detention beds. The reprogramming of funds will up ICE's bed count to roughly 50,000.

In recent months, however, the agency has been consistently holding more people in detention: As of August 10, 55,530 people were in immigration detention, according to the agency.

The latest shift in funds will also pull more money from FEMA -- $3.4 million for detention efforts.

Additionally, $4.3 million will be transferred from DHS' cyber agency.

DHS resources have been stretched thin amid an influx of migrants at the southern border. So far this fiscal year, more than 760,000 migrants have been arrested for crossing the border illegally. Many of them turn themselves in to agents.

In May, the Trump administration asked Congress for $4.5 billion in emergency funding. The request included additional detention beds. That part of the request was not fulfilled."

Comey friend expects criminal charges against McCabe 'any day' now,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/comey-friend-expects-criminal-charges-against-mccabe-any-day-now,"A ""good friend"" of former FBI Director James Comey says he expects criminal charges against former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe any day now.

Benjamin Wittes, editor-in-chief of Lawfare, wrote in a blog post that he was shocked by a New York Times report Monday that revealed McCabe's lawyers met with top Justice Department officials in recent weeks.

""Such meetings generally take place when indictment is imminent; they happen when the government plans to bring charges,"" Wittes said on Tuesday. ""You should thus expect charges against McCabe to be forthcoming any day. And if such charges don’t happen, that doesn’t mean they weren’t planned but, rather, that some extrinsic event has intervened.""

McCabe’s lawyers met with Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, who will help make the call on whether to prosecute, and U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jessie Liu in two separate meetings last week. This indicates federal prosecutors are close to making a final decision on whether to indict McCabe, who is accused of lying to federal agents.

Wittes, an author and senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, said the report was ""shocking."" He argued that ""as best as I can tell, the facts available on the public record simply don’t support such charges."" Wittes also suggested the White House may be a factor because of a ""sustained campaign by President Trump demanding McCabe’s scalp."" Trump has repeatedly criticized McCabe, who authorized the investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.

Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired McCabe in March 2018, less than two days before he was set to retire, prompted by a DOJ inspector general report that found he misled Comey and investigators about leaks to the media regarding the Hillary Clinton emails investigation and an inquiry into the Clinton Foundation which had not yet been made public.

Comey, whom Trump fired in May 2017, says he did not give McCabe permission to leak that information to the media. Comey has yet to comment on the latest developments in the McCabe investigation.

McCabe's lawyers have called the inspector general's report ""deeply flawed,"" and McCabe, who was hired by CNN last week, sued the Justice Department in August, accusing Trump of forcing his subordinates to participate in an “unconstitutional plan and scheme” to have him fired. He is demanding back pay, his full pension, and for his record to be expunged.

Wittes said if prosecutors bring criminal charges against McCabe, which he views as excessive, they will have to overcome ""substantially mitigating factors,"" such as McCabe correcting the record after he misled investigators and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page telling a grand jury that McCabe was authorized in his position as deputy director to give information to the media and had no motive to lie.

Wittes admitted there could be ""evidence that is not public yet"" against McCabe. He also predicted that McCabe's defense will be that he was confused and under a lot of pressure, given the circumstances at the time.

Although Wittes said he will not rush to judgment, he expressed concern about assistant U.S. attorneys dropping off the case. He also said, ""I would be lying if I said that, as I look at it now, it all seems on the level to me. I worry that what’s happening here is simple corruption of the Department of Justice in precisely the fashion I have been worrying about since before Donald Trump was even elected."""
"Joe Walsh, Republican candidate challenging Trump, says he lost his radio show",https://www.cbsnews.com,"['Emily Tillett', 'Emily Tillett Is A Politics Reporter', 'Video Editor For Cbs News Digital', 'Stephanie Ramirez']",,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/joe-walsh-2020-republican-candidate-challenging-trump-says-he-lost-his-radio-show/,"Joe Walsh, the former congressman who's challenging President Trump in the Republican Party's presidential primary, said in a Monday night CNN interview that he lost his popular radio show and had just received notice before arriving to the studio for the sit-down. Walsh told CNN's John Berman that he expected the move because nearly ""80 to 90%"" of his audience supports the president.

""I am running for president. I oppose this president. Most of my listeners support the president,"" said Walsh. ""It's not an easy thing to do to be in conservative talk radio and oppose this president.""

The conservative had broadcast his show through Salem Radio Network. He also has a podcast connected to ""AM560 The Answer"" in Chicago. Salem told CBS in a statement on Tuesday that affiliates can continue to receive Walsh's program from a different syndicator ""to be selected by Joe Walsh"" after 30 days.

""This announcement does not affect Joe Walsh's local program airing on AM 560 The Answer in Chicago, however Walsh's program will have to be removed as soon as he becomes a viable and legal candidate for President,"" Salem added.

While he argued that that the 2020 race isn't about ""the issues,"" Walsh contended that he's running to the right of Mr. Trump and believes in strong immigration policies. Walsh said he does not agree with Mr. Trump's tax cut and would have given a greater tax cut to the middle class. When asked about the lack of policy plans on his campaign website, Walsh focused on the president.

""I'm running against Trump because he's morally unfit. Period. It's about Trump. It's not about the issues. It's about Trump,"" Walsh said. ""But on the issues, I believe in a wall. Trump hasn't built a wall. I believe in border security. Trump has botched the border. The border's a bigger mess now than it was when he got elected.""

Walsh announced his candidacy for president during an interview on ABC's ""This Week'"" on Sunday. Also in the race against Mr. Trump is Bill Weld, a former Massachusetts governor.

Walsh won a House seat from suburban Chicago in the 2010 tea party wave but lost reelection in 2012 and has since hosted his talk show.

Walsh attempted to distance himself from past incendiary comments and make the case that he's not Mr. Trump. Walsh instead said some of his past controversial statements were made because he believes in free speech and ""abhors"" political correctness.

He admitted to saying racist comments and added: ""I think we're all a little bit racist. We've all said racist things. I bet if you and I went through everybody's Twitter feeds, we're going to find things that are objectionable and offensive.""

Walsh said that with the lack of a radio show, he now intends to campaign ""full time"" against Mr. Trump."
"For Trump, keeping up the act must be exhausting",https://www.cnn.com,"[""Michael D'Antonio""]",08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/26/opinions/trump-g7-dantonio/index.html,"(CNN) The odd man out at the G7 gathering of the world's richest democracies, President Donald Trump cut a weary figure at a farewell press conference Monday, where he boosted the pariah Russian President Vladimir Putin, railed against Barack Obama, and once again bragged about the great relationship he and his wife, Melania, have with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.

In contrast, Emmanuel Macron emerged from the conference as an energetic leader who bypassed America to make a diplomatic outreach to Iran. The French President's deft conduct at the G7, which featured climate change as a main topic, was all the more notable because of Trump's clumsiness. As is his habit, Trump offered conflicting messages on the trade war he started with China, blamed his predecessors for the nation's troubles -- and failed to note that Melania Trump has never met Kim Jong Un.

Macron -- and the world -- are well aware of Trump's inability to work well with others. Indeed, at the last G7 Trump reneged on a commitment to affirm a pro-trade joint communique all the others had approved, and attacked the summit's host, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, personally, calling him ""very dishonest and weak.""

And so as Macron planned to host this year's meeting, he decided there would be no communique at all to organize the proceedings, depriving Trump of the chance to repeat his skunk-in-the garden-party trick.

The French leader matched this defensive decision -- which freed him to set a more unpredictable agenda -- with an offense move of his own. To the surprise of many, he welcomed Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif to Biarritz on Sunday, opening the door for him to discuss trade security with his counterparts.

France was one of the six countries that signed a deal that froze Iran's nuclear weapons program in 2015. (The others were the United Kingdom, Russia, France, China, Germany and the US). Under intense monitoring, Iran complied with its part of the bargain and received, in turn, more favorable trading arrangements with the rest of the world. However, Trump regards Iran as an enemy -- and the agreement was devised by Obama (also a Trump enemy). He alienated the other signatories by abandoning the agreement last year.

Trump did not meet with Zarif in Biarritz, but Macron's move appeared to coax him into a more conciliatory posture toward Iran.

While Macron was deftly circumventing him on Iran, Trump was also outplayed by his erstwhile buddy Boris Johnson on the issue of climate change. Regarded by some as Britain's version of Trump, Prime Minister Johnson glad-handed his American counterpart, but reminded the world that he disagrees with the President on climate change. Johnson expressed concern about threats to biodiversity and he actually attended the G7 session on climate change, which Trump skipped.

The insult evident in Trump's absence from that meeting was amplified by the deceptive explanation offered for his failure to attend. According to the White House press secretary, ""The President had scheduled meetings and bilaterals with Germany and India, so a senior member of the Administration attended in his stead."" In fact, the two leaders who supposedly kept Trump away were in their assigned chairs at the climate session. All anyone had to do to determine the truthfulness of the Trump claim was check a photo of the meeting, which circulated widely in the press.

A telling photo also seemed to reveal Justin Trudeau practicing a little gamesmanship with First Lady Melania Trump. Thanks to the angle of Trudeau's approach as he greeted the First Lady, cameras appear to have caught Mrs. Trump about to plant a big kiss on the movie-star-handsome Trudeau. In fact, it was only an air kiss, but the internet was ablaze with commentary about the apparently smitten look on Melania Trump's face.

JUST WATCHED Trump and Iranian president open to meeting Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump and Iranian president open to meeting 03:45

Petty as it may seem -- and much of what is being said on social media about Trudeau and the First Lady is petty -- it's no surprise to see so much attention focused on the possible signals in photos. Much of the world is exhausted by President Trump's behavior and his attention seeking.

During the G7, China's foreign ministry joined the pushback against Trump, pouring cold water on the President's claim that recent contacts between Beijing and the administration suggested progress in the trade war Trump started. ""We've gotten two calls,"" over the weekend, Trump said on Monday. ""They want to be able to make a deal."" But a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry told a news briefing: ""Regarding the phone call in the weekend, I am not aware of that.""

Like the Chinese, the G7 leaders seem to have figured out Trump's methods, and have devised ways to quietly cope with them. Trump likes to present himself as a unique, even heroic figure who can do things others cannot. In Biarritz he even suggested that if he -- and not Barack Obama -- had been president when Russia invaded Crimea, it would have been stopped. He also vehemently urged leaders to bring Vladimir Putin, who was exiled from what was once the G8 because of his aggression, back into the great nations' club.

No other members of the group have proposed bringing Russia back into the fold, and as he suggested it -- and they resisted -- Trump underlined his isolated status.

Indeed, weak as the President seemed in contrast with Macron, his cravenly self-interested comments at the Monday press conference highlighted his scant relevance to the proceedings.

He added a parting shot of venality as he prepared to leave Biarritz: Asked about next year's G7, he launched into a marketing pitch for the session to be held at his Doral resort in Florida where, he said, the acreage would provide lots of parking. He followed with an odd reference to the money he thinks he's lost while serving as President of the United States and not the chief executive of the Trump Organization.

""Probably it will cost me anywhere from $3 to $5 billion to be President,"" said Trump, citing the example of lost income from public speaking. ""I used to get a lot of money to make speeches, now I give speeches all the time. You know what I get? Zippo.""

Trump softened the complaint -- which he brought up himself -- by suggesting that he doesn't care about the lost money.

His bragging about Doral, along with his disrespectful absence from the climate change session, served only to draw attention to how much he deviates from accepted norms. Trump may still think he's a leader of mythic proportions, but every day it seems more clear that he's only a hero in his own mind."
Trump lawyers ask Supreme Court to allow asylum rule during appeal,https://www.channel3000.com,['Priscilla Alvarez'],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.channel3000.com/news/politics/national-politics/trump-lawyers-ask-supreme-court-to-allow-asylum-rule-during-appeal/1113580145,"Getty Images Immigrant asylum seekers wait at a bus station after being released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ), on Nov. 1, 2018, in McAllen, Texas.

Getty Images Immigrant asylum seekers wait at a bus station after being released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ), on Nov. 1, 2018, in McAllen, Texas.

WASHINGTON (CNN) - The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to allow a rule limiting asylum claims to go into effect nationwide while a lower court ruling blocking it is appealed.

A federal judge had blocked the Trump administration rule, which dramatically limits the ability of Central American migrants to claim asylum if they enter the US by land through Mexico, nationwide. Earlier this month, the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals dialed back the nationwide injunction, saying that it can only apply to migrants claiming asylum in California and Arizona, states that fall under the Ninth Circuit's jurisdiction.

In its filing Monday, the administration laid out its case for the rule, arguing that, among other things, it ""alleviates a crushing burden on the US asylum system"" and deters migrants from coming to the US.

""The injunction now in effect is deeply flawed and should be stayed pending appeal and pending any further proceedings in this Court,"" the filing reads.

The Trump administration has rolled out a slew of policies in recent weeks to try to curb migration to the United States amid high border apprehension numbers. The solicitor general acknowledged the uptick in illegal border crossings in Monday's filing.

The rule, which was issued from the departments of Justice and Homeland Security in July, would prohibit migrants who have resided in or traveled through a third country from seeking asylum in the US, therefore barring migrants traveling through Mexico from being able to claim asylum. The result would be a severe limiting of who's eligible for asylum.

Immigrant advocacy groups have claimed the rule is unlawful and leaves migrants in harm's way.

In his July ruling, US District Judge Jon Tigar, a Barack Obama nominee, in the US District Court for the Northern District of California, wrote, ""This new rule is likely invalid because it is inconsistent with the existing asylum laws.""

""An injunction,"" Tigar added, ""would vindicate the public's interest -- which our existing immigration laws clearly articulate -- in ensuring that we do not deliver aliens into the hands of their persecutors.""

The US District Court for the Northern District of California will hold a hearing in early September.

I think John's point is right. Abdication is a word I have used. Essentially the United States has gone from being the principal architect and general contractor of world order to now becoming the principal disruptor. The problem for the Europeans and the Japanese and others is they lack the capacity to subjects duty substitute for us. They do what they can. $20 million for Amazon fires which is a literal drop in the bucket. Without the United States in the driver's seat, we don't make a lot of progress. The gap between the challenges and the international responses is growing. That's the historical judgment about the G-7, which looks like a tired gathering.



I think the two immediate things I would highlight are the president walked back two big issues. The trade war, for the moment, with China and the threat of actual war with Iran. On both of those, I think there was a change from where he showed up in France and where he ended."
Trump to nominate Antonin Scalia’s son to lead Labor Department,https://nypost.com,['August'],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://nypost.com/2019/08/27/trump-to-nominate-antonin-scalias-son-to-lead-labor-department/,"President Trump confirmed Tuesday that he plans to nominate Eugene Scalia — son of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia — to head up the Department of Labor.

The 56-year-old Virginia resident is a partner at the law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, and from 1992 to 1993 served under then- and current Attorney General Bill Barr.

Scalia has a decades-long record of challenging Labor Department and other federal regulations, winning praise from business interests but condemnation from unions and other labor advocates.

Trump first floated his name in mid-July less than a week after his previous secretary, Alexander Acosta, said he would resign amid renewed criticism of how he handled a 2008 secret plea deal with wealthy financier Jeffrey Epstein as a federal prosecutor in Florida.

Scalia, 55, served for a year as the Labor Department’s top lawyer, its solicitor, during George W. Bush’s administration.

But most of his career has been spent as a partner in the Washington office of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, where he has run up a string of victories in court cases on behalf of business interests challenging labor and financial regulations.

“Suing the Government? Call Scalia!” was the headline on a 2012 profile by Bloomberg.

When Bush nominated Scalia as the Labor Department solicitor, unions howled in protest and Senate Democrats refused to hold a confirmation vote.

Bush gave him a temporary, recess appointment to the job.

Even with strong Democratic opposition again, he has a clear path to confirmation in a Senate controlled by Republicans and stripped of the procedural requirement that nominees need 60 votes to proceed.

Scalia received his undergraduate degree from the University of Virginia and his law degree from the University of Chicago Law School, where he served as editor-in-chief of the University of Chicago Law Review.

However, as we’ve learned, stability in the cryptocurrency market doesn’t last long. According to Google Trends, interest in Bitcoin has been declining since 2017. Looking at data from recent months, we can even identify a trend similar to that of early 2017.

Still, the question remains – where did the money that catalyzed Bitcoin’s surge in 2019 come from? Rumors and internet conspiracies circulate, suggesting that inside information leaked from Facebook about the launch of its Libra cryptocurrency and created a trend change before the announcement and the associated hype.

When it comes to altcoins, the downtrend seems to have been halted this week as Binance announced the launch of a digital currency lending system, with its first two products being BNB and USDT. Surprisingly, users will be able to lend ETC, which explains its price increase. Wanchain also stood out this week, gaining more than 100% and occupying the 88th spot on the list of the top 100 cryptocurrencies.

Nevertheless, Bitcoin has maintained its dominance, and it’s still too early to talk about a change in the trend with respect to the altcoin markets, as Bitcoin hasn’t yet completed its move which began at the beginning of the year.

The trading volume is declining, and investors fear this trend will continue. Of course, there may also be those who are already plotting another move behind the scenes. Events such as Telegram’s coin launch, a recession, or the Bitcoin halving could certainly send Bitcoin’s price to new heights. The future won’t be boring, that’s for sure.

Meanwhile, the Kleiman v. Wright case is also seemingly coming to an end, as a judge ruled against Wright, who might have to pay 500,000 BTC to the brother of an old business partner. The sum is currently worth upwards of $5 billion, and almost half of that might need to be used to pay taxes, which could impact Bitcoin’s price in the short term.

Brighton water treatment plant out of compliance with EPA standards for 3 consecutive years,https://www.thedenverchannel.com,[],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/brighton-in-violation-of-epa-drinking-water-standards-for-3-consecutive-years-according-to-report,"BRIGHTON, Colo. -- We knew the water in Brighton was expensive, now - it turns out - it could be dangerous, too.

The same city that could see its mayor recalled over sky-high water bills now admits it was out of compliance with EPA water treatment standards for 3 years.

The water scandal continues to mystify even some who sit on the current council.

""The residents don't trust the city,"" said councilman Matt Johnston. ""I, as a city council representative, do not trust our city.""

The latest issue to surface is an EPA summary which concludes Brighton had ""Significant/Category 1"" violations for 12 consecutive quarters.

A city spokeswoman said late Monday those violations are for treated discharge that goes back into the river, not the drinking water.

But, Brighton's former city manager said late Monday that the reverse osmosis treatment facility also supplies Brighton with drinking water, so any violation at the plant should be concerning.

""Someone's at serious risk if the plant is that out of compliance,"" said former city manager Philip Rodriguez, who was fired in the midst of this scandal back in July. ""Either Brighton or its neighbors downstream.""

The city told Denver7 on Tuesday those issues were resolved and the treatment facility is now in compliance.

""We cannot say that 100% for sure all of our water is safe,"" Johnston said. ""We can't say that.""

And, in fact, just last week the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment required Brighton to send a letter to residents warning them about a dangerous back flow issue that could impact the drinking water supply.

For homeowner's like Jeremy Torgerson, it's mind-boggling.

""You don't want to cook with it, give it to your kids, your dog or anything,"" Torgerson said. ""I don't know how many more punches the residents have to take from their own city before we finally decide that we've had enough.""

The ongoing scandal has resulted in a flood of problems at city hall including the discovery of a $70 million fund from possible water billing overcharges and the subsequent firing of the city manager.

And now – there will be a recall election of the current mayor who insists the water is safe.

""The water here in Brighton is safe,"" said Mayor Ken Kreutzer. ""I drink it. My children drink it. My grandson drinks it. This is another gross exaggeration.""

But Johnston and others, like Torgerson, are no longer going with the flow. They insist city hall is corrupt.

""I'm tired of the backroom,"" Johnston said. ""It's time for the public to know everything about our water system - if it's safe, if it's clean, where the money's at and what it's being spent for.""

And while the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment hasn't issued a boil order, Johnston believes it's only a matter of time.

""This is a pre-boil warning type of scenario,"" Johnston said.

""The city government no longer functions,"" Torgerson said. ""This a basic function of a utility department to make sure the water that goes out is safe. They overcharge, and now we have to drink bottled water.""

Johnston says those who are sick should be particularly cautious.

""They're going through chemotherapy, and they do not know if they should be boiling their water at this point,"" Johnston said."
Weill Family Foundation announces public-private partnership with Energy Department on artificial intelligence,https://www.cnbc.com,['Riya Bhattacharjee'],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/26/weill-foundation-announces-public-private-partnership-with-dept-of-energy-on-artificial-intelligence.html,"The Department of Energy and the Weill Family Foundation on Monday signed a memorandum of understanding for a new public-private partnership which will use the agency's artificial intelligence capabilities for biomedical research.

Former Citigroup CEO Sandy Weill and Energy Secretary Rick Perry told CNBC's ""Closing Bell "" in an exclusive interview that the partnership aims to improve the diagnosis of brain diseases and neurological disorders, which would result in more effective treatment.

""As one looks at science and the development of new science, especially AI and computing, you really need to have partners to make things work."" Weill said. ""It's too expensive for anybody to try to do it by themselves.""

The partnership between the federal government and the Weill Family Foundation, involves Lawrence Livermore, Lawrence Berkeley and Argonne National laboratories, and was announced during a roundtable on DOE-fueled artificial intelligence at Lawrence Livermore Lab in Livermore, California.

The Department of Energy is currently home to the fastest supercomputers in the world.

The partnership aims to have new computers ready by 2022 that would run 15 times faster than current speeds.

""It will really break the logjam, especially as it related to neurodegenerative diseases,"" Weill said. ""And with everybody doing better, with the cancer research and with cardiovascular research, people are going to live longer. And we are all going to get these neurodegenerative diseases over time. And what we are working on is to prevent that because it would just be too costly.""

Perry said in the next 18 to 24 months, the department will have computers coming on board that will be between 50 to 100 times faster than today's computers. ""The improvement in health care, particularly in brain science, is going to be monumental, it's going to be world changing,"" Perry said.

Weill added it was important for the U.S. to beat China in this field.

When asked about current U.S.-China trade relations, Weill said it was important for the United States and China to figure out a way to get along with each other. ""With the two countries partnering for the future, I think we will end up with a better world, a safer world."""
Lisa Page could save Andrew McCabe from DOJ criminal charges,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/lisa-page-could-save-andrew-mccabe-from-doj-criminal-charges,"Former FBI lawyer Lisa Page could hinder a criminal case against former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe if the Justice Department decides to bring charges against him.

Federal prosecutors are close to making a final decision on whether to indict McCabe, who is accused of lying to federal agents, the New York Times reported Monday.

McCabe’s lawyers met with Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, who will help make the call on whether to prosecute, and U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia Jessie Liu in two separate meetings last week. This signals McCabe’s lawyers could be making a last-ditch effort to convince the top law enforcement officials not to prosecute the case.

If they were to bring charges against McCabe, prosecutors would have to prove he knowingly and intentionally lied to investigators when he told them on two occasions that he did not remember authorizing Page to speak to a Wall Street Journal reporter. McCabe corrected himself at a later time.

Page, who worked as a special counsel to McCabe, told a grand jury in Washington, D.C., that McCabe was authorized in his position as deputy director to give information to the media and had no motive to lie. Page resigned from the bureau last year after it was discovered she had exchanged anti-Trump text messages with former FBI agent Peter Strzok, with whom she had an affair.

Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired McCabe in March 2018, less than two days before he was set to retire. This followed Michael Horowitz, DOJ’s inspector general, releasing a report in February 2018 detailing instances where McCabe “lacked candor” with then-FBI Director James Comey and investigators and concluded McCabe greenlit disclosures to the media of sensitive information on an FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation “to make himself look good.”

McCabe's lawyers called the inspector general's report ""deeply flawed.""

Comey has said he did not give McCabe permission to leak, and when Sessions fired McCabe he stated the deputy director “made an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor — including under oath — on multiple occasions.”

McCabe, who was hired by CNN last week, sued in August, accusing Trump of forcing his subordinates at the Justice Department to participate in an “unconstitutional plan and scheme” to have him fired, and is demanding back pay, his full pension, and for his record to be expunged. Trump has accused McCabe, who authorized the investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, of being involved in an ""illegal and treasonous"" plot against him.

Neither DOJ nor McCabe’s attorney immediately responded to the Washington Examiner’s requests for comment.

The investigation into McCabe has been lengthy — so long, in fact, the Times reported the term expired for grand jury hearing evidence. It began last year after Horowitz referred his findings to the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington for possible criminal charges. Frustrated with the prolonged process, DOJ prosecutor Kamil Shields left the case and joined a private practice. Another assistant U.S. attorney, David Kent, is also no longer on the case.

McCabe is also likely still being scrutinized in Horowitz’s inquiry into allegations of abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The surveillance warrant applications targeting Trump associate Carter Page required the approval of top members of the FBI and DOJ, and McCabe was involved in the FISA approval process.

Horowitz’s report is expected to be released to the public in late September or early October."
Trump's North Korea point man gets a look for No. 2 State Dept. job,https://www.politico.com,"['Daniel Lippman', 'Eliana Johnson']",08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/26/biegun-north-korea-state-dept-1475896,"Special Envoy for North Korea Steve Biegun is being seriously considered to replace deputy secretary of state John Sullivan. | Jeon Heon-Kyun/Getty Images foreign policy Trump's North Korea point man gets a look for No. 2 State Dept. job Taking the deputy secretary position would leave the president without a dedicated envoy to Kim Jong Un.

Steve Biegun, President Trump’s special representative for North Korea, is being seriously considered for the No. 2 job at the State Department, according to two senior administration officials with knowledge of the matter.

The post looks like it’s going to open up soon because the current deputy secretary of state John Sullivan, who met with Trump in the Oval Office last week, is likely to get nominated in the coming weeks to be the U.S. ambassador to Russia, replacing Jon Huntsman, who leaves his post in early October.

Story Continued Below

While it’s early in the selection process for the job, multiple officials said that Biegun, a former auto executive who has been the point man on working-level negotiations with the North Korean regime, is a strong candidate.

Biegun, whose background before the North Korean job was in Russia policy, had also been considered to replace Huntsman and has talked to Trump about being an ambassador. He also reportedly turned down the Russia job.

“It’s good to have someone who is already in the system,” said a senior administration official. “They understand how the process goes. They already have a security clearance.” The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

“The whole building is vying for the job,” according to another senior administration official. One of the contenders could include Brian Bulatao, the undersecretary of state for management, who was chief operating officer of the CIA when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was CIA director, according to a former senior State Department official. Bulatao didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

It could take a while for Sullivan to get confirmed if and when he’s officially selected, since confirming judicial nominees is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s priority, which leads to occasional delays for executive branch nominees. Russia also is likely to take at least two months to approve the U.S. picking Sullivan, a diplomatic protocol known as “agrément.”

Trump has resisted acknowledging that his talks with Kim Jong Un have made little headway, and has sought a third summit with the North Korean leader.

He told reporters at the G7 in France on Monday that Kim “is a man with a country that has tremendous potential.” He had said that he was “not happy” about North Korea’s recent missile tests, which his own national security adviser has said violate U.N. Security Council resolutions.

There has also been some rather public daylight between Biegun and Trump on the progress the U.S. has made in negotiating with North Korea. While Trump bragged last year that there wasn’t a nuclear threat from North Korea anymore, Biegun said earlier this year at Stanford that “it is fair to say we have more work ahead of us than behind us.”

With few signs of any coming breakthroughs with North Korea, Biegun has recently shown signs of wanting to leave his current job. He’s been telling associates he was eager to move on from the envoy post and felt it was a thankless job, according to three people familiar with his comments.

In his job as Trump’s North Korea envoy, Biegun has had difficulty getting meetings with top North Korean officials to advance U.S. goals of denuclearization.

“Not having the North Koreans meet with you and the North Koreans only want to meet with the president is pretty frustrating,” said one Republican foreign policy hand who knows Biegun. “And negotiating with the North Koreans is hopeless. They just want to meet at the presidential level so there’s no real meetings at his level.”

It’s not clear whether Biegun would actually take the deputy job if Trump offers it. He has also told people that he is tired of serving in government and is eager to return to the private sector.

The State Department, meanwhile, is fending off twin challenges: a president whose sudden pronouncements can rewrite policy in mere seconds; and a budget that is constantly under the threat of severe cuts under Trump.

“How are you supposed to come to work and to be a serious professional when you don’t know what’s coming tomorrow?” said another Republican involved in foreign policy in Washington. “Even Pompeo doesn’t know the crazy thing Trump is going to say the next day and it’s really hard to engage with people in the White House” who don’t know what Trump is going to do either.

Weighing against this chaos factor: If Biegun is picked for the deputy job, there’s a possibility he could eventually become the acting secretary of state should Pompeo leave to run for a Senate seat in his home state of Kansas.

Biegun served as executive secretary of the National Security Council in the Bush administration and also had a brief stint as foreign policy adviser to Sarah Palin when she was John McCain’s vice presidential nominee.

Before joining the Trump administration, he worked as the vice president of international governmental affairs at Ford. After H.R. McMaster left as Trump’s national security adviser, Biegun was considered for that job before John Bolton was picked.

Traditionally, the deputy secretary of state position is tasked with managing the State Department’s 69,000 employees, but also usually carves out select foreign policy portfolios of his or her own.

Sullivan, for instance, has focused on a few key issues, including implementing the sanctions against Russia, leading the administration’s diplomatic response to the gas attacks and barrel bombings in Syria, and guiding the Trump team’s efforts to stabilize South Sudan.

Trump told reporters last week that Sullivan “could very well be” picked as the ambassador to Russia and that Pompeo “likes him very much.”

As for Biegun’s suitability for the job, “It’s a really tough and challenging role but I think Steve would be really excellent at it, just because of his work ethic, his style, his intelligence,” another former senior State Department official said. “I’ve always found Steve to be fair.”

Biegun didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

His departure would leave the North Korea envoy role empty -- but Trump has shown few signs of leaning on Biegun in any event.

On Monday, the president said that his wife, First Lady Melania Trump, has also gotten to know Kim Jong Un. That left Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, to quickly clarify Trump’s comments.

“President Trump confides in his wife on many issues including the detailed elements of his strong relationship with Chairman Kim,” she said in a statement. “And while the first lady hasn’t met him, the president feels like she’s gotten to know him too.”

Trump still hasn't realized that being president restricts what you should say and do,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/trump-still-hasnt-realized-that-being-president-restricts-what-you-should-say-or-do,"As the Washington Examiner argues in an editorial, it would be unethical and ill-advised to host next year's G-7 Summit at President Trump's Doral resort. But the fact that Trump has been making the pitch not only signals a willingness to personally enrich himself through the office of the presidency, but also gets at a much deeper problem.

Since taking office, Trump has never been able to grasp that being president, in addition to coming with new powers, also comes with certain restrictions about what he should say or do. There are statements and actions that may be acceptable or even innocuous outside the context of being commander in chief that become wildly inappropriate when done by a president. This has been a central problem in many of the controversies that have consumed his presidency.

His business actions and aggressive pitches of his properties can create conflicts of interest. His rant about ""disloyal Jews"" has much more weight coming as a president with an influential following. His regular Twitter tantrums aren't the same as when he was a private citizen; they can move markets and uproot our nation's foreign policy.

Regardless of whether one believes the actions outlined in Robert Mueller's report amount to obstruction of justice, it's clear that he would have had significantly less to work with had Trump recognized that as president, his words have more serious ramifications. His chat with James Comey about ""loyalty"" and his tweets about witnesses, among other actions, were clearly improper even if one doesn't believe they were illegal.

As he enters the 2020 election, his biggest vulnerability may be his utter inability to grasp the gravity of the office — specifically, the ways in which it limits what you can say or do."
Department of Energy Announces $21.4 Million for Quantum Information Science Research,https://www.energy.gov,[],,,,https://www.energy.gov/articles/department-energy-announces-214-million-quantum-information-science-research,"WASHINGTON, D.C.—Today, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced $21.4 million in funding for research in Quantum Information Science (QIS) related to both particle physics and fusion energy sciences.

“QIS holds great promise for tackling challenging questions in a wide range of disciplines,” said Under Secretary for Science Paul Dabbar. “This research will open up important new avenues of investigation in areas like artificial intelligence while helping keep American science on the cutting edge of the growing field of QIS.”

Funding of $12 million will be provided for 21 projects of two to three years’ duration in particle physics. Efforts will range from the development of highly sensitive quantum sensors for the detection of rare particles, to the use of quantum computing to analyze particle physics data, to quantum simulation experiments connecting the cosmos to quantum systems.

Funding of $9.4 million will be provided for six projects of up to three years in duration in fusion energy sciences. Research will examine the application of quantum computing to fusion and plasma science, the use of plasma science techniques for quantum sensing, and the quantum behavior of matter under high-energy-density conditions, among other topics.

Fiscal Year 2019 funding for the two initiatives totals $18.4 million, with out-year funding for the three-year particle physics projects contingent on congressional appropriations.

Projects were selected by competitive peer review under two separate Funding Opportunity Announcements (and corresponding announcements for DOE laboratories) sponsored respectively by the Office of High Energy Physics and the Office of Fusion Energy Sciences with the Department’s Office of Science.

A list of particle physics projects can be found here and fusion energy sciences projects here, both under the heading “What’s New.”

"A recession in 2020 would hurt Trump, but it wouldn't necessarily sink his reelection",https://www.cnbc.com,['Jacob Pramuk'],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/27/recession-would-likely-hurt-trump-in-2020-but-he-could-still-win.html,"President Donald Trump answers questions from reporters as he meets with Romania's President Klaus Iohannis in the Oval Office of the White House In Washington. August 20, 2019. Kevin Lamarque | Reuters

Fears about a flagging economy have jumped to the top of President Donald Trump's mind. As unusual bond market moves have prompted concerns about looming economic trouble, the president said ""we are very far from a recession."" Trump has pointed to a ""strong"" U.S. economy — the strongest in the world, he says — held back from soaring growth only by what he calls a ""clueless"" Federal Reserve and a news media hellbent on feeding the narrative of a downturn. At the G-7 meetings in France this weekend, he proclaimed the U.S. economy is ""the talk of the world!"" Trump has reason to fret. He has built his argument for reelection on American prosperity. His hopes for winning the race may hinge in no small part on stopping the U.S. from tumbling into a recession before November 2020.

Only two presidents since World War II — Democrats Harry Truman and Jimmy Carter — have run for reelection in the same year as a recession. While Truman won and Carter lost, history suggests an economic slump would damage Trump's chances in what will already be a tough 2020 race. Incumbents have a harder time winning amid a down economy because they need to find other issues to draw voters, said Lynn Vavreck, an American politics and public policy professor at UCLA. Trump is ""better positioned than most"" to withstand a slowdown because he ran on identity-focused issues like immigration in 2016, ""but without a good economy it will be harder for him to swing marginal voters,"" she said. Metrics such as the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index help track consumers views' on and expectations for the economy. The metric typically plummets during recessions. Over the survey's history back to the mid-20th century, it has ""largely"" found that ""if the index is low, the incumbent doesn't get reelected,"" said Richard Curtin, director of surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan. Recession fears climbed this month for a variety of reasons. Trade tensions with China exploded Friday: Trump said U.S. companies are ""hereby ordered"" to find an alternative to operating in the country, and the Trump administration hiked tariff rates on Chinese goods. A day earlier, a key indicator found the manufacturing sector contracted for the first time in 10 years, adding to concerns about the economy. Meanwhile, corporate profit growth has proven sluggish — though not as bad as some had feared. Trump may not need to worry just yet. Though some early warning signs of a slowdown have emerged, history suggests it could take until after the election in 2021 for a recession to hit. U.S. gross domestic product rose a solid 2.1% in the second quarter. On Wednesday, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected long-term growth of 1.8%, even though it expects Trump's trade conflicts to drag on economic growth. While 1.8% growth is lower than the long-term U.S. historical average, it would comfortably keep the U.S. ahead of a recession. Uncertainty created by the Trump administration's trade war with China helped to send consumer sentiment lower in August to a level not seen since the beginning of the year, but it still sits well above levels typically seen during recessions. The current sentiment reading would suggest a good case for reelection for an incumbent president, Curtin said.

He notes that Trump's presidency has thrown out some traditional expectations for how voters will react to a president's first term. For instance, views on the economy have become more partisan: Democrats are less likely to have positive feelings about the economy while Trump is in office than they were when Republican President Ronald Reagan was in the White House. Despite the economy's solid standing now, parts of Wall Street see a rising risk of a recession in the next year. Since the possibility has vexed Trump, CNBC looked back at how other presidents fared while running for reelection under the shadow of a recession.

Truman triumphs, Carter falters

U.S. presidents have rarely run for reelection during a full blown recession since the mid-20th century. Truman was the first president after World War II to run for a second term during a recession. He did not actually win a first election — he started 1945 as President Franklin Roosevelt's vice president before taking over when the president died only three months into his fourth term.

History best remembers Truman's 1948 victory for the photo of him gleefully holding up a Chicago Daily Tribune newspaper with the headline ""DEWEY DEFEATS TRUMAN"" — a projection based on the conventional wisdom that Republican New York Gov. Thomas Dewey would beat him. The result is also significant because he won easily despite a recession. The downturn's timing may explain Truman's success. It did not hit until November 1948, the month of the election, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. Not only did Truman comfortably win another term in the White House, but also his Democratic Party flipped control of both chambers of Congress. It gained 75 House seats and nine Senate seats. Carter did not have the same luck. The brief recession during his reelection year of 1980 started in January and ended in July — four months before Americans cast their ballots, according to NBER. It followed the 1979 energy crisis, when oil prices spiked and panic about the availability of gasoline spread in the U.S. Carter had encouraged Americans to live more modestly, a push Reagan targeted during his campaign. Republican Reagan trounced Carter, who won only six states. At the same time, the GOP gained more than 30 House seats and a dozen Senate seats. A few factors could explain why an election-year recession appeared to hurt Carter and not Truman. Due to how the government reports economic data, it can take months after a recession starts to confirm it. Voters also may not feel the effects of job losses or lower wages — or a recovery on the other end — until later. In Truman's case, Americans may not have known the recession started when they cast their ballots. When Carter stood for a second term, they may have had no idea that it ended.

The outlet obtained a copy of a contract signed by Barr for a “Family Holiday Party” in the hotel’s Presidential Ballroom on Dec. 8.

Barr is paying for the venue himself.

He chose the Trump Hotel only after other hotels, including the Willard and the Mayflower, were booked, a Department of Justice (DOJ) official told the Post.

Barr reportedly holds the party annually, although this is the first time it will be at a Trump hotel.

“Career ethics officials were consulted, and they determined that ethics rules did not prohibit him from hosting his annual party at the Trump hotel,” the DOJ official said.

Barr's party at the hotel is the latest in a string of connections between the administration and Trump's businesses.

Trump does not directly run the Trump Organization, which he put into a trust controlled by his adult sons when he entered office in 2017, but he still benefits financially from its holdings.

Earlier this week, Trump suggested the U.S. could host world leaders at his golf resort outside Miami for next year's Group of Seven summit, which his critics argue would be a clear violation of the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause.

The DOJ and Trump Organization did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Barr's holiday party from The Hill. The White House directed The Hill's inquiry to the DOJ."

The announcement came in an internal email to select State Department officials on Monday morning, according to one of those officials.

Berkowitz, who has taught both constitutional law and political philosophy, came to the State Department from Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. He is the author of four books on subjects ranging from conservatism and progressivism to the ethics of Nietzsche.

Under former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the Department of Policy Planning — which has historically operated as the State Department’s internal think tank — played a key role in the day-to-day management of the department.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who works closely with a team of special envoys, has returned it to its traditional role of churning out papers and proposals on long-range strategic issues.

Department of Energy awards Fermilab $3.5 million for quantum science,https://news.fnal.gov,[],,,,https://news.fnal.gov/2019/08/department-of-energy-awards-fermilab-3-5-million-for-quantum-science/,"The U.S. Department of Energy has awarded researchers at its Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory more than $3.5 million to boost research in the fast-emerging field of Quantum Information Science.

“Few pursuits have the revolutionary potential that quantum science presents,” said Fermilab Chief Research Officer Joe Lykken. “Fermilab’s expertise in quantum physics and cryogenic engineering is world-class, and combined with our experience in conventional computing and networks, we can advance quantum science in directions that not many other places can.”

As part of a number of grants to national laboratories and universities offered through its Quantum Information Science-Enabled Discovery (QuantISED) program, DOE’s recent round of funding to Fermilab covers three initiatives related to quantum science. It also funds Fermilab’s participation in a fourth initiative led by Argonne National Laboratory.

For a half-century, Fermilab researchers have closely studied the quantum realm and provided the computational and engineering capabilties needed to zoom in on nature at its most fundamental level. The projects announced by the Department of Energy will build on those capabilities, pushing quantum science and technology forward and leading to new discoveries that will enhance our picture of the universe at its smallest scale.

“Fermilab is well-versed in engineering, algorithmic development and recruiting massive computational resources to explore quantum-scale phenomena,” said Fermilab Head of Quantum Science Panagiotis Spentzouris. “Now we’re wrangling those competencies and capabilities to advance quantum science in many areas, and in a way that only a leading physics laboratory could.”

The Fermilab-led initiatives funded through these DOE QuantISED grants are:

Large Scale Simulations of Quantum Systems on High-Performance Computing with Analytics for High-Energy Physics Algorithms

Lead principal investigator: Adam Lyon, Fermilab

The large-scale simulation of quantum computers has plenty in common with simulations in high-energy physics: Both must sweep over a large number of variables. Both organize their inputs and outputs similarly. And in both cases, the simulation has to be analyzed and consolidated into results. Fermilab scientists, in collaboration with scientists at Argonne National Laboratory, will use tools from high-energy physics to produce and analyze simulations using high-performance computers at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. Specifically, they will simulate the operation of a qubit device that uses superconducting cavities (which are also used as components in particle accelerators) to maintain quantum information over a relatively long time. Their results will determine the device’s impact on high-energy physics algorithms using an Argonne-developed quantum simulator.

Partner institution: Argonne National Laboratory

Research Technology for Quantum Information Systems

Lead principal investigator: Gustavo Cancelo, Fermilab

One of the main challenges in quantum information science is designing an architecture that solves problems of massive interconnection, massive data processing and heat load. The electronics must be able to operate and interface with other electronics operating both at 4 kelvins and at near absolute zero. Fermilab scientists and engineers are designing novel electronic circuits as well as massive control and readout electronics to be compatible with quantum devices, such as sensors and quantum qubits. These circuits will enable many applications in the quantum information science field.

Partner institutions: Argonne National Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Chicago

MAGIS-100 – co-led by Stanford University and Fermilab

Lead Fermilab principal investigator: Rob Plunkett

Fermilab will host a new experiment to test quantum mechanics on macroscopic scales of space and time. Scientists on the MAGIS-100 experiment will drop clouds of ultracold atoms down a 100-meter-long vacuum pipe on the Fermilab site, and use a stable laser to create an atom interferometer which will look for dark matter made of ultralightweight particles. They will also advance a technique for gravitational-wave detection at relatively low frequencies.

This is a joint venture under the collaboration leadership of Stanford University Professor Jason Hogan, who is funded by grant GBMF7945 from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. Rob Plunkett of Fermilab serves as the project manager.

Other participating institutions: Northern Illinois University, Northwestern University, Stanford University, Johns Hopkins University, University of Liverpool

Fermilab was also funded to participate in another initiative led by Argonne National Laboratory:

Quantum Sensors for Wide Band Axion Dark Matter Detection

Lead principal investigator: Peter Barry, Argonne

Researchers are searching high and low for dark matter, the mysterious substance that makes up a quarter of our universe. One theory proposes that it could be made of particles called axions, which would signal their presence by converting into particles of light, called photons. Fermilab researchers are part of a team developing specialized detectors that look for photons in the terahertz range — at frequencies just below the infrared. The development of these detectors will widen the range of frequencies where axions may be discovered. To bring the faint signals to the fore, the team is using supersensitive quantum amplifiers.

Former New York Fed president says central bankers should interfere with the 2020 election to oust Trump,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/former-new-york-fed-president-says-central-bankers-should-interfere-with-the-2020-election-to-oust-trump,"Want to know how to spot someone who was unaffected by the last recession? Look for the people who argue now that another economic disaster would be worth it if it means President Trump loses his 2020 reelection bid.

The former chair of the New York Federal Reserve this week encouraged the central bank to “refuse to play along” with the president’s trade war with China, arguing in a Bloomberg News opinion article that it would be worth risking a major economic downturn if it means “making it abundantly clear that Trump will own the consequences of his actions.”

“I understand and support Fed officials’ desire to remain apolitical. But Trump’s ongoing attacks on [Fed Chairman Jay Powell] and on the institution have made that untenable,” Bill Dudley writes this week.

He adds, “Central bank officials face a choice: enable the Trump administration to continue down a disastrous path of trade war escalation, or send a clear signal that if the administration does so, the president, not the Fed, will bear the risks — including the risk of losing the next election.”

Remember: Dudley served as the president of the New York Fed for almost a decade (2009 to 2018, to be exact).

“There’s even an argument that the election itself falls within the Fed’s purview,” his op-ed concludes. “After all, Trump’s reelection arguably presents a threat to the U.S. and global economy, to the Fed’s independence and its ability to achieve its employment and inflation objectives.”

He adds, “If the goal of monetary policy is to achieve the best long-term economic outcome, then Fed officials should consider how their decisions will affect the political outcome in 2020.”

Well, that is a none-too-subtle message. He's effectively calling for a coup, stating in almost so many words that the Fed's mandate requires it to interfere in the Democratic process — to help presidents it likes and to ruin the economy for the ones it doesn't like.

Dudley argues that the central bank taking a stand against Trump “could benefit the Fed and the economy in three ways.”

“First,” he writes, “it would discourage further escalation of the trade war, by increasing the costs to the Trump administration. Second, it would reassert the Fed’s independence by distancing it from the administration’s policies. Third, it would conserve much-needed ammunition, allowing the Fed to avoid further interest-rate cuts at a time when rates are already very low by historical standards.”

I suspect Dudley would feel differently about encouraging potential economic disaster had the last one affected him in a meaningful way. But I suspect he suffered no real consequences for the disastrous decisions made by the same sort of people whom he calls on now to “resist” Trump through economic pressure. Those who had their life's savings wiped out, those who lost their homes, and those who struggled for months to find work as bills piled up are likely not the same ones suggesting that another recession would be preferable to four more years of Bad Orange Man in the White House.

Unfortunately, Dudley is not even alone in entertaining this destructive, vindictive fantasy. He is merely the latest and most powerful to call for economic sabotage.

I wonder, though, whether it won't help Trump's reelection in 2020 if those who oppose him are cheering on economic destruction."
United States Department of Defense Increases Deployment of Rekor Technology,https://finance.yahoo.com,[],08-27-2019,2019,8,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-states-department-defense-increases-113000911.html,"Expands use of Rekor’s proprietary vehicle recognition software to enhance existing camera networks following successful initial engagement

COLUMBIA, MD / ACCESSWIRE / August 27, 2019 / Rekor Systems, Inc, (REKR) (‘Rekor”) a Nasdaq company focused on bringing smarter, faster, cost-competitive solutions to the worlds of public safety and customer experience, announced today it has received a purchase order from the Department of Defense (DoD) to provide an additional 200 camera licenses for the Company’s vehicle recognition system. The DoD has now doubled its total camera licenses from Rekor, having originally purchased 200 licenses to use the Company’s machine-learning enabled vehicle recognition system in May of this year.

“We believe that both the initial selection and the rapid subsequent second purchase by the DoD confirms what we’ve long known about our technology - that it is the most robust vehicle recognition system on the market and a critical tool to support the important work of the world’s preeminent defense department,” said Robert A. Berman, President and CEO of Rekor. “Our solutions are easy to integrate, highly scalable and very cost efficient. By deploying our software within their existing infrastructure, our customers, including the DoD, can markedly enhance the functionality of their existing IP cameras by adding the most powerful vehicle recognition system in the world. What’s more, it’s all done without sacrificing any of the functionality of the existing system or the need to purchase new, expensive hardware.”

Rekor’s software enables automatic license plate and vehicle recognition through virtually any IP camera. Its industry-leading artificial intelligence-based solutions can be hosted locally or in the cloud. Enabled by machine learning from its robust and growing database covering over 70 countries, Rekor’s software can identify in real time vehicle license plate data, color, make, model and body type.

Rather than buying expensive cameras that take weeks or months to ship and install, Rekor’s software can be deployed to any existing IP camera immediately. This can represent a potential savings of tens of thousands of dollars per camera, as well as greater flexibility to expand or decrease usage as needed without large capital expenditures on hardware. It also eliminates the need for two separate cameras - one for lice plate reading functionality, one for general surveillance recording - as Rekor’s solution can be used to collect license plate data and information such as the make, model, and color of a vehicle using the same camera that provides surveillance monitoring.

Katie Porter (D-Calif.) is in a vulnerable position, having flipped a Republican seat in Orange County, and acknowledges the political risks of being pro-impeachment. | Mario Tama/Getty Images 2020 elections ‘You are helping him’: Vulnerable Democrats grilled on impeachment Lawmakers are being confronted at town halls by voters — not with activist organizations — who boast deep knowledge of Mueller's probe.

IRVINE, Calif. — Democrats hoping to avoid clashes over impeachment when they left Washington this summer are being confronted with a difficult reality at sometimes hostile town hall events.

Voters across the country — from California to Pennsylvania to Massachusetts — grilled House Democrats on the potential impeachment of President Donald Trump at a series of events this month, regardless of whether they support or oppose the drastic measure.

Story Continued Below

The very first question Rep. Katie Porter received at a town hall here, for example, was where she stood on impeaching Trump.

To rousing applause, the vulnerable California Democrat told the crowd that she favors impeachment — even though some worry it would play into the president’s hands. Porter, who flipped a Republican seat in what is becoming a more liberal Orange County, also acknowledged the political dangers of her pro-impeachment stance.

“People said, ‘Well, this might be risky, you might not get reelected,’” Porter said. “I said, ‘I am here to do what’s right.’”

Her response underscores the quandary facing House Democrats — especially so-called front-line members whom the national party believes are its most vulnerable in 2020. Many progressive voters want Democratic leaders to move forward with impeachment immediately, the politics of it be damned, because ethics demand it; others are hammering their representatives over the possibility that impeachment would boost Trump’s reelection prospects because he would claim vindication after being acquitted by the GOP-controlled Senate.

New Window INTERACTIVE: See which House lawmakers support impeachment.

“If the only times I got out of bed were days I thought something I vote on would pass the Senate, I would have bedsores,” Porter quipped.

Democrats won the majority in the House because they flipped dozens of Republican-held seats, including all four in Orange County, with candidates who billed themselves as moderates. But many of those same Democrats have come out for impeachment, and all of the potentially perilous political consequences that come with it.

It’s a question freshman Rep. Harley Rouda has also grappled with. Rouda, another Orange County Democrat, is high on Republicans’ target list as they aim to retake the majority in 2020 — but he, too, backs an impeachment inquiry, despite fears among many Democrats that taking such a position in a swing district is a political death knell.

“None of the calculus included, ‘What does this mean to me personally from a political standpoint?’” Rouda said in an interview in Laguna Beach, where he lives. “‘Does this help me or hurt me in my chances of getting reelected?’ never crossed my mind once.”

Rep. Stephen Lynch, who opposes impeachment because he fears it will help Trump, faced a hostile crowd of around 200 advocates, activists and constituents who shouted him down as he delivered impassioned rejections of their calls for impeachment.

Lynch, who has served in the House for nearly two decades, faces a different predicament than his fellow moderates in swing districts. The Massachusetts Democrat doesn't fear Republican opponents; he has progressive primary challengers as his already-blue Boston suburbs district is being yanked to the left.

“You are going to give Donald Trump another four years by doing that. You are helping him. You are helping him get another four years,” Lynch fired back at his constituents, raising his voice as the restive audience shouted at him. “I want Donald Trump removed from office and you’re going to give him another four years. That’s what I know. That’s what I know in my heart.”

Many of the pro-impeachment voters turning out at town halls didn’t appear to be part of organized efforts, even as progressive groups like Impeach Now and Indivisible have ramped up their “Impeachment August” campaign. There were few, if any, matching T-shirts, poster-board signs or coordinated chants.

Instead, people lined up at the microphones eager to discuss specifics of Trump’s actions as outlined in former special counsel Robert Mueller's report and the House’s lawsuits — a kind of detailed knowledge and energy that suggests pro-impeachment sentiment is more deep-rooted than simply an antagonistic anti-Trump movement and could be impossible for Democrats to ignore long term.

Several people were so versed in the House’s work that they at times challenged their own members about the legal merits of an impeachment “inquiry,” a nuanced argument that is usually heard in the hallways of Congress rather than a suburban community center. They praised House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) by name, and name-dropped witnesses like former White House counsel Don McGahn, who was mentioned multiple times in Mueller’s 448-page report.

The issue also resurfaced in a Democratic Caucus call this month, where Speaker Nancy Pelosi reiterated her cautious view on the subject.

“The public isn’t there on impeachment. It’s your voice and constituency, but give me the leverage I need to make sure that we’re ready and it is as strong as it can be,” Pelosi told House Democrats in the conference call last week, according to an aide.

“The equities we have to weigh are our responsibility to protect and defend the Constitution and to be unifying and not dividing. But if and when we act, people will know he gave us no choice,” Pelosi added, a reference to Trump’s stonewalling of myriad congressional investigations. “If he cannot respect the Constitution, we’ll have to deal with that. It’s about patriotism, not partisanship.”

But liberal voters across the country, who flocked to town halls this month, say that politics is the exact reason Democratic leaders aren’t acting on impeachment.

In a conservative suburb of Pittsburgh, one man recited lines from the Mueller report as he pressed vulnerable freshman Rep. Conor Lamb (D-Pa.) on his opposition to impeachment.

“I happen to believe, having read the Mueller report — back to front, back again — there are a lot of questions we still need to know the answers to,” Lamb, a former federal prosecutor, said during the event.

In a packed City Council room in Verona, N.J., Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill faced dozens of people clamoring for impeachment and, at times, interrupting her to make their point.

“If we let him get away with this, my fear is, there will not be a Constitution,” one woman told Sherrill, sparking applause.

But Sherrill, who is also a former federal prosecutor, said Democrats don’t yet have enough evidence to bring an impeachment case against Trump — a charge that a majority of her Democratic colleagues have rejected.

“If we don't make a strong enough case to the American people — and right now, I don’t think we can do that without more — the president will be acquitted, and we will now have two branches of our government who have said that his behavior is acceptable,” Sherrill said as the room quieted, adding that she would support impeachment if Trump defies a court order.

Yet this moved some members of the audience to accuse her of playing politics.

“It’s a fight worth fighting. If you lose, you lose, but at least you made the fight,” one man said as Sherrill turned to other questions. Another woman chimed in with a warning: “Don’t be last to speak up. You’ll be challenged.”

Rep. Gil Cisneros, a Democrat who also flipped a GOP-held seat in Orange County and parts of Los Angeles, supports the House Judiciary Committee’s efforts to get its hands on key documents and secure witness testimony via the various court battles wading their way through the federal judiciary. But he said the House needs Mueller’s grand jury information and testimony from McGahn and other former top White House aides before proceeding with an impeachment inquiry.

“We can’t hold an impeachment hearing with just simply the Mueller report. We need the information behind the Mueller report, which the administration is not giving us, which is why we’re fighting that in court right now,” Cisneros said in an interview in Buena Park.

In the beachside city of Del Mar, outside San Diego, Rep. Mike Levin, another vulnerable Orange County Democrat, defended his support for an impeachment inquiry from a voter who pressed him on the political implications: “Why give [Trump] this gift?”

“I know that the politics on this are divided,” Levin told the man. “But I also know, with two young children, that eventually I’m going to have to account for what I did or did not do.”

“And I would rather be able, in the years ahead, to look back and know that we protected our democracy and that we stood up for what we knew to be right, for what we knew the founders intended for us to do, rather than what we felt may or may not be politically expedient,” Levin said as voters in the room gave him a standing ovation.

Levin’s district, represented for nearly two decades by former GOP Rep. Darrell Issa, includes the most conservative part of Orange County — a suburb of Los Angeles that is rapidly shifting Democratic — and much of San Diego County, which is more liberal. But Democrats still count him as vulnerable, and Levin acknowledged that it won’t be easy to keep his job in 2020. Still, he said, he’s ready to act on impeachment.

“If we don’t take the actions that the Constitution requires, I think we’re going to look back at this period of time and regret it,” Levin told POLITICO after the town hall. “The Mueller report speaks for itself. Mueller’s testimony speaks for itself.”

""The outlaw regime in Iran issued a threat today against @FDD, an American think tank, and its CEO. The U.S. takes the regime's threats seriously. We intend to hold Iran responsible for directly or indirectly compromising the safety of any American,"" Ortagus said.

Justice Department takes controversial stand on transgender case at Supreme Court,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,['Ap Photo J. Scott Applewhite'],08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/justice-department-takes-controversial-stand-on-transgender-case-at-supreme-court,"In one of the most important cases the Supreme Court will hear this fall, the Department of Justice has taken a stand, along with a number of influential people and organizations. All of them take specific, strong stances on the definition of sex and gender identity, which center around the questions both the LGBT activists, conservatives, and legal experts have been asking for some time: What is sex, who defines it, and what legal protections does it have?

In a brief filed with the Supreme Court, the Department of Justice said they believe transgender discrimination is not prohibited by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in October to address the issue. The ACLU will argue on behalf of the transgender woman and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s position, claiming the employee was fired because of her gender identity. R.G & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes maintains that the employee was fired after he transitioned from male to female because he did not wear sex-specific clothing, which is a company policy.

This particular brief is significant because the DOJ represents the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, but their brief shows they will depart from the commission’s position that gender identity should be a protected category until Title VII’s sex discrimination clause. In the brief, the DOJ argues that Congress didn’t include transgender people and gender identity when Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act was originally passed, and Congress has not passed any efforts to add gender identity to the statute. “Under this Court’s precedent, proving discrimination because of sex under Title VII requires showing that an employer treated members of one sex less favorably than similarly situated members of the other sex,” the Justice Department said in its brief.

The DOJ’s brief isn’t the only noteworthy opinion on the case. Paul McHugh is the University Distinguished Service professor of Psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and he filed an amicus brief “not to discuss statutory construction but to critically evaluate, on the basis of his clinical and scientific expertise” in support of the concept that gender identity and sex are not the same thing, which basically supports the funeral home's case. The brief reads that he “seeks to discuss the frequently heard claims about gender identity, which sometimes masquerade as science but are really ideological pronouncements not supported by scientific evidence.”

Just last week a brief was filed by a group of people who appear to have all undergone gender reassignment surgeries or transitioned to some degree, and warn others about the dangers of transitioning through hormone replacement or surgeries. In their brief, they too tackle the subject of gender identity, sex, and transitioning, rather than law. Both amicus briefs provide an insightful look into the world of those who treat or who have identified as a different gender from a cultural, rather than a legal, perspective.

This case will be to gender identity what Obergefell v. Hodges was to same-sex marriage. It will be interesting to see who else steps in to add a perspective to this controversial legal case.

Trump claims he has 'absolute right' to order US companies out of China under 1977 law,https://www.cnn.com,['Veronica Stracqualursi'],08-24-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/24/politics/trump-china-trade-war-emergency-economic-powers-act/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump claimed he has the ""absolute right"" to ""order"" US companies to stop doing business with China that would involve using his broad executive authority in a new and unprecedented way under a 1977 law.

On Friday, China unveiled a new round of retaliatory tariffs on about $75 billion worth of US goods, the latest escalation in an on-going trade war that's putting a strain on the world's two largest economies. In response, Trump wrote on Twitter later Friday: ""Our great American companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China including bringing ...your companies HOME and making your products in the USA.""

When leaving the White House for the G7 summit in France, Trump told reporters, ""I have the absolute right to do that, but we'll see how it goes."" He later explained that he was referring to the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), and in a Friday tweet wrote: ""For all of the Fake News Reporters that don't have a clue as to what the law is relative to Presidential powers, China, etc., try looking at the Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977. Case closed!""

Trump's latest comments again raise questions as to how far the President's authority goes under the IEEPA . In May, Trump threatened to slap Mexico with punitive tariffs unless it slowed the passage of migrants from Central America to the US. The IEEPA, according to the Congressional Research Service, has never been invoked to impose tariffs, and Trump ultimately drew back at the last minute.

The IEEPA, passed in the wake of Watergate and Vietnam, gives Trump ""broad authority to regulate a variety of economic transactions following a declaration of national emergency,"" according to an analysis by the CRS.

Those presidential powers can be used ""to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat....to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States.""

Under the IEEPA, the President has to consult with Congress before invoking his authority and, after declaring a national emergency, send a report to Congress explaining why.

This authority has been used frequently; there have been 54 national emergencies, 29 of which are ongoing. In the first use of the IEEPA, during the Iran hostage crisis in 1979, President Jimmy Carter imposed trade sanctions against Iran, freezing Iranian assets in the US, according to CRS.

Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas and a CNN legal analyst, told CNN in May that what Trump wanted to do under the law with Mexico may have been within the authority given to the White House by Congress -- though it might not have been what Congress ever intended.

""The idea behind these authorities is that the President is better situated to make those kinds of determinations than Congress, especially when they're time-sensitive,"" Vladeck told CNN at the time. ""So I think the President's conduct may well be within the letter of the law here. But, as with the National Emergencies Act, I very much doubt this kind of exercise of the authority conferred by the statute is what Congress had in mind.""

On Saturday, Vladeck again weighed in, tweeting: ""One of the enduring phenomena of the Trump era is going to be the list of statutes that give far too much power to the President, but that many didn't used to worry about—assuming there'd be political safeguards. Today's entrant: The International Emergency Economic Powers Act.""

Under the law, though, Congress can end an emergency with a joint resolution.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, who has mounted a longshot bid against Trump for the 2020 Republican presidential nomination, called it ""outrageous"" that a US President would tell US companies how to conduct business."

Republican Senator Tom Cotton says it's a good idea to buy Greenland: Yikes. An excerpt from his New York Times op-ed:



After news leaked last week that President Trump had expressed interest in acquiring Greenland from Denmark, his critics predictably derided him as crazy. But once again, the president is crazy like a fox. The acquisition of Greenland would secure vital strategic interests for the United States, economically benefit both us and Greenlanders, and would be in keeping with American — and Danish — diplomatic traditions. ... America is not the only nation to recognize Greenland’s strategic significance. Intent on securing a foothold in the Arctic and North America, China attempted in 2016 to purchase an old American naval base in Greenland, a move the Danish government prevented. Two years later, China was back at it, attempting to build three airports on the island, which failed only after intense lobbying of the Danes by the Trump administration.

The Environmental Protection Agency has failed to set proper regulations on smog and must improve its air quality standards ruled a federal appeals court last week.

In a case fought between Murray Energy Corporation, a massive coal company, and Earthjustice, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reviewed massive amounts of scientific evidence to determine if the EPA’s current air quality standards were sufficient.

The court ruled that current air quality standards for the ozone are too weak to protect the environment and do not meet basic federal requirements for protecting human health.

Although the case is a great win, unfortunately the court only fully recognized the scientific evidence of air pollution on forests and other natural landscapes.

“We are disappointed that the court failed to recognize the overwhelming scientific evidence showing ozone’s potential to cause premature death, difficulty breathing, wheezing and coughing, and asthma attacks at levels previously considered safe,” Harold P. Wimmer, CEO of the American Lung Association, said in a statement. “Such evidence demands that EPA adopt stronger, more protective standards, not backslide on the progress being made toward cleaning up the air we breathe.”

The case was important in highlighting how effective strong scientific evidence can be when arguing during a trial.

“As President Trump’s EPA considers weakening science-based protections, that fact should give the agency pause as it goes out of its way to either dismantle science advisory boards, or fire independent scientists and replace them with fossil fuel lobbyists,” said Senator Tom Carper, a member of the Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee, in a statement.

Murray Energy also attempted to argue that the EPA should consider costs incurred by industry groups and corporations when they are forced to comply with new and updated regulations. The court rejected this argument, stating “The plain text of the [Clean Air] Act unambiguously bars cost considerations.”

Seth Johnson, the attorney who worked the case on behalf of Earthjustice was positive about its outcome. The EPA “must go back and fix its mistakes so cherished natural spaces like national parks can thrive,” he said after the ruling."
"Trump says China trade deal coming, Beijing calls for resolution of dispute",https://www.reuters.com,"['Jeff Mason', 'Min Read']",08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-trump/trump-says-china-trade-deal-coming-beijing-calls-for-resolution-idUSKCN1VG0HK,"BIARRITZ, France/BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday predicted a trade deal with China after positive gestures by Beijing, calming global markets that have been roiled by new tariffs from the world’s two largest economies.

Trump said after a G7 summit of world leaders in Biarritz, France, that he believed China was sincere about wanting to reach a deal, citing what he described as increasing economic pressure on Beijing and job losses there.

Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, who has been leading the talks with Washington, said on Monday that China was willing to resolve the trade dispute through “calm” negotiations and opposed any increase in trade tensions.

Trump cited Liu’s comments as a positive sign, underscoring his seniority, and repeated his assertion that Chinese officials had contacted U.S. trade counterparts overnight and offered to resume negotiations, an assertion that China declined to confirm.

“I think they want to make a deal very badly. I think that was elevated last night. The vice chairman of China came out, he said he wants to see a deal made,” Trump told a news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron.

“The longer they wait, the harder it is to put back, if it can be put back at all. I don’t think they have a choice.”

The trade war between the world’s two largest economies has damaged global growth and raised market fears the world economy will tip into recession.

Macron said an agreement would help dispel uncertainty that has been weighing on global markets. He said Trump had told other G7 leaders that he wanted to strike a deal with China.

The upbeat tones soothed global markets, sending U.S. stocks higher and bolstering the U.S. dollar, which had fallen to a 2-1/2-year low against the Japanese yen earlier.

The S&P 500 gained 31.27 points, or 1.10%, to close at 2,878.38, while the dollar index reversed course to trade higher, last rising 0.4%.

The Chinese yuan, which had fallen to an 11-year low in the onshore market and hit a record low in the offshore market, pared losses. In the offshore market, the Chinese yuan was last down 0.5% at 7.1684 per dollar.

Trump said he was more upbeat about the prospects for an agreement with China than in the recent past, and signaled that Washington could also reach a trade agreement with Brussels that averted car tariffs on car imports from Europe.

The U.S. leader also downplayed the prospect of new U.S. tariffs on autos imported from Japan, after a trade deal reached by the largest and third-largest economies on Sunday.

CONTRADICTION? NO PROBLEM!

Asked whether his contradictory statements on trade matters had fueled global market uncertainty, Trump appeared to defend the practice and said it had served his interests well.

“Sorry,” he said, flatly. “It’s the way I negotiate. It’s done well for me over the years, and it’s doing even better for the country, I think.”

Days after referring to President Xi Jinping as an enemy, for instance, Trump on Monday heaped praise on his Chinese counterpart in separate remarks, alternately calling him a “great leader” and a “brilliant man.”

In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said he had not heard that a phone call between the two sides had taken place. China’s Commerce Ministry, which typically releases statements on trade calls, did not respond to a request for comment.

When pressed on whether a call had taken place, Trump emphasized Liu’s comments. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said there had been contact between the two sides but declined to say with whom.

Hu Xijin, editor of the state-controlled Global Times newspaper, tweeted: “Based on what I know, Chinese and U.S. top negotiators didn’t hold phone talks in recent days. The two sides have been keeping contact at technical level, it doesn’t have significance that President Trump suggested. China didn’t change its position. China won’t cave to U.S. pressure.”

TARIFFS

The increasingly bitter U.S.-China trade war worsened on Friday with both sides leveling more tariffs on each other’s exports.

Trump announced an additional duty on some $550 billion of targeted Chinese goods, hours after China unveiled retaliatory tariffs on $75 billion worth of U.S. goods.

On Sunday, the White House said Trump regretted not raising the tariffs even more. But Trump also appeared to back off of his threat to order U.S. companies out of China.

Liu, Xi’s top economic adviser, said at a conference in southwestern Chongqing: “We are willing to resolve the issue through consultations and cooperation in a calm attitude and resolutely oppose the escalation of the trade war.

“We believe the escalation of the trade war is not beneficial for China, the United States, nor to the interests of the people of the world.”

The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said China would retaliate if Trump enforced the latest U.S. tariffs.

The two sides were due to meet in September in Washington, but no specific dates have been released.

The United States accuses China of economic sins including intellectual property theft, currency manipulation and forced technology transfer by U.S. companies to their Chinese partners as a requirement for doing business in China. China denies the U.S. allegations.

Beijing and Washington were close to a deal last spring but U.S. officials said China backed away from an agreed text over a reluctance to change laws to address U.S. complaints.

The trade war has affected businesses all over the world and disrupted supply chains. Trump has urged U.S. companies to move their operations out of China, but it was not clear how or whether his efforts to order such a move would work.

He said on Monday that if a deal emerged, U.S. companies should stay in China or leave if it did not.

Liu said: “We welcome enterprises from all over the world, including the United States, to invest and operate in China.”

Mnuchin said Trump could order companies out of China under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act if he declared a national emergency.

Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who met with Trump at the G7, both said it was in everyone’s interest for China and the United States to reach a deal. Germany’s economy, which is heavily dependent on exports, is facing a recession, according to some economists."
