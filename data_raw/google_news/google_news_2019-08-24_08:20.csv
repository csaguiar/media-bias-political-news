"A Gyrating Economy, and Trump’s Volatile Approach to It, Raise Alarms",https://www.nytimes.com,['Peter Baker'],08-23-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/23/us/politics/trump-economy-trade.html,"Not content to leave it there, Mr. Trump proceeded to try to unilaterally dictate to the private sector how and where it should conduct business, presuming a role in the marketplace that no other president has asserted in similar circumstances.

“Our great American companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China, including bringing your companies HOME and making your products in the USA,” he tweeted.

While White House officials said no such order was being drawn up and it was not clear how it would be justified legally, at least without an act of Congress, a president does have an array of tools at his disposal to make it more difficult or costly for businesses to remain in China.

Shaken as both China and Mr. Trump again raised tariffs in a tit-for-tat exchange on Friday, stock markets fell sharply. The president turned that into a laugh line at the expense of a Democratic congressman from Massachusetts who ended his bid for the presidency on Friday.

“The Dow is down 573 points perhaps on the news that Representative Seth Moulton, whoever that may be, has dropped out of the 2020 Presidential Race!” Mr. Trump tweeted. (The Dow Jones industrial average finished the day 623 points down.)

Mr. Trump’s tweets caught most of his advisers and staff by surprise. His advisers have grown concerned that he is creeping perilously close to turning what they had hoped would be his signature issue into a liability. His moves risk scaring away voters, including some of his own backers.

His aides believe Mr. Trump is being urged on by Robert Lighthizer and Peter Navarro, his trade advisers, who generally share the president’s hostile view of China and who advocated a confrontational path with tariffs. Some said they have filled a void left by Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff, who has not weighed in forcefully."
Trump blasts CNN for 'disgraceful' hiring of ex-FBI official Andrew McCabe,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Joseph Wulfsohn', 'Joseph A. Wulfsohn Is A Media Reporter For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-cnn-disgraceful-andrew-mccabe,"President Trump slammed CNN on Friday night after the network announced that it had hired controversial ex-FBI official Andrew McCabe as a contributor, calling the decision ""disgraceful.""

McCabe was famously fired by the FBI on March 16, 2018, after a Justice Department inspector general's report found he had repeatedly misstated his involvement in a leak to The Wall Street Journal regarding an FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation. The watchdog office referred the matter to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, which has been investigating.

The former FBI deputy director is currently suing the Justice Department and the FBI over his dismissal from the bureau, claiming that the agencies bowed to political pressure from Trump.

CRITICS MOCK CNN FOR HIRING EX-FBI OFFICIAL ANDREW MCCABE: 'WILL ONLY FURTHER PLUNGE THE NETWORK'S CREDIBILITY INTO A BLACK HOLE'

Trump blasted the network on Twitter while retweeting a message by Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who also condemned the CNN move.

""Disgraceful!"" Trump simply tweeted.

The president then mocked CNN in reaction to a tweet that pointed out that CNN's highest-rated show on Wednesday was ""Cuomo Prime Time,"" which ranked at only No. 27, with around 1 million viewers.

Meanwhile, Fox News dominated the list with four shows in the top five, including ""Hannity"" and ""Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" both drawing more than 3 million viewers.

""Such a sad and pathetic fall for @CNN and Jeff Z[ucker]!"" Trump said about the network and its president.

CNN's newest hire was widely panned by media critics and Twitter users.

Powell Highlights Fed’s Limits.

Against that backdrop, some members of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee support cutting rates to shore up economic growth, while others want to wait to monitor how the trade dispute plays out.

“Risk management enters our decision making because of both the uncertainty about the effects of recent developments, and the uncertainty we face regarding structural aspects of the economy,” Mr. Powell said.

Mr. Trump, who appointed Mr. Powell to a four-year term, has said that the Fed should use monetary policy to even the playing field with trading partners like China and Germany, which he believes are weakening their currencies and lowering rates to gain an economic advantage over the United States.

“Our Federal Reserve does not allow us to do what we must do,” the president said in a tweet on Thursday, adding that Fed officials “move like quicksand. Fight or go home!”

Investors fully expect a rate cut in September and anticipate another before the end of the year, based on market pricing measured by the CME Group.

Fed officials often point to two mid-1990s rate-cutting cycles as rough templates for how the central bank is approaching policy now. In both instances, the Fed cut rates by 75 basis points to help get the economy through rough patches."
"Jeffrey Epstein taken off suicide watch after examination by ‘doctoral-level psychologist,’ DOJ says",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Alex Pappas', 'Alex Pappas Is A Politics Reporter At Foxnews.Com.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jeffrey-epstein-taken-off-suicide-watch-by-doctoral-level-psychologist-doj-says,"Disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein was taken off suicide watch after being examined by a “doctoral-level psychologist” days before he hanged himself in his prison cell, according to the Justice Department.

The disclosure was made in a letter addressed Thursday to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., and ranking member Doug Collins, R-Ga. The letter was obtained by Fox News on Friday.

FRANCE TO INVESTIGATE RAPE CHARGES LINKED TO JEFFREY EPSTEIN CASE

“The Department can confirm that Mr. Epstein was placed on suicide watch in July,” Justice Department official Stephen E. Boyd wrote. “Mr. Epstein was later removed from suicide watch after being evaluated by a doctoral-level psychologist who determined that a suicide watch was no longer warranted.”

Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan, N.Y., on Aug. 10, as he awaited trial on federal sex trafficking charges involving underage girls. He had been placed on suicide watch weeks earlier, on July 23, after he was found on the floor of his cell with bruises around his neck.

Both the FBI and the Justice Department's inspector general are investigating the circumstances surrounding Epstein's death.

“Although Mr. Epstein is deceased, the department’s case against anyone who was complicit in his alleged crimes will continue,” the DOJ’s letter said.

Epstein's ability to take his own life while incarcerated at one of the most secure jails in America ended the possibility of a trial that could have involved prominent figures and sparked widespread anger that he wouldn't have to answer for his alleged crimes.

Since Epstein's death, Attorney General William Barr has removed the director of the federal Bureau of Prisons and appointed a new director and deputy director. The jail's warden has been reassigned to a desk post at a regional office and two guards who were supposed to be watching Epstein the night he died were placed on administrative leave.

Meanwhile, on Friday France announced it had opened an investigation into the alleged rape of minors and a raft of other charges linked to the Epstein case. Epstein had a home in Paris and was arrested in early July after arriving at New Jersey's Teterboro Airport from the French capital.

Epstein had pleaded not guilty to sexually abusing girls as young as 14 and young women in New York and Florida in the early 2000s.

His lawyers maintained that the charges were nullified by a non-prosecution agreement he reached with the federal government when he pleaded guilty in 2008 to state charges of soliciting a minor for prostitution. Under that agreement, besides serving 13 months in jail, he was required to reach financial settlements with dozens of his alleged victims and register as a sex offender.

The Trump administration is making changes to the agency that operates the nation's immigration court system, a move immediately denounced by the immigration judges' union as a power grab.

The agency is called the Executive Office for Immigration Review and it is an arm of the Justice Department. Under the interim rule announced Friday, the agency's director will have the power to issue appellate decisions in immigration cases that have not been decided within an allotted timeframe. It also creates a new office of policy within EOIR to implement the administration's immigration policies.

The head of the immigration judges' union accused the administration of trying to strip power away from judges and turn the immigration court system into a law enforcement agency.

""In an unprecedented attempt at agency overreach to dismantle the Immigration Court, the Department of Justice, Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) today published a new interim rule, effective next Monday, which takes steps to dismantle the Immigration Court system,"" Judge Ashley Tabaddor, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, said in a statement. ""DOJ's action ends any transparency and assurance of independent decision making over individual cases.""

The new rule, first reported by The Associated Press, comes after the administration announced an effort to decertify the immigration judges' union. The judges, 440 in total, are employees of the Justice Department and not part of the independent judiciary. The Trump administration has also imposed quotas on judges in an effort to speed up deportations and reduce the backlog of more than 900,000 cases pending in immigration courts.

Tabaddor said the administration is trying to concentrate its power over immigration proceedings.

""The new rule is a wolf in sheep's clothing,"" Tabaddor said. ""While couched in bureaucratic language, the impact of this regulation is to substitute the policy directives of a single political appointee over the legal analysis of non-political, independent adjudicators.""

The EOIR did not respond to a call for comment.

Earlier this week, the EOIR sent the immigration judges a newsletter containing a blog post from VDare, an anti-immigration website, which included an anti-Semitic reference, according to Tabaddor. After she protested, Justice Department officials said some information included with the newsletter had been compiled by a third-party contractor and should not have been distributed.

""The Department of Justice condemns anti-Semitism in the strongest terms,"" Kathryn Mattingly, a spokeswoman for EOIR told BuzzFeed."

A federal court ruled President Donald Trump can’t block people on Twitter, but the Trump administration isn’t giving up that easily.

The Justice Department on Friday asked the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals to hear en banc a case challenging the president’s ability to block people on the platform.

Story Continued Below

A panel of judges from the court ruled last month that, because Trump uses his private Twitter account to announce policy and other issues of national importance, blocking users would exclude them from public discussion.

In its Friday court filing that requested a rehearing from all judges of the court, the Justice Department argued that because the @realDonaldTrump account is not owned by the federal government and has been operated by Trump in a personal capacity for years, the president can control who can have access to it.

“An official’s decision to exclude someone from his personal residence would not exercise the authority of the government, even if he were giving official statements on that property on that day,” the filing said. “And what is true for real property is likewise true for a social media account.”

The Justice Department declined to comment Friday afternoon.

The filing comes as part of a lawsuit brought by a group of Twitter users represented by Columbia University’s Knight First Amendment Institute against Trump, his social media adviser Dan Scavino and former White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. The court ruled at the time that the White House had referenced Trump’s Twitter account in an official capacity in the past and that public access to official communication channels was protected by the First Amendment.

In its Friday filing, the Justice Department argued that assumption would set a precedent that would mean all “public officials who address matters relating to their public office on personal accounts will run the risk that every action taken on that account will be state action subject to constitutional scrutiny.”

“The First Amendment does not warrant this type of judicial superintendence of personal social media accounts owned by public officials,” the filing said.

Trump has operated his Twitter account since 2009 — long before his presidency — and as president has routinely used it to announce major policy decisions and White House personnel changes to the public.

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON–The Justice Department late Friday acknowledged that accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein had been removed from suicide watch prior to his death by a ""doctoral-level psychologist"" who determined that continued monitoring was ""no longer warranted.""

The written response to questions posed by House Judiciary Committee leaders offered little new information about the circumstances surrounding the disgraced financier's suicide earlier this month at the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan.

The Justice Department said it was limited in what could be disclosed because of three continuing investigations into the death led by the FBI, the department's inspector general and the Bureau of Prisons.

Epstein, 66, was awaiting trial following last month's indictment on charges of sex trafficking and sex-trafficking conspiracy. Federal prosecutors alleged that he ""sexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girls at his homes"" in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida, and at other locations from 2002-2005.

In Friday's letter to lawmakers, Justice re-affirmed that the investigation into Epstein's alleged sex crimes was continuing.

DOJ asks appeals court to reconsider ruling that Trump's Twitter blocking violates Constitution,https://www.cnn.com,"['Katelyn Polantz', 'Caroline Kelly']",08-23-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/23/politics/doj-appeals-court-reconsider-trump-blocking-tweets-unconstitutional/index.html,"(CNN) The Justice Department asked a federal court of appeals on Friday to reconsider a case where President Donald Trump was told he couldn't legally block Twitter users from seeing his tweets.

The 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals has not yet said if it would rehear the case. The request comes following a three-judge appellate panel having decided in July that Trump blocking users on Twitter from following or interacting with his account handle @realDonaldTrump was unconstitutional.

The Justice Department, which has represented Trump in the lawsuit, called the matter one of ""exceptional importance."" The department maintains that Trump's Twitter account is his personal account and will remain his handle after he leaves office.

""The importance of en banc review here is underscored because the panel's novel and mistaken First Amendment reasoning is being applied not just to any public official, but to the President of United States,"" the department wrote in Friday's petition. ""Accordingly, en banc rehearing should be granted.""

The appeals court previously ruled that the handle is a public forum because it is sometimes controlled by government officials or used for official government business.

Did DOJ Say Christian Employers Should Be Allowed to Force Women to Wear Skirts?,https://www.snopes.com,['Dan Macguill'],,,,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/doj-women-skirts-christian/,"On Aug. 19, 2019, the left-leaning website Shareblue Media published an article with the headline “[Department of Justice] Says Christian Employers Should Be Allowed to Make Women Wear Skirts,” which reported that:

This term, the Supreme Court will hear a case, R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), to determine whether trans employees can be fired simply for being trans…Currently, the case is before the Supreme Court, to be heard in the 2019-2020 term, and the government has flipped sides. Last week, the Department of Justice wrote a brief arguing the case that the EEOC won in the appellate court should now be reversed, urging the Court to hand a victory to the Christian funeral home owner. The DOJ’s stance is so appalling that the EEOC refused to sign onto the brief. The argument of Solicitor General Noel Francisco, a Trump nominee, is that Title VII is limited only to discrimination based on “biological sex” only and therefore doesn’t cover the firing of Stephens for being transgender. Put another way, the DOJ is arguing that Title VII applies when, say, women are treated worse at a job then men are, but not when transgender workers are treated worse at work than non-transgender workers. It gets worse. The DOJ brief endorses the view of the funeral home owner, Thomas Rost, who said “the Bible teaches that it is wrong for a biological male to deny his sex by dressing as a woman or for a biological female to deny her sex by dressing as a man” and that he would fire any woman who refused to wear a skirt while at work. You read that right. It’s 2019, and the government is arguing that businesses should be allowed to force women to wear skirts at work as long as a Christian business owner demands it.

We received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of Shareblue’s claim that the DOJ had articulated or supported the view that Christian employers should be legally allowed to force female employees to wear a skirt at work.

Background

The U.S. Supreme Court accepted the case in question for consideration in July 2018. As of August 2019, it was scheduled for oral arguments in October. Based on accounts filed by the employer Harris Funeral Homes, the employee Aimee Stephens, and the DOJ, as well as an earlier Court of Appeals opinion, the following is the rough sequence of events at the heart of this important but at times complicated case.

Employment and termination

In 2007, Stephens was hired by Harris Homes, which has three funeral-home locations in Michigan. Stephens had been born biologically male and assigned that gender at birth, was given the name William Anthony Beasley Stephens, and went by “Anthony.”

In 2013, she informed her employer that she intended to live as a woman, which she had regarded for a long time as her true gender identity, and that as part of that transition, she intended to have gender-reassignment surgery. That would require living and working as a woman for a year first, and Stephens told Harris Homes she would take a vacation, and would “return to work as [her] true self,” with the intention of presenting herself as a woman and complying with the company’s dress code for women by wearing a skirt and suit jacket at work. Male employees were required to wear a suit and tie.

Before she took that vacation, the owner of the company, Thomas Rost, terminated Stephens’ employment. Stephens filed a sex-discrimination complaint with the federal Equality Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), alleging that Rost had fired her “due to her sex and gender identity.” (The EEOC also found the company had discriminated against female employees by providing suits for male workers, free of charge, but not providing an equal allowance to women. Harris Homes changed that particular policy in 2014 and now provides all workers a clothing allowance.)

EEOC and the U.S. District Court

The EEOC investigated Stephens’ complaint and ultimately decided to apply to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan in 2014, seeking an injunction against Harris Funeral Homes. The agency alleged that — in violation of federal non-discrimination law — the company had “fired Stephens because Stephens is transgender, because of Stephens’s transition from male to female, and/or because Stephens did not conform to [Harris Homes’] sex- or gender-based preferences, expectations or stereotypes.”

The company applied to have the case dismissed, but the District Court denied that motion. However, the court said the EEOC could not claim Title VII discrimination (after Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act) solely on the basis of Stephens’ status as a transgender person, because gender identity was not one of the types of discrimination prohibited by law. (They are: race, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability and pregnancy.)

However, the District Court said the EEOC could bring a claim that alleged Harris Homes had engaged in impermissible “sex stereotyping,” based on the fact that Stephens’ firing was related to her stated intention to not wear the clothes prescribed under the company’s male dress code.

(In a precedent-setting 1988 case called “Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins,” the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit said evidence of workplace discrimination based on sex and gender stereotypes could be regarded as de facto evidence of sex-based discrimination. That case revolved around a woman who was denied a partnership at the firm, partly because some decision-makers viewed her behavior and demeanor to be insufficiently “ladylike.” The court found that while the discrimination was not, strictly-speaking, based on the mere fact of her sex, it was inextricably linked to her sex, and could not, by definition, have taken place without reference to her sex. As such, the court concluded, it amounted to legally prohibited sex discrimination.)

In the end, the District Court concluded that Harris Homes had indeed engaged in sex discrimination against Stephens on the basis of the “sex stereotyping” claim, but said the company was exempt from federal non-discrimination law based on the protections provided through the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which was signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1993.

(In the Stephens case, company owner Rost, a devout Christian, posited a religious objection to continuing to employ a person who would use a dress code different from that of an assigned, biological sex at birth, stating: “… The Bible teaches that it is wrong for a biological male to deny his sex by dressing as a woman or for a biological female to deny her sex by dressing as a man.”)

The EEOC appealed the District Court’s decision before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.

Court of Appeals

In March 2018, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court’s ruling, finding that Harris Homes did engage in impermissible “sex stereotyping” sex discrimination, and rejecting the company’s claim that sex stereotyping was only impermissible discrimination if it had a disproportionately negative impact on one gender class of employees.

The court also found that Rost had a legitimate right to a religious objection to employing Stephens, but that even the legislation which codified that constitutional right (RFRA) allowed for “greater good” exceptions, where the state has an overriding interest in protecting someone from discrimination, which the court saw as being the case here.

Thirdly, and perhaps most notably, the Court of Appeals also contradicted the District Court’s ruling that the EEOC could not proceed against Harris Homes on the basis of a “pure” discrimination claim. According to the Court of Appeals, gender identity was, in fact, a grounds for a discrimination claim, under federal non-discrimination laws.

In the court’s published opinion, Judge Karen Nelson Moore wrote:

“We also hold that discrimination on the basis of transgender and transitioning status violates Title VII … First, it is analytically impossible to fire an employee based on that employee’s status as a transgender person without being motivated, at least in part, by the employee’s sex … We ask whether Stephens would have been fired if Stephens had been a [biological] woman who sought to comply with the women’s dress code. The answer quite obviously is no. This, in and of itself, confirms that Stephens’s sex impermissibly affected Rost’s decision to fire Stephens.

“… Second, discrimination against transgender persons necessarily implicates Title VII’s proscriptions against sex stereotyping … an employer cannot discriminate on the basis of transgender status without imposing its stereotypical notions of how sexual organs and gender identity ought to align. There is no way to disaggregate discrimination on the basis of transgender status from discrimination on the basis of gender non-conformity, and we see no reason to try.”

In July 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to consider the case and was scheduled to hear oral arguments in early October 2019.

DOJ Stance

On Aug. 16, the DOJ filed a brief before the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing on behalf of the federal government that the court should reverse the Court of Appeals decision, thus ruling in favor of Harris Homes and against the EEOC. Despite being the federal respondent to the company’s appeal, the EEOC did not sign on to the government’s (that is, the DOJ’s) Supreme Court brief.

The District Court based its ruling on several grounds, as did the Court of Appeals, so it’s important to understand the reasons put forward by the DOJ for asking the Supreme Court to reverse the Court of Appeals decision. After all, the DOJ might be calling for the same outcome as the funeral home, but that doesn’t mean they agree on all issues, and they might be advocating the same outcome for differing reasons.

As outlined in the Aug. 16 brief, the following is a rough summary of the DOJ’s arguments:

The meaning of “sex” in the original 1964 Civil Rights act was understood to be biological sex, and Congress has declined to explicitly add transgender status to employment non-discrimination legislation over the years. This means the Court of Appeals was wrong in its claim that federal non-discrimination law does implicitly entail transgender status. Even if discrimination against a transgender person on the basis of being transgender could be regarded as discrimination on the basis of sex, a claimant must prove that he or she was negatively impacted by that discrimination by comparison with a counterpart of the opposite sex. Since discrimination against transgender persons would negatively impact trans men as much as trans women, this would not be the case. If the Supreme Court accepts that merely considering sex amounts to impermissible sex discrimination, without this element of disproportionate harm, then the court would have to invalidate any and all sex-specific policies, including dress codes and sex-specific bathrooms. The argument that discrimination based on transgender status inherently requires impermissible sex stereotyping fails because the basis of that precedent, Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, did not involve a declaration that any and all sex stereotyping was impermissible, only that evidence of sex stereotyping could be regarded as de facto evidence of sex discrimination. Furthermore, Stephens hasn’t been able to prove that she was disproportionately negatively impacted by comparison with a member of the opposite sex — that is, that (in the DOJ’s language) a biological woman would have been allowed to dress under the male dress code.

Did the DOJ say what Shareblue claimed it said?

As of Aug. 23, oral arguments had not taken place, but so far at least, the DOJ hasn’t argued that “Christian employers should be allowed to make women wear skirts,” as Shareblue’s headline claimed. In fact, the “religious objection” exemption that the District Court afforded Harris Homes and its owner Rost has not formed part of the DOJ’s arguments.

Shareblue claimed that:

“The DOJ brief endorses the view of the funeral home owner, Thomas Rost, who said ‘the Bible teaches that it is wrong for a biological male to deny his sex by dressing as a woman or for a biological female to deny her sex by dressing as a man’ and that he would fire any woman who refused to wear a skirt while at work.”

That is not accurate. The DOJ brief mentions the fact that Rost said this, but does not endorse that view. The actual point the DOJ makes about this, which Shareblue omitted, is that the fact Rost would be equally willing to fire both a biological man and biological woman who both refused to dress under the dress code of their assigned gender shows (in the DOJ’s opinion) that the policy does not favor one sex over the other, meaning it is permissible under federal non-discrimination law.

The DOJ has not endorsed or supported Rost’s biblically founded viewpoint on gender or attire, nor his company’s specific dress code policy. Rather, the DOJ has quite narrowly and specifically argued that the policy does not unfairly favor or burden workers of one sex over the other, and so does not violate non-discrimination law.

Shareblue went on to claim:

“You read that right. It’s 2019, and the government is arguing that businesses should be allowed to force women to wear skirts at work as long as a Christian business owner demands it.”

This is very misleading. Again, the DOJ did not make a religious exemption argument in its Supreme Court brief, and its argument that Harris Homes’ dress code does not unfairly burden one sex over the other is not contingent upon the particular religious faith of the employer. So the conditional statement “as long as a Christian business owner demands it,” is a highly misleading representation of what the DOJ has actually argued.

Is the DOJ arguing that any business owner, regardless of religious faith (or absence thereof) “should be allowed to force women to wear skirts at work”? Not exactly, but the DOJ is arguing that this is what the law already allows, under certain conditions.

The DOJ is not making an argument from a moral viewpoint, saying what “should” be allowed and what should not be allowed. As is the norm for briefs before the U.S. Supreme Court, the DOJ is arguing what it perceives existing law to require — taking into account the text of legislation, the precedents set in past federal court decisions, as well as the intentions and understandings of lawmakers when they wrote the legislation in question. These are legal arguments, not moral ones, and they are arguments based on what the DOJ understands is the case, not what the DOJ thinks should be the case.

In this particular instance, the DOJ is arguing that the existing body of non-discrimination law does not recognize transgender status as one of the grounds for a “pure” discrimination claim (like race, sex, religion, and so on); and that existing law does not regard a workplace policy as impermissible if it merely takes into account sex, rather than unfairly favoring or burdening one sex over the other.

Therefore, the DOJ is in effect arguing that existing law already allows an employer to impose different dress codes for male and female workers, provided those dress codes don’t unfairly burden or favor one sex over the other. In this narrow sense, Shareblue’s headline has an element of truth — having different dress codes for men and women could involve obliging female employees to wear skirts (or pantsuits, or scarves, or dresses, and so on.)

But that headline is woefully incomplete and therefore misleads readers about the DOJ’s actual argument, because having different dress codes for men and women would equally involve obliging male employees to wear trousers, suits, ties, and so on.

So for Shareblue to cherry-pick only one side of the implications of the DOJ’s argument, by focusing, in its headline, on “women” and “skirts,” misleads readers while also missing the very point the DOJ made in that argument: that once the burden from sex-specific policies like dress codes is equally shared by men and women, the law allows that policy."
"Pro Farmer National Corn, Soybean Yield Estimate Below USDA Forecast",https://www.agweb.com,[],,,,https://www.agweb.com/article/pro-farmer-national-corn-soybean-yield-estimate-below-usda-forecast,"Corn: 13.358 billion bu.; Average yield of 163.3 bu. per acre

Soybeans: 3.497 billion bu.; Average yield of 46.1 bu. per acre

Soybeans +/- 2% = 3.567 billion bu. to 3.427 billion bu.; 47.0 bu. to 45.2 bu. per acre

The national estimates above reflect Pro Farmer’s view on production and yields. They take into account data gathered during Crop Tour and other factors, such as crop maturity, acreage adjustments we’ve made, historical differences in Tour data versus USDA’s final yields, areas outside those sampled on Crop Tour, etc. That’s why the state yield numbers below differ from the Crop Tour figures.

Thousands of farmers, agribusiness executives and national and local media attended a series of meetings across the Midwest this week as part of the annual Pro Farmer Midwest Crop Tour. The Crop Tour focused on crop conditions going into the final stretch of the 2019 growing season.

Pro Farmer, a division of Farm Journal, shared its much-anticipated production estimates for the 2019 U.S. corn and soybean crops after analyzing information from the 27th annual tour and other sources.

The Pro Farmer Midwest Crop Tour unveiled the stresses the corn and soybean crops faced following an excessively wet spring and record-slow planting pace this year. Scouts on Crop Tour sampled around 3,000 fields across the Corn Belt in seven of the nation’s most important corn and soybean states.

Pro Farmer estimates the 2019 U.S. corn crop at 13.358 billion bushels, based on an average yield of 163.3 bu. per acre. That compares to USDA’s Aug. 1 estimate of 169.5 bu. per acre. For soybeans, the Pro Farmer production estimate is 3.497 billion bushels, with a national average yield of 46.1 bu. per acre, down from the 48.5 bu. per acre USDA estimated in August.

“Ear counts were lower than last year in all of the Crop Tour states as a result of the rough spring conditions,” said Brian Grete, Pro Farmer editor. “We also found a corn crop that was, in many cases, multiple weeks behind in maturity due to the record-slow planting.”

$16B veterans' health project hits major snag,https://www.politico.com,['Arthur Allen'],08-23-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/23/veterans-health-project-1673379,"The Pentagon has yet to give the VA authority to link its network to the current VA record system, decades-old VistA, which is key to implementation, a congressional staffer said. | Charles Dharapak, File/AP Photo health care $16B veterans' health project hits major snag The rollout is likely to be delayed six months, which members of Congress worry could be an early sign of trouble.

Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie insisted last week that the Trump administration is ""on track"" with a $16 billion project to connect medical records for the military and vets.

But that’s not exactly the case — the project faces significant delays and unanticipated headaches, according to three sources with detailed knowledge of what will be one of the largest technology contracts in federal history.

Story Continued Below

Promoters of the flagship Trump administration project say it will create a model for better-coordinated care for the whole United States, setting up a digitized health care record for millions of current and future veterans from the time they join the military. It’s a massively complex bureaucratic and technical undertaking, however, and a host of glitches have surfaced since the VA contract was signed last year, raising doubts in Congress about whether it can achieve its lofty goals.

Those problems are creating the first major hiccup for the project. Its promised March 2020 rollout at three VA medical centers — one in Spokane, Wash., the others in the Seattle area — is almost certain to be partially or completely delayed until October, the sources said.

In an op-ed published in military newspapers last week, Wilkie said the Trump administration is “working to deliver a win for veterans that prior administrations could not: a unified electronic health record (EHR) solution” that “will give [Pentagon and VA] doctors instant and seamless access to veterans’ full-service health records and history.”

Partly at the urging of President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, the VA decided in 2017 to sign a no-bid contract with Cerner, which the Defense Department signed up with two years earlier to replace its homegrown records system. Three members of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club also have been involved in the effort — at first trying to block the Cerner contract because one of them, physician Bruce Moskowitz, didn't like its software. A cache of 2017 emails released Thursday show that the VA officials in charge of the project humored the Mar-a-Lago group while bristling under their suggestions.

“If they are not ready to meet the highest standards of care, a delay might be required and that’s what should happen,"" Rep. Susie Lee said. | Andrew Harnik/AP Photo

The Pentagon’s project had gotten off on the wrong foot at four Pacific Northwest bases that year. Initially, the system lost prescriptions and made it difficult for clinicians to log on, leading terrified doctors to fear harm to their patients, as POLITICO reported at the time.

Worried the same might happen to the VA project, its congressional overseers repeatedly have urged the agency to slow the project rather than risk compromising veterans’ health care, so they are not entirely dismayed by news of the likely delay.

“I have said to the VA, time and again, that we’d rather get implementation right than to rush to meet a deadline,” said Rep. Susie Lee (D-Nev.), chairwoman of the House Veterans’ Affairs Technology Modernization Subcommittee, in an interview. “If they are not ready to meet the highest standards of care, a delay might be required and that’s what should happen.”

The VA recently decided to split the initial implementation into two blocks, one that might go live in March and April, and a second in October, according to two sources with knowledge of the plan. But this would require the VA to offer limited Cerner software to clinicians during the first phase, they said, and it would require the first phase to start at the understaffed and cramped Mann-Grandstaff Medical Center in Spokane. So the agency may hold up the whole project until October.

In a statement to POLITICO, the VA declined to say whether it would push the launch date. The VA ""is continually evaluating its path forward based on lessons learned from the Department of Defense and commercial implementations,"" the agency said. ""We are considering our options.""

A Cerner spokesperson said the VA was ""finalizing their [rollout] strategy"" and ""already ahead of where other clients would typically be at this point in implementation. We are confident we are on the track.”

""It is my understanding that VA is considering delaying the go-live at one or more of the initial Cerner cites,"" said physician and Rep. Phil Roe (R-Tenn.), ranking member of the full committee that led oversight of the project for years. ""If delaying the initial go-live date is needed to ensure that implementation is ultimately successful and patient care is enhanced rather than disrupted, then I fully support it.""

The project has been dogged by the inability of the Pentagon and VA to agree to a joint oversight board. The Pentagon has yet to give the VA authority to link its network to the current VA record system, decades-old VistA, which is key to implementation, a congressional staffer said.

A new office called the Federal Electronic Health Record Modernization Office was supposed to handle that and other coordination matters, but the office isn’t up and running yet, although the two agencies agreed to set it up last September. They recently notified Congress of the appointment of Neil Evans, a senior VA health care official, as interim leader of the office, with Pentagon health official Holly Joers as his deputy.

The various problems expected in the initial phase of the electronic records project — partial functionality of key clinical software, the need for clinicians to toggle between different software systems, and the enormous task of installing new IT hardware in the first three bases — has some congressional critics worried about the project’s direction.

“Is it going to be something better than what they currently have in VistA?” asked a second congressional source, referring to the VA's current software, which the agency developed in-house over the past 35 years. “That’s our concern.""

At a subcommittee hearing July 25, ranking member Jim Banks (R-Ind.) said the VA team had not provided answers to many questions Congress has asked about how well the system is going to work, including how data will flow between the two systems during the 10 years in which Cerner will replace VistA across the VA.

""I am skeptical that all the technical constraints are known and there aren't more intractable difficulties waiting to be discovered,"" he added.

The VA recently trumpeted the transfer of records from VistA to the Cerner data center as a major first step in the project, but far more complex tasks, such as uploading the records into Cerner’s system and making them usable for VA providers, remain, observers said.

“They have physically deposited the record on the Cerner side of the firewall, but they can’t do anything with the records,” a former VA official said, who compared the situation to having received a large encrypted file in an email.

The VA's statement said it was ""on track"" in transferring the data.

Lee and Banks also had questions about how long the VA planned to have physicians use the Joint Legacy Viewer, a discreet software program that allows a clinician to view older VA and Pentagon patient data.

The cumbersome viewer was one of the reasons the VA cited for moving to a single “seamless” heath record with the Pentagon to begin with, Lee noted. “It’s not clear how it fits into the long-term interoperability strategy, that is, how long it will be needed,” she said.

The VA said that two Cerner platforms — one with software used for patient encounters, the other with historical data and analytical tools — as well as the Joint Legacy Viewer will all be available on different ""tabs"" on the same terminal for clinicians, at least initially.

At the July 25 hearing, senior VA medical adviser Thomas O’Toole acknowledged the “challenge” of “complex clinical scenarios” where veterans are seen in different facilities and clinicians must call up multiple screens to safely review a patient’s data.

“We’re trying to identify those workflow processes in advance so clinicians know what to expect,” he said."
Justice Department inspector general reportedly completes FISA abuse investigation,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-23-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice-department-inspector-general-reportedly-completes-fisa-abuse-investigation,"Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz has reportedly completed his investigation into alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuses by the Justice Department and FBI.

The Hill's John Solomon made the announcement Thursday evening on Fox News.

""What I can report tonight, Sean, is that the IG has completed his work on the FISA abuse report. It's expected to be transmitted as early as next week to Attorney General William Barr and that will begin a process of declassification,"" the investigative reporter told host Sean Hannity.

""I think we are still on track for that timeline, I've been saying on your show: mid-September to early October seems the most likely release point,"" Solomon said. ""It's going to be a tough report,"" he added.

The timeline for Horowitz's investigation, which began in March 2018, has repeatedly shifted over the past few months because of various developments.

Horowitz's team is examining the FISA application and three renewals beginning in October 2016 to surveil former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. The applications relied heavily on the unverified dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele, who was hired by opposition research firm Fusion GPS and funded by Democrats.

Republicans have argued the dossier's Democratic benefactors, which included Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign and the Democratic National Committee, and its author's anti-Trump bias were left out of the FISA applications, and they have demanded accountability. Democrats countered that the FBI acted appropriately, saying the Justice Department and the FBI met the rigor, transparency, and evidentiary basis for probable cause.

Meanwhile, Barr's ""investigation into the investigators"" is underway, and the attorney general has said he is working very closely with Horowitz. The inspector general can recommend prosecutions, and U.S. Attorney John Durham, whom Barr tasked to lead the review of the origins of the Russia investigation, has the ability to convene a grand jury and subpoena people outside the government.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, has promised a ""deep dive"" into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation after Horowitz completes his work. Over the past few days, the South Carolina Republican has said he expects Horowitz's findings to be ""damning and ugly"" for the DOJ. Graham also said he plans to meet with Barr this week to ""talk to him about how best to tell the story"" and predicted that after his report is released Horowitz will deliver ""chilling testimony"" in front of his panel."

""Fox News Sunday"" anchor Chris Wallace told Sandra Smith Friday on ""America’s Newsroom"" that he has no explanation for why the president would tweet an ""order"" to American companies to stop doing business in China and wondered whether Trump thinks he has the authority to make such a demand.



""As best I can tell, the American president can’t order U.S. companies how they’re going to do their sales and where they’re going to have their supply chains,"" he said. ""We have a free market, capitalist system. I don’t think a president can order a car company to move some of its factories from one place to another.""





""He could impose tariffs or make it economically untenable,"" Wallace added. ""But he can't sit there and order the CEO or the board -- and my guess is most people in this country wouldn't want to see the president be able to do this.""

....all deliveries of Fentanyl from China (or anywhere else!). Fentanyl kills 100,000 Americans a year. President Xi said this would stop - it didn’t. Our Economy, because of our gains in the last 2 1/2 years, is MUCH larger than that of China. We will keep it that way! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 23, 2019

CHRIS WALLACE: We are just all learning of us at the same time, but as best I can tell, the American president can’t order U.S. companies how they’re going to do their sales and where they’re going to have their supply chains.



We have a free market, capitalist system. I don’t think a president can order a car company to move some of its factories from one place to another.



He could impose tariffs or make it economically untenable, but he can't sit there and order the CEO or the board -- and my guess is most people in this country wouldn't want to see the president be able to do this. We have to drill down on the statement, ""who is a bigger enemy to this country? The head of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell, who was appointed by President Trump, or Chinese President Xi?



SANDRA SMITH: Who he has called a friend and says they have a good relationship.



WALLACE: Yeah, exactly. It's interesting because this all comes amidst obvious concern and legitimate concern about the strength of the economy and whether or not we are headed for a downturn. No signs yet of a recession but certainly signs of a slowdown in growth, and one of the things that a lot of people in the White House have been saying just last week on ""Fox News Sunday"" that you have Larry Kudlow jaw-boning the economy and saying don't be afraid of optimism and things are going to be better than you think and the economy is strong. When you have the President of the United States flailing around this way and ordering companies to move back to the U.S. and saying that the head of the Federal Reserve is the enemy of the country, is not going to create more consumer confidence about the state of the economy or not?



SANDRA SMITH: ... So what do these tweets tell us about the state of negotiations with President Xi and China?



CHRIS WALLACE: Obviously not good. I know that Peter Navarro was here in the studio, one of the great things about working in the Fox bureau is you never know who is going to be walking down the hall, and I talked to Navarro myself and he said exactly the same thing, that talks with China are on track, not saying there's going to be an agreement anytime soon. He said they fully expected they were going to retaliate with their $75 billion in American goods that they will have tariffs on them.



But, clearly, the president isn't responding well to this and all of this is happening as the president is going to get on a plane at ten or eleven o'clock tonight to France for the G7. China is not a member, but remember last year when they were in Canada and the president blew up the conference disagreeing with all the other six economic partners on a number of issues, hold on to your hats, this could be a bumpy ride this weekend at the G7 in Paris.



Which leads me to a very good tease, we're going to have a live report from France on ""Fox News Sunday"" and also we're going to have an interview with a top White House official about all of that. So going to be a lot of interesting developments on the U.S. and global economy over the course of the next 48 hours.

Emails from senior Veterans Affairs staff released Thursday reveal the frustration and scorn they felt at having to deal with the intrusion of three wealthy members of President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in the agency’s plans to create a new digital health platform.

The 2017 and 2018 emails, which Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, show the outsized influence of the Mar-a-Lago members, Marvel Entertainment Chairman Ike Perlmutter, attorney Marc Sherman and internist Bruce Moskowitz.

Story Continued Below

The emails reveal how senior staff responded to what they saw as unhelpful meddling in their work. Essentially, they humored the three Trump friends while ignoring their advice, which they considered misinformed and potentially disruptive to veteran health care.

In one email, project head John Windom describes a meeting with the three as a “grin and bear it session.” Another calls them ""clearly out of their depth"" in demanding changes in the department's 2018 EHR contract with Cerner that the officials felt were unreasonable.

“Mr. Sherman does not understand the culture of VA or the federal government,” Windom said in another email with a colleague. “He appears to be a ‘big bang’ theory guy. The problem is, we must continue to deliver uninterrupted and quality care to our Veterans during the transformation within the parameters of the law and other regulations/policies.”

But a senior VA official involved in the EHR project, former Trump campaign official Camilo Sandoval, kept a list of the requests made by the three Mar-a-Lago members on a posterboard that he checked off from time to time, according to an official who worked directly with him.

The influence of the three Mar-a-Lago members was revealed by POLITICO in 2018, with additional details surfacing in FOIA documents requested by ProPublica. Congress is still investigating the group's interactions with department.

VA Secretary Robert Wilkie said last year that he had not spoken with any of the three since taking office. The VA on Thursday did not respond to an email inquiring into whether they are still involved in agency policymaking.

Two legal advocacy groups on Wednesday sued Wilkie for allegedly failing to preserve emails that they allege his predecessor, David Shulkin, sent from a personal account to conduct business with the Mar-a-Lago figures — activity that the suit claims was illegal.

“Despite misgivings, career VA employees were obligated to waste taxpayer time and resources to respond to the trio of Mar-a-Lago members, purely because of their connections to Trump,” the ethics group CREW said in a news release with the documents.

In one email released by CREW, a top VA official forwarded questions to another staffer that he said came from ""a POTUS friend/doctor.""

""We need to handle sensitively and with facts,"" acting Chief Information Officer Scott Blackburn said in the email. Ashwini Zenooz, a senior medical staffer on the project, responded that the requests are “just ridiculous. They don’t make sense and there is a basic lack of understanding… I’m just baffled.”

In another email, a staffer refers to Moskowitz as “the Dr from W Palm that is connected to Trump. ... He is outdated in his understanding of system but we need to be responsive here.”"

The president tweeted Friday morning that he was ordering ""our great American companies"" to ""immediately start looking for an alternative to China, including bringing your companies HOME and making your products in the USA.""

Early Friday afternoon, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note traded at 1.535%, while the yield on the 2-year Treasury note held at 1.513%, an inversion of a key segment of the U.S. yield curve. The rates dipped into and out of inversion throughout the rest of the trading session.

An inversion of the 2-10 yields is viewed by fixed income traders as a recession prognosticator, but trying to forecast exactly when GDP growth contracts is harder to project.

Inversions of that part of the curve have predated every recession over the past 50 years and the last five 2-10 inversions have all led to recessions. Still, even when it does predict a recession, yield curve inversion is, on average, 22 months early, according to Credit Suisse.

The movement in the bond market on Friday was largely pegged to Trump's social media barrage, which sparked fears on Wall Street that the trade war between the U.S. and China isn't close to a resolution and could worsen over the next few months. China announced earlier Friday that it will retaliate against new U.S. tariffs with its own levies on $75 billion more of U.S. goods and resume auto tariffs."
Overstock CEO gave info to DOJ for John Durham's review of Russia investigation origins,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-23-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/overstock-ceo-gave-info-to-doj-for-john-durhams-review-of-russia-investigation-origins,"Former Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne said he has provided information to the Justice Department for its investigation into the origins of the Russia investigation.

In multiple interviews Thursday, following his exit from the e-commerce retailer he led for two decades, Byrne described how he was an informant for the FBI and later turned to Attorney General William Barr when he felt that he had become part of a ""deep state"" plot.

Byrne told Fox News that he has provided documents that made their way to U.S. Attorney John Durham, whom Barr has tasked with leading the review of the DOJ's and FBI's conduct in the early stages of the inquiry into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.

In an interview with CNN, Byrne said he fed his information to the DOJ on Apr. 5 and Apr. 30, after which it was revealed that Durham had been asked to determine if there was any wrongdoing at the genesis of the Trump-Russia probe.

The 57-year-old multimillionaire resigned as CEO on Thursday, saying it was best for Overstock. The company saw its shares plummet more than 30% after he publicly detailed his involvement in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Byrne claimed that beginning in 2015, the FBI reached out to him for help in conducting law enforcement activities. He said he later discovered that he was being used in a ""political espionage"" effort targeting Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Sen. Marco Rubio, and Sen. Ted Cruz. Byrne also said he liked former President Barack Obama and did not vote for Trump.

Byrne said he received orders down the pipeline from former FBI agent Peter Strzok, who played key roles in the Clinton emails and Russia investigations. Strzok was removed from special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation after it was discovered he exchanged anti-Trump text messages with former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, with whom he was having an affair, and was fired last year. Byrne said federal officials confirmed with him that it was Strzok who gave him orders.

Claiming the bureau was ""hijacked from the top,"" Byrne also named former FBI Director James Comey and Deputy Director Andrew McCabe as being aware of his role. He told CNN host Chris Cuomo, who asked about proof, that he is ""highly confident"" Barr will be naming the three former FBI officials in an indictment in the near future.

The Washington Examiner reached out to the FBI, DOJ, and Strzok's lawyer. The FBI and Strzok's lawyer declined to comment, while the DOJ did not immediately return the request for comment

Byrne said he is not the only ""whistleblower"" coming forward, and asserted that Clinton's supporters in Hollywood were targets of spying.

As Byrne faced questions from skeptical interviewers on Thursday, CNN reported that a U.S. official confirmed that Byrne shared information about the early stages of the Russia investigation during a meeting earlier this year. This source said Justice officials found part of Byrne's story to be credible because what he was saying was not widely known.

Byrne is the latest person to emerge as a possible FBI informant used over the course of the counterintelligence investigation into Trump's campaign. Another one of these individuals is Stefan Halper, a 75-year-old Cambridge professor who reportedly had discussions with at least three Trump campaign members: foreign policy aides George Papadopoulos, Carter Page, and Trump campaign co-chairman Sam Clovis. The New York Times reported in April that the Justice Department inspector general was looking into his actions to see if he exceeded the scope of his assignment.

Byrne first revealed a couple weeks ago to the Washington Examiner his claim that he engaged in a sexual relationship with Russian spy Maria Butina at the encouragement of the FBI, but did not rekindle the romantic aspect of their relationship when asked to do so as the Russia investigation progressed. Byrne said he had been swept up in “political espionage"" and a ""deep state"" plot. Butina was sentenced in April to 18 months in prison for conspiring with a senior Russian official to infiltrate conservative American political circles and influence U.S. relations with Russia.

Byrne, who claimed he was offered a $1 billion ""bribe"" to keep quiet, said he received advice from billionaire investor Warren Buffett, whom he called his ""rabbi,"" and chose to come forward because he felt guilty, tying the decision to the recent wave of deadly mass shootings.

“The issue is, I realized that these orders I got came from Peter Strzok, and as I put together things, I know much more than I should know and tried to keep silent,” he told Fox Business. “This country has gone nuts, and especially for the last year when I realized what I know, every time I see one of these things, somebody drives 600 miles to gun down 20 strangers in the mall, I guess I feel a bit responsible.”"
Rudy Giuliani presses Ukraine to investigate Biden family,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/rudy-giuliani-presses-ukraine-to-investigate-biden-family,"Rudy Giuliani revived an effort to convince the Ukrainian government to investigate a matter related to Joe Biden, the front-runner in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary.

Giuliani, who is President Trump's personal attorney, encouraged a top representative of the new Ukrainian President Volodymy Zelensky to look into whether there was any improper overlap between the former vice president's diplomatic overtures in Ukraine, and his son Hunter Biden's ties to an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch, according to the New York Times.

He also asked Andriy Yermak, a close ally of Zelensky, to look into whether Ukrainian officials tried to undermine Trump's 2016 campaign.

Giuliani has called for Biden to be investigated for a trip he made in 2016 when he threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees if Ukraine did not dismiss Viktor Shokin, the country’s then-prosecutor general. Biden’s son, Hunter, stood to gain financially from having Shokin removed.

Giuliani said he ""strongly urged"" Yermak to “just investigate the darn things."" These discussions included a recent in person meeting in Madrid.

In May, Giuliani was subject to intense criticism for a planned trip to Ukraine to meet with then-elect Zelensky to ask that Ukraine pursue these investigations. He called it off after facing pushback from the State Department and concerns about 2020 election meddling, complaining that he was the victim of a ""setup.""

This time around, Giuliani claims he was not acting on Trump's behalf, but rather as a private citizen, and arranged the correspondence with the help of the State Department. Yermak, whose government wants a Trump-Zelensky meeting, said it was unclear whether Giuliani was acting on his own.

During a visit to Washington last month, an aide to House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Democrat from Maryland, urged Yermak not to work with Giuliani.

Yermak said he did not interpret that conversation as a warning and told Giuliani and congressional staff that the Ukrainian government is committed to fair investigations into possible crimes once a new top prosecutor is confirmed by parliament."
"New VA drug aims to 'make a dent' in vet suicide crisis, Secretary Wilkie says",https://www.foxnews.com,['Melissa Leon'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/va-drug-veteran-suicide-robert-wilkie,"Twenty-two American veterans are said to die by suicide every day, and the Department of Veterans Affairs is taking a step to fight that sobering statistic at the request of President Trump.

The president on Wednesday said he instructed the VA to place a substantial order of Spravato, which is used to help treat depression in patients who might not have seen results from other treatments or drugs, although some medical experts have said the drug's effectiveness is not entirely clear.

Spravato would be part of a new combination of drugs administered in spray form, VA Secretary Robert Wilkie told Fox News on Thursday morning, noting that the VA has prescribed Spravato for years “but in intravenous form and under the supervision of anesthesiologists.”

“What we’re doing now is transitioning to the nasal spray,” Wilkie said on “America’s Newsroom.” “It’s still under the supervision of anesthesiologists at [the] VA, but FDA has approved the combination of several drugs and Spravato [as] a means to combat depression.”

VETERAN WALKS FROM WASHINGTON STATE TO DISNEY WORLD TO RAISE AWARENESS FOR SUICIDE AMONG SERVICE MEMBERS

“We are doing everything we can to address the issues involving depression and mental health. I’ve said many times that we’ve not even had that national conversation about mental health that we desperately need,” Wilkie stressed, pointing also to addiction and homelessness.

“It’s in its opening stages when it comes to that combination of drugs the FDA has approved for us, to see if we can make a dent in depression,” Wilkie told Fox News’ Jon Scott and Sandra Smith.

On Wednesday, before departing for the American Veterans (AMVETS) national convention in Kentucky, President Trump told reporters he had instructed the VA to buy “a lot” of Spravato.

“There’s a product that’s made right now that just came out by Johnson & Johnson which has a tremendously positive, pretty short-term, but nevertheless a positive effect,” Trump said, McClatchy reported. “I’ve instructed the head of the VA to go out and buy a lot of it, and we are buying a lot of it.”

At the AMVETS convention, Trump said there’s been no issue more urgent than the veteran suicide crisis.

“My administration is determined to do everything in our power to save the lives of our heroes,” Trump said.

TRUMP SIGNS EXECUTIVE ORDER CANCELLING STUDENT LOAN DEBT FOR DISABLED VETERANS

The president said earlier at the White House that he hopes the VA is “getting [the medication] at a very good cost” from Johnson & Johnson.

One dose of Spravato is $295, according to McClatchy; a patient’s total daily cost could be more than $700 if they need two and a half sprays, which is common. Since the Food and Drug Administration has approved the treatment for the VA, Medicare and Medicaid would cover 65 percent of each dose, McClatchy noted.

Wilkie told Fox News on Thursday that a veteran can be given the Spravato nasal spray if his or her doctor and team approve its use.

Trump on Wednesday also signed an executive order that forgives all student loan debt for any permanently disabled military veterans.

DOJ argues Civil Rights Act does not protect LGBTQ workers,https://nypost.com,['August'],08-23-2019,2019,8,https://nypost.com/2019/08/23/doj-argues-civil-rights-act-does-not-protect-lgbtq-workers/,"The Justice Department on Friday urged the Supreme Court to rule that gay and transgender people are not protected against discrimination under the 1964 Civil Rights Act.

The federal law prohibits discrimination only on the basis of a person’s “biological” sex, the administration argues in a brief to the high court.

“The ordinary meaning of ‘sex’ is biologically male or female; it does not include sexual orientation,” reads the brief, submitted by U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco.

The justices said in April that they will hear three cases involving people who claim they were fired because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

"Treasury yield curve inverts after China tariff pledge, Powell speech, and Trump trade tweets",https://www.marketwatch.com,['Sunny Oh'],08-23-2019,2019,8,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/treasury-yields-tick-higher-ahead-of-powell-speech-2019-08-23,"U.S. Treasury yields fell sharply on Friday after China announced more tariffs on imports of U.S. goods, Federal Reserve chair Powell indicated that lower interest rates were possible, and President Trump “ordered” American companies home, creating even more uncertainty for business planning.

Longer term yields also fell faster than short term yields, inverting the yield curve on a closing basis for the first time.

What are Treasurys doing?

The 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, -4.88% fell 9 basis points to 1.523%, its lowest close since August 2016, contributing to a weekly decline of 1.7 basis points.

The 2-year note rate TMUBMUSD02Y, -5.87% slumped 7.8 basis points to 1.528%, paring its week long rise to 4.9 basis points. The 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, -3.74% plunged 8.8 basis points to 2.018%, trimming its weekly rise to 1.7 basis points. Bond prices move in the opposite direction of yields.

The 2-year note yield closed above the 10-year note yield for the first time since 2007, inverting the so-called yield curve. A lasting inversion of the yield curve can serve as a recession indicator. A recession followed after the last seven inversions of the 2-year/10-year spread.

Opinion: The Fed should heed the bond market and slash interest rates

What’s driving Treasurys?

Government bonds rallied and stocks slumped after China’s finance ministry on Friday said it would impose tariffs on $75 billion of U.S. goods, staggered over two stages. The first batch of tariffs would kick in at Sep. 1, with the second batch coming in at Dec. 15.

Federal Reserve chair Powell in a planned speech said the U.S. central bank would “act as appropriate”, and that he was aware of the downside risks to the U.S. economy including slower global economic growth and trade policy tensions. He, however, held back from promising outright to lower interest rates.

Still, traders on the fed fund futures market all but expect a rate cut at the Fed’s September meeting, according to CME Group data.

President Donald Trump fired back in tweets describing Powell and Chinese President Xi Jinping as enemies, and “ordered” U.S. companies to start moving their supply chains out of China.

The S&P 500 SPX, -2.59% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -2.37% sank on Friday, putting key equity benchmarks on track for losses this week.

Earlier this week, several members of the Federal Open Market Committee including Kansas City Fed President Esther George expressed their opposition to further interest rate cuts. They felt slowing but still healthy economic conditions did not necessitate easier monetary policy.

On the side of the monetary policy doves, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said he would support more interest rate cuts to serve as insurance against growth risks from a contracting manufacturing sectors.

What did market participants’ say?

“Post Powell comments this morning, the rates market’s feeling is that a 25 basis point rate cut for September is completely baked in. The market has gained more comfort on that,” Gary Cameron, portfolio manager at Garda Capital Partners, told MarketWatch.

“As regards to the China tariff story, it doesn’t look like there’s any resolution coming any time soon on the trade front,” said Cameron."
Greg Craig jury hears testimony on DOJ meeting key to his indictment,https://www.politico.com,['Josh Gerstein'],08-23-2019,2019,8,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/23/greg-craig-jury-doj-meeting-1474378,"Former White House counsel Greg Craig is under investigation of allegedly hiding details of his work for the Ukrainian government from the Justice Department. | Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Photo legal Greg Craig jury hears testimony on DOJ meeting key to his indictment

Jurors at Greg Craig’s trial heard their first testimony Friday about a critical meeting where prosecutors say the former Obama White House counsel attempted to trick Justice Department officials into concluding that he did not need to register as a foreign agent.

However, the brief appearance by one of Craig’s former law partners, Kenneth Gross, failed to shed much light on the encounter at the heart of the government’s case: an October 9, 2013 exchange between officials from Justice’s Foreign Agent Registration Act office and attorneys from Craig’s law firm at the time, Skadden Arps.

Story Continued Below

Prosecutors contend Craig asserted at the meeting that his contacts with journalists about a report Skadden prepared on behalf of Ukraine’s government were entirely reactive, meaning that he was solely responding to inquiries and not actively soliciting news coverage about the report. Under FARA, disseminating the report for Ukraine would likely have triggered a requirement to register.

Gross — a prominent election law practitioner in Washington — said he had only a vague recollection of the session, but remembers Craig saying he spoke to reporters to head off inaccurate stories.

“Greg was making the point that the contacts he had with certain press was to correct misinformation that were either printed or about to be printed or he knew was going to be printed and the purpose was to say, that’s not correct — they’re mischaracterizations,” Gross said. “That’s what I remember at that meeting.”

While the meeting is important to the government’s case charging Craig with an attempt to conceal material facts about the Ukraine-focused report, prosecutors are unlikely to be able to prove exactly what the prominent Washington lawyer said at the session.

Gross said he did not take notes and does not believe any of the Skadden lawyers did. The government has also failed to locate any notes taken by the Justice Department officials at the meeting, defense attorneys said.

Craig is accused of dissembling about his actions related to a 186-page report Skadden prepared on Ukraine’s controversial prosecution and conviction of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko. The $4.6 million review was officially commissioned by Ukraine’s Ministry of Justice, but secretly funded by an extraordinarily wealthy Ukrainian steel tubing magnate, Viktor Pinchuk.

Prosecutors have suggested that Craig lied when he said that in all his dealings with reporters he was pushing back against mischaracterizations of the report. The prosecution has argued that when Craig delivered an embargoed copy of the review to New York Times reporter David Sanger’s home on December 11, 2012, the document had not yet been publicly released, so there could be no misinformation to rebut.

But defense lawyers say Craig had seen draft press releases and had other information convincing him that Ukrainian officials and public relations specialists Paul Manafort hired to spin the report were all but certain to distort the findings.

A one-question cross examination by defense attorney William Taylor elicited more testimony from Gross supporting the notion that Craig told the Justice Department officials that some of his comments were intended to prevent inaccuracies in stories that were not yet published.

“I remember something about the timing, either it had been printed or was going to be printed … that it was in a newspaper story [that had] already been published or was about to be published,” Gross said.

After the October 2013 meeting, the FARA enforcement unit at Justice reversed course and told Skadden it would not be required to register.

“I thought Greg had made a very persuasive case,” Gross said. “My sense was it was very well received by the FARA unit and we had a reasonable chance that they might make a determination in our favor.”

Craig’s prosecution is part of stepped up enforcement of FARA by the Justice Department, which named former Mueller prosecutor Brandon Van Grack in March to oversee that effort. Van Grack was on hand watching from the courtroom gallery during some of Friday’s testimony.

Before Gross took the stand, jurors heard about four and a half hours of testimony from another former Skadden partner called as a prosecution witness, Cliff Sloan.

Both Sloan and Craig were deeply involved in the report and the prosecution seemed to be suggesting to jurors that Sloan wanted to take a more conservative approach on some issues, in urging that the firm not hire a public relations firm to handle publicity about the report.

“We’re in this representation as lawyers, not spin doctors, and I think it’s important to say that,” Sloan wrote in an April 2012 email to Craig.

“Good advice,” Craig replied.

However, Sloan — who went on to serve a stint as the Obama administration’s envoy for Guantanamo closure — showed no reticence when it came to urging Craig to demand a large sum for the firm when he met the businessman Manafort lined up to pay for the report.

“Now, THAT is an important meeting. Don’t be bashful about asking for a lot,” Sloan said in one of several emails he read to the jury.

Over time, the funding of the report became a topic of increased controversy in Ukraine, eventually prompting an article in the Kyiv Post whose headline quickly grabbed the attention of the law firm’s public relations team: “Skadden Stink.”

Sloan said he and Craig both wanted to disclose that Pinchuk was paying for the report, but Pinchuk resisted. One email shown to jurors Friday suggested that Craig would have been pleased if someone leaked the businessman’s name to the press.

“I have already told Manafort he has got to get Pinchuk out whether voluntarily or non-voluntarily,” Craig wrote to Sloan in August 2012.

Jurors also saw a message supporting what prosecutors contend was Craig’s primary motive to lie to Justice officials: he was reluctant to register as a foreign agent because it might limit his ability to serve in a high government post in the future.

“I don’t want to register as a foreign agent under FARA. I don’t think there’s a need to with this assignment, yes?” Craig wrote in February 2012.

Messages shown to Sloan and jurors Friday also indicated that he was aware, at least to some degree, that Craig was interacting with the Times’s Sanger about the report.

Craig told Sloan that Sanger was pressing for a quote about a fine distinction in the report: that Skadden’s team didn’t attempt to address whether Tymoshenko’s prosecution was politically motivated, but did conclude she didn’t present the kind of evidence that would get a case tossed out for selective prosecution in the U.S.

“I would stay away from that one. It’s in the report – he can quote from there,” Sloan responded.

Despite Sloan’s advice, Craig wound up giving Sanger a quote on that point — the only quote from Craig that appeared in the Times story.

One email message shown to the jury suggested that after the Justice Department wrote to Skadden seeking more information about its role, Craig and Sloan had some disagreement about the scope of the firm’s response, with Craig favoring a more limited disclosure of other work Skadden was planning or hoping to do for Ukraine’s government.

“I don’t see any request for them to be informed of new or additional agreements,” Craig wrote to Sloan in April 2013. He then seemed to suggest that if Sloan insisted on disclosing that other work, Craig was prepared to take the issue to Skadden’s general counsel to resolve the issue. “Do you agree? If not, we will go to Larry Spiegel,” Craig added.

Prosecutor Molly Gaston led Sloan through a slew of draft memos and emails about proposed responses to Justice Department queries on the Ukraine project. Some of the questions seemed intended to show that Sloan was deferring to Craig in preparing the responses, in particular a passage where Skadden ultimately said it provided the report to a few media outlets between “December 12-13, 2012.”

In fact, Craig delivered the report to Sanger on December 11. The difference appears minor, but since the first stories about the report appeared on December 12, using an earlier date would have made clear that some of Skadden’s contacts preceded public release of the report.

One email from Sloan to Craig specifically urged Craig to double check the dates. “I assume you’re sure about the dates that you provide,” Sloan wrote.

However, defense attorney William Murphy later noted that the Times story explicitly said that Craig granted the Times an interview on December 12 in advance of the report’s release. That would suggest the FARA unit should’ve known Craig spoke to the Times before the report was made public, regardless of any dates in the letter.

“The article seems to indicate that Mr. Craig spoke to the Times before the report was released,” Murphy said.

“Yes, it does seem to show that,” Sloan responded.

Murphy also managed to get Sloan to undercut prosecutors’ suggestions that any interaction with Ukraine’s public relations team may have been improper if Skadden did not intend to register under FARA. Sloan said he thought it would be appropriate to brief the public relations specialists about the contents of the report and that wouldn’t require registering.

By the end of the day Friday, it was unclear whether Sloan’s testimony — and the raft of accompanying exhibits — had actually advanced the prosecution’s case. While some of the evidence seemed unhelpful to Craig, the process of drafting Skadden’s responses involved so many iterations, drafts and individuals that jurors could have trouble being certain that any particular passage in Skadden’s letters to the Justice Department originated with Craig.

“Most of the scribbling on this document is in your handwriting?” Murphy asked, showing jurors a draft covered in scrawled notations, some in red and some in black.

“Yes,” Sloan replied.

A secretary combined the input from both lawyers, Murphy said. “One of them has his embellishments? And one of them has your tweaks?” the defense lawyer asked. “Some of the changes are in blue, some of the strikeouts are in red and some of the questions are in purple, right?”

Sloan insisted he had no inkling as he was discussing responses to the letters of any effort by Craig or anyone else at Skadden to mislead. Sloan is not charged in the case, but Murphy gingerly suggested at one point that perhaps he could have been, noting that another Skadden lawyer proposed that either Sloan or Craig sign the first response to the Justice Department.

“It’s [Craig’s] name that’s been plugged in there,” Murphy said.

“It’s his name on the draft, yes,” Sloan replied.

While the jury will decide if Craig misled the Justice Department, one email made public Friday shows that Craig himself was misled during one of the key events in question — an early conversation with Sanger.

The December 2012 exchange took place soon after Hillary Clinton announced plans to step down as secretary of state. In an email to Sloan shown to jurors Friday, Craig recounts Sanger’s prediction for who would take over at the State Department.

“He thinks it will be Susan and that Dennis will be Deputy,” Craig told his colleague. Sloan said he took the message to mean that Susan Rice would be nominated as secretary of state with Denis McDonough serving as deputy secretary.

Neither was nominated to those jobs. A few days later, it emerged that Obama tapped Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) for the Secretary of State post. The deputy secretary at the time, Bill Burns, served nearly two more years before retiring from the foreign service in 2014. Rice went on to become national security adviser, while McDonough was named as White House chief of staff."
EPA ordered to set stronger smog standards,https://thehill.com,[],08-23-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/458608-epa-ordered-to-set-stronger-smog-standards,"A federal appeals court has ruled in a case battling Obama-era pollution regulations that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must set stronger regulations on smog in order to protect the environment.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found that while the EPA's current air quality standards for ozone are too weak to protect the environment, the standards do meet federal requirements when it comes to protecting human health.

Seth Johnson, an attorney who argued the case on behalf of Earthjustice, said the case gets to the heart of the Clean Air Act’s requirement that the EPA protect forests and natural landscapes from the ozone damage that can inhibit their growth.

The EPA “must go back and fix its mistakes so cherished natural spaces like national parks can thrive,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT

But advocates warned that a win for park was not necessarily a win for people.

“We are disappointed that the court failed to recognize the overwhelming scientific evidence showing ozone’s potential to cause premature death, difficulty breathing, wheezing and coughing, and asthma attacks at levels previously considered safe,” Harold P. Wimmer, national president and CEO of the American Lung Association, said in a statement. “Such evidence demands that EPA adopt stronger, more protective standards, not backslide on the progress being made toward cleaning up the air we breathe.”

While ozone helps create a protective layer in the stratosphere to protect the earth from the sun’s ultraviolet light, when at ground-level, the gas can contribute to asthma attacks and other respiratory issues.

The suit was initially brought by Murray Energy Corporation, one of the largest coal companies in the U.S.

Environmentalists and Democrats alike said the suit showed the importance of scientific evidence at trial.

Johnson said data from the EPA helped it make its case in portions of the suit, while a lack of scientific data hindered it in other areas of the case.

MORE’s EPA considers weakening science-based protections, that fact should give the agency pause as it goes out of its way to either dismantle science advisory boards, or fire independent scientists and replace them with fossil fuel lobbyists,” he said in a statement.

A spokesperson for the EPA said it was reviewing the decision.

The court also rejected the argument from industry groups that the EPA should consider costs incurred by industry groups as they try to comply with regulations.

“The plain text of the [Clean Air] Act unambiguously bars cost considerations,” the opinion said.

Johnson said he expects the EPA will have to consider human health as it reevaluates the standards through 2020."

Congress pumps brakes on Interior push to relocate Bureau of Land Management,https://thehill.com,[],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/458352-congress-pumps-brakes-on-interior-push-to-move-bureau-of-land,"The Interior Department says it is moving ahead with plans to relocate a Washington-based agency to Colorado after getting the green light from Congress, but lawmakers say no such approval has been granted.

The Department of the Interior is preparing to move 27 top officials at the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to new headquarters in Grand Junction, Colo., while scattering other D.C.-based employees to existing offices out West.

The House Appropriations Committee was given 30 days to submit questions to Interior about the move and the reallocation of $5 million to cover related costs.

Lawmakers had a number of questions: What are the benefits to Interior and the American public? What problem will this solve? Why was BLM singled out for this move?

The 30-day period ended on Aug. 15, and Interior says it will now proceed with plans to move about 300 employees to Western states after answering all questions from lawmakers.

But some lawmakers beg to differ.

“The administration’s characterization of Congress having ‘blessed’ BLM’s relocation plan is false,” Amanda Yanchury, spokeswoman for Rep. Betty McCollum Betty Louise McCollumDemocrats object to Interior plans to move BLM out west Congress pumps brakes on Interior push to relocate Bureau of Land Management Here are the 95 Democrats who voted to support impeachment MORE (D-Minn.), chairwoman of the House Appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over the Interior Department, said in a statement to The Hill.

“Interior’s initial relocation plan was significantly lacking in the details necessary for the Committee to evaluate this proposal. That’s why Congress, in a bipartisan and bicameral manner, requested more information — to ensure the transparency and accountability of the administration’s actions,” she added.

BLM argues the move will position its staff closer to the lands the agency manages, but critics contend it will simply move high-level career staff out of D.C. and further away from the corridors of power, following a similar decision to relocate Department of Agriculture (USDA) research staff to a new outpost in the Kansas City area.

Chellie Pingree Rochelle (Chellie) PingreeCongress pumps brakes on Interior push to relocate Bureau of Land Management Overnight Energy: Changing climate boosts Maine lobster industry -- for now | 2020 Dems debate climate response at Detroit debate | Dem asks for perjury investigation into Interior nominee Changing climate boosts Maine lobster industry — for now MORE (D-Maine), who serves on the House Appropriations Committee, said in a statement to The Hill.

“As we’ve seen with affected USDA researchers, uprooting employees is this administration’s strategy for eliminating branches of government since it creates hardship and people are forced to quit,” she added. “It’s outrageous that this administration has now targeted BLM employees because the Interior Secretary— a former coal and mining lobbyist—doesn’t believe in the agency’s mission of preserving public lands.”

BLM retirees penned a letter to lawmakers on Tuesday arguing the move would “functionally dismantle” the agency. They also asked the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to hold a hearing on the move.

About 4 percent of BLM’s 10,000 employees are based in Washington. Nearly all of them would be transferred elsewhere under Interior’s plan, leaving just 61 workers in Washington, according to a memo to Congress from Interior.

""Now that the Department of the Interior has met its commitment to provide Congress with an opportunity to review its reorganization plan for the Bureau of Land Management, we look forward to moving ahead with a thoughtfully considered and carefully developed plan that will place the BLM's leadership closer to the lands and resources they manage,” an Interior spokesperson said in a statement to The Hill.

""We have answered every single question asked by the Committee. No additional follow up questions were received,"" the agency said.

But details beyond what is covered by Interior’s July 16 memo have been sparse.

Lawmakers say their questions range from basic logistics like finding office space and the overall timeline to bigger picture questions like whether it is even legal to move the agency’s headquarters without congressional approval.

Those concerns were expressed in a “four corners letter” signed by majority and minority appropriations leaders in both chambers.

“It’s absurd for the administration to assume Congressional approval when the Committee has not yet received sufficient answers to outstanding questions about the plan’s feasibility, costs, legality, and personnel issues. This is clearly an attempt by the Trump administration to steamroll ahead with this plan without regard to the concerns of a co-equal branch of government,” said Yanchury, McCollum's spokeswoman.

House Appropriations Committee staffers say talks with BLM about the request are ongoing and that the congressional panels were under no obligation to meet a 30-day timeline for approving BLM’s financial plans related to the relocation effort.

Interior has brushed aside legal concerns surrounding the move and has not answered several questions about when employees will have to decide whether they will accept the reassignment and when the new headquarters in Grand Junction will be open.

William Pendley, the top official at BLM, told staff in an email obtained by The Hill that they can expect more details soon.

“During the last 30 days, we have continued to develop an implementation plan for the move while ensuring the continuity of operations across the Bureau of Land Management. This email is to let you know that more information will be forthcoming shortly,” Pendley wrote on Aug. 16. “We look forward to working with you to make the process as smooth and transparent for everyone as possible.”

Democrats also have questions over whether the move is legal.

McCollum’s office pointed to a section of federal law that says “all offices attached to the seat of government shall be exercised in the District of Columbia, and not elsewhere, except as otherwise provided by law.”

In a response to McCollum shared with The Hill, Interior noted that agencies like the Food and Drug Administration are headquartered outside D.C., in the nearby suburbs.

Interior said an office attached to the seat of government should be interpreted as “an executive department, a term defined elsewhere in the U.S. Code to include the Department of the Interior, but not its component parts.”

“The provision referenced by your staff is not a bar to making this change, which will promote greater efficiency and use of taxpayer resources,” Cole Rojewski, director of Interior’s Office of Congressional and Legislative Affairs, wrote to McCollum, adding that having every federal government office located in D.C. would be “impractical and unreasonable.”

Disagreement over the move is expected to spill into September as lawmakers work on appropriations for fiscal 2020, which begins on Oct 1. The House Natural Resources Committee will also hold a hearing in September to discuss the planning process behind BLM’s move.

Senior DHS official exits amid department leadership changes,https://www.cnn.com,['Geneva Sands'],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/22/politics/dhs-andrew-meehan-leaving/index.html,"(CNN) A senior official in the Department of Homeland Security will leave the agency next month, marking the latest top DHS official to leave the administration in recent months.

Acting DHS public affairs Assistant Secretary Andrew Meehan decided to resign two weeks ago and his last day will be Sept. 20, according to a DHS official. Meehan has been a close confidant of acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan, joining him at DHS headquarters to run the public affairs office.

Meehan, who also oversaw public affairs at Customs and Border Protection, is the latest public affairs official expected to leave the department. Earlier this week, Customs and Border Protection press secretary Katharine Gorka told CNN she was leaving her post at the end of the week. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Assistant Director of Public Affairs Carol Danko recently left the agency amid pressure from DHS, according to a source familiar with the decision.

Meehan's departure comes amid speculation that McAleenan won't last in the secretary role. Earlier this summer, McAleenan went to the White House prepared to resign, CNN reported. He was concerned about an immigration enforcement operation and felt he was being undermined by subordinate immigration hardliners who had a direct line to the President.

Meehan is in Panama this week with McAleenan for a ministerial meeting focused on enhancing regional cooperation and combating irregular migration. This, after a tense week between the White House and DHS over the rollout of a new rule on migrant children in government custody , according to a source familiar with the matter. The source said the White House had asked McAleenan to delay his departure for Panama to hold a news conference about the rule.

Meehan's resignation was not connected to the rollout, according to a source.

A separate source familiar with the situation told CNN that ""micromanagement by White House officials have made it close to impossible for the department to carry out its mission.""

Senior policy adviser Stephen ""Miller and others will bypass leadership and communicate directly with lower level staff whom they view as controllable and direct actions. No organization can operate that way and we should expect more senior officials to leave,"" the source said.

Oregon Justice Department Warns Supreme Court About Scrapping Unanimous Juries,https://www.opb.org,['Conrad'],,,,https://www.opb.org/news/article/oregon-justice-department-supreme-court-scrapping-non-unamious-juries/,"Oregon Department of Justice officials said Friday that “convictions in hundreds if not thousands of cases” would be invalidated if the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the state’s unique non-unanimous jury law.

In a friend of the court brief, state lawyers didn’t directly defend the state’s controversial non-unanimous jury system, but they did issue a warning about the potential disruption the nation’s highest court could have should it decide to overturn a 47-year-old ruling.

In October, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear Ramos v. Louisiana, which stems from a 2014 murder in New Orleans. Whatever the court rules, the outcome will almost certainly be widely felt in Oregon, the lone state in the country where criminal felony cases are still decided by non-unanimous juries.

RELATED COVERAGE Bill To Put Non-Unanimous Juries Before Voters Fails To Make It Out Of Oregon Legislature

Last year, Oregon became the last state in the country that allows jurors to reach non-unanimous verdicts in criminal felony cases, after voters in Louisiana changed their state’s constitution and scrap split jury verdicts.

Oregon’s legal position before the court comes down on the side of asking the justices to uphold the conviction of a Louisiana man who was found guilty by a 10-2 verdict before voters there ended non-unanimous juries.

In Ramos, justices will decide whether to overturn a 1972 Supreme Court ruling, Apodaca v. Oregon that found non-unanimous juries in state criminal courts are permitted under the U.S. Constitution.

The case asks whether the “Sixth Amendment, as incorporated through the Fourteenth Amendment, guarantees State criminal defendants the right to a unanimous jury verdict.” The court could use its sweeping powers to abolish non-unanimous juries, uphold them or find some middle ground.

The Justice Department’s amicus brief comes as Oregon’s political leaders as well as much of the state’s legal community are largely unified in their desire to abolish non-unanimous juries in future trials. Earlier this year, Oregon lawmakers tabled a bill to put the issue before voters, in part because they wanted to see how the U.S. Supreme Court would rule and possibly negating the need for a costly ballot measure campaign.

Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum acknowledges her own mixed feelings about the high court reviewing Oregon’s law, and the potential consequences of its decision.

“If I could’ve not had to write this brief, I’d be very happy, and I would prefer to move forward, and change our law – change our Constitution,” Rosenblum told OPB.

The state’s friend of court brief has raised questions for some about Rosenblum, who has expressed support for ending non-unanimous juries, but now seems to be warning against their demise.

“If this Court were to overrule Apodaca, it would invalidate convictions in hundreds if not thousands of cases,” Rosenblum, Solicitor General Benjamin Gutman and other state lawyers wrote. “The state’s trial, appellate, and post conviction courts would be flooded with non-unamity claims to resolve and overwhelmed by the staggering number of cases that would have to retried.”

The authors note that their 43-page brief is not a discussion about whether Apodaca was correctly decided. “Nor does the brief contend that a non-unanimous jury rule is preferable to a unanimous jury rule,” they write. But the majority of the document discusses the state’s concerns and potential consequences should the Supreme Court overturn Apodaca.

While the federal government and 49 other states require all jurors to agree on a verdict, in Oregon it only takes 10 of 12 jurors to convict. The only exceptions are murder and aggravated murder cases, which require unanimous verdicts.

Earlier this year, Rosenblum’s staff told lawmakers that the state’s jury system was “out of step with criminal justice in the rest of the country.” Her office urged the Legislature to pass the bill putting non-unanimous juries before voters.

On May 6, Aaron Knott, the Justice Department’s legislative director, submitted written testimony to the House Rules Committee in support of the bill. In his testimony, Knott lamented Oregon’s unique situation.

“This status is all the more troublesome because the practice of allowing a conviction with less than a full unanimous vote has been linked with the historical exclusion of diverse viewpoints,” Knott wrote. “Requiring unanimous juries ensures fair representation, promotes systemic accountability and legitimacy, and brings Oregon in line with all 49 of our sister states.”

In a statement Friday, Rosenblum reiterated her support for repealing non-unanimous juries.

“That is why I support referring an Oregon constitutional amendment to voters that would change Oregon’s law going forward,” Rosenblum said. “But it is important that the U.S. Supreme Court understand the practical consequences should it reverse its decades-old determination that the United States Constitution allows non-unanimous verdicts.”



“Reinterpreting federal constitutional requirements after 40-plus years would call into question thousands of settled criminal cases, and could require new trials in hundreds, if not thousands, of cases.”

Rosenblum said her Supreme Court filing doesn’t argue that non-unanimous juries are sound policy.

“The brief in no way undercuts my view that Oregon should require juror unanimity in criminal cases going forward,” she said.

“I fully support repealing our non-unanimous jury rule, but just not in this way,” she told OPB Friday.

Lewis and Clark Law professor Aliza Kaplan, who tracked the racist history of Oregon’s law in a law review article, said she takes issue with the number of cases the Justice Department estimate would need to be retried.

“If Ramos is successful it would lead to approximately 50 cases in Louisiana needing to be retried,” Kaplan said. “So it’s hard for me to imagine that Oregon has hundreds or thousands of cases at issue as the attorney general says in her brief.”

While the Justice Department’s filing reflects the state’s official legal opinion, it’s not the only brief from Oregon regarding the case.

In June, a group of former state Supreme Court justices, Court of Appeals judges, law school deans and governors signed onto an amicus brief urging the court to overturn Apodaca and rule that non-unanimous juries are not constitutional.

Oregon Gov. Kate Brown also urged the court to end non-unanimous verdicts.

“The governor regrets that Oregon is the only state left in the country that will permit somebody to be convicted of a crime and deprive someone of their liberty, on a vote of a non-unanimous jury,” said Misha Isaak, general counsel for Brown. “Governor Brown’s position is that it should not be that way and she is interested in seeing a policy change whether that happens in the legislature and the ballot box, or it happens through a court decision.”

“Unlike Gov. Brown and the attorneys general from a number of states that wrote in support of ending non-unanimous juries in this case, the Oregon attorney general decided to hide behind fear mongering and a retrograde practice born from Oregon’s racist past, a practice her own office has said ‘exacerbates racial disparities,’” Kaplan said.

In Louisiana, split juries date back to the post-Civil War era. They were unveiled in what’s known as the “Constitution of White Supremacy” and have long served as a final remnant of Jim Crow laws. The amendment allowing non-unanimous verdicts was designed to make it easier to convict black defendants so the state’s white landowners had access to cheap prison labor.

In Oregon, voters created the non-unanimous verdict policy in 1934, at a time when anti-immigrant sentiment was high and the Ku Klux Klan was powerful in the state. It too sought to silence the voices of select jurors, and make it easier to convict.

Critics of non-unanimous verdicts argue they allow for convictions when there’s doubt and stop the deliberative process on juries. They also say they silence two jurors, sometimes people of color. The concern, Kaplan said, is that Oregon’s system can deny defendants of color a jury of their peers.

“Just by the very nature of our demographics we are possibly putting those minority jurors of being in a position where their voices don’t count at all,” Kaplan said.

Supporters of non-unanimous juries – which until recently included the Oregon District Attorneys Association – have pushed back on Kaplan’s analysis. They argue non-unanimous verdicts prevent hung juries and ultimately lead to a more efficient criminal justice system.

Controversial husband and wife EPA duo to leave Washington,https://thehill.com,[],08-23-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/458605-controversial-husband-and-wife-epa-duo-to-leave-washington,"A controversial husband and wife political duo is leaving the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) D.C. office after nearly two years working there during the Trump administration.

While negotiating his job at EPA in May 2017, Henry Darwin also pitched a role for his wife, who he called a “legitimate environmental professional,"" according to internal emails obtained by ABC.

""It would help our financial decision immensely,"" Darwin wrote to EPA Chief of staff Ryan Jackson in the email. ""If not out of the question, I would be happy to forward her resume and references (which I would suggest you check - everyone loves her almost as much as I do).""

The former Arizona state official’s wife Veronica Darwin was later hired to be a senior adviser to the administrator for Land and Emergency Management.

Pruitt later came under fire for using his position at EPA to try to get jobs for close acquaintances, including a clerking internship for his daughter at the White House and a job for his wife opening up a Chick-fil-A franchise.

Wheeler in his email Friday said Henry Darwin will be stepping down from his role and will once again take the title of assistant deputy administrator at EPA. In the role he will “concentrate on the deployment of EPA’s Lean Management System (ELMS)” which he will do from Arizona.

“Given the amount of time he already spends traveling to the regional offices to deploy ELMS, his relocation to Phoenix should not impact his ability to help us become even more effective in carrying out our very important mission. In addition, Henry will be here at headquarters on a regular basis,” Wheeler wrote.

Wheeler announced Veronica Darwin left the agency on Aug. 9.

“While at EPA, Veronica managed implementation of the Superfund Task Force recommendations, and led other Administrator priorities like children’s health, and the development of the action plan for lead. These key initiatives will remain Administrator priorities, however Veronica’s leadership will be greatly missed,” wrote Wheeler.

EPA did not respond to a request for comment on the nature of the departures."
"DHS moves to end limits on detention of migrant families, close 'loophole'",https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dhs-detention-migrant-families,"The Trump administration announced Wednesday it would move to scrap a major court agreement in order to allow for migrant families to be detained longer as their cases are being considered, instead of having to release them after 20 days.

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, in a press conference detailing the decision, claimed that the long-standing court order known as the Flores agreement has incentivized illegal immigration and represents a ""loophole"" in the immigration system.

That agreement prohibited children from being kept in detention for more than 20 days. As a result, officials were releasing entire families to keep them from being separated -- though last year, the administration did separate families as part of a ""zero tolerance"" program that eventually was stopped amid a bipartisan outcry.

BORDER PATROL NABS NEARLY 200 CENTRAL AMERICAN MIGRANTS NEAR NEW MEXICO PORT OF ENTRY

""Today, the government has issued a critical rule that will permit the Department of Homeland Security to appropriately hold families together and improve the integrity of the immigration system,” McAleenan said. “This rule allows the federal government to enforce immigration laws as passed by Congress and ensures that all children in U.S. government custody are treated with dignity, respect, and special concern for their particular vulnerability.”

The Flores ruling came about as a result of a 1980s case in which a girl named Jenny Flores, then 15, was detained with adults by U.S. authorities after she fled El Salvador. Beginning in 1997, the Flores settlement called for migrant children to be sent to care programs after 20 days, and be given access to medical treatment and visits with relatives. McAleenan said the new rule takes the place of Flores, while keeping many of its terms.

The new rule is slated to go into effect in 60 days, though the change is sure to face a new court challenge.

In July, at a House Oversight Committee hearing on Capitol Hill, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., accused McAleenan and other administration officials of seeking to scrap the Flores Settlement, with the alleged goal ""to keep kids longer"" in custody.

McAleenan pushed back against that characterization. He explained that he wanted to keep families together for the time necessary it takes for immigration proceedings to go through, and for the justice system to make a ruling on the case.

“We want to keep families together through an immigration proceeding that's fair and expeditious in an appropriate setting,” he said. “That can't be done in 20 days with due process.""

Democrats have slammed the detentions as “inhumane."" When the new rule was announced, the ACLU called it ""another cruel attack on children,"" by allowing them to be held for longer than previously allowed.

""The government should NOT be jailing kids, and certainly shouldn’t be seeking to put more kids in jail for longer,"" they said.

Democratic presidential candidate Julián Castro vowed to end all detention if he wins the presidency.

""Separating migrant children from their parents is appalling—but indefinitely detaining families isn’t a better alternative,"" he tweeted after McAleenan's announcement.

Republicans such as Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have claimed that the current system has resulted in children being used, repeatedly, by adults posing as family members to get into the U.S.

“This is a sick system, it’s rotten to its core,” Graham told Fox Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo in July, stating that 30 percent of those who cross into the U.S. with children are “fake families,” and that loopholes are used to let the same children come back over and over, bringing different adults with them.

McAleenan said approximately 6,000 migrants fraudulently presented themselves as families in the past fiscal year.

""No child should be a pawn in a scheme to manipulate our immigration system,"" he said.

In addition to putting an end to the 20-day limit, the plans announced Wednesday also set standards for detention facilities, which have been criticized by members of both parties for not having sufficient resources to keep people in proper living conditions.

""The new rule establishes a high national standard for care of children and families in custody,"" McAleenan said, noting that maintaining proper standards of care is a ""core"" element of the new rule.

Pompeo held the call with Danish Minister of Foreign Affairs Jeppe Kofod Wednesday to discuss President Donald Trump's canceled state visit to the country, which had been scheduled to take place in early September.

""The Secretary expressed appreciation for Denmark's cooperation as one of the United States' allies and Denmark's contributions to address shared global security priorities,"" U.S. Department of State spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said in a statement.

""The Secretary and Foreign Minister Kofod also discussed strengthening cooperation with the Kingdom of Denmark — including Greenland — in the Arctic.""

Denmark's Kofod said Wednesday that the conversation had been ""frank, friendly and constructive"" and affirmed the two nations' strong bond.

""(The) U.S. and Denmark are close friends and allies with a long history of active engagement across (the) globe,"" he said on Twitter. ""(We) agreed to stay in touch on full range of issues of mutual interest.""

Trump surprised Danish officials on Tuesday when he took to Twitter to announce he would no longer go to Denmark next month, with the president later dubbing Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen ""nasty"" for her response to his idea that the U.S. could purchase Greenland. On Sunday, Frederiksen said Trump's suggestion of purchasing the territory was ""absurd,"" telling Greenland's Sermitsiaq newspaper that ""Greenland is not for sale.""

Tabbador wrote that the article ""directly attacks"" immigration judges ""with racial and ethnically tinged slurs,"" and the label 'Kritarch,'"" according to BuzzFeed. ""The reference to Kritarch in a negative tone is deeply offensive and Anti-Semitic,"" Tabbador added.

Kritarch is a term derived from the concept of a ""kritarchy,"" or a society run by judges. It's referenced in the Old Testament's Book of Judges as a type of rule in ancient Israel. VDare has repeatedly used the term to pejoratively refer to immigration judges.

Defense Department Official Stresses CBD Ban For Military Members,https://www.marijuanamoment.net,['Kyle Jaeger'],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.marijuanamoment.net/defense-department-official-stresses-cbd-ban-for-military-members/,"South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg released a comprehensive plan on Friday that calls for “decriminalizing all drug possession” in his first presidential term as a means to combat the opioid epidemic and treat addiction as a public health, rather than criminal justice, issue.

Decriminalization is just one action the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate said he’d pursue in order to reform the country’s mental health care system and bolster substance abuse treatment. His plan also includes proposals to reduce sentences for drug offenses other than possession, increase access to the opioid overdose reversal drug naloxone and make it easier to implement syringe exchange programs.

America’s addiction and mental health care crisis has been building for decades—due to decades of neglect by political leaders in Washington. Today, I’m proposing a new approach that tackles this crisis with the urgency and care it deserves. pic.twitter.com/U8F9DXJPC2 — Pete Buttigieg (@PeteButtigieg) August 23, 2019

Buttigieg’s “Healing and Belonging in America” plan emphasizes the need to divert people suffering from addiction away from prisons and into treatment. He said he’d accomplish that by expanding diversionary programs and evidence-based training “for drug courts, mental health courts, and other alternatives to incarceration for justice-involved persons.”

The goal of decriminalization and diversion is to reduce “the number of people incarcerated due to mental illness or substance use by 75 percent in the first term.”

Our country is in the midst of a mental health and addiction crisis, worsened by decades of stigma and political neglect. I’ll bring a new approach, rooted in commitment and community, to tackle this crisis with the urgency it deserves. https://t.co/spBoh5KH4X — Pete Buttigieg (@PeteButtigieg) August 23, 2019

Under his plan, sentencing reform for drug offenses other than possession would be applied retroactively and coupled with expungements for past convictions. Buttigieg pointed to research demonstrating that “incarceration for drug offenses has no effect on drug misuse, drug arrests, or overdose deaths” and instead “actually increases the rate of overdose deaths.”

“We cannot incarcerate ourselves out of this public health problem.”

“To ensure that people with a mental illness or substance use disorder can heal, we will decriminalize these conditions,” the proposal states. “When someone is undergoing a crisis or is caught using a drug, they should be treated by a health professional rather than punished in a jail cell.”

“All presidential candidates should join Pete Buttigieg in recognizing that the criminalization of people for their drug use is wrong and simply bad policy,” Maria McFarland Sánchez-Moreno, executive director of the Drug Policy Action, said in a press release. “Possession of drugs for personal use is the single most arrested offense in the United States, eclipsing arrest rates for any other offense. With overdose numbers skyrocketing and entire communities, disproportionately black or brown, suffering from criminalization, it’s time for policymakers to shift gears. Taking an evidence-based, health-centered approach to address this crisis is not only true leadership – it’s common sense.”

The mayor also made harm reduction policies a key component of his strategy. He said take-home naloxone programs would be expanded to all 50 states by 2024 and that harm reduction services would be expanded “to reduce overdose deaths and the spread of infectious diseases related to needle sharing.”

The plan would make naloxone “broadly available in order to reverse overdoses” and remove “legislative and regulatory restrictions on the use of federal funds for syringe service programs.”

Buttigieg said the federal government should provide funding for state and local health departments to purchase the medication, make sure that it’s “available in public spaces and workplaces” similar to first aid kids and encourage “co-prescribing of naloxone with opioids, either by individual physicians or direct dispensing by pharmacists.”

Existing federal law makes it difficult to establish syringe exchange programs, in part because federal funds can’t be used to buy needles. The restrictions “hamper state and local responses, both because they limit resources and because they convey a negative message about the value of these programs, despite overwhelming scientific evidence that they can prevent transmission of HIV and hepatitis.”

In addition to lifting those barriers, the candidate said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “would also work with states to remove any criminal liability for those participating in” syringe exchange programs.

“Harm reduction programs are a critical part of any effective response to the opioid and injection drug use crisis. They minimize the negative impact of drug use without encouraging it, while reducing other side effects of drug use. In particular, this means access to syringe service programs for people who inject drugs, that link them to treatment, and provides access to sterile syringes. These programs help prevent transmission of HIV, viral hepatitis, and other infectious diseases associated with needle sharing, and reduce overdoses by deploying medication such as naloxone that help reverse the effects of opioids.”

One harm reduction policy that didn’t make the cut in Buttigieg’s plan is safe injection sites, where people could use illicit drugs under the supervision of medical professionals who could reverse overdoses and recommend treatment options. Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who are also running for the Democratic nomination, both proposed legalizing such facilities as part of criminal justice reform plans they released this month.

“Decades of failed mental health and addiction policy, coupled with mass incarceration that criminalized mental illness and drug use, have left us with a mental health and addiction care system so broken that today there are more people with serious mental illness in prisons than in treatment facilities,” Buttigieg said.

The candidate also made ending incarceration for drug possession—as well as legalizing marijuana—central principles of his previously released criminal justice reform plan, which he released last month.

But while the prior plan did not explicitly describe the move as “decriminalizing” drugs, even though advocates commonly use that word to refer to policies that remove the threat of being imprisoned for possession, the new document does use that terminology—signaling a shift in clarity as Buttigieg continues to develop his campaign messaging.

In other instances, he borrowed language from his criminal justice reform plan, specifically as it concerns how criminalizing drug use can increase rates of overdose, for his mental health proposal.

“Despite equal rates of use, Black Americans are nearly four times as likely to be arrested for using marijuana,” the criminal justice plan states. “Research shows that incarceration for drug offenses has no effect on drug misuse, drug arrests, or overdose deaths. In fact, some studies show that incarceration actually increases the rate of overdose deaths.”

Buttigieg mentioned that, as with drug offenses, black people are also more likely to die from overdoses. And that’s due to “the current broken system that criminalizes mental illness and addiction” that was “built during the crack epidemic of the 1980s.”

Former VA pathologist charged in deaths of 3 veterans,https://www.cbsnews.com,[],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dr-robert-levy-former-va-pathologist-charged-in-deaths-of-3-veterans/,"Little Rock, Arkansas — A pathologist fired from an Arkansas veterans hospital after officials said he had been impaired while on duty was charged Tuesday with involuntary manslaughter in the deaths of three patients. Authorities say he misdiagnosed them and altered their records to try to conceal his mistakes.

A grand jury indictment unsealed Tuesday charged Dr. Robert Morris Levy in the patients' deaths and on multiple charges of fraud and making false statements for his alleged attempts to conceal his substance abuse and incorrect diagnoses.

""In doing so, he was allowed to stay employed with the Veterans Administration, thus earning a salary, benefits and possibly a bonus,"" Duane Kees, the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Arkansas, said at a news conference in Fayetteville, referring to the Department of Veterans Affairs by its former name.

Levy, 53, who worked at the Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks in Fayetteville, was paid an annual salary of $225,000, according to the indictment. He was fired from the hospital in April 2018.

In this Aug. 17, 2019, file photo provided by the Washington County, Arkansas Sheriff's Department, Robert Levy is pictured in a booking photo. Washington County Sheriff's Dept.

VA officials said in January that outside pathologists reviewed nearly 34,000 cases handled by Levy and found more than 3,000 errors or missed diagnoses dating back to 2005. Levy has acknowledged that he once showed up to work at the Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks drunk in 2016, but he denied that he had worked while impaired. He entered an in-patient treatment program following that incident and returned to work in October 2016 after agreeing to remain sober and submitting to random drug testing.

Levy, who was being held at the Washington County jail, pleaded not guilty at a hearing Tuesday. Kees said that as of Tuesday morning, Levy had not obtained counsel to represent him in the case.

In the deaths, Levy is accused of falsifying entries in his patients' records after making incorrect and misleading diagnoses. In one case, a patient died of prostate cancer after Levy determined that his biopsy showed he didn't have cancer, prosecutors allege.

Prosecutors say a second patient died of squamous cell carcinoma after Levy misdiagnosed the patient with another form of carcinoma. In a third case, the indictment says, a patient with small cell carcinoma was treated for a type of cancer he didn't have following an incorrect diagnosis by Levy, and died.

In two cases, he's accused of falsifying patients' medical records to state that a second pathologist agreed with his diagnosis.

Prosecutors say Levy received bonuses in 2016 and 2017 that were based in part on him reporting that his clinical errors were less than 5%. But, according the indictment, almost 10% of the diagnoses he made had clinical errors.

""These charges send a clear signal that anyone entrusted with the care of veterans will be held accountable for placing them at risk by working while impaired or through other misconduct,"" VA Inspector General Michael Missal said.

Levy ingested 2-methyl-2-butanol, a chemical that would intoxicate him but that standard drug and alcohol screenings don't test for, according to the indictment. Levy is accused of lying to hospital officials when he told them he wasn't under the influence of any intoxicants. Levy is charged with multiple counts of mail and wire fraud for his purchase of the chemical.

U.S. Attorney Kees said at a news conference Levy ""had the medical expertise, the knowledge, the skill set and the equipment to know exactly how much of this substance to take. He had the equipment to measure it out precisely, and he had the knowledge to know how to ingest it so it wouldn't be fatal.""

The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) said that ingesting between 18 and 27 grams of the chemical can produce signs of intoxication and cause unconsciousness after only 30 minutes, according to CBS Fort Smith, Arkansas, affiliate KFSM-TV. The NCBI also reportedly said that the effects can persist until the next day, and can include daylong sleeping and weeks of recovery.

If convicted of all counts, Levy faces a sentence of up to 524 years in prison and $7.75 million in fines, Kees said."
Georgia poultry industry to receive USDA aid tied to China trade war,https://www.ajc.com,[],,,,https://www.ajc.com/business/georgia-poultry-industry-receive-usda-aid-tied-china-trade-war/jliXrHFrYHqgBCbuRhf70I/,"Georgia’s poultry industry looks likely to receive a meaty portion of the coming aid package from the government aimed at softening the blow from the trade war with China, according to U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue.

Roughly $432 million will be dispersed to the industry by the U.S Department of Agriculture with much of that money presumably going to Georgia, the nation’s largest poultry producer.

The program — parallel to previous bailouts aimed more at Midwestern farmers — was announced last month as the trade battle with China escalated. Some details about how the money would be apportioned were issued today by Perdue, but exactly how much would come to Georgia is not clear.

Overall, the spending is meant to mitigate the impact of China’s retaliatory tariffs, said Perdue, a former Georgia governor, in a statement Friday. “Our support package ensures farmers will not stand alone in facing unjustified retaliatory tariffs while President Trump continues working to solidify better and stronger trade deals around the globe.”

As the trade imbroglio intensified this summer, the Chinese government vowed to stop buying the products of American agriculture. In response, the USDA last month announced a $16 billion package of payments to U.S. producers.

The USDA also said it would purchase $1.4 billion worth of “surplus commodities” like fruits, vegetables, beef, pork, lamb, milk and poultry — food that would be distributed to food banks and schools. According to the details released Friday, nearly a third is being earmarked for poultry, which spans chicken, turkey and eggs.

Officials at the Georgia Poultry Federation and the Stone Mountain-based USA Poultry & Egg Export Council declined comment, saying they did not have enough information about the USDA payments.

But Tom Super, senior vice president at the National Chicken Council, said the industry has been struggling with surpluses since being shut out of the China market completely in 2015 after an outbreak of avian influenza.

“We lost considerable market share,” he said. “We had $715 million in exports (of chicken) to China at the peak.”

Government payments are welcome, he said. “Every little bit helps. There is definitely a lot of chicken on the market.”

Georgia would likely receive a proportional share of the government money, Super said.

Ultimately, the chicken producers want access to China, he said. “We haven’t been able to get back into the market and the current political situation doesn’t help us to get back in.”

Georgia’s poultry industry employs thousands of workers. The state accounts for about 15% of all the chickens raised in the United States, but only a much smaller fraction of the turkeys raised, according to government data.

The most recent available statistics show the state’s chicken production is valued at about $4.42 billion — more than twice as much as cotton, peanuts and pecans combined.

Trump says his mileage rules make cars safer. His EPA was worried they will kill more people.,https://www.vox.com,['Aug'],08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.vox.com/2019/8/21/20826601/trump-auto-company-fuel-economy-california,"President Trump on Wednesday tweeted a defense of his administration’s weakening of fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks, citing safety benefits. It’s a change that automakers have already said they don’t want. And according to internal emails from the Environmental Protection Agency released in 2018, the rule change would increase highway fatalities.

In fact, four car companies — Volkswagen, BMW, Ford, and Honda — signed a surprise deal with the state of California earlier this summer to set stricter mileage rules for themselves than what the Trump administration proposed.

My proposal to the politically correct Automobile Companies would lower the average price of a car to consumers by more than $3000, while at the same time making the cars substantially safer. Engines would run smoother. Very little impact on the environment! Foolish executives! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 21, 2019

According to the New York Times, this sudden side deal with California so infuriated the White House that a senior official summoned leaders from Toyota, Fiat Chrysler, and General Motors in July to pressure them to support the administration’s policy.

But once the deal was announced, several other car companies said they were open to signing on as well. Mercedes-Benz is now preparing to join the California accord, the New York Times reported.

The California agreement would put car companies on course to average 51 miles per gallon across all their sales by 2026. This is weaker than the standard set under President Obama, but much stronger than Trump’s proposal.

The Obama rules restricted tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide from light-duty vehicles but gave companies several ways to comply. Meeting that target just by increasing fuel economy would have required car companies to average 54.5 miles per gallon across sales of cars, trucks, SUVs, and crossovers by 2025.

Some car companies thought this target was too aggressive, so when Trump came to office, these manufacturers petitioned to have the standard revised. But carmakers got way more than they bargained for: The Trump administration decided to freeze mileage standards after 2020, which would hold average fuel economy at just 37 miles per gallon.

The state of California, which has a waiver from federal rules to set its own emissions standards, said it wanted to uphold the Obama benchmark. In response, the EPA threatened to revoke California’s waiver.

That put California and the federal government on a collision course, with car manufacturers in the middle. California is the largest market for new cars in the United States, so it’s impossible for carmakers to ignore. Another 13 states and the District of Columbia have also adopted California’s vehicle emissions standards.

So auto companies were faced with the prospect of having two very different standards to meet across the country, or having to wait for the dust to settle from what was sure to be a long, messy legal fight.

To justify the rollback, the Trump administration has cited safety as its main concern. The reasoning is that new cars are safer than old cars, but forcing carmakers to meet tougher efficiency rules makes new cars more expensive. That means people end up driving their older, less safe cars for longer, according to the EPA’s published analysis.

The EPA publicly said the Trump rule change would save 1,000 lives per year, but an internal email from staffers obtained by the Associated Press showed that they expected the revision to actually increase highway deaths by 17 per year, undermining the EPA’s bizarre rationale.

Increasing fuel economy is an important tool for limiting air pollution and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The transportation sector is now the largest source of carbon dioxide in the United States. Cars and trucks account for about 20 percent of all US carbon emissions.

So why is the Trump administration so insistent on relaxing a regulation beyond what the auto industry wants? Because oil producers want cars and trucks to use more fuel. As the New York Times reported in December, oil companies see higher fuel efficiency standards as a threat:

The industry had reason to urge the rollback of higher fuel efficiency standards proposed by former President Barack Obama. A quarter of the world’s oil is used to power cars, and less-thirsty vehicles mean lower gasoline sales. In recent months, Marathon Petroleum also teamed up with the American Legislative Exchange Council, a secretive policy group financed by corporations as well as the Koch network, to draft legislation for states supporting the industry’s position. Its proposed resolution, dated Sept. 18, describes current fuel-efficiency rules as “a relic of a disproven narrative of resource scarcity” and says “unelected bureaucrats” shouldn’t dictate the cars Americans drive.

But as the recent California deal shows, car companies would prefer to have stable regulations, even if it means a tougher standard for themselves.

Correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the scope of California’s waiver from federal air quality rules."
DOJ: Immigration facility shouldn’t have to pay minimum wage,https://www.seattletimes.com,"['Gene Johnson', 'The Associated Press']",08-23-2019,2019,8,https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/feds-say-tacoma-immigration-detention-site-shouldnt-have-to-pay-minimum-wage/,"SEATTLE (AP) — The Trump administration is opposing Washington state’s effort to make a privately run, for-profit immigration detention center pay detainees minimum wage for the work they do.

Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson sued The GEO Group in 2017, saying its Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma must pay the state minimum wage to detainees who perform kitchen, laundry, janitorial, maintenance and barbershop tasks. The lawsuit seeks to force GEO to turn over profits it gained by underpaying them — an amount that could reach into the millions.

U.S. District Judge Robert Bryan has already issued some key rulings in the state’s favor. But in a “statement of interest” filed this week, the Justice Department called the lawsuit “an aggressive and legally unjustified effort by the State of Washington to interfere with federal immigration enforcement,” and it urged Bryan to reject it.

The department said that because the state’s minimum wage act doesn’t apply to inmates of state prisons, it impermissibly discriminates against the federal government to apply it to a federal contractor holding detainees on civil immigration violations. The judge has already rejected that argument, but on Thursday agreed to reconsider it and other arguments and set a hearing for Sept. 12.

“The State insists that these federal immigration detainees are ’employees’ under state law, even though it simultaneously exempts similarly-situated detainees in state facilities from the minimum wage,” the Justice Department said. “Basic constitutional principles prevent a State from interfering with the federal government’s activities in the way Washington is trying to do here.”

The Northwest Detention Center is a 1,575-bed facility, one of the nation’s largest privately run immigrant detention centers. On any given day, about 470 of them perform some sort of work through a voluntary program, earning $1 per day. GEO has the authority to pay more, but Congress will only reimburse it up to that amount.

Washington argues it is entitled to enforce the minimum wage law against GEO just as it’s entitled to enforce it against any other company. The law does exempt state prisons from paying inmates for work, but it doesn’t do the same for private detention centers, it says.

Further, the state says, GEO’s contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement requires the detainee work program to comply with all applicable labor laws — including Washington’s minimum wage law, since GEO is in a clear employer-employee relationship with the detainees.

“The Trump Administration apparently thinks the for-profit, private company that runs Northwest Detention Center should be above the law,” Ferguson said in an emailed statement. “Despite President Trump’s position, GEO must comply with Washington law and either pay the detainees that run its facility minimum wage, or pay minimum wage to Washington workers to do the job.”

GEO has attacked Ferguson’s lawsuit as being “politically motivated.” In court documents, the company says the state has known about the dollar-a-day payments since as early as 2009, but that Ferguson did not file a lawsuit until after the 2016 election of President Donald Trump and his implementation of controversial immigration policies."
"President Trump decision to end DACA was lawful, Justice Department says",https://www.foxnews.com,['Danielle Wallace'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/president-trump-decision-to-end-daca-was-lawful-justice-department-supreme-court,"The Justice Department submitted a legal brief to the Supreme Court Monday that stated President Trump acted lawfully when he decided to end the Obama-era immigration program known as DACA in September of 2017, according to a new report.

The Department of Homeland Security, “correctly, and at a minimum reasonably, concluded that DACA is unlawful,” Justice Department lawyers wrote in a brief submitted to the Supreme Court late Monday.

SUPREME COURT TO DECIDE WHETHER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CAN END DACA PROGRAM

The Supreme Court will begin to hear arguments in November. A ruling is expected in the presidential election year, putting the high court at the center of one of the most politically charged issues of debates. A decision in favor of Trump would allow for the president to deport more than one million young adults residing in the U.S. under DACA protection, the New York Times reported.

Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, was created under an executive order in 2012. The program gives some illegal immigrants -- known as ""Dreamers"" -- who were brought to the United States as children-- the opportunity to receive a renewable two-year reprieve from deportation and become eligible for a work permit.

In 2017, the Trump administration announced its plan to phase out the program, but federal courts have ruled that the phase-out could not apply retroactively and that the program should be restarted.

The White House fought back on those decisions, saying the president has broad authority over immigration enforcement policy. Federal appeals courts around the country have rejected efforts by the federal government to move ahead with phasing out the Obama-era program.

DACA proponents have also argued that Trump’s planned termination of the program violates federal law requiring adequate notice-and-comment periods before certain federal rules are changed, as well as other constitutional equal protection and due process guarantees.

A decision from the Supreme Court to end DACA could galvanize young Americans to ensure Trump does not see another four years in the White House, the Times report stated. On the other hand, if the Court chooses to continue the Obama-era program, conservatives could argue Trump needs another four years to fulfill his campaign promises on immigration.
