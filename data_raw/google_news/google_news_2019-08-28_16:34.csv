"Mattis swipes at Trump, warns of ‘storm clouds gathering’ amid fractured alliances",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mattis-swipes-at-trump-warns-of-storm-clouds-gathering-amid-fractured-alliances,"Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis took several implicit swipes at President Trump’s leadership in an op-ed published Wednesday, warning about the fallout from fractured alliances and increasing divisiveness under the current administration.

Mattis’ comments were included in a lengthy essay adapted from a forthcoming book and published in The Wall Street Journal. They amount to the most extensive remarks from him about his time in the Trump administration since he quietly resigned in January.

MATTIS TO RETIRE AT THE END OF FEBRUARY, TRUMP SAYS

In the essay, Mattis suggested he left his post as secretary of defense amid concerns about “keeping faith with our allies,” warning that America “cannot go it alone.”

“Nations with allies thrive, and those without them wither. Alone, America cannot protect our people and our economy,” Mattis wrote. “At this time, we can see storm clouds gathering.”

He pointedly added: “A polemicist’s role is not sufficient for a leader. A leader must display strategic acumen that incorporates respect for those nations that have stood with us when trouble loomed.”

Mattis said he “did as well as I could, for as long as I could” as secretary of defense.

In one section, he essentially wrote that he resigned when he felt his concerns about those alliances were not being taken seriously.

“When my concrete solutions and strategic advice, especially keeping faith with our allies, no longer resonated, it was time to resign, despite the limitless joy I felt serving alongside our troops in defense of our Constitution,” Mattis wrote.

Mattis went on to note his deepest concerns “as a military man,” noting they are “not our external adversaries; it is our internal divisiveness.”

“We are dividing into hostile tribes cheering against each other, fueled by emotion and a mutual disdain that jeopardizes our future instead of rediscovering our common ground and finding solutions,” he wrote. “All Americans need to recognize that our democracy is an experiment—and one that can be reversed. We all know that we’re better than our current politics.”

He added: “Tribalism must not be allowed to destroy our experiment.”

TRUMP PUSHES OUT MATTIS SOONER THAN PLANNED

Mattis announced his intention to resign in December 2018, after clashing with the president over the abrupt withdrawal of all 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria. At the time, Mattis delivered a resignation letter to Trump which stated that the president has “the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours,” and that he would leave his post by the end of February.

But Trump then announced the secretary would be removed from his post on Jan. 1, 2019 — nearly two months before Mattis had planned.

Trump, in October 2018, told CBS News’ “60 Minutes” that he had a “very good relationship” with Mattis, but described him as “sort of a Democrat.”

"Why November 4, 2020 could be a very bad day",https://www.cnn.com,"['Analysis Chris Cillizza', 'Cnn Editor-At-Large']",08-28-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/28/politics/trump-2020-election-fraud/index.html,"(CNN) Since almost the moment Donald Trump won the White House in 2016, people have had November 3, 2020 -- aka Election Day -- circled on their calendars.

For Trump haters, that first Tuesday in November next year is the moment when they can put an end to what they believe is a colossal mistake. For Trump backers, Election Day 2020 is their chance to prove that 2016 was no fluke -- and that they want another four years of the billionaire businessman in the White House.

But what if the vote on November 3, 2020 doesn't actually settle anything?

There's been polling evidence for some time that Americans are losing faith in the ability of Americans elections to be conducted fair and squarely.

In an NPR/Marist University poll conducted just before the 2018 midterm elections, almost half -- 47% -- of respondents said that they lacked faith that all votes cast would be counted fairly. That number was even higher among non-white voters -- of whom almost 6 in 10 said it was likely not all votes would be counted. Two in 5 voters said they did not believe American elections were fair in that same poll."

Trump’s Unprecedented Fight to Withhold Information,https://www.theatlantic.com,"['Kerry W. Kircher', 'Former House General Counsel']",08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/house-needs-its-subpoena-power-against-trump/596857/,"Under these circumstances, the House has to keep fighting, including by suing civilly to enforce its committees’ subpoenas. During the period that I served in the Office of General Counsel, only two House-subpoena cases ended up in court: Committee on the Judiciary v. Miers (during George W. Bush’s presidency) and Committee on Oversight and Government Reform v. Holder (during Barack Obama’s presidency). I worked on both. These cases provide some guidance on how the current suits will likely unfold, at least at the lower-court level.

In 2007, when Nancy Pelosi was speaker, the House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed former White House Counsel Harriet Miers to testify about, and White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten to produce records relating to, the White House’s firing of an unusual number of U.S. attorneys. The Bush White House directed Miers not to appear and Bolten not to provide records, claiming that senior White House aides were absolutely immune from congressional subpoenas (the same claim the Trump White House now makes with respect to McGahn). Ultimately, the committee, after being so authorized by the full House, sued to compel compliance.

U.S. District Judge John Bates, a Bush appointee, ruled in 2008 in the Miers case that senior White House aides are not immune from congressional subpoenas, that Miers had to appear before the committee but could raise privilege objections in response to specific questions, and that Bolten had to either produce the documents subpoenaed or provide to the committee a log of the documents as to which he claimed privilege. Bates also indicated that if further disputes ensued regarding specific privilege objections, he would help resolve them. Miers and Bolten appealed. But shortly thereafter, President Obama was sworn in, and the parties settled: The Judiciary Committee took Miers’s testimony and Bolten produced some, although not all, of the subpoenaed documents.

Kia Rahnama: What Congress can do when Trump appointees defy it

In 2011, when John Boehner was speaker, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform subpoenaed Attorney General Eric Holder for documents that concerned “Fast and Furious,” an undercover Justice Department law-enforcement operation that went awry and resulted in the death of a U.S. Border Patrol agent. After months of back-and-forth and the production of a small number of documents to the committee, Holder claimed that the remaining documents were protected by a common-law privilege little understood outside legal circles, known as the deliberative-process privilege. As before, the committee, after being so authorized by the full House, sued, this time to compel compliance with certain specific aspects of its document subpoena.

In 2013, U.S. District Judge Amy Jackson, an Obama appointee, ruled that the House had standing to sue. On the merits, however, the case dragged on for several more years—because of the volume of documents at issue, because Jackson allowed the Justice Department to assert new privileges as the case proceeded, and because she concluded that the deliberative-process privilege had some constitutional roots. Ultimately, the committee obtained many, although not all, of the documents it had sought."

The Federal Reserve’s Job Isn’t to Help Trump — or to Hurt Him,https://www.barrons.com,['Randall W. Forsyth'],,,,https://www.barrons.com/articles/donald-trump-federal-reserve-trade-war-51566950641,"Text size

The policy objectives of the Federal Reserve are to promote maximum employment and stable prices. That is what Congress has mandated, period.

This bears repeating, because the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York thinks it’s actually the job of the central bank to oppose Executive Branch policies with which it takes issue.

In a Bloomberg opinion piece, Bill Dudley argues the Fed should not “enable” the policies of President Donald Trump, which will he says will produce an “economic disaster.”

Leave aside the arguments over policy for a moment. Consider instead the Constitutional question of an unelected agency of government officials working to thwart the policies of elected officials.

Like him or not, Trump was duly chosen by Electoral College as the 45th President of the United States. As such, he is empowered to carry out the functions and duties as the head of the Executive Branch, as articulated by the U.S. Constitution, subject to the checks and balances provided by the Legislative and Judicial branches.

The Fed, meanwhile, is run by unelected officials, some of whom are nominated by the executive and confirmed by the legislative branch. Others are selected solely by private citizens answerable to no one else.

The Fed is a creation of Congress, which can change its structure, aims, or operating procedures. And similar to Supreme Court justices, members of the Fed’s Board of Governors are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Fed governors serve 14-year terms, while the chair has a four-year term (coincident with his or her term as governor.) The 12 Fed district bank presidents are chosen by the banks’ own board of directors, with no legislative oversight.

Monetary policy is set by the Federal Open Market Committee, comprising the seven Fed governors, with the Fed Board Chair also chairing the FOMC, plus five of the 12 Fed district chairs. The Fed presidents rotate every year, except for the New York Fed president, which is a permanent member, in recognition of New York’s status as the nation’s—and arguably the world’s—financial capital. The New York Fed president also is the FOMC vice chair, further cementing the post as first among equals.

Leave aside the anachronistic structure of the Fed, cobbled together over a century ago. Defenders say it is designed to provide independence for the central bank. Critics argue it makes it unaccountable, resulting in campaigns to “audit the Fed” and its decision making, which the central bank has adamantly opposed.

That’s not to say the Fed has avoided being drawn into the political realm, sometimes legitimately, more often not.

During World War II, the entire aim of the U.S. government was to support the war effort. That included the Fed, by facilitating the financing of the wartime deficit by pegging bond yields. By the early 1950s, that mandate to cap interest rates caused inflation. That led to the Treasury-Fed Accord of 1951, which freed the central bank to raise rates as needed to control inflation.

The need to raise interest rates produced other conflicts between the Fed and other branches of government, most notably during the 1960s, when spending on the Vietnam War and the Great Society stirred inflation. President Lyndon B. Johnson literally manhandled then-Fed Chairman William McChesney Martin for hiking rates then.

Read more: How This Bull Market Will End

Richard Nixon, who blamed his loss in 1960 in part on a sluggish economy resulting from tight Fed policy, installed the malleable Arthur Burns as his Fed Chairman after his 1968 presidential victory. Burns dutifully pursued stimulative policies to help ensure Nixon’s reelection, which provided the inflationary tinder for the explosion in oil prices, and the subsequent steep recession of 1973-74.

In more recent years, Alan Greenspan famously made certain to get along with both Republican and Democratic administrations (although George H.W. Bush blamed him for his reelection loss in 1992.) His successors, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, fared less well: The former didn’t get a third term under Barack Obama, while the latter wasn’t reappointed to a second term.

Jerome Powell got the nod from Trump, who nonetheless has stepped up his criticism of the central bank to unprecedented levels. Trump blasted the Fed for raising rates last year and its reluctance to lower them this year. While the central bank trimmed its federal funds target range one-quarter percentage point, the president has called for a cut of a full percentage point. That’s despite the Fed having achieved its aforementioned policy mandates, with unemployment at 3.7%, a half-century low, and inflation running a few tenths shy of its 2% target.

Fears of recession mainly stem from a global slowdown in manufacturing, which arguably stems mainly from the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China. In his speech at the Fed’s annual Jackson Hole policy confab last week, Powell acknowledged the impact of trade. “While monetary policy is a powerful tool that works to support consumer spending, business investment and public confidence, it cannot provide a settled rulebook for international trade,” he said. But, he added, “we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion,” opening the way for another rate cut in September.

Dudley, by contrast, suggests the Fed opt not to do that. “Officials could state explicitly that the central bank won’t bail out an administration that keeps making bad choices on trade policy, making it abundantly clear that Trump will own the consequences of his actions,” he wrote.

Even more radically, Dudley contends that Trump’s attacks on the Fed puts the presidential election within the central bank’s purview.

“After all, Trump’s reelection arguably presents a threat to the U.S. and global economy, to the Fed’s independence and its ability to achieve its employment and inflation objectives,” he writes. “If the goal of monetary policy is to achieve the best long-term economic outcome, then Fed officials should consider how their decisions will affect the political outcome in 2020.”

This is shocking, coming from a person who used to be one of the top three monetary-policy officials in the U.S. Dudley, moreover, came to the New York Fed from Goldman Sachs, where he was their chief Fed watcher, so he was no neophyte when it comes to the intersection of policy and markets. That also made him just one of the many former Goldman types to ascent to high government posts, such as Henry Paulson, the former Treasury Secretary during the financial crisis.

An independent central bank means one able to meet its clearly defined policy goals—not to pursue its own agenda to thwart policies of other branches of government.

That would be tantamount to a coup d’etat.

"Facing farmer anger, Trump scrambles Cabinet to brainstorm on biofuel policy: sources",https://www.reuters.com,"['Humeyra Pamuk', 'Min Read']",08-23-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biofuels-trump/facing-farmer-anger-trump-scrambles-cabinet-to-brainstorm-on-biofuel-policy-sources-idUSKCN1VC1RN,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, faced with mounting anger in the farm belt over policies that allow oil refineries to use less corn-based ethanol, summoned Cabinet members on Thursday to discuss ways to boost biofuel demand, four sources familiar with the matter said.

FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump returns after travelling to the AMVETS convention in Kentucky, at the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, U.S. August 21, 2019. REUTERS/Tasos Katopodis

Throughout his 2016 campaign that brought him to power, Trump championed ethanol but also courted the oil industry. However, his latest decision to grant dozens of waivers to oil refineries infuriated farmers, a key constituency he is counting on for re-election in 2020.

Trump met with Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Andrew Wheeler at the White House, the sources said. They presented options to boost ethanol demand, which farmers say has slumped since the EPA exempted dozens of refineries from ethanol requirements.

The White House declined to comment on the meeting.

One proposal that was discussed and was advocated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture was rescinding seven or eight of the 31 waivers the administration has granted to refineries, according to a memo of five proposals obtained by Reuters. Sources said government agencies have agreed on four of the proposals, but Trump was yet to make a final decision.

The sticking point is a technical proposal to redistribute projected volumes that could be exempted in the future through the annual biofuel mandate from 2020 onwards. The USDA and EPA remain divided on the issue.

David Fialkov, a lobbyist for NATSO, the national association representing the travel plaza and truckstop industry, said an agreement on that proposal was key for biofuels.

“As long as EPA continues issuing small refinery exemptions without accounting for waived volumes in establishing the underlying renewable fuel mandate every year, fuel marketers won’t be motivated to buy biofuels. End of story,” Fialkov said.

The remaining proposals agreed upon are for the EPA taking steps to make infrastructure for E15, a higher ethanol blend of gasoline, more accessible; and the USDA and EPA working together to amend the Reset rule, which will be dictating new blending mandates for a slew of biofuels for the next several years and beyond. The final one is for the EPA to take action to encourage flex-fuel vehicles that can use E85, a higher ethanol blend.

U.S. regulations require refiners to blend biofuels into their gasoline or buy credits to fund those refiners who can. Small refiners can seek exemptions, but Trump’s EPA has granted waivers to refineries owned by the likes of Exxon Mobil Corp, Chevron Corp and billionaire Carl Icahn.

U.S. farmers have already been suffering due to a slump in crop prices and exports shrinking following Trump’s trade war with China. On Wednesday, biofuel industry groups and farm-state lawmakers complained to the White House about the refinery waivers.

‘ENOUGH IS ENOUGH’

The backlash from agricultural and biofuel trade groups has been particularly strong in Iowa, the largest producer of corn and ethanol, and a swing state won twice by former Democrat President Barack Obama but which voted for Trump in 2016.

Democratic presidential hopefuls have spent a lot of time in Iowa because it holds an early nominating contest, and they have used the refinery issue as a cudgel. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said that if elected, she would block pending refinery waiver applications and look to reverse any approved. She said, at a maximum, only a few should be approved.

Farmers and biofuel producers have complained that Trump is favoring the oil industry at their expense. Over the past month, several biofuel plants announced shutdowns or production cutbacks, including the largest U.S. ethanol producer POET.

On Thursday, American GreenFuels, owned by Kolmar Americas, said it was slashing output by 50% in the fourth quarter, citing pain from waivers and a biodiesel tax credit that expired and has not been renewed.

“Enough is enough,” Raf Aviner, president of Kolmar Americas said in a statement. “We cannot justify buying more feedstock under these market conditions.”

Refiners and some academics dispute the contention that waivers have decimated ethanol demand, and the industry and its allies have fought to keep the waivers intact.

On Thursday, North America’s Building Trades Unions (NABTU) sent a letter to Trump supporting waivers, saying they significantly reduced costs for refineries and alleviated a threat to thousands of jobs.

Renewable fuel credits for 2019 traded at 16.5 cents apiece throughout the session on Thursday, up from 14.75 cents each on Wednesday, traders said. The credits have steadily climbed from trading at 11 cents apiece two weeks ago as refiners sought to actively buy in the market."
Italy Opposition Says It Is Ready for Cabinet Deal With 5-Star,https://www.usnews.com,[],08-28-2019,2019,8,https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2019-08-28/italys-pd-says-no-vetoes-as-talks-resume-with-5-star,"Democratic Party leader Nicola Zingaretti speaks to the media next to the party leadership members Paolo Gentiloni and Andrea Marcucci in the Presidential Palace after consultations, in Rome, Italy, August 28, 2019.

By Giselda Vagnoni and Angelo Amante

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's opposition Democratic Party (PD) said on Wednesday it was ready to form a coalition with the 5-Star Movement, setting aside years of hostility to avert a snap election and ease economic uncertainty.

Following days of often tense and difficult talks, PD leader Nicola Zingaretti told Italy's president that his party would accept the 5-Star candidate for prime minister -- the current premier Giuseppe Conte.

""We love Italy and we consider it worthwhile to try this experience,"" Zingaretti told reporters. ""In difficult times like these, shunning our responsibility to have the courage to try this is something we cannot afford to do.""

The previous coalition made up of 5-Star and the far-right League collapsed this month when League leader Matteo Salvini withdrew hoping to trigger an early election and cash in on his surging popularity.

But his move backfired when Conte refused to resign immediately, giving 5-Star and the PD time to try to overcome their fierce mutual animosity and agree to a government that had initially appeared impossible.

The prospect of a new administration led by Conte, an academic who is considered close to the 5-Star, has buoyed markets, which are betting that Italy will get a fiscally prudent government that will avoid confrontation with Europe.

The League is highly eurosceptic and had promised swinging tax cuts for 2020 that economists warned could put unsustainable pressure on Italy's towering debt mountain.

Italy's 10-year bond yield fell to a record low below 1%, two-year bond yields fell to their lowest since May 2018 at -0.22% and Italy's 50-year bond yield fell to a record low around 2.266% .

HURDLES AHEAD

However, a coalition pact is not yet a done deal. The tentative accord could still unravel even as President Sergio Mattarella wraps up his consultations aimed at resolving the political chaos that was unexpectedly unleashed by Salvini.

5-Star and the PD have yet to agree on other top government posts, besides the prime minister's position, or reveal a common policy platform.

Mattarella is due to meet 5-Star leaders at 7 p.m. (1700 GMT). If they give him the green light, he will likely call in Conte and invite him to form a new cabinet, Italy's 67th since the end of World War Two.

However, in an added complication, 5-Star has said it will put its proposed deal with the PD to an online vote of its members. Many 5-Star supporters have taken to social media to denounce any pact with the center-left and a 'yes' vote cannot be taken for granted.

As negotiations went down to the wire, one of the posts still in play was that of deputy prime minister. The PD wants this job for one of its own, now that it has agreed to Conte staying on as prime minister.

""The problem is that if there is a premier from the 5-Star it is fair that his deputy is from the PD,"" PD deputy leader Andrea Orlando said on Twitter.

Conte, a virtually unknown lawyer when he was chosen by the League and 5-Star to lead their new government last year, was seen as a voice of reason within the outgoing coalition and has good relations with Mattarella.

"After blacklisting, U.S. receives 130-plus license requests to sell to Huawei: sources",https://www.reuters.com,"['Alexandra Alper', 'Min Read']",08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-huawei-tech-usa/after-blacklisting-u-s-receives-130-plus-license-requests-to-sell-to-huawei-sources-idUSKCN1VH2K0,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department has received more than 130 applications from companies for licenses to sell U.S. goods to China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, three sources said, nearly two months after President Donald Trump said some sales would be allowed.

FILE PHOTO: A Huawei company logo is pictured at the Shenzhen International Airport in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China July 22, 2019. REUTERS/Aly Song

But the Trump administration has not yet granted any licenses for sales to the blacklisted company, said the people familiar with the process who spoke to Reuters on the condition of anonymity.

The standstill coincides with mixed messages from Trump in the U.S.-China trade war, which have dimmed hopes for prompt decisions on license applications to sell to Huawei, the world’s top producer of telecoms equipment.

That has raised the specter of billions of dollars of lost sales for chipmakers, software companies and others in Huawei’s U.S. supply chain.

“Nobody in the executive branch knows what (Trump) wants and they’re all afraid to make a decision without knowing that,” said William Reinsch, a former Commerce department official.

Last week, Trump vowed to raise tariffs on $550 billion in Chinese imports, hours after China imposed new levies on $75 billion in U.S. goods. Then he softened his tone toward China at the G7 leaders’ meeting over the weekend, saying he thought the world’s two largest economies would reach a deal to end the tit-for-tat trade war that has roiled markets and hammered growth.

The current number of license applications, not previously reported, far exceeds the 50 or so that U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross disclosed receiving in July.

A spokesman for the Commerce Department said: “The interagency process, weighing license requests concerning Huawei and its non-U.S. affiliates, is currently ongoing.”

Huawei did not immediately respond to a request for comment but has called for the United States to remove the company from the so-called entity list and put an end to what it called “unjust treatment.”

Huawei, the world’s no. 2 smartphone maker, was placed on the list because of U.S. national security concerns in May, when trade talks with China broke down. Sales of U.S. goods are mostly banned to companies on the list, unless suppliers obtain special licenses, which must overcome tough scrutiny.

The United States says the company can spy on customers and has sought to convince allies to exclude it from 5G networks. Huawei denies the allegations.

PROMISE

Seeking to lure China back to the negotiating table in late June, Trump promised President Xi Jinping that U.S. companies would be allowed to make some sales to Huawei, a gesture welcomed by U.S. chipmakers and software companies. Huawei spent $11 billion on U.S. components from U.S. firms such as Intel Corp, Qualcomm and Micron Technology last year.

Government officials urged U.S. companies to apply for licenses following Trump’s pledge of relief, saying exports to Huawei of non-sensitive items that are readily replaced by foreign competitors would be permitted. Ross and Trump in July promised timely responses.

One of the sources noted that the review process was not delayed, pointing to the complexities of interagency consultation.

But the only relief seen by Huawei thus far was the extension in August of the temporary general license, which gives U.S. companies a small exception to repair and maintain Huawei’s existing handsets and networks.

China expert Derek Scissors of the American Enterprise Institute said a breakthrough in U.S.-China trade talks could spur license approvals for Huawei as soon as next month.

The two trade teams are due to meet in September in Washington, but no specific dates have been disclosed.

According to three Commerce department officials, many of the licenses requests have been reviewed by other agencies such as the Departments of State and Defense.

However, no standards have yet been set and no responses have been issued as officials await a green light from Ross and the White House, according to three people familiar with the process.

The United States has a case pending against Huawei over allegations Huawei violated U.S. sanctions on Iran.

Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou has been detained in Vancouver since December on U.S. bank fraud charges for misleading banks about the company’s Iran business. Trump has at times asserted that Huawei and Meng could be included in a grand U.S.-China trade deal."

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said he plans to reshuffle his cabinet next month, and that he will emphasize ""stability"" and ""consistency"" in the new line-up, signaling that he will keep key positions unchanged."
Can Trump force U.S. companies out of China?,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Rachel Layne'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/can-trump-force-u-s-companies-out-of-china-not-technically-but-he-can-make-it-very-hard-to-stay/,"The International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 would give President Trump discretion to impose restrictions on U.S. companies doing business in China if he declared an emergency.

The law was first used in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter to impose sanctions on the Iranian government during the Iran hostage crisis.



Although Congress could intervene to block Mr. Trump from declaring an emergency, it would be unlikely to do so given the ongoing partisan conflict in Washington, D.C.

President Donald Trump startled investors last week when he took to Twitter and ""hereby ordered"" U.S. companies to stop doing business in China as the countries continue to clash over trade. So is he within his rights?

The answer, experts say, is probably so. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a more than 40-year-old law Mr. Trump later cited in another tweet, gives the executive branch broad powers that, if invoked, could make it difficult for U.S. companies to operate in China.

Passed by Congress in 1977, IEEPA authorizes the president — after a national emergency is declared — to ""investigate, regulate or prohibit"" a range of activities by U.S. companies engaged in global commerce. Those include foreign exchange transactions, banking payments or transfers, and the import or export of foreign currency and securities. The law was first used in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter to impose sanctions on the Iranian government during the Iran hostage crisis.

IEEPA is ""an extraordinarily broad and open-ended delegation from Congress to the president,"" Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard Law School professor and Hoover Institute fellow, said in a tweet. As of earlier this year, U.S. presidents had invoked the act more than 50 times since its initial passage, according to the Congressional Research Service.

CBS News poll: U.S. consumers concerned about China tariffs

More recently, Mr. Trump in May invoked IEEPA in placing restrictions on U.S. companies doing business with Chinese technology company Huawei. He also threatened to use it to impose tariffs on Mexico tied to immigration. The difference now is that Mr. Trump is threatening to use IEEPA, which is typically used for sanctions, as a cudgel in his administration's trade war with China.

Mr. Trump's threat to block U.S. companies from doing business in China ""would face no effective legal barrier,"" Height Securities analyst Clayton Allen said in a research note. The White House could also expect backing from the courts, which have tended to uphold even broad exercises of power under IEEPA, Goldsmith said in another tweet.

The White House has since walked back Mr. Trump's order that U.S. companies cut ties with China amid protest from the business community. But he could still brandish IEEPA down the road if the conflict continues to deteriorate.

""So in theory that law exists, but that's not what the president said. He is asking American companies to take a look, take a fresh look at frankly moving out of China, go in someplace else,"" Larry Kudlow, the White House economic adviser, told Margaret Brennan Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation.""

Trump gets ready to ""double down"" on trade war with China

So what's to stop Mr. Trump from using IEEPA to push U.S. companies around in an unending series of national emergencies? In a word, Congress, which is constitutionally mandated to regulate commerce with foreign countries and which could vote to end a national emergency.

The problem there is that Congress would likely need a two-thirds majority to end a national emergency, according to the Congressional Research Service. Partisan conflict in Washington would make that a tall task, giving Mr. Trump more room to exercise his power under IEEPA."
Italy inches toward new govt as Trump backs Conte's return as PM,https://www.reuters.com,"['Gavin Jones', 'Min Read']",08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-politics-5star/italys-5-star-opposition-clash-over-potential-cabinet-roles-idUSKCN1VH0QT,"ROME (Reuters) - The two parties trying to form a new Italian government made progress toward a coalition deal on Tuesday, cheering financial markets as well as U.S. President Donald Trump, who said he hoped Giuseppe Conte would be reinstated as prime minister.

The role of Conte has been a sticking point in the negotiations between the 5-Star Movement, a member of the outgoing coalition, and the opposition Democratic Party (PD), which has been resisting his reappointment.

“Starting to look good for the highly respected Prime Minister of the Italian Republic, Giuseppe Conte,” Trump said on Twitter. “A very talented man who will hopefully remain Prime Minister.”

After setbacks early on Tuesday the roller-coaster talks between the anti-establishment 5-Star and the center-left PD appeared to be back on track later in the day, with upbeat comments from both sides prompting a strong market rally.

Italian 10-year bond yields fell to three-year lows, and the spread between German Bunds narrowed to below 182 basis points, the tightest since May 2018.

Tensions persist and surprises are possible, however.

Late on Tuesday, a PD source said talks were still at risk of failure over the post of deputy prime minister, saying 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio was insisting on retaining that role in a new coalition despite strong opposition to this from the PD.

Even if a deal were struck, it would need to survive an online vote of 5-Star party members, the party said in a blog post. Many of its rank and file are hostile to the PD and have used social media to urge Di Maio against doing a deal.

Investors, though, are betting that Italy will avoid snap elections, fearing they would be won by Matteo Salvini’s hard-right League party, which would put Rome on a collision course with the European Union over expansionary government spending.

“Our work is continuing in a fruitful way,” the PD’s Senate leader Andrea Marcucci told reporters in brief comments after an evening meeting with 5-Star officials.

Deputy PD leader Paola De Micheli said the two sides had “analyzed points for the basis of a common program”, while 5-Star’s Senate chief Stefano Patuanelli reported a “good climate” and said contacts would continue on Wednesday.

The parties are due to report back to President Sergio Mattarella on Wednesday from 1400 GMT. If no deal has been sealed he will name a caretaker government and call elections.

Conte, who belongs to no party but is close to 5-Star, resigned last week after League chief Salvini declared his 14-month coalition with 5-Star was dead, seeking to trigger elections and capitalize on his surging popularity.

The move has not gone to plan, as 5-Star and the PD seek to form a coalition of their own, pushing the League into opposition.

FIGHT OVER JOBS

Earlier on Tuesday the PD/5-Star talks seemed to have run into trouble, with the two sides fighting over key jobs as well as being at loggerheads over Conte’s role.

The PD accused 5-Star of undermining the formation of a new cabinet by demanding the interior ministry for Di Maio. 5-Star denied this, and the parties canceled a scheduled meeting.

The PD says Di Maio is insisting on keeping the role of deputy prime minister that he held in the outgoing government, something it considers unacceptable if Conte is to stay on as premier.

It remains to be seen if the exchanges are merely tactics to secure the upper hand in negotiations over cabinet jobs, or whether they have the potential to scupper an accord between the two parties which have always been bitter adversaries.

The picture is complicated by deep internal divisions in both parties, each one split between leadership factions that want a deal and others that would prefer to risk an election.

Di Maio was absent at the start of an evening meeting of all the 5-Star lawmakers. The great majority favors an accord with the PD rather than a snap election which would probably see many lose their seats less than 18 months into this parliament.

Meanwhile Salvini continues to demand elections, and is likely to be disappointed by Trump’s endorsement of Conte, especially as the populist League chief has always expressed his admiration for the U.S. president.

Opinion polls suggest the League has lost 3-7 percentage points since collapsing the government, though it remains easily the most popular party, followed by the PD and 5-Star."
David Koch’s spirit is alive and well in the White House cabinet,https://qz.com,[],,,,https://qz.com/1694132/david-kochs-spirit-lives-on-in-the-white-house-cabinet/,"David Koch was no friend of US president Donald Trump. The businessman and conservative icon, who died today at age 79, made little secret of his dislike of the president or his policies—his tariffs, the travel ban, and almost everything else about him.

So they surrounded him with their allies instead.

The sons of Koch Industries founder Fred Koch, David Koch and his brother Charles were born into extraordinary wealth. For decades, they used their billions to wield political influence, supporting a sprawling network of conservative nonprofits closely aligned with their mission—right-wing libertarianism. The crux of this, as Charles Koch once put it, was a desire for “economic freedom”—with as little power in the hands of centralized government as possible. In short, he wrote, “big governments are inherently inefficient and harmful.”

The brothers favor minimal government “intrusions,” encompassing conservative economic policies such as minimal taxation and free trade, as well as more liberal, anti-interventionist social policies. Many of their main areas of concern have closely aligned with Koch Industries’ business interests, ushering in candidates who deny climate change, were likely to promote fossil fuel use, and support environmental deregulation.

They did this through organizations like Americans for Prosperity, which supported the establishment of the Tea Party movement, while concealing the identities of other, more media-shy, conservative donors.

When it came to Trump, who rose to political power on the heels of the Tea Party movement, their enthusiasm was much more muted. But while they may not like Trump’s style, and have publicly refused to donate directly to Trump’s campaign, the brothers’ influence is apparent in the president’s choice of advisors, including official counselor Kellyanne Conway. The president’s cabinet remains a who’s-who of Koch affiliates. Their nearly $900 million budget for the 2016 election seems to have had the desired effect.

Koch may be dead, but many of his preferred political figures—and, by extension, his preferred policies—continue to thrive in the highest positions of power. Here’s how.

Vice President Mike Pence

During the 2016 presidential campaign, then-trusted Trump advisor and the high-powered arch-conservative Steve Bannon expressed concerns that a potential Pence president would be “a president that the Kochs would own.” This pretty much sums up the long-held loyal relationship between Pence and the Kochs, which dates back to his time as an Indiana congressman in the early 2000s. Though a channel for the their influence in the White House, Pence differs from David Koch in his anti-choice evangelical position.

Secretary of Energy Rick Perry

The Koch brothers are above all petrochemical magnates, so there is arguably no cabinet position more important than energy secretary. Perry, who once studied animal husbandry and has in the past actually recommended abolishing the energy department, might not be the most qualified for the job. But he is an important representative of the Koch’s interests at the country’s most important table. A climate change denier, Perry has been pushing for more fossil fuel and has called attempts to replace them with renewables “immoral.”

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo

Formerly nicknamed the “congressman from Koch,” Pompeo is a member of the Wichita, Kansas, business community—the Kochs’ home base. He made the jump into politics thanks almost entirely to the Kochs’ support. He has, in fact, received more money from the brothers than any other single individual. Pompeo has shown his gratitude toward his donors by favoring environmental deregulation on energy production, and by defending his benefactors in the public arena, including an op-ed unsubtly titled “Stop Harassing the Koch Brothers.”

Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross

The billionaire investor was a close personal friend of David Koch’s. He was photographed with the late financier and pedophile Jeffrey Epstein at a dinner party at his home in 2010. (Koch was among Epstein’s personal friends.) Ross and his wife later attended Koch’s 2016 holiday party.

Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao

Chao is the wife of Senate leader Mitch McConnell, and a regular guest at Koch donor events. As secretary of labor under US president George W. Bush, Chao spoke at the 2002 annual meeting of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). Koch Industries is a longtime member of ALEC’s corporate board. She was also a fellow of the Heritage Foundation, a think-tank closely tied to the Koch brothers’ political ambitions.

Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos

Trump appointed the billionaire and charter school advocate as education secretary in 2017. Her family has close ties to the Koch brothers’ political fundraising, donating millions in 2016 to super-PACs, including the Koch-backed Freedom Partners Action Fund. Devos is a regular attendee at the Kochs’ biannual donor meeting, and is a financial backer of Koch-affiliated groups such as Americans for Prosperity, and the George Mason University-based Mercatus Institute. In October 2018, the education secretary met privately with members of the Koch-funded group Youth Entrepreneurs at a Koch Industries office in Wichita, Kansas."

President Donald Trump on Monday ordered cabinet members to alleviate anger from corn farmers over his administration's decision to exempt some refiners from US biofuel laws, Reuters reported.

The administration granted exemptions to 31 small refineries on August 9, allowing them to use less ethanol when mixing gasoline.

Ethanol producers and corn farmers lobbied to cut the number of exemptions granted, according to Reuters.

President Donald Trump ordered cabinet members Monday to alleviate discontent in Farm Belt states over his administration's decision to give 31 small refineries exemptions from US biofuel laws, according to Reuters.

The exemptions, granted on August 9, allow the refiners to use a smaller amount of ethanol when mixing their gasoline. Trump's administration has handed out a record number of such exemptions. Refiners are required to blend biofuels such as ethanol into their gasoline or help fund peers that do so.

Ethanol producers and corn harvesters lobbied to cut the number of exemptions, according to Reuters.

Iowa is the US' largest producer of corn and ethanol, and the state swung to Trump in 2016 after voting for President Barack Obama twice.

""At a time when ethanol plants in the Heartland are being mothballed and jobs are being lost, it is unfathomable and utterly reprehensible that the Trump administration would dole out more unwarranted waivers to prosperous petroleum refiners,"" Renewable Fuels Association CEO Geoff Cooper said in a statement following the decision.

Trump held a two-hour cabinet meeting during which the matter was discussed on Monday, two sources familiar with the talks told Reuters.

Corn prices were down about 1.3% as of 2:40 p.m. ET Tuesday, at $3.60 per bushel. Corn closed as much as 12% lower after the administration's August 9 announcement.

""Website is being updated. There has been no change to our policy,"" a State Department official said in a statement. Asked whether the listing would be added back to the website, the official reiterated that the site is being updated.

It is unclear when exactly the listing for the territories, which was once included as one of the ""countries and other areas"" under the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, was removed.

Feds greenlight plans to improve safety of Spaghetti Junction ramp in Louisville,https://www.courier-journal.com,"['Billy Kobin', 'Published P.M.

An interstate ramp in Louisville's so-called Spaghetti Junction that has been the site of numerous rollovers and spills over the years is getting some new safety improvements, according to state transportation officials.

Jordan Smith, a Kentucky Transportation Cabinet spokeswoman, said the Federal Highway Administration has given the green light to the cabinet's plans for ""additional safety improvements"" on the ramp from I-71 South and I-64 West to I-65 South in downtown Louisville.

Crews will begin work on the ramp by Nov. 1, Smith told the Courier Journal in an email.

A final cost estimate and timeline on when the work could be completed were not available, but Smith said the cabinet will alert people before construction begins if traffic will be impacted.

""Some of the features to improve the visibility of the curve include new overhead signage, interstate logos on the surface of the road, new striping, raised pavement markers along both edge lines, curve warning and truck rollover signs and LED enhanced chevrons,"" Smith said.

The ramp to I-65 South has had its fair share of auto-related incidents and overturned tractor-trailers over the years.

Previously:110 pigs die after truck overturns on I-65 ramp at Spaghetti Junction

In 2017, a truck filled with glue overturned and spilled the sticky substance on the ramp.

A month later, a tractor-trailer carrying pigs overturned and then caught fire on the ramp, with some pigs running loose on the ramp before being corralled and others dying.

A nearly identical incident on the I-65 South ramp to I-71 North and I-64 East left more than 100 pigs dead this past July.

The 2017 incidents prompted the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet to take a closer look at the Spaghetti Junction ramps and roadways, the Courier Journal previously reported.

An agency spokesperson told the Courier Journal in August 2017 that it would review Louisville Metro Police Department crash reports, install new arrow markings on the pavement on one particular ramp and conduct a mechanical analysis on all of the curves.

The speed limit at the Spaghetti Junction interchange is 55 mph, with ""curve advisories"" of 40 mph for the I-64 West to I-65 ramp and 45 mph for the I-71 South to I-65 ramp, Smith said.

Two years later, officials hope the latest safety improvement efforts will result in fewer accidents and smoother drives.

The Federal Reserve’s Job Isn’t to Help Trump — or to Hurt Him,https://www.barrons.com,['Randall W. Forsyth'],,,,https://www.barrons.com/articles/donald-trump-federal-reserve-trade-war-51566950641?refsec=up-and-down-wall-street,"Text size

The policy objectives of the Federal Reserve are to promote maximum employment and stable prices. That is what Congress has mandated, period.

This bears repeating, because the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York thinks it’s actually the job of the central bank to oppose Executive Branch policies with which it takes issue.

In a Bloomberg opinion piece, Bill Dudley argues the Fed should not “enable” the policies of President Donald Trump, which will he says will produce an “economic disaster.”

Leave aside the arguments over policy for a moment. Consider instead the Constitutional question of an unelected agency of government officials working to thwart the policies of elected officials.

Like him or not, Trump was duly chosen by Electoral College as the 45th President of the United States. As such, he is empowered to carry out the functions and duties as the head of the Executive Branch, as articulated by the U.S. Constitution, subject to the checks and balances provided by the Legislative and Judicial branches.

The Fed, meanwhile, is run by unelected officials, some of whom are nominated by the executive and confirmed by the legislative branch. Others are selected solely by private citizens answerable to no one else.

The Fed is a creation of Congress, which can change its structure, aims, or operating procedures. And similar to Supreme Court justices, members of the Fed’s Board of Governors are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Fed governors serve 14-year terms, while the chair has a four-year term (coincident with his or her term as governor.) The 12 Fed district bank presidents are chosen by the banks’ own board of directors, with no legislative oversight.

Monetary policy is set by the Federal Open Market Committee, comprising the seven Fed governors, with the Fed Board Chair also chairing the FOMC, plus five of the 12 Fed district chairs. The Fed presidents rotate every year, except for the New York Fed president, which is a permanent member, in recognition of New York’s status as the nation’s—and arguably the world’s—financial capital. The New York Fed president also is the FOMC vice chair, further cementing the post as first among equals.

Leave aside the anachronistic structure of the Fed, cobbled together over a century ago. Defenders say it is designed to provide independence for the central bank. Critics argue it makes it unaccountable, resulting in campaigns to “audit the Fed” and its decision making, which the central bank has adamantly opposed.

That’s not to say the Fed has avoided being drawn into the political realm, sometimes legitimately, more often not.

During World War II, the entire aim of the U.S. government was to support the war effort. That included the Fed, by facilitating the financing of the wartime deficit by pegging bond yields. By the early 1950s, that mandate to cap interest rates caused inflation. That led to the Treasury-Fed Accord of 1951, which freed the central bank to raise rates as needed to control inflation.

The need to raise interest rates produced other conflicts between the Fed and other branches of government, most notably during the 1960s, when spending on the Vietnam War and the Great Society stirred inflation. President Lyndon B. Johnson literally manhandled then-Fed Chairman William McChesney Martin for hiking rates then.

Richard Nixon, who blamed his loss in 1960 in part on a sluggish economy resulting from tight Fed policy, installed the malleable Arthur Burns as his Fed Chairman after his 1968 presidential victory. Burns dutifully pursued stimulative policies to help ensure Nixon’s reelection, which provided the inflationary tinder for the explosion in oil prices, and the subsequent steep recession of 1973-74.

In more recent years, Alan Greenspan famously made certain to get along with both Republican and Democratic administrations (although George H.W. Bush blamed him for his reelection loss in 1992.) His successors, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, fared less well: The former didn’t get a third term under Barack Obama, while the latter wasn’t reappointed to a second term.

Jerome Powell got the nod from Trump, who nonetheless has stepped up his criticism of the central bank to unprecedented levels. Trump blasted the Fed for raising rates last year and its reluctance to lower them this year. While the central bank trimmed its federal funds target range one-quarter percentage point, the president has called for a cut of a full percentage point. That’s despite the Fed having achieved its aforementioned policy mandates, with unemployment at 3.7%, a half-century low, and inflation running a few tenths shy of its 2% target.

Fears of recession mainly stem from a global slowdown in manufacturing, which arguably stems mainly from the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China. In his speech at the Fed’s annual Jackson Hole policy confab last week, Powell acknowledged the impact of trade. “While monetary policy is a powerful tool that works to support consumer spending, business investment and public confidence, it cannot provide a settled rulebook for international trade,” he said. But, he added, “we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion,” opening the way for another rate cut in September.

Dudley, by contrast, suggests the Fed opt not to do that. “Officials could state explicitly that the central bank won’t bail out an administration that keeps making bad choices on trade policy, making it abundantly clear that Trump will own the consequences of his actions,” he wrote.

Even more radically, Dudley contends that Trump’s attacks on the Fed puts the presidential election within the central bank’s purview.

“After all, Trump’s reelection arguably presents a threat to the U.S. and global economy, to the Fed’s independence and its ability to achieve its employment and inflation objectives,” he writes. “If the goal of monetary policy is to achieve the best long-term economic outcome, then Fed officials should consider how their decisions will affect the political outcome in 2020.”

This is shocking, coming from a person who used to be one of the top three monetary-policy officials in the U.S. Dudley, moreover, came to the New York Fed from Goldman Sachs, where he was their chief Fed watcher, so he was no neophyte when it comes to the intersection of policy and markets. That also made him just one of the many former Goldman types to ascent to high government posts, such as Henry Paulson, the former Treasury Secretary during the financial crisis.

An independent central bank means one able to meet its clearly defined policy goals—not to pursue its own agenda to thwart policies of other branches of government.

That would be tantamount to a coup d’etat.

Report: U.K. Seeks Suspension of Parliament Before Brexit,https://time.com,['Stuart Biggs'],,,,https://time.com/5663167/uk-brexit-queen-prorogue-parliament/,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government is preparing to ask Queen Elizabeth II to prorogue or suspend the U.K. Parliament from September until mid-October, the BBC reported, a move that could hamper lawmakers’ efforts to block a no-deal Brexit and even trigger a constitutional crisis.

The pound fell as much as 0.7%.

Under the plan, all business would be suspended from about Sept. 11 until a Queen’s speech on Oct. 14 kicks off a new session of Parliament, the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg said on Twitter. Downing Street called it business as usual for a new government, she said, with the “useful political side effect” of denying time to MPs trying to stop Britain from leaving the European Union without a deal on Oct. 31.

The prime minister’s office had no immediate comment when contacted by Bloomberg. Parliament is due to return from summer recess on Sept. 3.

Members of Parliament who oppose a no-deal Brexit have feared Johnson would attempt to stop them meeting, and won’t take it lying down. Some have talked of simply continuing to meet in another building, and defying the government. Parliament has also passed measures aimed at forcing the government to let it meet.

“This is an unconstitutional and undemocratic outrage not seen in recent British history,’’ Labour MP Stephen Doughty said on Twitter. “Pulls HM the Queen into major political crisis. Did Cabinet know or approve? How can a tiny meeting of just three be allowed to shut down our democracy? This will not stand.’’

The BBC also reported the Cabinet would hold a conference call on Wednesday morning.

"After blacklisting, U.S. receives 130-plus license requests to sell to Huawei: sources",https://ca.reuters.com,"['Alexandra Alper', 'Karen Freifeld', 'Min Read']",08-27-2019,2019,8,https://ca.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKCN1VH2K0-OCATC,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department has received more than 130 applications from companies for licenses to sell U.S. goods to China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, three sources said, nearly two months after President Donald Trump said some sales would be allowed.

FILE PHOTO: A Huawei company logo is pictured at the Shenzhen International Airport in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China July 22, 2019. REUTERS/Aly Song

But the Trump administration has not yet granted any licenses for sales to the blacklisted company, said the people familiar with the process who spoke to Reuters on the condition of anonymity.

The standstill coincides with mixed messages from Trump in the U.S.-China trade war, which have dimmed hopes for prompt decisions on license applications to sell to Huawei, the world’s top producer of telecoms equipment.

That has raised the specter of billions of dollars of lost sales for chipmakers, software companies and others in Huawei’s U.S. supply chain.

“Nobody in the executive branch knows what (Trump) wants and they’re all afraid to make a decision without knowing that,” said William Reinsch, a former Commerce department official.

Last week, Trump vowed to raise tariffs on $550 billion in Chinese imports, hours after China imposed new levies on $75 billion in U.S. goods. Then he softened his tone toward China at the G7 leaders’ meeting over the weekend, saying he thought the world’s two largest economies would reach a deal to end the tit-for-tat trade war that has roiled markets and hammered growth.

The current number of license applications, not previously reported, far exceeds the 50 or so that U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross disclosed receiving in July.

A spokesman for the Commerce Department said: “The interagency process, weighing license requests concerning Huawei and its non-U.S. affiliates, is currently ongoing.”

Huawei did not immediately respond to a request for comment but has called for the United States to remove the company from the so-called entity list and put an end to what it called “unjust treatment.”

Huawei, the world’s no. 2 smartphone maker, was placed on the list because of U.S. national security concerns in May, when trade talks with China broke down. Sales of U.S. goods are mostly banned to companies on the list, unless suppliers obtain special licenses, which must overcome tough scrutiny.

The United States says the company can spy on customers and has sought to convince allies to exclude it from 5G networks. Huawei denies the allegations.

PROMISE

Seeking to lure China back to the negotiating table in late June, Trump promised President Xi Jinping that U.S. companies would be allowed to make some sales to Huawei, a gesture welcomed by U.S. chipmakers and software companies. Huawei spent $11 billion on U.S. components from U.S. firms such as Intel Corp, Qualcomm and Micron Technology last year.

Government officials urged U.S. companies to apply for licenses following Trump’s pledge of relief, saying exports to Huawei of non-sensitive items that are readily replaced by foreign competitors would be permitted. Ross and Trump in July promised timely responses.

One of the sources noted that the review process was not delayed, pointing to the complexities of interagency consultation.

But the only relief seen by Huawei thus far was the extension in August of the temporary general license, which gives U.S. companies a small exception to repair and maintain Huawei’s existing handsets and networks.

China expert Derek Scissors of the American Enterprise Institute said a breakthrough in U.S.-China trade talks could spur license approvals for Huawei as soon as next month.

The two trade teams are due to meet in September in Washington, but no specific dates have been disclosed.

According to three Commerce department officials, many of the licenses requests have been reviewed by other agencies such as the Departments of State and Defense.

However, no standards have yet been set and no responses have been issued as officials await a green light from Ross and the White House, according to three people familiar with the process.

The United States has a case pending against Huawei over allegations Huawei violated U.S. sanctions on Iran.

Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou has been detained in Vancouver since December on U.S. bank fraud charges for misleading banks about the company’s Iran business. Trump has at times asserted that Huawei and Meng could be included in a grand U.S.-China trade deal."

WASHINGTON (AP) - Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis warns in a book excerpt of the bitter political divisions that seem to be tearing apart American society, echoing themes he often cited before he resigned from the Trump administration in protest.

The retired Marine general, who quit in December amid policy disagreements with President Donald Trump, says he is concerned about the state of American politics.

""We all know that we're better than our current politics,"" Mattis wrote in the excerpt published Wednesday in The Wall Street Journal. ""Tribalism must not be allowed to destroy our experiment.""

Mattis said that ""our own commons seems to be breaking apart"" to a degree not seen in the past.

""What concerns me most as a military man is not our external adversaries; it is our internal divisiveness,"" he wrote.

Much of the excerpt is a recitation of the reasons Mattis has previously given for agreeing to become the Pentagon chief despite not having known or spoken to Trump before being interviewed for the position in November.

Regarding his reasons for leaving, Mattis offered a slightly more pointed explanation than what his resignation letter outlined.

""When my concrete solutions and strategic advice, especially keeping faith with our allies, no longer resonated, it was time to resign, despite the limitless joy I felt serving alongside our troops in defense of our Constitution,"" he wrote.

Mattis resigned shortly after Trump announced he was pulling all U.S. troops from Syria. In Mattis' view this amounted to betraying the Syrian Kurdish fighters who'd partnered with American troops to combat the Islamic State group.

Mattis' book, ""Call Sign Chaos: Learning to Lead,"" is scheduled to be published Sept. 3.

""I'm in the process of putting together a team of people that feel the exact same way that I do. This is not a 'Never Trump' situation. This not just screeching rhetoric. This is -- OK, the guy is unstable. Everyone inside knows it, everyone outside knows it. Let's see if we can find a viable alternative,"" Scaramucci told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day.""

""Moreover, I have to get some former Cabinet officials in unity to speak up about it. They know it's a crisis,"" he added. Scaramucci did not provide any names of people associated with the coalition he said he is assembling, but predicted that by ""middle to late fall"" there will be a ""trove"" of people willing to speak out against Trump.

Last week, Scaramucci announced he no longer supports Trump's reelection bid and that the top of the 2020 Republican presidential ticket may need to be replaced. During his ""New Day"" appearance on Monday, Scaramucci said that if more Republicans begin publicly opposing Trump, it would jumpstart a ""process"" that could eventually replace Trump on the GOP ticket.

Trump, in an apparent response to Scaramucci's ""New Day"" interview, labeled his former aide a ""nut job"" on Twitter and said he ""barely knew him,"" even though he hired him as communications director and Scaramucci frequently defended him on television.

U.S. agriculture secretary pledges Trump will announce way to boost biofuel demand,https://kfgo.com,['Midwest Communications Inc.'],08-28-2019,2019,8,https://kfgo.com/news/articles/2019/aug/28/trump-to-announce-way-forward-on-how-to-mitigate-biofuel-waiver-impact-ag-secretary/931722/?refer-section=national,"By Humeyra Pamuk

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump will announce a plan to boost demand for biofuels, which farmers and producers say has suffered from waivers the administration has issued exempting oil refiners from requirements to blend ethanol into the U.S. fuel supply, Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue said on Wednesday.

The Trump administration has scrambled Cabinet members for several weeks now to churn out a plan that would quell an uproar among American farmers after the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) decision to grant 31 biofuel waivers to small oil refineries.

Perdue was speaking at an agriculture policy forum as part of the Illinois Farm Progress Show. He did not provide a timeline for when the president would make the announcement.

""This is news the president wants to deliver..over the mitigation"" of small refinery exemptions, Perdue said.

He added that the U.S. Department of Agriculture has presented proposals on strengthening infrastructure to allow more widespread use of E15, a higher ethanol blend of gasoline.

The tug of war between rivaling oil and corn industries is a growing headache for Trump, who struggles to appease these two crucial constituencies as he eyes re-election in 2020. Throughout his 2016 campaign that brought him to power, Trump championed ethanol but also courted the oil industry.

American farmers have born the brunt of Trump's trade war with China and he has rolled out around $30 billion in aid package to offset their losses to ensure this key voter base stays loyal to him.

Last week Trump summoned Perdue and EPA chief Andrew Wheeler and a few White House advisors to come up with a solution that will boost biofuel demand. Among the proposals circulated was to ramp up biofuel blending quotas to account for the waived volumes but there has been disagreement over when to start it, this year or the next, sources said.

Any redistribution of waived volumes or lifting of the annual biofuel mandates will upset the oil industry, which dismisses farmers' argument that waivers hurt ethanol demand.

""The waivers are reducing demand for biofuels and decreasing the value of our crop,"" said Matt Frostic, president of the Michigan Corn Growers Association. ""After six consecutive years of depressed commodity prices, on top of a challenging growing season, farmers can’t afford to take another hit.""

Perdue also said he held a meeting with Wheeler and Energy Secretary Rick Perry on Wednesday over the blend wall, which is the maximum amount of ethanol that can be blended into gasoline.

""We had a meeting yesterday with DOE (Department of Energy) and EPA over determining what the blend wall is, which really effects a lot of policy,"" Perdue said. ""We have to come to an agreement about that.""

Sources have said a final agreement on how to move forward on the issue is yet to be finalised and put in writing.

U.S. regulations require refiners to blend biofuels into their gasoline or buy credits to fund those refiners who can. Small refiners can seek exemptions, but Trump's EPA has vastly expanded the waiver program and in August granted 31 exemptions.

The move has infuriated the ethanol industry, which has seen several plant closures and production cuts due to low margins and triggered a flood of criticism directed at Trump last week.

"Nigeria's Buhari assigns cabinet portfolios, appoints new oil minister",https://www.reuters.com,"['Felix Onuah', 'Min Read']",08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nigeria-politics/nigerias-buhari-assigns-cabinet-portfolios-appoints-new-oil-minister-idUSKCN1VB1F9,"ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari swore members of his cabinet into office on Wednesday, assigning a new minister of state for petroleum in Africa’s top producer of crude oil.

Buhari kept the petroleum portfolio for himself, as in his first term, and appointed Timipre Silva as the junior minister, who is widely expected to manage the portfolio on a day-to-day basis.

Silva, a former governor of Bayelsa state in the southern Niger Delta oil production heartlands, replaces former ExxonMobil executive Emmanuel Kachikwu who was the country’s main representative at OPEC meetings.

Nigeria, which has Africa’s biggest economy, remains heavily reliant on crude oil sales despite efforts by Buhari to boost non-oil revenues since he first took office in 2015. Oil receipts account for about 90% of foreign exchange and low oil prices helped to push the country into recession in 2016.

The move to assign portfolios comes six months after Buhari won a presidential election and nearly three months after his second term began. The time taken to appoint ministers caused jitters amongst investors and threatened growth prospects.

Zainab Ahmed, who became finance minister in September last year after her predecessor resigned, retained the position with additional responsibilities for the budget and national planning.

The cabinet of 43 ministers faces a long list of challenges including tepid growth following Nigeria’s emergence from recession in 2017, high unemployment and galloping inflation that has hit the poorest people in a nation of 190 million people, most of whom live on less than $2 a day.

And security forces have been stretched as they try to tackle Islamists waging a decade-long insurgency in the northeast, banditry in the northwest and clashes between nomadic herdsmen and farming communities over dwindling arable land in central states.

“The core objectives of this administration are to improve security, achieve diversified, inclusive economic growth and fight corruption,” Buhari told his cabinet at the swearing in ceremony.

The ministry of power, housing and works - created to address challenges related to the country’s ailing electricity and transport infrastructure when Buhari first took office in 2015 - was broken up.

Babatunde Fashola, a former governor of commercial hub Lagos state who headed that super ministry in the first term, was named minister for housing and works.

Sale Mamman, a businessman and former ministry of works official, was given the power portfolio. His task will be to tackle a poor electricity supply that holds back everything from manufacturing to education, while addressing spiraling debts that have crippled the power sector and held back investment.

“We have seen an exodus of the more capable and technocratic ministers and in their place there are politically connected replacements,” said Malte Liewerscheidt, vice president at Teneo Intelligence.

He said some of the new entrants were stalwarts in Buhari’s ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) party, who appear to have been rewarded for helping him to win February’s election, while others were part of a bid to solidify the party’s base in some parts of the country ahead of elections in 2023.

“There are no real surprises here. The potential for positive change is rather limited,” said Liewerscheidt."

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's prime minister and his cabinet breached the constitution by failing to recite the full oath of allegiance when they were sworn in before the king last month, the Office of the Ombudsman said on Tuesday.

Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha and 35 cabinet ministers pledged their loyalty to King Maha Vajiralongkorn at a ceremony at a Bangkok palace on July 16 but omitted the last sentence, on upholding and complying with the constitution.

""The prime minister did not recite all the wordings as required by the constitution,"" Raksagecha Chaechai, secretary-general of the Office of the Ombudsman told reporters.

""Therefore, the swearing-in was incomplete,"" he said.

Raksagecha said the Constitutional Court would have to rule on what needed to be done because an incomplete oath could mean that all of the government's actions could be seen as unconstitutional.

Prayuth declined to comment when reporters asked him about the office's ruling.

Prayuth scrapped the previous constitution when he seized power from an elected government in a 2014 coup. He was army chief at the time.

The current constitution was drawn up at his behest. It gives the military a significant role in politics, to the disappointment of pro-democracy activists.

Despite their reservations about the constitution, activists say the failure of Prayuth and his cabinet to recite the line about upholding it could raise concern about prospects for constitutional rule.

On Aug. 8, Prayuth said he was taking full responsibility for the omission and apologized, while assuring the country that the government would function as normal. He did not specify how he would rectify the situation.

Television footage of the July 16 ceremony shows Prayuth reading from a sheet of paper as he and his cabinet swore their loyalty to the king and vowed to perform their duties for the benefit of the county and the people, but leaving out the last bit about the constitution.

Prayuth became prime minister with the backing of pro-military members of a new parliament, elected in a contested March general election.

Earlier on Tuesday, Prayuth and his cabinet received a written message from the king encouraging the government to perform its duty well and do what was right, a government spokeswoman said.

Scorecard ranks U.S. retailers on sustainably produced wood furniture,https://www.woodworkingnetwork.com,[],08-28-2019,2019,8,https://www.woodworkingnetwork.com/news/woodworking-industry-news/scorecard-ranks-us-retailers-sustainably-produced-wood-furniture,"Which U.S. retailers are best at sourcing wood sustainably?

The National Wildlife Federation and Sustainable Furnishings Council ranked the country's 90 leading retailers on their wood sourcing practices, compiling the data into an online scorecard. With the annual scorecard, the Federation aims to encourage furniture retailers, big or small, to implement robust policies that drive responsible wood sourcing practices through their complex supply chains.

Top retailers included Cisco Home, ABC Carpet and Home, Ikea, and Williams-Sonoma.

""One thing to remember is that 65% of furniture in North America comes through independent retailers, not the chains,” the National Wildlife Federation's Barbara Bramble. “So that's why we've made the list of companies we score a wide variety.""

Responsible wood sourcing is good for business, says the Federation. According to a poll by the Sustainable Furnishings Council, more than 80 percent of consumers surveyed said they are interested in buying furniture made from wood harvested from well-managed forests. Bramble said since the scorecard was developed last year, many companies already have made improvements.

""The scores, even the top category for several companies, went up this year. And, a number of companies who were in the very low-scoring basket have raised their scores as well,” she said. “So, I think this scorecard is catching their attention.""

President Trump may think he’s keeping Chinese negotiators guessing with his whiplash-inducing remarks about the U.S.-China trade war.

But he’s not fooling anyone here.

More than a year into the deepening commercial conflict, Chinese officials and analysts say they’ve got a handle on the tweeter-in-chief and are no longer fazed by his unpredictable initiatives.

“There is a lot of fatigue with President Trump’s ‘art of the deal,’ ” said Wang Huiyao, president of the Center for China and Globalization and an adviser to China’s cabinet.

“It’s like a roller coaster. Buenos Aires, Osaka, Shanghai. He says one thing one day, then hits the world with a surprise the next day,” Wang said, referring to the sites of high-level, if ill-fated, negotiating sessions. “The more they deal with him, the more they figure him out.”

At the Group of Seven leaders’ summit in Biarritz, France, this weekend, Trump brushed aside complaints that his habit of swerving between tough talk and a salesman’s hype was damaging the global economy.

“Sorry! It’s the way I negotiate,” he told reporters Monday. “It’s done very well for me over the years. It’s doing very well for the country.”

It hasn’t, however, produced a deal that would commit China to make the structural changes in its state-led economy that the administration has been seeking for more than a year.

Trump has announced tariffs that by Dec. 15 will cover almost 97 percent of the Chinese merchandise that American companies import, according to economist Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

By depressing demand for Chinese goods, U.S. tariffs have cost 3 million Chinese factory workers their jobs, according to Trump, and put pressure on Chinese President Xi Jinping to make a deal.

Trump’s claim to have the upper hand at the negotiating table does not appear to have convinced the Chinese.

“They’ve decided Trump is a vacillating guy who can’t figure out what he wants and gets spooked every time the stock market goes down or someone accuses him of not being tough,” said Arthur Kroeber, managing director of Gavekal Dragonomics, a consultancy in Beijing. “Although there are problems in China, they believe they have their economy under control, more so than Trump. They think he is more vulnerable to a slowdown and that they can afford to wait him out.”

[Trump retaliates in trade war by demanding companies cut ties with China ]

By early May, the two sides had completed 90 percent of a deal involving major Chinese purchases of American farm, industrial and energy products as well as enhanced protections for foreign companies’ technology and trade secrets, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said this summer.

But the trade war between the world’s economic superpowers appears to have entered a dangerous new phase this month, with new rounds of retaliatory tariffs and a demand from Trump that U.S. companies stop doing business with China.

That has caused alarm across the globe, with fears that the war could help tip leading economies such as Japan and Germany into recession and create new head winds for the American economy. China’s growth rate has, meanwhile, slowed to its lowest rate in three decades.

Chinese officials were initially mystified by Trump’s unconventional style, and Xi is said to have faced criticism for underestimating Trump’s resolve to tackle China’s trading practices.

But emerging last week from this year’s Communist Party confab at the beach resort of Beidaihe, China’s leadership appears to have decided to hunker down.

“What’s the point of calling Xi Jinping ‘a good friend’ and ‘a great leader’ but still increasing tariffs?” asked Yao Xinchao, a trade professor at the University of International Business and Economics. “He’s a 70-ish-year-old man but speaks like a 7-year-old kid. We just can’t listen to what he says now. I think Chinese leaders have realized this, too.”

Wang Yiwei, a professor of international relations at the Renmin University, shares a similarly disdainful view. “He is a real estate developer; he is a profiteer in the eyes of the Chinese people,” he said.

[‘Protectionist bullying’: China denounces Trump administration’s latest tariff hikes ]

But the bottom line remains that China, which is experiencing a marked economic slowdown, wants a deal.

“The trade dispute between China and the U.S. should be resolved through dialogue and consultations,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Tuesday, adding that the United States’s “maximum-pressure approach hurts both sides and is not in the least constructive.”

“We hope that the U.S. can exercise restraint, return to reason, and demonstrate sincerity in order to facilitate further consultations on the basis of mutual respect and mutual benefits,” Geng said.

The question now is how the two sides find a way out of the standoff.

Wei Jianguo, a former vice minister of commerce, said Trump’s efforts to browbeat countries such as Canada, Mexico and Japan into making a deal will not work with China.

“We have seen and understand Trump’s style,” Wei said. “If he thinks he can secure an advantage for the U.S. and wear China down by exerting various kinds of extreme pressure, he’s dreaming. It’s impossible.”

[With the U.S.-China trade war escalating, Trump arrives at G-7 with a list of grievances ]

The longer this pattern continues, the more China becomes concerned that any deal won’t stick.

“Now China understands him thoroughly and knows that inconsistency is his nature,” said Wang, of Renmin University. “Even if an agreement is signed, he may not implement it well. But, without an agreement, he does this over and over again, which is also very annoying.”

Many analysts expect the dispute to continue to at least November, when the two leaders are likely to meet at a summit of Pacific Rim nations in Chile.

Xi, meanwhile, confronts domestic political challenges that likely reduce his willingness to make concessions under foreign pressure. The authorities in Beijing face a growing crisis in Hong Kong, where protests aimed at preserving the city’s special status continue, and are preoccupied by preparations to celebrate in early October the politically charged 70th anniversary of the Communist Party’s takeover of China.

Liu Yang, Wang Yuan and Lyric Li contributed to this report.

"US Fed should help defeat Donald Trump in 2020, says former New York Federal Reserve Bank president Bill Dudley",https://www.firstpost.com,[],08-28-2019,2019,8,https://www.firstpost.com/world/us-fed-should-help-defeat-donald-trump-in-2020-says-former-new-york-federal-reserve-bank-president-bill-dudley-7238101.html,"Washington: A former top US central banker leapt into the political fray on Tuesday, calling on the Federal Reserve to oppose President Donald Trump's re-election effort next year.

Bill Dudley, the influential former president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, also said the Fed should not ""enable"" Trump's escalating trade war with China by lowering interest rates.

The stunning arguments in a Bloomberg opinion column flew in the face of efforts by current Fed officials to remain strictly neutral and above partisan politics, despite Trump's intense year-long campaign to demand easier monetary policy.

But Dudley said the outcome of the 2020 presidential elections was arguably ""within the Fed's purview"" because a second Trump term represented a threat to the global economy as well as to the Fed's political independence and policy mandates.

""If the goal of monetary policy is to achieve the best long-term economic outcome, then Fed officials should consider how their decisions will affect the political outcome in 2020,"" he wrote.

Trump already blames the Fed, rather than trade policy, for the slowing economy and has demanded drastic cuts in interest rates in his relentless, nearly daily attacks.

Last week he called Fed Chairman Jerome Powell an ""enemy"" and on Tuesday tweeted that central bankers loved ""watching our manufacturers struggle"" to export to markets with easier monetary policy.

Powell, when asked, has consistently brushed off Trump's near-daily invective, saying Fed officials do not take politics into account when deciding on a policy.

A spokesman for the central bank maintained this position on Tuesday, saying the Fed's policy decisions were guided ""solely by its congressional mandate"" for stable prices and maximum employment.

""Political considerations play absolutely no role,"" the spokesman said in a statement.

Earlier this month, the Fed cut interest rates for the first time in more than a decade even though unemployment remains at historic lows, amid growing concerns about the global economy.

And investors overwhelmingly expect the Fed to deliver at least a 25-basis-point rate cut next month as the economy slows and the US-China trade war drags into its second year.

But Dudley, who also served as the vice-chairman of the Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, said in his op-ed that providing more stimulus could encourage Trump to escalate a ""disastrous"" trade war with China, which deteriorated sharply last week.

""The central bank's efforts to cushion the blow might not be merely ineffectual. They might actually make things worse,"" he wrote.

Instead, the Fed should clearly state that it will not cut rates in response to Trump's trade actions, sending a signal that he will own the risks created by his trade wars — ""including the risk of losing the next election,"" Dudley said.

Dudley retired from his post as New York Fed president last year and is currently a senior research scholar at Princeton University."
USDA cuts buyout packages for employees who won't relocate,https://www.cnn.com,['Sam Fossum'],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/20/politics/usda-buyouts-kansas-city/index.html,"(CNN) The US Department of Agriculture is shrinking payments offered to employees who applied for buyouts rather than relocate to the greater Kansas City area, according to a document obtained by CNN.

The one-time payouts are being reduced from $25,000 to $10,000 because so many workers applied, according to the document.

The American Federation of Government Employees, which represents workers at the affected agencies, says employees of the two research-related agencies that are being moved out of the the Washington area are ""extremely upset.""

A USDA spokesperson told CNN that the department said the change was made in order to offer payments to all eligible employees, rather than offer only the higher amount on a first-come, first-served basis. Workers still have the option to refuse the reduced payment if they decide to relocate, the spokesperson added.

The change comes after a union-compiled survey released last month showed an overwhelming number of the reassigned employees will likely choose to leave rather than relocate -- losses that could drain institutional knowledge and talent at two units that fund agricultural research across the nation and produce crucial reports, including data on agricultural markets and estimates of US and international agricultural productivity.

Re: “Former governor considers Senate run,” Aug. 14 news story

Former Gov. John Hickenlooper clearly is not going to be the Democratic presidential nominee to run against Donald Trump. Some are prompting him, as the most recognizable name, to run for the U.S. Senate against Cory Gardner despite seeming little in his experience or temperament that fits into a legislative position.

His best prospect for a job post-election, should Democrats succeed in ousting the sitting president, is a Cabinet position in the next administration — perhaps interior secretary (though environmentalists will disagree here). His best move politically would be to work hard for the eventual nominee and hope for the best.

What about us, Chase Bank?

Last week, Chase Bank announced it is forgiving all credit card debt for Canadian customers. Chase closed all Canadian credit card accounts in March 2018, so rather than collect the payments that are legitimately owed, Chase just decided to forgive all those loans.

Who will pay for this magnanimous act? We will, in the form of higher interest rates and higher fees. I think we should cut up our Chase credit cards and send them to Chase with a note stating that we want to be treated the same as our northern neighbors.

A price too high to pay?

Re: “Protections for endangered species weakened by order,” Aug. 13 news story

The Trump administration has again displayed its core values by announcing a revision of the successful Endangered Species Act, with a healthy nod to industry. “Economic costs” are now a key factor in determining whether or not a species receives protection, thus placing the almighty dollar in a judgmental position on the sanctity and diversity of life in an interdependent ecosystem.

This precarious situation of deciding “who stays and who goes” based on financial interests is bound to be a blind and disastrous bargain. But the Trump administration continues to scorn even the most basic of environmental science.

Epstein’s fate

Re: “Epstein’s apparent suicide is unfathomable,” Aug. 12 commentary

I am not a believer in an afterlife, but in the case of Jeffrey Epstein, I’ll make an exception. There should be no escape. Guilt, shame and penitence for eternity seems fair.

Dangerous decision on scooters

Re: “Death raises safety concerns,” Aug. 13 news story

I honestly can’t imagine what Denver’s “study” process was that resulted in continuing to allow hundreds of electric scooters to be operated in our city. I realize the recent death occurred after the review, but there were hundreds of injuries and, based on my observations, the fatality was inevitable.

I live downtown, and what I have never seen is a rider wearing a helmet — not one. I have seen some responsible, lawful riders. But what I have seen many times is scooting the wrong way on streets and bike lanes, zooming along sidewalks, slaloming around pedestrians, zipping across streets midblock, etc.

So Denver recommends a helmet, and the companies take a break from counting cash to say safety is good, and provide tutorials or offer a helmet? Thank you both for your caring and commitment to public safety.

(Rich Pedroncelli/AP)

Taking their cue from red states that regularly banded together to sue the Obama administration, Democratic attorneys general began challenging the Trump administration in court the first month President Trump took office, starting with the travel ban.

The litigation by coalition has continued unabated, with at least six multistate lawsuits filed against Trump policies in August alone, most prominently against the president’s attempt to deny green cards and visa extensions to foreign nationals seeking public assistance.

Those August suits brought the total to 87 multistate legal actions in the 31 months since Trump took office, according to a database compiled by Marquette University political scientist Paul Nolette.

The litigant states tend to be the same in most cases, among them California, New York, Washington, Connecticut, Illinois, Hawaii, Vermont, Massachusetts and Colorado, along with the District of Columbia.

The figures surpass the 78 multistate suits against President Barack Obama in eight years and the 76 against President George W. Bush during his two terms, according to Nolette.

The most frequent state litigants against Obama included Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana and North Carolina.

The Democratic litigants are finding greater success against Trump than the Republicans did against Obama, said Nolette, with 40 victories and nine losses under their belt, a success rate of 82 percent. Winning, in Nolette’s database, includes completed cases as well as cases still being appealed.

Their most dramatic recent win came when the Supreme Court halted the administration’s plans to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census.

The figures present only a partial picture of Trump’s record in court as hundreds of cases have been brought by advocacy groups, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, environmental organizations like the Sierra Club and civil rights activists such as Lambda Legal.

Overall, according to a Washington Post count, the Trump administration has been on the losing end of at least 85 federal court decisions, many of which are being appealed.

The GOP attorneys general still have plenty to brag about in their battles against Obama: They chalked up 40 wins and 25 losses, a success rate of about 62 percent, with six cases still pending, Nolette said.

Their highest profile victories were securing an injunction from a Texas judge halting Obama’s deferred 2014 action program (DAPA) designed to protect millions of immigrant parents in the country illegally from being deported, and a ruling from another Texas judge that would effectively wipe out President Obama’s Affordable Care Act.

Nolette said in an interview that he had not yet calculated Bush’s won-lost record but he believed it was about the same as Obama’s.

The proliferation of multistate suits, Nolette said, represents a fundamental shift in the constitutional order.

Presidents, faced with divided government and gridlocked Congresses, have resorted more to unilateral executive decisions and agency action to change policy.

Both are more vulnerable to court challenges than acts of Congress and that encourages states to litigate.

“It’s a good indication of how much the partisan battle has shifted from what ostensibly is supposed to be a democratic institution, Congress, to institutions further outside the public eye,” he said.

Indeed, attorneys general such as California’s Xavier Becerra and New York’s Letitia James, both Democrats, along with Texas’s Ken Paxton, a Republican, have used the litigation to significantly raise their national profiles, taking on roles historically reserved for members of Congress.

Multistate litigation also provides greater opportunity for forum shopping. Despite the protestations of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. (“We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges”) partisan litigators have good reason to believe they will fare better in judicial circuits with more judges appointed by presidents of their own party.

Lawsuits against Trump administration policies, for example, have thrived in the federal courts within the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, particularly in California, Montana and Washington, where Democratic appointees have been in the majority for many years, an advantage shrinking as new Trump appointees join their ranks.

Republican attorneys general prefer the 5th Circuit, which includes Texas, where they believe they get more sympathy from the large number of Republican appointees.

They chose Texas for the Affordable Care Act litigation, just as Democrats chose New York and California as the main battlegrounds over the census."
"The executive branch's job is to enforce laws, not make them",https://thehill.com,[],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/457996-the-executive-branchs-job-is-to-enforce-laws-not-make-them,"The Trump administration unveiled two controversial sets of regulations last week. One narrows the eligibility criteria for legal immigrant status. The other eases protections for threatened and endangered species. Both policies face legal challenges.

People can legitimately debate whether these rules make sense as a matter of policy and politics. The environmental regulations arguably do more to protect big business than animal species, while the new immigration regulations make it even harder for migrants to remain in the United States legally.

As a personal matter, judges might like or dislike these outcomes. But as a professional matter, some judges believe that, under the Constitution, only Congress has the express power to make laws — not agencies that answer to the president. These judges tend to be ideologically conservative. Will that crowd join progressives to criticize the new regulations, albeit for different reasons?

ADVERTISEMENT

Not likely.

The argument against agency lawmaking was articulated most recently by Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch. He wrote the dissenting opinion in Gundy v. United States, a case involving lawmaking by the attorney general regarding the national sex offender registry. Gorsuch eloquently argued that lawmaking power belongs to Congress, and for good reason. Unlike career bureaucrats within the executive branch, Congress is democratically accountable to the people if they wind up making bad laws. Executive branch officials are supposed enforce the law, not create it. This is because — with the exception of the president — the people get no say in hiring and firing those in the executive branch.

To be sure, President Trump Donald John TrumpSenate Democrats warn Trump: Don't invite Putin to G-7 Trump blames Fed for manufacturing slowdown Pence responds to Haley tweet: I'm looking forward to running with Trump in 2020 MORE campaigned on aggressive elimination of federal regulations — which is a longstanding GOP objective — and has held to this promise. Proponents of deregulation argue that the federal administrative bureaucracy is bloated and inefficient, and that regulation of free markets is bad for businesses and bad for the economy. Everyone does better if the markets are allowed to function unimpeded by bureaucrats who wind up blocking progress and innovation.

That’s a fine position to take, of course — so long as what is good for the goose is also good for the gander. The problem with the conservative argument against lawmaking by agencies is that it’s often — and conveniently — abandoned once an agency does something that conservatives like politically.

Department of Commerce v. New York involved lawmaking by the Department of Commerce regarding the contents of the U.S. Census form. The Constitution gives the power to implement the Census to Congress — not the president. Congress handed that power off to the secretary of Commerce in a statute called the Census Act. Although this is what Congress did in the statute challenged in Gundy — to Gorsuch’s chagrin — he said nary a peep about the hand-off of legislative power in the Census Act.

Conservatives cannot have it both ways. Either delegation of lawmaking power by Congress to the executive branch is constitutionally acceptable or it is not.

One might argue that deregulation is taking regulations off the books, so it doesn’t involve lawmaking, and is less constitutionally objectionable. But that’s not what the Trump administration’s environmental and immigration regulations do. They make new laws.

Let’s start with the Endangered Species Act. It provides that “the Secretary shall by regulation . . . determine whether any species is an endangered species or a threatened species.” That language is the “hand-off” of legislative power from Congress to the secretary of the Department of Commerce, whom today happens to be Wilbur Ross Wilbur Louis RossHillicon Valley: Court delays ruling against Qualcomm | Google asks employees not to talk politics at work | Facebook releases early emails discussing Cambridge Analytica | Bannon to release anti-Huawei film Bannon to release anti-Huawei film 'Claws of the Red Dragon' Trump administration announces deal to avert tariffs on Mexican tomatoes MORE.

The statute then gives Ross a bunch of factors to use in deciding whether a species is endangered or threatened, including habitat destruction, overutilization of the species for commercial or other purposes, disease or predation, inadequate regulations or “other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.”

The agency’s regulations add new factors to this list, including the requirement that a threatened species must become endangered “within the foreseeable future.” For that determination, the agency must now consider factors like “threat-projection timeframes, and environmental variability.”

The immigration regulations are no less constitutionally objectionable. The Immigration and Nationality Act gives the secretary of Homeland Security the power to “establish . . . regulations” to implement the statute. (Again, that’s the “hand-off.”) The statute also states that “any alien who . . . is likely at any time to become a public charge is inadmissible,” and provides a list of factors for use in deciding if someone is a “public charge,” including age, health, family status, assets, resources, financial status, education and skills.

Once again, the agency’s new regulations add new factors to this list, defining “public charge” to also capture “any alien who receives one or more public benefits,” including federally-funded benefits such as housing assistance and Medicaid.

Handing off legislative power to agencies is not considered unconstitutional under current Supreme Court case law, and there are good reasons for tolerating the practice.

But if conservative judges are going to complain about them, they should do so across-the-board. The leaders of the agencies involved in these rulemakings were never on the ballot for the offices they hold. Voters who don’t like these laws cannot go to the polls and fire them. This is precisely why Gorsuch and other conservative judges have balked at lawmaking by agencies. It messes with the separation of powers.

The question for conservatives is this: If either of these laws were to reach the Supreme Court, would Gorsuch kvetch that this particular lawmaking by executive branch agencies is constitutionally objectionable? Or would he stay silent — as in the Census case — leaving us to wonder whether his constitutional purity is contingent on conservative ideology and politics?

Because if it’s the latter, then we might have politicians on the Supreme Court after all.

Let President Trump cancel spending that was never used,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Andy Biggs']",08-27-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/aug/27/rescinding-wasteful-unspent-appropriations/,"ANALYSIS/OPINION:

It is said that there are two parties in Washington, D.C., that want to increase spending, Democrats and Republicans. It is imperative that, as we approach the end of the fiscal year, we consider tools to curb some of the ravenous appetite to spend money in D.C. — using the presidential prerogative to rescind some of our wasteful and subsequently unspent appropriations.

Rescission is a tool that was created by Congress in the 1970s and has been used by presidents of both parties over the decades. President Trump has indicated a desire to cancel spending that was never used, particularly in foreign aid accounts. Whenever he has done so, however, there have been howls from the big spenders in Congress and federal agencies.

While they will predict destruction of the country and our diplomatic relations, the reality is that most of what the president has considered in the past are ones that have previously been identified as being wasteful. How’s that for a novel concept? Actually eliminating programs that have been found to be a waste of taxpayers’ dollars.

I saw firsthand that the United Nations is one of the most-inept institutions on the world stage, yet the United States pays a hefty price as a member and host. While Congress and the federal bureaucracy are experts at wasting funds, we are pikers compared to the skill with which the U.N. blows money — without any accountability. The president has the right idea to eliminate funding of U.N. programs that don’t address critical U.S. needs.

The Executive Branch has some money that was authorized but has been sitting unused for more than two years. Some bureaucrats view these accounts as a potential place to satiate their desire to spend money (after all, there is little incentive to save the money). Rescission by the president will allow these funds to be returned to the U.S. Treasury.

When I first ran for Congress, our national debt was around $20 trillion. Today, it exceeds $22 trillion and is speeding toward $23 trillion. Both parties are to blame.

Revenue to the U.S. Treasury is growing at 3 percent per year but spending growth is around 7 percent. Our spending is in the trillions of dollars. We do not have a revenue problem; we have a gigantic spending problem.

The big spenders in Congress were not at all supportive of the president’s proposal, but he has the authority to claw back unused funds.

National security experts have repeatedly warned us that our biggest national security threat is not the Chinese, Russians or terrorists. They tell us it is our own national debt. As long as our spending rate surpasses our revenue, we will have a structural deficit. That results in a monumental national debt increase.

Even an aggressive proposal by the president will be a mere nudge in the right direction on spending. Regardless, I will support the president should he provide Congress with another rescission package to cut spending. It is the first step in the right direction of addressing our out-of-control spending problem. I hope it will lead to a strong push to bring our national debt under control.

Can Trump Actually Buy Greenland? The Short Answer Is No,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Nick Rigillo', 'Morten Buttler']",08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/can-trump-actually-buy-greenland-the-short-answer-is-no/2019/08/21/ec08c1d2-c3f4-11e9-8bf7-cde2d9e09055_story.html,"1. Why would Trump want to buy Greenland?

A real estate baron before his turn to politics, Trump has a history of analyzing geopolitical issues through the lens of a property developer. During his 2018 meeting with Kim Jong Un, for example, Trump spoke of the potential he sees for beach hotels and condos in North Korea. Plus, as Trump surely knows, other U.S. presidents have made their mark in history for such grand ideas.

2. Why is Greenland interesting for the U.S.?

Besides being bigger than Mexico and Saudi Arabia, Greenland has abundant resources and a strategic location near the warming Arctic. Located in the northern Atlantic Ocean between Europe and America, the island has long been a nexus of tensions among the U.S., Russia, Canada, Denmark and Norway. It’s already home to a strategic U.S. air base and radar station. In 1968, a B-52 bomber carrying nuclear weapons crashed near the Thule base in northwestern Greenland, causing radioactive contamination. More recently, Denmark stopped China from gaining a foothold on its territory by agreeing to co-fund the construction of two new airports.

3. Is the idea totally outlandish?

Until a century ago, these kinds of transactions were not unusual: The U.S. bought the territory of Louisiana from France for $15 million in 1803, and Andrew Johnson is remembered as the president who oversaw the acquisition of Alaska from Russia in 1867. There’s even a precedent involving Denmark. The government in Copenhagen sold what are now known as the U.S. Virgin Islands in 1917. There are in fact plenty of other islands for sale, but they tend to be smaller and located in warmer climates. But as the BBC points out, Joseph Blocher of the Duke University School of Law wrote in 2012 that the “market for sovereign territory seems to have dried up” as it does “not seem to be for sale.”

4. How much would Greenland cost to buy?

Since the 830,000 square-mile (2.1 million square-kilometer) island isn’t currently on the market, there are no valuations available. However, for a sense of how much it might fetch, it’s worth noting that its gross domestic product totaled just over $2.7 billion in 2017. The island receives an annual subsidy of about $500 million from Denmark. For perspective, the purchase price of Alaska in 1867, $7.2 million, would translate to just $125 million today -- which most would agree would be quite a bargain.

5. How would Trump go about buying Greenland?

It’s unclear. Adjunct Professor Rasmus Leander Nielsen of Greenland University has told local media that Denmark can’t sell Greenland because its home-rule law of 2009 “clearly states that Greenlanders are their own people.” Trump’s best hope would be for the territory to gain independence and then choose to arrange a sale to the U.S. As it turns out, breaking away from Denmark has been discussed in Greenland, where advocates of independence have touted 2021, the 300th anniversary of colonization, as a possible leave date. One argument in favor of independence is that Greenland should have a closer association with North America, which is much nearer than Denmark.

6. Could Trump do this on his own?

Under the U.S. Constitution, the U.S. Congress would have to approve money for any such purchase. But Trump has shown a willingness to try to go around Congress’s power of the purse. When it refused to appropriate money for more fencing on the U.S.-Mexico border, Trump raided the Pentagon’s budget to find funds for it -- and the Supreme Court backed him up.

7. What might the next step be?

According to the New York Times, skeptical Trump advisers have told him they would investigate the matter further, but only because they’d rather not tell him that the purchase is impossible. Trump would have had an opportunity to discuss the matter personally with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, but the president canceled his planned Sept. 2-3 state visit to Denmark after his Greenland scheme was rebuked.

"Labor Cabinet: 1,074 'sickout' teachers broke the law, but won't be fined",https://www.courier-journal.com,"['Mandy Mclaren', 'Published P.M. Et Aug.']",08-16-2019,2019,8,https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/education/2019/08/16/kentucky-labor-cabinet-sickout-teachers-wont-fined/2033916001/,"CLOSE

More than 1,000 Kentucky teachers broke the law by participating in this year's ""sickout"" protests, but will not be fined for their actions, the state labor department announced.

Teachers faced fines of up to $1,000 for each day they were caught falsely calling in sick.

""While no penalties will be assessed for violations in this specific instance, this investigation was necessary to ensure that public schools remain open during the upcoming school year and that similar work stoppages do not occur in the future,"" the Labor Cabinet said in a news release late Friday afternoon.

Altogether, an investigation into the sickouts determined 1,074 teachers engaged in an ""illegal work stoppage,"" the cabinet said.

Kentucky Labor Secretary David Dickerson called for the investigation in May. He and his boss, Gov. Matt Bevin, had blasted teachers for lying about being sick and for forcing school districts to shut down as a result.

""Let it be clearly understood that the grace extended in this instance will not be extended for future such proven violations,” Dickerson said in the Friday statement. “The public cannot tolerate another illegal work stoppage in our schools.""

Earlier: Names in hand, state officials will investigate sickout teachers

The state's largest district, Jefferson County Public Schools, closed its doors to nearly 100,000 students six times over a two-week period in early 2019.

The Labor Cabinet did not say how it arrived at its conclusion. But its Office of the Inspector General, which handled the sickout investigation, likely looked at district records to see which teachers had called in sick on multiple occasions.

Attorney General Andy Beshear, Bevin's opponent in this year's race for governor, went to court to try to stop the Labor Cabinet from getting teachers' names from local school districts.

Those names, along with other sickout records, were first collected in March by Education Commissioner Wayne Lewis. The Labor Cabinet did an end-run around Beshear's lawsuit, getting the records directly from Lewis' department.

Friday's announcement drew immediate criticism from Beshear and other Democrats.

“Today, Matt Bevin and the Labor Cabinet backed down and stated that they would not attempt to fine brave Kentucky teachers who protested his anti-education policies at the Capitol,"" Beshear said.

""This is a clear win for the thousands of teachers that this governor tried to bully,"" he added. ""While the governor’s press release attempts to threaten future punishment of teachers, we’ve stopped him before, we stopped him here and we will stop him in the future.”

Previously: Beshear scores win in lawsuit over teacher-sickout inquiry

House Democratic Leaders Rocky Adkins, Derrick Graham and Joni Jenkins also released a statement.

“This administration has tried every trick in the book to undermine our teachers and their supporters,"" the Democrats said. ""Its Labor Cabinet threatens them with fines for exercising their right to be heard on legislation directly affecting them; its Finance and Administration Cabinet all but locks the doors to the Capitol to shut down any form of dissent; and the governor calls them thugs and tries to take away their retirement. Our teachers — and all of Kentucky — deserve better than this.”

KY 120 United, which called for the first 2019 teacher sickout but did not outright endorse the following protests, said the Labor Cabinet's decision ""surprised exactly no one.""

""School is just barely back in session and already Kentucky teachers have received their first threat from one of Bevin’s heavies at the Labor Cabinet,"" the group said in a statement. "" ... Our Kentucky teachers continue to show up for our kids and help them achieve their goals. We should expect our legislators and governor and his hand picked cabinet to respect our education system and it's lifeblood — teachers. As we face critical teacher shortages, this administration is bent on continuing the attacks. Game. On.""

Education news: Kentucky PTA sues to block activist from seeing spending records

Because Kentucky teachers do not have the legal right to strike, they have instead staged sickouts, with thousands of teachers calling out sick for the same day. The protests began during the 2018 legislative session, first as a massive rebuke to the late-night passage of a bill that would have affected teachers' pensions.

This year's sickouts, which took place between Feb. 28 and March 14, came in response to legislation that protesting teachers said would harm public schools, including a proposal to create a private school scholarship tax credit. That bill, which did not pass, would have drained revenue from the state's public schools, teachers said

Over the two-week period, 10 Kentucky districts were occasionally forced to close their doors to students. Bath, Boyd, Bullitt, Carter, Fayette, Letcher, Jefferson, Madison, Marion and Oldham counties were affected.

Teachers and their advocates say they were exercising their First Amendment rights on days when school was not in session.

Beshear's lawsuit against the cabinet remains ongoing. A pretrial hearing is scheduled for Monday morning in Franklin Circuit Court.

What is the G7? Here's the History of the Conference,https://time.com,['Julia Webster'],,,,https://time.com/5657375/what-is-g7/,"Heads of state are meeting on Saturday for a two-day summit in the southern French city of Biarritz. President Emmanuel Macron is this year’s host and wants the meeting to focus on fighting inequality and protecting biodiversity and climate.

Here’s everything you need to know about the conference of world leaders.

What does G7 stand for?

G7 stands for “Group of Seven” industrialized nations. It used to be known as the G8 (Group of Eight) until 2014 when Russia was excluded because of its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.

Why was G7 created?

The G7 was created more than four decades ago as an annual gathering of political leaders to discuss and exchange ideas on a broad range of issues, including global economy, security and energy.

France, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States and West Germany formed the Group of Six in 1975 so that the noncommunist powers could come together to discuss economic concerns, which at the time included inflation and recession following an OPEC oil embargo. Canada joined the following year. Russia eventually joined in 1998 — and its inclusion was meant as a signal of cooperation between East and West after the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991.

The G7 is an informal bloc and takes no mandatory decisions, so the leaders’ declarations at the end of the summit are not binding.

Which countries are members of the G7?

The group includes the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, Japan, France and Italy. Together, the G7 countries represent 40% of global GDP and 10% of the world’s population.

The European Union has been involved in G7 work since 1977, and is represented at the summit by the President of the European Commission (the E.U.’s executive branch) Jean-Claude Juncker, and the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk. The E.U. has gradually been included in all political discussions on the agenda despite not having official member status.

This would have been Juncker’s last G7, as he is soon to be replaced by his successor, Ursula von der Leyen, following the European elections that took place in May. However, on Monday it was announced that Juncker will not travel to Biarritz for the summit since he needs to continue his recovery after having had emergency surgery at the weekend.

Why was Russia kicked out of the G8?

Russia was kicked out of the then G8 in 2014 after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine, which was seen by leaders as a “violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”.

President Barack Obama and other world leaders announced in a joint statement, titled The Hague Declaration, in March 2014 that they would cancel that year’s planned meeting in Sochi, Russia.

“Under these circumstances, we will not participate in the planned Sochi summit,” the statement said. “We will suspend our participation in the G8 until Russia changes course and the environment comes back to where the G8 is able to have a meaningful discussion.”

Speaking to reporters at the White House on Tuesday, a few days before his departure for the summit, Donald Trump said Russia should be allowed to re-join the G7 group. “I think it’s much more appropriate to have Russia in. It should be the G8 because a lot of the things we talk about have to do with Russia,” he said.

Next year it will be the turn of the United States to host the G7.

What’s the difference between G7 and G20?

They have similar names and similar functions. While the G7 mainly has to do with politics, the G20 is a broader group that focuses on the global economy. It’s also known as the “Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy” and represents 80% of global GDP.

It gathers leaders from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as the European Union.

Founded in 1999 after the Asian financial crisis in 1997-1998, the G20 started off as a meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors. However, as a response to the financial crisis of 2008, the G20 was upgraded to head of state level in an inaugural summit in Washington, D.C.

This year’s G20 was chaired by Japan. The 2019 Osaka summit was the 14th meeting of the G20, held on 28-29 June 2019.
