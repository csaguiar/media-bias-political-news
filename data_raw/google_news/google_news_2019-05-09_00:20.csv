Donald Trump Jr. Is Subpoenaed to Testify to Senate Panel on Russia Contacts,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Mark Mazzetti', 'Maggie Haberman']",05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/us/politics/donald-trump-jr-subpoena.html,"The committee is particularly interested in the younger Mr. Trump’s account of the events surrounding the Trump Tower meeting — as well as his role in his father’s efforts to build a skyscraper in Moscow — and comparing the testimony to his previous answers to Senate investigators in 2017. Mr. Trump is a scion of President Trump’s global business empire and was one of his father’s close advisers during the election.

Republicans expressed frustration with news of the subpoena. Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House minority leader, tweeted that the younger Mr. Trump “has already spent dozens of hours testifying in front of Congressional committees. Endless investigations — by either party — won’t change the fact that there was NO collusion. It’s time to move on. It’s time to focus on ISSUES, not investigations.”

A lawyer for Donald Trump Jr. declined to comment, as did spokespeople for the committee’s leaders.

The decision to subpoena the president’s son is an aggressive move, and appears to have come after discussions broke down about whether the younger Mr. Trump might appear voluntarily before the panel. Mr. Trump was highly unlikely to appear before the panel in person, three people close to him said, and one person said that he could invoke his Fifth Amendment rights in a written response.

The June 9, 2016, Trump Tower meeting was the main focus of investigators’ questions during Senate Judiciary Committee testimony the following year. Investigators were particularly interested in what — if anything — Mr. Trump told his father about what had transpired. Repeatedly, he told them that he said nothing to President Trump — either before the meeting or after.

“I wouldn’t have wasted his time with it,” he said.

But Michael D. Cohen, the president’s longtime lawyer, recalled being in a meeting at Trump Tower when Donald Trump Jr. told his father about a planned meeting “to obtain adverse information about Clinton,” according to the report by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, citing Mr. Cohen’s testimony."
Why Markets Aren’t Sweating the U.S.-China Trade War Much: The ‘Trump Put’,https://www.nytimes.com,['Neil Irwin'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/upshot/trade-war-stock-market-china-us-tariff.html,"The real question is not why the stock market is down this week. It is why it is down so little.

After all, the world’s two largest economies have seemed to be hurtling toward a major escalation of their trade war. American officials have complained that Chinese negotiators have been playing a bait-and-switch, backing away from concessions they had agreed to.

President Trump said the United States would raise its tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent on Friday, and begin taxing the remaining $325 billion of goods at that rate “shortly.” For a while, it was unclear whether negotiations would resume at all this week.

[President Trump taunted China by tweet on Wednesday.]

If trade talks did disintegrate, even with the arrival of high-level Chinese officials in Washington, the economy would be in danger of experiencing a meaningful downturn and potentially a recession. Economists at Moody’s Analytics, for example, expect it would subtract 1.8 percentage points from G.D.P. growth and cause unemployment to rise.

It would particularly hammer the financial results of some of the prominent American companies that either import Chinese goods or rely on the country as a major export market."

Sessions sides with Barr over FBI's 'spying' on Trump campaign,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Alex Pappas', 'Alex Pappas Is A Politics Reporter At Foxnews.Com. Follow Him On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sessions-sides-with-barr-over-fbi-spying-on-trump-campaign,"Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Wednesday sided with his successor, Bill Barr, over FBI Director Christopher Wray in describing bureau surveillance of Trump associates during the 2016 presidential campaign as “spying.”

“I think that ‘spying’ is a perfectly good word,” Sessions said during an on-stage interview at a conference in Las Vegas.

Sessions was asked about the recent split between Barr and Wray over the word. Barr has said he believes “spying” on the Trump campaign did occur in 2016 as the bureau conducted the Russia probe; Wray said he wouldn’t use the word “spying” to describe the FBI’s surveillance activity.

FBI DIRECTOR WRAY SAYS SURVEILLANCE NOT THE SAME AS ‘SPYING’

Sessions referenced last week’s New York Times story about an informant working for U.S. intelligence who posed as a Cambridge University research assistant in September 2016 to try to probe George Papadopoulos, then a Trump foreign policy adviser, on the campaign's possible ties to Russia.

“They had this lady, apparently, that was sent to Papadopoulos,” Sessions said. “Is that a spy? I mean, I don't know.” Sessions said it will take “more facts to come out” to know.

On Tuesday, asked about ""spying,"" Wray, the FBI director, said: “That’s not the term I would use. Lots of people have different colloquial phrases. I believe that the FBI is engaged in investigative activity, and part of investigative activity includes surveillance activity of different shapes and sizes, and to me, the key question is making sure that it's done by the book, consistent with our lawful authorities.”

US INFORMANT REPORTEDLY TRIED TO PROBE PAPADOPOULOS ON TRUMP-RUSSIA TIES, 'SEDUCE HIM' DURING CAMPAIGN

Both Barr and President Trump have alleged, following the release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia report with redactions, that the bureau engaged in spying against Trump associates during the 2016 presidential campaign.

""I think spying did occur,"" Barr said in a hearing last month. ""The question is whether it was adequately predicated. … Spying on a political campaign is a big deal.""

Barr later clarified in the hearing, ""I am not saying that improper surveillance occurred; I’m saying that I am concerned about it and looking into it, that’s all.”

BARR TESTIFIES 'SPYING DID OCCUR' ON TRUMP CAMPAIGN

Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz is looking into the origins of the Russia probe and whether surveillance abuses occurred, but Barr’s remarks were widely criticized by Democrats, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., accusing the AG of “peddling conspiracy theories.” Yet Trump allies note that there is documented evidence that the FBI obtained surveillance warrants to monitor Trump adviser Carter Page and that numerous reports have disclosed the use of an informant and others to gather information during the early days of the probe.

Barr testified last week that he's working with Wray to try and ""reconstruct"" the origins of the probe.

"""All I'm Thinking Is, 'I'm Going to Die'"": Howard Stern Reveals Cancer Scare, Trump Regrets and Details of a Dishy New Book",https://www.hollywoodreporter.com,['Lacey Rose'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/howard-stern-reveals-cancer-scare-trump-regrets-details-a-dishy-new-book-1208773,"After a health crisis that had him ""scared s***less,"" the $90 million-a-year radio legend opens up about retirement, the one time he lied to his listeners and his metamorphosis from shock jock to insightful interviewer: ""I'd feel really f***ing s***ty if I hadn't evolved.""

On Wednesday, May 10, 2017, for the first time in memory, Howard Stern abruptly canceled that day's show. His listeners, a famously loyal subset of SiriusXM's 36 million subscribers who've made Stern a part of their lives since he rose to prominence in the '80s as radio's boundary-pushing ""shock jock,"" were understandably alarmed. Reddit lit up with crackpot theories, and a handful of dogged reporters tracked down the host's elderly parents to check up on him.

By Monday, the self-described king of all media was back on the air, poking fun at the hullaballoo, as many hoped he would. It was just the flu, he told his audience: ""Why is it such a big deal that I took a fucking day off?""

Turns out, he was lying through his teeth.

On the morning in question, Stern wasn't home with a fever or runny nose; he was being carted into surgery. For the better part of the previous year, he'd been shuttling between appointments as doctors monitored a low white blood cell count revealed during a routine checkup and, later, discovered a growth on his kidney. The chance that it was cancerous: 90 percent.

For a man who lives his life on-air, divulging such personal details as his first wife's miscarriage and his reputedly undersized penis, he'd been uncharacteristically discreet about his latest struggle. In fact, he told only his very inner circle, a group that included his second wife, Beth, his three daughters, his therapist and his on-air foil of nearly four decades, Robin Quivers, herself a cancer survivor. Until all this, Stern had considered himself invincible — at 65, his 6-foot-5 frame was still enviably trim, his head endowed with a thick mop of curls. He ate well and exercised often. Cancer was a ridiculous notion.

""And now all I'm thinking is, 'I'm going to die,' "" he recalls in an interview, his first time discussing the health issue publicly. ""And I'm scared shitless.""

A couple of hours and seven incisions to his abdomen later, he came out of surgery to learn it had all been a scare. A tiny, harmless cyst. The news should have been comforting. But for the first time in Stern's adult life, he'd come face-to-face with his own mortality, and now there was no turning back.

In the 24 months since, he's found himself wondering often if he's done it all wrong. Despite fame and fortune unrivaled in his medium, Stern says he's a mountain of regret. He beats himself up over the father he couldn't be to those three girls, now grown and living elsewhere; and the husband he never was to their mother, Alison, who finally left him in 1999. He can't read his first two best-selling books, Private Parts (1993) and Miss America ('95), without cringing at his own narcissism, and he insists nearly every one of the interviews he conducted during his pre-satellite radio days makes him sick.

""I was so completely fucked up back then,"" he says, his head shaking with disgust on this morning in early April. ""I didn't know what was up and what was down, and there was no room for anybody else on the planet."" His more recent metamorphosis, the result of age, a healthy marriage and intensive therapy, has revealed sensitivities he didn't know he had. It's also sharpened his skills as an interviewer.

Dressed now like an aging rocker with a pair of dark jeans, boots and his signature shades perched just above his brows, Stern is sprawled out on the charcoal-gray couch usually reserved for guests in his midtown Manhattan studio. He's explaining how his brush with cancer is a key reason he agreed to write his first book in two decades, Howard Stern Comes Again, a curated collection of edited transcripts from his favorite interviews — with everyone from Billy Joel to Donald Trump (more on him later) — wrapped in his own memories and candid self-reflection. There's considerably more in the book on his health scare, too, along with his musings on fame, sex and spirituality. ""It's as much his autobiography in conversation as it is a tour through American pop culture over the last 20 years,"" says Jonathan Karp, publisher of Simon & Schuster, which will release the book May 14. That brush is also the reason Stern's been having real discussions about what's next once his contract with SiriusXM, which reportedly pays him $90 million a year, expires at the end of 2020.

""I'm at a place now where I am trying to figure out how to spend the rest of my life, however long that might be,"" he says. He's been flirting with the idea of retirement in conversation with close friends and, occasionally, on the air. ""It seems weird to me not to have this,"" he nods at the desk where he spends four to five hours three mornings a week — but maybe it would be great. Maybe his painting could improve. Maybe he could take that sketch class he's been thinking about. Maybe he and Beth, 46, and their coterie of rescue cats, could travel more, visiting those kids he doesn't get to see enough of.

He wouldn't be bored, he's sure of that; but is Howard Stern really ready to shut up?

***

America's most famous radio personality has been screaming for attention his entire life. Early on, it was through performance: dirty puppet shows for his pals, impressions for his parents. His radio engineer father would offer feedback, if not exactly encouragement — and a valuable lesson in how to keep an audience engaged. ""Stop!"" his dad would bark. ""You're going on too long! Make it interesting!""

By the time he hit puberty, Howard's Long Island community had transformed from predominantly white to predominantly black. As he recalls, the arrival of black families prompted his so-called liberal neighbors to flee in the middle of the night. It was an early education in hypocrisy, and it left him outraged: ""All these preachy phonies who would go to services and say, 'All people are the same in God's eyes' were full of shit,"" he seethes. His parents, along with Stern and his older sister, Ellen, would stay put. By his freshman year of high school, he was one of only a handful of white kids left in class, a de facto outsider who'd frequently find himself on the receiving end of somebody's fist.

The Sterns eventually relocated to a nearby white neighborhood, but by then Howard was woefully behind academically and a complete disaster socially. ""I was traumatized,"" he says. Still, he got admitted to Boston University, where he found an outlet on the campus radio station and later a series of gigs that took him from Hartford to Detroit. In the early days, he'd shake every time he got on-air; but with time, he began to relax and find his voice, a mix of hijinks and puerile humor.

By the early '80s, Stern landed in D.C., where he was first paired with Quivers and, through a series of outrageous antics, sealed his shock jock reputation. No prank seemed to get quite as much attention as the one he pulled the morning after an Air Florida flight crashed in the Potomac River, killing 78 people. The host famously pretended to ring the airline, inquiring about the price of a one-way ticket to the 14th Street Bridge. Those who weren't horrified were highly amused. From there, Stern moved to New York, the most coveted of markets, where he shared with format predecessor Don Imus a station and a slogan: ""If we weren't so bad, we wouldn't be so good."" By 1986, his eponymous show was nationally syndicated.

With each stunt, Stern's audience seemed to grow larger and more passionate. At its peak, The Howard Stern Show reached an estimated 20 million weekly listeners. Money followed, though the number of zeroes seemed important to him largely as a measure of success. Save a few pricey homes — in Manhattan, the Hamptons and Florida — the borderline recluse has never been known as a big spender or a man of lavish taste. (Money is the rare subject that Stern has long been unwilling to touch, unless of course he's the one asking the questions.) Winning, on the other hand, ""became an almost debilitating obsession,"" he says. He was committed to doing and saying pretty much anything to stay on top: be it dialing for dates with lesbians or banging bare bottoms like bongos. At one point, one in every four cars on Long Island was listening to The Howard Stern Show during the morning commute; he was fixated on the other three: What the hell were they listening to if not him?

For years, guests served merely as props, there to service Stern's audience. ""My interviewing technique was like bashing someone in the face with a sledgehammer,"" he writes in the new book. ""I was like the Joker, and all I wanted to do was cause chaos."" He asked Gilda Radner if Gene Wilder was well endowed, driving her right out of the studio. He spent the bulk of his time with Carly Simon telling the singer how hot she was; and, despite multiple warnings not to ask George Michael about his sexuality, he did so immediately. There were plenty more, from Eminem to Will Ferrell, who appeared once then never again.

What Stern lacked was the humility to be a fan of anybody but himself. At least not publicly. ""I lashed out at anyone and everyone whose career was prospering,"" he offers. ""I thought I should be at the center of the universe, and whenever it seemed like someone else was, I couldn't accept it."" David Letterman? Blasted him. Jerry Seinfeld? Him, too. Rosie O'Donnell? Forget it. His denunciations of her inspired Stern fans to rummage through her trash and threaten the life of her young son. ""It got to the point where it was terrifying,"" says O'Donnell, who, in a stunning twist, became a Stern confidante years later.

An early '90s interview he did with Robin Williams still ranks among Stern's biggest regrets, however, in part because it's too late to apologize, as he has to others. ""I loved Robin Williams, but there I am beating him over the head with, like, 'Hey, I hear you're fucking your nanny?' I could have had a great conversation, but I'm playing to the audience,"" he says. ""They want to hear outrageousness, and that's my arrogance thinking that Robin Williams can't entertain my audience. How stupid am I?""

In the end, Stern found himself stuck in an arms race with himself, constantly reaching for new levels of outrage. It caused endless headaches: Religious groups came after him, as did the FCC, levying millions in fines. Advertisers regularly pulled their support and cranks called in death threats. ""I was a nervous fucking wreck, ready to jump out a window,"" he admits. But he wouldn't be stopped. ""Every issue — race, religion, sexuality — was dealt with as honestly and openly as possible to the detriment of everything around me. I was like scorched earth, … trying to be heard like the mountain that roared.""

Everything else in Stern's life, including his college sweetheart, Alison, and their three daughters, took a back seat. He just couldn't see it at the time. ""I lived in a delusional world. I thought I was the best parent. I thought I was like Ward Cleaver, living the Leave It to Beaver life. I didn't realize everything was crumbling around me,"" he says now. ""I mean, I didn't even know what it meant to be a grown man with a family. I didn't know anything. I was a child.""

Then, in late 2004, came a lifeline from Sirius, a fledgling satellite service that was willing to bet $500 million (and, arguably, its future) on Stern. He'd start in 2006, getting two entire channels to himself and the freedom to do and say whatever he damn well pleased. No federal decency rules to contend with, nor skittish bosses breathing down his neck. On his way out, he caused one last firestorm, promoting his switch to Sirius on the air at CBS Radio, prompting then-boss Leslie Moonves to slap him with a nine-figure lawsuit. Scorched earth it was.

***

Sirius was, by all accounts, the Wild West. He could get away with anything, and for a good stretch he did. ""We said 'fuck,' we said 'shit,' we weighed a guy's doody,"" he recalls. Then something happened. He began to lose interest in outrage. With no rules left to break, it wasn't that much fun anymore.

It was time to evolve.

By that point, Stern was spending as many as four days a week in therapy — he's now down to two, though his longtime therapist would prefer three — and he was interested in having more genuine conver­sations. He felt he was finally being heard and was eager to hear from others. ""You can only interview so many strippers,"" he offers without a whiff of irony. Don't get him wrong, however: he ""loved the idea that we'd go on the air and measure our penises or discuss vaginal secretions —whatever it was, if it freaked you out, I loved it because, to me, it was not a big deal. But now I find it gross. And I'd feel really fucking shitty if I hadn't evolved. I'd be completely out of step with the times.""

With little warning, Stern's off on a tear about the industry's more recent cultural reckoning, enraged once again by the hypocrisy it's revealed. After all, several of the professional moralists who'd attacked him for his on-air antics were now being exposed for ""doing really weird shit"" in private. ""It just shows you that people are full of shit,"" he says, before directing his fury at his former nemesis: ""I'll admit there was a certain joy that I took when the #MeToo movement broke and [we found out] Les Moonves is doing all these things in his private life.""

To Stern's delight, most of his listeners have been willing to evolve with him. Not all, of course. There are some who miss the old Howard — including former Howard Stern Show personality Artie Lange — who accuses him of having gone soft. Stern, for his part, counters that he has little left to offer those who say, ""We want you squeezing a perfect stranger's titties in the studio."" Which is not to suggest he or his show have somehow become G-rated. There are still plenty of pranks, profanity and egregious sex talk that can occasionally feel jarring in the year 2019. He shrugs and says, ""I still have a really juvenile sense of humor.""

At his therapist's urging, Stern has been making room in his life for interests beyond radio. He took up chess for a few years, then photography, though in both cases, he says, ""My compulsion to be the greatest crept in and strangled the fun out of it."" Now, he's all in on painting. He's opened himself up to genuine friendships, too, with folks like Jimmy Kimmel and O'Donnell. (It was Mia Farrow who brokered peace between the two, telling Stern that he and Rosie had been the only ones who publicly admonished her ex, Woody Allen, well before it was culturally in vogue to do so. ""She told him, 'Stop being such an asshole. You and Rosie have more in common than you think,' "" says O'Donnell. ""And really, we do."")

Selling Hollywood's gatekeepers on the new Stern would take time. For years, he'd been enemy No. 1 in most publicity circles, and often the feeling was mutual. ""Their job was to avoid controversy,"" he says, ""and my job was to create it."" But, gradually, he became so eager to showcase his softer side, he signed on to judge America's Got Talent in 2012, to the shock of his longtime agent, Don Buchwald. Perhaps more shocking: It worked. ""I had a reputation as a stark-raving lunatic before that,"" says Stern. After his four seasons on the NBC talent competition, ""I went from America's nightmare to Santa Claus. Literally, people were putting their kids on my lap.""

Slowly, stars and their handlers began to accept the shift, too. Stern describes his interviewing technique now as the ""dinner party approach,"" explaining how he coaxes his guests to be spontaneous without having to get in their faces. He points to an early 2015 interview with Gwyneth Paltrow that weaved its way from a discussion of relationships to one of oral sex as a major turning point. ""Had I said to her, 'Gwyneth Paltrow, do you blow your husband?' I'm an asshole,"" he says. ""But, sure enough, we start talking, and she's fascinating, and I'm getting to know her, and then she goes: 'One of the things you can do to make your man happy, ladies, is, like, sometimes in the middle of a fight, I just blow him. It ends everything.' So, she took me there.""

Stern's longtime producer, Gary ""Baba Booey"" Dell'Abate, has called the Paltrow interview ""one of the most important milestones"" for his job as a booker. In the years since, Stern's couch has become a sought-after stop on the publicity tour for a wide swath of Hollywood's A-list — though flacks still cop to sweating through clients' hour-plus interviews, which quickly evolve past prepackaged sound bites to become intimate character excavations. ""When you talk to Howard, you just kind of explode with candor,"" says Lena Dunham, whose relationship with Stern got off to a rocky start in early 2013 when he described her as ""a little fat girl who looks like Jonah Hill."" He later apologized, declared himself a major Girls fan and invited her on to dig deep on subjects ranging from obsessive-compulsive disorder, from which they both suffer, to sexual assault. Adds Dunham, ""I wish the side effect [of going on his show] wasn't tons of aggressive headlines, because while it's happening it feels really good.""

Kimmel, a loyal listener long before he became a close friend, considers Stern the best the format has to offer, and he's hardly unique in his assessment. ""Unlike the late-night talk shows, nothing is off-limits on his show, and you know that going in,"" says Kimmel, having been a guest himself more than 30 times. ""If you put limits on the interview, Howard won't do it. No matter how tempting or how much he wants the guest, he just won't. So, if you're Paul McCartney and you want to publicize something, you know you're going to sit with Howard for an hour and a half and talk about whatever Howard wants to talk about, and no one is above that.""

***

Curating a book of Stern's best interviews was supposed to be simple. Jonathan Karp had assured him that Simon & Schuster would do nearly all of the work. In fact, when Karp arrived at Stern's Manhattan apartment in April 2017, the publisher had 30 of his most popular transcripts already bound with a book jacket. All Stern would have to do was write a few words of introduction. He was flattered enough to say yes.

Like every other major publisher, Karp had been courting Stern for years for the express reason that his base had proved eager book buyers, as evidenced by the performance of his first two tomes. When Private Parts came out in 1993, it was the fastest seller in Simon & Schuster's history. Beatles-esque hysteria at book signings and, later, a film adaptation with Stern as its star, followed. His second, Miss America, managed to outdo it, becoming what was, at the time, the fastest seller in publishing history.

But Stern didn't love the idea of doing a third. Books were simply too much work, he'd often say, which is why Karp tried to make it easy. Stern, however, was constitutionally incapable of doing it that way. He couldn't let someone else pick the interviews; he'd have to do that himself. So a one-year project took two, as he pored over hundreds of transcripts and decided to write an intimate introduction for every one he chose. Ultimately, he settled on close to 40 in-depth conversations, from the early and uncomfortable (Bill O'Reilly) to the more recent and evolved (Bill Murray); along with several dozen snippets that he'd weave together by theme, like sex and relationships or money and fame.

Then came another idea: He'd lace throughout the book a sampling of his 40-plus conversations with Trump, beginning with a 1995 exchange in which they joke about a presidential run; he'd also devote at least a few pages to the interview he tried desperately to land with Hillary Clinton, who, he'd reveal, had rebuffed him at every turn. Despite the host's history with the current president, who'd regularly call in and discuss such subjects as his sex life with Melania or his daughter Ivanka's ""very voluptuous"" breasts, Stern was an ardent supporter of Clinton, both in 2008 and again in 2016. Still, he says he saw before others how tough it would be for her to beat Trump.

His listeners span the country, he explains, and in that final stretch he could see that Hillary wasn't connecting with them. Stern isn't arrogant enough to say for sure that an interview on his show could have tipped the election in her favor, but he doesn't rule it out, either. ""There's a segment of my audience that really gets turned on to people they thought they hated because we tap into their humanity,"" he says, rattling off examples like Lady Gaga. ""They were like, 'Fuck Lady Gaga, why are you having her on?' And then it's over, and they go, 'Shit man, I'm going to go see her in concert.' ""

For a while there, Stern says his wife would get annoyed every time a conversation turned to the election since it always seemed to play out the same way. He'd ask those better versed in politics than he who they thought would win and then he'd refuse to bite his tongue when inevitably he'd be told Hillary. ""I'd sit there at these dinner parties and go, 'Not that you asked, but I don't think you're seeing this the right way,' "" he says. "" 'Donald is communicating. He's talking like a dude. That's very powerful — take it from someone who knows.' "" Stern had famously soared in the polls when he ran for governor of New York on the libertarian ticket in 1994, and all he had to say was, ""We're going to kill all the criminals, take their crispy remains and stick them in the potholes."" He removed himself from the race before it was too late.

On-air and off, he had tried to get Trump to do the same. Early on, Stern was still fielding his calls from the campaign trail and spending time at Mar-a-Lago. Sure, he considered Trump among his greatest all-time radio guests — raw and unfiltered — but leader of the free world? He insists in those days, he never imagined Trump would get anywhere near that far, and he's convinced Trump didn't either. Save a brief congratulatory exchange when Trump won, the two haven't had any interaction since Stern declined his request to speak at the Republican National Convention. ""It was a difficult thing because there's a part of me that really likes Donald, but I just don't agree politically,"" he says. Still, he jokes: ""A more self-serving person would have gone all in on Donald because I'd probably be the FCC commissioner or a Supreme Court justice by now.""

The rest of Stern's book can occasionally read like a series of love letters to his subjects. Before a Kimmel interview, he writes about how his friend is often there to provide him with a boost of confidence when he needs it most — and for that, he shares, ""I love him""; before one with O'Donnell, he offers: ""I remember thinking, 'How could I have missed out in my life on someone so special because of some dumb posturing on the radio?' "" He hopes that the collection, as a whole, adequately captures his evolution and ultimately becomes his legacy; at the very least, he says, it's how he wants to present himself to his daughters. Just don't, under any circumstance, accuse Stern of having lost his edge.

It's a lesson that talk show host Wendy Williams learned the hard way. After praising him as her role model and his book as an inevitable best-seller — per Karp, it's Simon & Schuster's fastest seller of the year, in terms of pre-orders — she became the latest to suggest the host had gone soft. ""He's a Hollywood insider now,"" Williams said on a March episode of her show, ""which sucks because you started like me, being of the people, but at some point, you sat behind that microphone for too long, and now you are the people.""

Within hours, Stern had fired back, eviscerating Williams on his air. ""Jealous bitch. … You'll never be me,"" he fumed. ""You don't have my wit and you don't have my talent."" Weeks later, he regrets the tirade, acknowledging: ""That was me at my worst. I thought she was saying that I was a piece of shit and I sucked. But as [I hear it] now, I don't see it as an offense at all. If 'Hollywood' means that I've evolved in some way and the show has changed, then yeah, she hit the nail on the head."" He's pulled the rant from rerun airings.

Soon, the conversation comes back around to his health scare and with it his musings about a future off the radio. Of course, Stern has contemplated walking away before, notably in the run-up to his last contract negotiation, only to re-up with a rich new deal in 2015. Similar talks will reignite in the next year, if not sooner, along with an almost inevitable crush of headlines that will ask whether Howard Stern is still worth $90 million a year. Sure, some will argue, when he signed his first pact in 2004, he was key to the future of what was then just Sirius, with its 1.1 million subscribers and $67 million in revenue. On his back, the company, which later merged with XM Satellite Radio, built both its brand and its base.

By 2014, however, the last time Macquarie Securities analyst Amy Yong surveyed SiriusXM subscribers, only 12 percent (or about 3.2 million listeners) were tuning in to Stern, and only 5 percent said they'd bail if he left. And now? Yong cites SiriusXM's subscriber growth, currently at 36 million, and its recent $3.5 billion acquisition of Pandora: ""They're in such a different life stage, and they've done a really good job of diversifying,"" she says of a company that now boasts $5.8 billion in revenue.

Still, it's hard to imagine the guy who regularly sneaks onto Twitter to gauge listener reactions is really ready to hang it all up.

Kamala Harris Is Trying to Reset Her Campaign by Taking On Trump,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Astead W. Herndon', 'Jonathan Martin']",05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/us/politics/kamala-harris-2020-trump.html,"DETROIT — Senator Kamala Harris of California structures her stump speech around two themes — “truth” and “justice” — meant to evoke her career as a barrier-breaking prosecutor and cultivate a reputation as a fearless public advocate.

But when Ms. Harris swept into Detroit to address an N.A.A.C.P. banquet on Sunday night, she added something new. After her signature windup of “let’s speak truth,” she replaced her usual recitation of Democratic policies with an attack on President Trump, accusing him of enabling bigotry and divisiveness and refusing “to call neo-Nazi violence what it is: domestic terrorism.”

“This president isn’t trying to make America great,” she said, “he’s trying to make America hate.”

With that, Ms. Harris was nodding to a political truth: She is attempting to reset her campaign after stagnating in Democratic primary polls, using her strengths as a prosecutor — which were on display during a recent face-off with Attorney General William Barr — to mount a sharp indictment of Mr. Trump.

Ms. Harris entered the 2020 race in January seeking to make history as the first black female president, and drew 20,000 people to her campaign kickoff in Oakland and a burst of donations that helped her emerge as the No. 2 fund-raiser in the Democratic field through March. But from the start, she has found herself in a political vise, squeezed by competing factions in her party and even in her own campaign, which has led to some stumbles."
DOJ inspector general 'homing in on' FBI’s use of unverified Steele dossier,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,['Ap'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-inspector-general-homing-in-on-fbis-use-of-unverified-steele-dossier,"Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz is investigating the FBI’s reliance on the unverified dossier produced by British ex-spy Christopher Steele in the surveillance of a Trump campaign associate “despite questions about [Steele’s] credibility.""

Citing unnamed sources, the Wall Street Journal reports Horowitz “is homing in on” and “has been asking witnesses about” the FBI’s “treatment of information” provided by Steele, described as a “key source”, who was used to obtain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants against former Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page.

This is part of Horowitz’s broad investigation into alleged FISA abuse and more.

Steele’s dossier was funded in part by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign through the Perkins Coie law firm and opposition research group Fusion GPS, which had reached out to and contracted Steele.

The new Wall Street Journal report says the inspector general’s office “has been asking why the FBI continued to cite Steele as a credible source in the renewal applications.” And a specific focus of Horowitz’s team is apparently “a news report cited extensively in the [FISA] applications that appeared to bolster Steele’s credibility… [which] said U.S. intelligence officials were investigating allegations similar to those Steele had raised.”

The “news report” was written by Yahoo News journalist Michael Isikoff, who said he was stunned when he learned that his September 2016 article for Yahoo News was used in the FISA applications targeting Carter Page to bolster Steele’s credibility, despite his source being Steele himself. Iskoff said “it’s self-referential” and “it seems a little odd that they would cite the Yahoo News story about the matter they are investigating themselves based on the same material that had been separately presented to the FBI.”

Isikoff personally met with Steele in person in September 2016. Also at the meeting was Isikoff’s “old friend” Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of Fusion GPS. The three of them talked about Trump and Russia and Steele provided him with some of his research.

Isikoff now admits that everyone should have been more cautious about Steele’s information. “I think it’s fair to say that all of us should have approached this, in retrospect, with more skepticism, particularly when we didn’t know where it was coming from,” Isikoff said. “We knew that Steele compiled it, but that Steele did not hear these allegations himself. Somebody else heard them from others and then passed them along. That’s thirdhand stuff, which is not usually the kind you want for publishing.”

In the FISA renewal applications, which spanned until June 2017, the FBI continued to insist that it didn’t think Steele was Isikoff’s source even though Steele himself had said that he was by the spring of 2017.

The Wall Street Journal report says “investigators have also asked about an internal FBI evaluation of Steele’s credibility that found his reporting had been ‘minimally corroborated’ even as it also said he had provided information ‘of value’ to the U.S. intelligence community.” The report says “the evaluation was reflected in a ‘human source validation report’ written by a unit of the FBI after the bureau cut off its relationship with Steele in October 2016… because of his disclosures to the media about his work for the FBI.”

Heavily redacted FBI records unearthed through Freedom of Information Act litigation in 2018 show that Steele was cut off as a confidential human source because of his improper disclosures to third parties and that his “handling agent advised [Steele] that [Confidential Human Source] was not to operate to obtain any intelligence whatsoever on behalf of the FBI.”

According to a New York Times report from April, the FBI reached out to some of Steele’s foreign sources in an attempt to determine their credibility, and as early as January 2017 agents had reportedly concluded that some of the dossier’s contents may have been based upon “rumors and hearsay” which were “passed from source to source.” The agents believed that some of Steele’s information may have even been based upon “Russian disinformation.”

For its part, Fusion GPS told the Washington Examiner that it stands by Steele’s dossier, claiming that “to our knowledge, nothing in the Steele memoranda has been disproven.”

Journalist Bob Woodward has been calling Steele’s dossier “garbage” for more than two years. And former CIA Moscow station chief Daniel Hoffman said: “I called what bullshit the dossier was a year and a half ago… It’s likely FSB [the successor agency to the KGB] disinformation.” A number of Steele’s biggest claims — including its allegation from ""Kremlin insiders"" that former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen had met in Prague with Putin associates and foreign hackers — were knocked down by special counsel Robert Mueller's report.

Attorney General William Barr told Congress that the Justice Department has launched an investigation into how the DOJ and the FBI handled the Trump-Russia investigation, and he said that “the people helping me with my review will be working very closely with” Horowitz.

Horowitz, who launched his investigation in 2018, said he would “examine the Justice Department’s and the FBI’s compliance with legal requirements, and with applicable DOJ and FBI policies and procedures, in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court relating to a certain U.S. person [Carter Page].”

Horowitz stated that he would “review information that was known to the DOJ and the FBI at the time the applications were filed from or about an alleged FBI confidential source. Additionally, the OIG will review the DOJ’s and FBI’s relationship and communications with the alleged source as they relate to the FISC applications.” This “alleged FBI confidential source” is Steele.

Barr has said Horowitz’s investigation should be completed in either May or June."

Perhaps that statute is not clear enough for Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The secretary on Monday rebuffed just such a request from Representative Richard Neal, the Democratic chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. In April, Mr. Neal requested six years’ worth of federal tax returns for President Trump and several of his companies.

The purpose of the request was not “harassment” of the president, as Mr. Trump and his defenders have branded efforts by Democratic House members to perform legitimate oversight functions. Rather, as Mr. Neal told the I.R.S., the committee “is considering legislative proposals and conducting oversight related to our federal tax laws, including, but not limited to, the extent to which the I.R.S. audits and enforces the federal tax laws against a president.”

In a letter responding to Mr. Neal on Monday, Mr. Mnuchin said he consulted with the Justice Department and determined that the chairman’s request “lacks a legitimate legislative purpose” and that the Treasury Department “may not lawfully fulfill the committee’s request.”"
VA mortgage lenders hit with federal subpoenas,https://www.politico.com,['Lorraine Woellert'],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/07/va-mortgage-lenders-federal-subpoenas-1414318,"Some VA lenders have drawn scrutiny from regulators after they sold short-term, adjustable-rate mortgages to military homeowners as interest rates climbed. | Charles Dharapak, File/AP Photo defense VA mortgage lenders hit with federal subpoenas

Federal investigators have issued subpoenas to several mortgage lenders that make loans to military veterans, seeking information on delinquencies and payments.

The investigation is being led by the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General in cooperation with the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York, according to four people with knowledge of the subpoenas.

Story Continued Below

At least eight lenders, and likely more, have been asked to turn over hundreds of files on VA home loans made between 2013 and 2017, according to two people with knowledge of the request.

The requests include questions about quality control and loan audits.

Some VA lenders have drawn scrutiny from regulators after they sold short-term, adjustable-rate mortgages to military homeowners as interest rates climbed. One VA program in particular — the Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loan, or IRRRL — allows lenders to put existing VA borrowers into new loans without an appraisal or underwriting and was ripe for abuse.

Michael Nacincik, a spokesperson for the Department of Veterans Affairs OIG, and John Marzulli, a spokesperson for the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, declined to comment. Both said they could neither confirm nor deny the existence of any investigation.

Jeffrey London, executive director of the VA’s Loan Guaranty Service, did not respond to requests for comment.

On Friday, Ginnie Mae said it was weighing whether to exclude some of those VA loans from its pooled securities in an effort to tackle a wave of rapid-fire mortgage refinancings that have left some military service members deeper in debt.

In a 14-page request for input, the government mortgage agency called the practice, known as churning, “unhealthy” for the agency.

The loan documents requested by investigators weren’t limited to IRRRLs, according to one person with knowledge of the subpoenas.

The VA subpoenas are landing as HUD is taking steps to rein in the prosecution of lenders who sell mortgages backed by the Federal Housing Administration.

Many of the nation’s largest banks, including JPMorgan Chase, stopped offering FHA loans after the government, under former President Barack Obama, used the False Claims Act to extract billions of dollars in settlements from dozens of big lenders.

FHA Commissioner Brian Montgomery, an appointee of President Donald Trump, has said those cases went too far and that the Trump administration is working with the DOJ to change how the False Claims Act is used against lenders."
"Top US general: Pentagon, DHS working on 'multiyear plan' for border",https://thehill.com,[],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/defense/442758-top-us-general-pentagon-dhs-working-on-multi-year-plan-for-border,"The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on Wednesday said that the Pentagon is working with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to develop a “multiyear plan"" for the border, suggesting that active duty and National Guard troops will be deployed to the southern border for the remainder of President’s Trump's first term.

“What we’re hopeful to do is to have, in fairly short order, for the secretary of Homeland Security, a much more predictable, comprehensive plan for the next couple years,” Gen. Joseph Dunford said during a Senate Appropriations defense subcommittee hearing.

The Defense Department has provided a two-star general “plus a number of planners” to DHS “to “lay out the next couple of years.”

Dunford said the so-called interagency planning team will prepare around the number of migrants expected to come to the southern U.S. border, the capacity of DHS to handle the migrants and the expected support DHS will need from the rest of the government.

“Although the commitment to the border hasn’t impacted our preparedness for other missions at this point, what we wanted to do is get into a more predictable mode of the requirements that the Department of Homeland Security has and do better at integrating across the government,” Dunford said.

There are now about 4,364 U.S. service member at the border, a mix of active-duty and National Guard members, according to acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, who testified alongside Dunford.

About 1,167 of the service members are performing the primary role of monitoring and detection, but a broader set of missions range from logistical support to aviation support to food service.

The administration has said troops will stay at such posts until DHS “no longer requires [Department of Defense] support to secure the southern border.”

As of last month, the deployment is expected to cost at least $534 million by the end of the fiscal year in September.

Late last month, Shanahan approved a DHS request to send about 320 more military personnel to help with handling migrants entering the United States, easing restrictions on troops interacting with migrants.

In addition, the Army Corps of Engineer is currently on contract to build about 256 miles of barrier.

“How you will see this materialize in the next six months is about 63 new miles of wall will come online, so about half a mile a day will be produced,” Shanahan said."

Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., initially requested ""all materials ... obtained or produced by the Special Counsel's Office in the course of the investigation"" in a March 27 letter to Attorney General William Barr, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and FBI Director Christopher Wray. After receiving no response, Schiff and Nunes repeated their request in a second letter dated April 25, one week after Barr released a redacted version of the Mueller report to Congress and the public.

""[A]s the report makes clear, the Department of Justice and the FBI failed to keep the Committee 'fully and currently informed' of this important foreign intelligence and counterintelligence information, as required by law,"" Schiff and Nunes wrote in the April letter. ""The Department and the Bureau did not keep the Committee apprised of this information ... contrary to long-standing practice regarding significant counterintelligence matters.""

The second letter from Nunes and Schiff gave the Justice Department until May 2 to cooperate with their requests or ""the Committee will have no choice but to resort to compulsory process on Friday, May 3 to compel production of documents responsive to the Committee's request.""

A committee aide told Fox News on Tuesday that ""the [Justice] Department has not produced any documents responsive to our requests and has not agreed to schedule any testimony,"" even after Schiff and Nunes sent their second letter.

""An accommodations process must go both ways, and the Committee will soon start the compulsory process since the Department has not even begun to comply,"" the aide said.

The letters mark a rare showing of bipartisan agreement between Schiff and Nunes, who have repeatedly been at loggerheads over the Russia investigation. On March 28, the committee's nine Republican members -- including Nunes -- requested that Schiff step down as chairman over his repeated claims in the media that there was ""more than circumstantial evidence” of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.

Last week, Schiff called for Barr to resign as attorney general over his handling of the Mueller report, writing in a USA Today op-ed that Barr ""misled the country about an investigation implicating the president.

""Then he lied to Congress,"" Schiff wrote in the piece published last Friday. ""Then he did something worse: He effectively said that the president of the United States is above the law.""

The subpoena threat from Schiff and Nunes -- two California lawmakers who have often been at each other's throats on the committee over the past two years -- is a rare case where the diverging interests of the pair align when it comes to the special counsel's investigation.

Schiff and Nunes have jointly requested a briefing on the FBI's counterintelligence investigation into Trump and Russia from Mueller and his team, as well as the special counsel's evidence collected during the probe.

The House Oversight Committee on Tuesday threatened to withhold the salaries of Interior Department officials who have blocked lawmakers from interviewing agency employees about whether Secretary David Bernhardt was complying with recordkeeping laws.

The committee’s threat ratchets up the pressure on Interior in the latest skirmish between House Democrats and the Trump administration over the lawmakers' complaints that agencies are withholding documents and ignoring requests to send senior officials to testify before Congress.

“Please be advised that any official at the Department who ‘prohibits or prevents’ or ‘attempts or threatens to prohibit or prevent’ any officer or employee of the Federal Government from speaking with the Committee could have his or her salary withheld pursuant to section 713 of the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act,” Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said in a prepared statement.

Cummings also complained in the letter to Cole Rojewski, Interior's director of congressional and legislative affairs, that the agency ""does not appear to recognize that Congress is an independent and co-equal branch of government"" that is empowered to conduct its own investigations.

Oversight has sought interviews with Interior’s administrative assistant to the deputy secretary, scheduling and advance director, executive assistant to the office of the deputy secretary and acting chief of staff and associate deputy secretary. The committee asked Interior to respond to the interview requests by Friday.

Cummings is also using the the threat of withholding salaries to force Commerce Department officials to appear before it for interviews relating plans to add citizenship questions to the 2020 Census.

In his statement, Cummings pointed to a 2016 GAO report that said a department’s budget “appropriation was not available to pay the salary of a federal officer or employee who prevents another federal officer or employee from communicating directly with any member, committee, or subcommittee of Congress.”

Oversight and the National Archives and Records Administration are investigating allegations that Bernhardt was keeping meetings off his official calendars and not supplying information about meetings to the public.

Interior refused the committee’s previous requests to interview several staffers, telling Oversight that the interviews “are unnecessary at this time,” according to a letter the committee sent to Interior today.

At a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing on the Interior Department budget on Tuesday, Bernhardt defended preventing the employees from talking to the committee, saying ""it’s not the appropriate time"" for those interviews, and that his decision was designed to protect career employees.

“You’re talking about individual employees who have long standing in the department,” he said in response to questioning from Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.). “We have wonderful career employees here ... they’ve never had this happen to them in their careers.”

Lawrence shot back that Congress was responsible for oversight of the agency.

""You have been requested to comply. With all due to respect, you are required to comply,“ she said.

Besides refusing interviews, Interior has declined to provide documents the Oversight and House Natural Resources committees requested on March 13, according Cummings‘ letter. The department instead offered tens of thousands of pages of documents unrelated to the committee's request, the letter states.

Labor Dispute Opens New Front in Fight to Privatize the VA,http://nymag.com,['Sarah Jones'],05-08-2019,2019,5,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/05/labor-dispute-veterans-affairs-privatization.html,"Robert Wilkie. Photo: Alex Wong/Getty Images

During his Senate confirmation hearing, Robert Wilkie, the secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, said he wouldn’t privatize the VA’s health-care services. He’s since repeated that promise to veterans themselves. “The private sector cannot replicate VA’s expertise in things like spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, rehabilitative services, prosthetics, audiology, services for the blind, suicide prevention,” he told members of the American Legion in 2018.

But Wilkie was nominated by President Trump, who has surrounded himself with advocates for the privatization of the VA since taking office. His decision to fire Wilkie’s predecessor, David Shulkin, an Obama appointee who opposed privatization, may not have had as much to do with Shulkin’s alleged spending improprieties as it did with months of sustained lobbying against the secretary from allies of Concerned Veterans for America. The Koch-backed advocacy group supports an expansion of private-sector care for veterans — and Wilkie, since his confirmation, has deviated little from that goal.

On Wilkie’s watch, the VA has begun to shrink. (The VA reached out following publication to dispute this, stating: ‘Since last quarter, VA achieved a net increase of 3,043 employees and maintained a vacancy rate of approximately 11 percent.”) The department, which provides free or low-cost health care to around 9 million enrolled veterans as part of its mission to support former service members, has nearly 49,000 unfilled vacancies. Meanwhile, the Mission Act, which will expand the VA’s privatized community-care network for eligible veterans, is scheduled to take effect in June.

Now, a nascent contract dispute between the VA and the American Federation of Government Employees may bolster fears that Wilkie’s reforms are privatization in all but name. On Thursday, the VA submitted a proposal to renegotiate its collective-bargaining agreement with the AFGE, which represents around 250,000 department employees. The department’s proposals would drastically reduce the amount of time employees are allowed to spend on union business during the workday, among other changes. In a press release, the VA said it hoped to reduce staffers’ union time from 1 million hours per year to around 10,000, a change that would, it claimed, direct “more than $48 million per year” back to aiding veterans. The press release was otherwise light on detail, though in it, Secretary Wilkie described this as “a reset” of the VA’s relationship with the AFGE. “With VA facing thousands of vacancies, these proposals could add more than 1 million man-hours per year back into our work force — a vital influx of resources that would make an almost immediate difference for veterans and the employees who care for them,” Wilkie said.

These restrictions on union time would make it difficult, if not quite impossible, for staff to conduct legally permissible union business during work hours. And the VA’s plan goes even further. According to a copy of the proposal package provided by the union, the VA wants to eliminate 28 provisions of the department’s current collective-bargaining agreement. Union representatives would lose their offices inside VA facilities, and could no longer use VA equipment to carry out their duties. The department’s new contract with AFGE would last for ten years, but only the VA could make changes to it during that time; the union would be prohibited from doing the same. The VA seeks to weaken the grievance procedures set out in its previous agreement with AFGE. Communication between the union and the department would have to take place entirely at the national level. Employees who need to file grievances, for example, would no longer be able to do so at the local level. The union believes this could create a bottleneck that would slow the processing of employee grievances. The union also alleges that at least two of the VA’s proposals — to require the union to pay for the time management spends on union business, and to pay attorneys’ fees to the VA — would violate existing labor law.

Contacted for comment, VA press secretary Curt Cashour directed New York to a May 2 editorial published by Wilkie on InsideSources.com. In it, the secretary said that the department’s reforms would “make sure that the contract does not interfere with the department’s ability to take action against poor performers” and eliminate language in the previous agreement that “has effectively allowed the union to co-manage the VA.”

Asked specifically about the union’s claim that some of the proposals are illegal, Cashour said, “When department employees and attorneys — at the demand of the union — are required to cease providing medical care and support for veteran services, to prepare for and engage in union-demanded activities such as grievances, disciplinary appeals, or arbitration, it’s only fair for the union to reimburse taxpayers for this time spent not taking care of veterans.”

David Cann, AFGE’s director of field services and education, told New York on Monday that the VA’s proposals “are unique.” He added, “What I’m seeing out of the VA is the most both-barrels anti-union effort that I’ve seen in my time with AFGE.” The VA’s proposals resemble executive orders that Trump signed last May. One would have significantly reduced the amount of time that federal workers are allowed to spend on union business. AFGE sued the administration and won an injunction in August that blocked certain provisions of the orders from going forward. The Trump administration appealed the injunction, and the case is ongoing. “For whatever reason, the VA is acting in contravention of that injunction, and proposing limitations on the rights of members that are exactly the same as what the court has said they’re not allowed to do,” Cann said.

The VA’s proposal package seems to be “a clear case of failing to bargain in good faith, which is an unfair labor practice under the relevant statute,” Joseph Slater, the Eugene M. Balk professor of law and values at the University of Toledo, told New York in an email. Slater, who has reviewed a summary of the VA’s proposals, added that provisions “strike me as illegal bargaining proposals on their own,” including the provision that would allow only the VA to make changes to the contract once it’s in place. “The ten-year duration is clearly trying to lock in extreme terms for an unusually long time, which is commonly held to be bargaining in bad faith. Eliminating procedures and appropriate arrangements generally seems legally dicey to me too, as those are statutory rights,” he continued.

“I could go on,” he concluded, “but this is a set of radical, unworkable proposals that no union would agree to.”

The VA isn’t the first federal agency to call for a draconian renegotiation of its collective-bargaining agreement with AFGE. The Social Security Administration has proposed similar changes to its union contract, down to the removal of union representatives from their offices inside SSA buildings. Contract negotiations with AFGE may become not just a backdoor for the Trump administration to get around the injunction, but the locus at which its antipathy to the federal workforce meets its hostility toward unions.

The first two years of Trump’s presidency have already been difficult for the federal workforce. One of Trump’s first actions as president was to implement a temporary federal hiring freeze. He’s overseen two significant government shutdowns, the most recent of which lasted for five weeks and cost federal employees two pay periods. (Though federal workers received back pay after the government reopened, many federal contractors did not.) The VA isn’t the only federal agency facing a staffing crisis, either. Though the status of the VA’s workforce has a clear, disproportionate effect on veterans, so too does the state of the federal workforce at large. A third of federal employees are veterans. Cann told New York that AFGE believes that figure is even higher for employees of the VA.

But the fact that Wilkie is pursuing certain conflict with AFGE, instead of filling his department’s vacancies, kindles a fear specific to the VA: that the secretary intends to let the VA atrophy and funnel more and more veterans into private medical care. “If we really want to fix the VA so badly, let’s start hiring, and fill up some of those 49,000 [staff] vacancies,” Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said at a recent town hall co-sponsored by National Nurses United and CommonDefense, a progressive veterans’ advocacy group.

There’s no question that the VA suffers from systemic problems. Twenty-four veterans have died by suicide on VA campuses during the last 18 months, the Military Times reported in April. The department’s tech problems are so pronounced that implementation of the Mission Act may prove disastrous. According to ProPublica, a planned tool to help determine which veterans are eligible for private community care is so unreliable that “it threatens to disrupt the health care of about 75,000 veterans every day.” Nevertheless, a joint study from the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice and the White River Junction VA Medical Center found that VA medical facilities achieve health-care outcomes that are consistently as good as, or even better than, private alternatives in 121 regional markets. In polling, veterans themselves reliably oppose privatization, though they’re less hostile to the notion of some community-based choices as a supplement to the VA’s public services. The American Legion, like every other major veterans’ service organization, opposes privatization of the VA.

Alexander McCoy, the political director of Common Defense and a former Marine, told New York that his organization is watching the labor dispute closely. “The secretary of Veterans Affairs and Trump are trying to use veterans as props for union-busting,” he said. “This isn’t about improving our health care or fixing problems with the VA. They’re punishing workers for their own campaign to starve the VA.”

Kate Hoit, an Army veteran affiliated with VoteVets, a progressive organization that has repeatedly sued the Trump administration for its handling of the VA, agreed. “First and foremost, our concerns rest in the fact that the changes in the collective bargaining agreement will make the VA a worse place to work and therefore result in worse care for veterans,” Hoit said in a statement to New York.

Private-sector unions, too, worry that the VA’s contract proposals belie its commitment to privatization. Sara Nelson, who heads the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA and called for a general strike in response to the latest government shutdown, said that it’s “no surprise” that the Trump administration would target AFGE’s VA members, who have traditionally enjoyed a robust contract. “It’s all a direct attack on VA workers and their union,” Nelson said in a statement to New York. “Why? Because they are the ones demanding accountability at the VA, they are the ones blowing the whistle on waste and fraud, they are the ones standing in the way of privatization. That’s the ultimate goal: privatize the VA so the giant health care corporations can reap the billions spent on caring for our veterans, ignoring the fact that veterans overwhelmingly prefer the VA to private healthcare.”

AFGE will likely need all the support it can get. Slater, the law professor, cautioned that if the union wanted to file an unfair labor practices charge against the VA, it may have difficulty finding relief. Trump took until March of this year to nominate a general counsel to the U.S. Federal Labor Relations Authority, the body responsible for addressing labor grievances against federal agencies. Unions have already criticized Trump’s FLRA pick, Catherine Bird. National Treasury Employees Union president Tony Reardon told Bloomberg Law that Bird, who formerly worked in the office of general counsel for the Department of Health and Human Services, was “directly involved in the agency’s bad faith bargaining last year.” Reardon added that his union has filed four grievances against HHS for unfair labor practices. Even if Bird is confirmed, Bloomberg Law said she’ll have to process an extensive backlog of cases because the office has been vacant for two years.

Federal law also prohibits VA employees from going on strike, which further restricts AFGE’s options as it navigates contract negotiations. But Cann said that the union is considering other forms of direct action. “Getting people involved, doing petitions, doing informational rallies, applying pressure on the agency by pointing out their hypocrisy and their anti-union animus, reaching out to the handful of friends we have on the Hill, we plan on doing all of that,” he said, adding, “We’re counting on employees who care so much about the work they do as caregivers to veterans to be willing to stand up, and get involved in this campaign, and object to having their voices silenced.”

Obama DHS secretary pulls out of commencement speech after opposition to immigration policies: report,https://thehill.com,[],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/latino/442682-obama-dhs-secretary-pulls-out-of-usc-commencement-speech-after-opposition-to,"Former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson has reportedly withdrawn as commencement speaker for the University of Southern California’s (USC) law school, citing concerns about his enforcement of the Obama administration’s immigration policy.

""I informed Secretary Johnson that some faculty and students have raised concerns about the immigration policies of the Obama administration and, therefore, about having him as our commencement speaker,” Dean Andrew Guzman said in an email to faculty and staff, according to Inside Higher Ed. “Secretary Johnson shared with me that he believes that graduations should be free of tension and political controversy and for this reason has decided not to speak.”

Johnson served as head of the Department of Homeland Security from December 2013 through the end of former President Obama’s second term.

In April, two Chicano professors at USC's Gould School of Law wrote to express disappointment with Johnson’s invitation, noting his part in the detention of migrants fleeing an uptick in violence in Central America in 2014, as well as his arguments against judicial review of “kill lists” of combatants when he served as general counsel for the Department of Defense.

""USC’s choice to invite Secretary Johnson to speak normalizes illegal state violence. Inviting him to speak to the graduating class legitimates what federal courts and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have recognized as a fundamental betrayal of core values,” wrote professors Daria Roithmayr and David B. Cruz. “Johnson has repeatedly failed to respect legal and moral limits on the use of government-sponsored coercive force, particularly against children, and has demonstrated a morally repugnant willingness to use those who are most vulnerable among us as means to an end."""
Economists flee Agriculture Dept. after feeling punished under Trump,https://www.politico.com,"['Ryan Mccrimmon', 'Doug Palmer']",05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/07/agriculture-economists-leave-trump-1307146,"Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue's moves to limit his agency's research arm have led to a string of departures from the Economic Research Service, whose reports detail how farmers have been hurt by President Donald Trump's trade feuds. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo Agriculture Economists flee Agriculture Dept. after feeling punished under Trump Reports showing farmers hurt by the president’s policies have drawn the ire of top officials.

Economists in the Agriculture Department's research branch say the Trump administration is retaliating against them for publishing reports that shed negative light on White House policies, spurring an exodus that included six of them quitting the department on a single day in late April.

The Economic Research Service — a source of closely read reports on farm income and other topics that can shape federal policy, planting decisions and commodity markets — has run afoul of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue with its findings on how farmers have been financially harmed by President Donald Trump's trade feuds, the Republican tax code rewrite and other sensitive issues, according to current and former agency employees.

Story Continued Below

The reports highlight the continued decline under Trump’s watch in farm income, which has dropped about 50 percent since 2013. Rural voters were a crucial source of support for Trump in 2016, and analysts say even a small retreat in 2020 could jeopardize the president’s standing in several battleground states.

“The administration didn’t appreciate some of our findings, so this is retaliation to harm the agency and send a message,” said one current ERS employee, who asked not to be named to avoid retribution.

For example, two ERS researchers presented a paper at an economic conference in early 2018 that indicated the GOP tax overhaul would largely benefit the wealthiest farmers — generating negative press coverage that staff members said irked senior officials at USDA.

Then, in August, Perdue stunned members of the roughly 300-member research service by announcing plans to bring ERS under the control of USDA’s chief economist, who reports more directly to the secretary. Equally significant, he said the USDA would move the agency out of Washington to a location closer to the U.S. heartland.

Members of the agency were also caught off-guard last summer when Perdue’s office issued an internal memo directing ERS and other research branches to include disclaimers in their peer-reviewed publications stating that the findings were “preliminary” and “should not be construed to represent any agency determination or policy” — seen as a way of watering down any unflattering data from the department’s own experts.

The move to uproot the agency has led to a brain-drain of experienced researchers. So far in fiscal 2019, non-retirement departures from the agency have more than doubled on an annualized basis compared to the previous three-year average, according to data collected by employees.

Six of the economists — made up of specialists in the agricultural economy, farm taxation and food programs with more than 50 years of combined experience at ERS — left the agency at the end of April, out of frustration with the relocation process or in some cases suspicion about Perdue’s efforts to reshape USDA’s research wing, according to coworkers. More are planning to leave in the coming months.

For his part, Perdue has said the relocation was motivated by his desire to save taxpayer dollars, bring the research service closer to major farming regions, and help attract economists who could be deterred by Washington’s high cost of living.

“I really have been a little surprised with the naysayers on this,” he said last month at a Senate Appropriations hearing, touting the move as a common-sense, cost-cutting measure.

Perdue’s office declined to provide information on the numbers of employees who’ve quit or respond to allegations of political interference in the research service.

But the secretary alluded to frustrations with the quality of USDA research in comments to POLITICO on April 30, saying that all decision-making in the department must be “fact-based.”

“In USDA, we want good scientific discovery,” Perdue said, when asked about the mandated research-disclosure language. “We want peer-based evidence there. We know that research, some has been found in the past to not have been adequately peer-reviewed in a way that created wrong information, and we’re very serious when we say we’re fact-based, data-driven decision makers. That relies on sound, replicatable science rather than opinion. What I see unfortunately happening many times is that we tried to make policy decisions based on political science rather than on sound science.”

Perdue and Trump made clear in their budget request in March that they wanted to reduce the scope of the ERS, eliminating “low priority research” into such politically sensitive areas as food stamps and environmental issues.

The White House blueprint called for slashing ERS staff levels by more than 50 percent, cutting the total number of positions from about 329 to 160.

The budget is unlikely to be approved by Congress, but members of the service say they’ve already seen the effects of Trump’s and Perdue’s preferences.

“Things like conservation, rural development, food assistance, have just been de-emphasized” in favor of the administration’s preferred topics, said one economist who left ERS because of the relocation plan.

Former ERS Administrator Susan Offutt, who oversaw the service under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, said the agency’s studies showing how USDA’s farm-subsidy programs disproportionately benefit wealthier farmers have been a “perennial irritant” to influential lobbying groups, but an “over-the-top reaction” to clamp down on such reports would be unprecedented.

“Of course, this is not the story the farm lobby wants to tell about struggling farmers,” said Offutt. “Controlling ERS would stop unflattering news about federal farm subsidies favoring high-income, high-wealth farm households from reaching the public.”

Lawmakers have complained that USDA has yet to provide a full cost-benefit analysis of its plan to move the office closer to the heartland. Republicans have increasingly supported the relocation plan, while House Democrats have filed legislation to block the move.

On Friday, the USDA announced three finalists for the new headquarters of the service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which is also being moved out of Washington. The finalists are Kansas City, the North Carolina research triangle region and multiple locations in Indiana.

Perdue’s office has promised to release further data justifying the move when he announces a final site recommendation this month.

Within the service, skeptical employees view the secretary’s rationale for the move and the months-long site selection process carried out by accounting firm Ernst & Young as a smokescreen.

“The message we’ve been getting is, ‘The cost-benefit analysis doesn’t matter. Being close to stakeholders doesn’t matter. The only thing that matters for you is the fact that the secretary wants you to move, thinks it’s in your best interest, and that’s what we’re doing,’” said another senior ERS economist who declined to use his name for fear of retaliation.

Brian Stacy, a former ERS economist who left in February, said he thinks the move is a way for the administration to force out staff members and reduce the size of the ERS without congressional approval.

“Part of me wonders whether this relocation is just a way to get at that staff reduction,” Stacy said, referring to the president’s budget request. “I don’t know how else to read some of the moves being made.”

ERS employees are planning to vote on unionization on Thursday.

USDA intends to keep 76 ERS employees in Washington and relocate 253 positions to the new location, USDA senior adviser Kristi Boswell told a House Appropriations panel in March.

“This is the spiraling down of the fantastic work that the ERS has done for years,” said Sonny Ramaswamy, who headed the National Institute of Food and Agriculture under the Obama and early Trump administrations. “It’s one way to drain the swamp, as it were.”

"E.P.A. Leaders Disregarded Agency’s Experts in Issuing Asbestos Rule, Memos Show",https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/climate/epa-asbestos-rule-scientists.html,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.

WASHINGTON — Senior officials at the Environmental Protection Agency disregarded the advice of their own scientists and lawyers in April when the agency issued a rule that restricted but did not ban asbestos, according to two internal memos.

Because of its fiber strength and resistance to heat, asbestos has long been used in insulation and construction materials. It is also is a known carcinogen. Last month’s rule kept open a way for manufacturers to adopt new uses for asbestos, or return to certain older uses, but only with E.P.A. approval.

Andrew Wheeler, the E.P.A. administrator, said when the rule was issued that it would significantly strengthen public health protections. But in the memos, dated Aug. 10, more than a dozen of E.P.A.’s own experts urged the agency to ban asbestos outright, as do most other industrialized nations.

“Rather than allow for (even with restrictions) any new uses for asbestos, E.P.A. should seek to ban all new uses of asbestos because the extreme harm from this chemical substance outweighs any benefit — and because there are adequate alternatives to asbestos,” staff members wrote."

David Bernhardt listens during a White House meeting in April. (Chris Kleponis/Pool via Bloomberg)

He acknowledged climate change is real. He acknowledged that humans are contributing to it.

So why, Democratic lawmakers asked David Bernhardt, isn't he doing more to address global warming?

Apparently, because Congress hasn't told him to.

During his first testimony to Congress since becoming interior secretary, Bernhardt said it is up to lawmakers to direct bureaucrats like himself to address the causes and effects of warming globally.

The punt back to lawmakers is likely to frustrate House Democrats who are trying to hold the administration's feet to the fire on climate change, since they know that any significant climate-related legislation to emerge from their chamber is likely to be rejected by either the president or the GOP-controlled Senate. At the same time, Democrats have only passed a single climate bill — one keeping the United States in the Paris climate accord — since taking the the majority.

The exchange came when Democrats on the House Appropriations subcommittee overseeing the Interior Department's budget pressed the Trump Cabinet official about why his department isn't doing more to assess and mitigate the effects of warming temperatures, acidifying oceans and other effects of climate change over the vast lands and waters stewarded by the Interior Department.

“Isn’t this really your job?” asked Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-Maine).

Bernhardt pushed back against the assertion, arguing he has no legal obligation to act in response to climate change. ""My perspective on this is probably a little different than yours,"" he said.

He noted that of more than 600 instances in the law mandating the interior secretary to take some action, none tell him that he ""shall,"" as is the legal parlance, manage federal lands to stop global warming.

""There's no 'shalls,' "" Bernhardt said. ""You guys come up with the 'shalls.' ""

Pingee responded by asking Bernhardt to identify any legal barriers to acting on climate change. ""If there’s something legally stopping you, then we’re Congress,” she said. ""We make the laws.""

It is a lawyerly defense Bernhardt has turned to before, including in an interview last year with The Washington Post. Yet law or no law, climate change remains a threat to the land the Interior Department is tasked with overseeing.

In the national park system alone, warming temperatures threaten to undermine the very nature of many popular tourist spots, such as by melting the glaciers of Montana's Glacier National Park and imperilling the iconic Joshua trees of California's Joshua Tree National Park.

And the department holds considerable sway of the United States' overall contributions to climate change. A U.S. Geological Survey study published last year found that a quarter of the nation's carbon dioxide emissions came from the extracting and burning of fossil fuels from federal lands.

Yet in the more than two years Donald Trump has been president, the Interior Department has sought to undo much of the previous administration's efforts to slow the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere undergirding that change.

Its action include rolling back rules designed to reduce the release of methane, a potent heat-trapping gas, from oil and natural gas wells and lifting a moratorium on new coal leasing on public lands.

During the hearing, Bernhardt said his department does not plan on easing up on oil and gas drilling on public lands when asked by Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.), the subcommittee’s chairwoman, if a recent United Nations report on the possible extinction of up to 1 million species worldwide gives him pause.

""Are we going to stop oil and gas development because of this report? The answer to that is no,"" he said, again noting it is up to Congress to decide what the government does or does not allow on federal lands.

But when it came to the issue of drilling for oil and gas off the coasts of states outside the Gulf of Mexico, Bernhardt suggested he would give deference to local leaders.

""I’m not aware of a single lease that was ever developed over the opposition of a state,” he said.

The department has put on pause plans to expand offshore drilling across the U.S. continental shelf after a recent federal court ruled against the Trump administration's effort to lift a current drilling ban in the Arctic and Atlantic oceans. That decision came amid stiff opposition to offshore drilling from both Democratic and Republican politicians along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.

POWER PLAYS

— More Interior Department drama: House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) sent letters urging a group of current and former Trump administration officials to provide information to the committee related to ongoing investigations, threatening to withhold salaries from anyone who seeks to hamper investigations. One letter threatened the salaries of any Interior officials that try to stop lawmakers from interviewing agency staff about whether Bernhardt complied with federal record-keeping laws.

— Fed prepares for climate risks to banks: Federal Reserve Jerome Powell told lawmakers in a letter last month the central bank has aimed to “prepare financial institutions for severe weather events,” to make sure banks are resilient to climate-related risks, the Wall Street Journal reports. That echoes comments the central banker made while testifying before Congress in late February, in which he said climate-risks are mostly a matter of bank supervision and not actual monetary policy.

— EPA must enforce Obama-era methane regulations, judge says: A federal judge in California has ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to begin enforcing methane gas emission regulations that were established in 2016, E&E News reports. U.S . District Judge Haywood Gilliam of Oakland ruled the Trump administration has been illegally delaying action to limit pollutants emitted from landfills across the country, in violation of the Clean Air Act.

Who's winning in California vs. Trump? Gilliam’s ruling is just the latest in a slew of environmental cases California has brought against the administration. And the Los Angeles Times reports the state is winning in nearly all of its efforts.

— The stalemate over Puerto Rico disaster funding gets worse: And it's because of the border wall. The Trump administration is looking to add emergency border funding to a disaster aid bill, a new obstacle that has further complicated ongoing negotiations over the multibillion-dollar disaster legislation, The Post’s Erica Werner reports. An ongoing feud between the president and congressional Democrats over Puerto Rico spending has already stalled negotiations. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.) made a plea this week to Vice President Pence, who joined Senate Republicans for a closed-door lunch to talk about the disaster bill, that the introduction of a new spending element could tangle negotiations further.

— The partisan gulf in Congress over climate: There’s a stark contrast between how often Democratic and Republican lawmakers talk about climate change, The Post’s Philip Bump writes, compiling data from ProPublica to illustrate mentions of “climate” in congressional statements. The above graphic shows how that shakes out.

By contrast, Republican mentions of the “Green New Deal” outweigh those by Democrats, as Bump notes numerous Republican statements have been made to “express skepticism about the need to address the problem.”

— Starups targeting climate change struggle to rake in funding: The founder of the digital thermostat company Nest has met some obstacles in his mission to invest in start-up companies looking to tackle climate change. For one, the New York Times reports, not many venture capitalists have joined him in his quest to support such companies. Canadian company Carbon Engineering, which has been moving forward with carbon capture technology, is one company that has had success in raising money. But the Times writes the “current wave of internet-focused start-ups going public, and reaping billions of dollars for investors, has hardened the bias against so-called hard technology…In the time it took Carbon Engineering to raise one round of $68 million, Slack, a messaging company founded the same year, has raised more than 10 times as much and is now preparing for an initial public offering that could value it at nearly $20 billion.”

— Trump’s steel tariffs cost U.S. consumers $900,000 for every job created: That's according to an analysis by experts at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “The reason it’s so high is that steel is a very capital-intensive industry. There are not many workers,” Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute who did the cost calculation, told The Post’s Heather Long. Some Republicans and business leaders had hoped the president would have already removed the tariffs, and congressional Republicans have continued to pressure the administration to remove them “at least on Canada and Mexico, which are major feeders of metals to the United States,” Long adds.

— ""They let me go"": Hemanth Kappanna, an engineer who was part of a team of students who helped expose Volkswagen’s efforts to lie about diesel car emissions in 2013, was one of about 4,000 workers at General Motors who were recently laid off, the New York Times reports. On Tuesday, Volkswagen’s Porsche division announced it agreed to a 535 million euro, or $600 million, fine after German officials accused the car maker of selling almost 100,000 diesel SUVs with software meant to conceal excess emissions. Just a few months before, Kappanna, whose most recent role at G.M. was to communicate with the EPA about the company’s emissions technology, was called into a conference room to be let go. He received a severance package with two months of pay and a one-way ticket to India, where he returned soon after because he couldn’t find work before his 60-day grace period expired.

"Amazon Gave Jobs to DOD Staff Working on Cloud Bid, Lawsuit Claims",http://fortune.com,['Naomi Nix'],05-08-2019,2019,5,http://fortune.com/2019/05/08/amazon-oracle-pentagon-cloud-lawsuit/,"At least two Pentagon employees were offered jobs at Amazon.com Inc. while working on the Defense Department’s $10 billion cloud contract, a lawsuit filed by Oracle Corp. alleges.

The amended complaint, made public on Tuesday, claims Deap Ubhi, a former employee at a high-level Defense Department technology unit, helped design the cloud contract in a way that was favorable to Amazon after receiving “significant” job and bonus offers from the e-commerce giant.

Oracle’s latest court action comes weeks after the Pentagon announced it had eliminated Oracle and International Business Machines Corp. from the bidding because they didn’t meet the minimum criteria, leaving Amazon and Microsoft Corp. as the last remaining competitors.

The Pentagon, which announced the so-called JEDI competition in March of last year, doesn’t expect to award the contract before July 19.

Ubhi, who had worked at Amazon before joining the government, helped craft the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, procurement for weeks after accepting a job offer in October 2017 from Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud unit, according to the lawsuit. Ubhi then made up an “elaborate lie” about an Amazon offer to buy his startup company, Tablehero, when he “belatedly” recused himself from working on the contract, the lawsuit alleges.

JEDI Contracting Process

The lawsuit also contends that an unnamed former official connected with the Navy participated in the JEDI contracting process even after accepting a position with Amazon Web Services.

Ubhi is still employed by Amazon Web Services, according to his Twitter account.

An Amazon representative didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. The Defense Department declined to comment. Efforts to reach Ubhi through multiple emails and by telephone were unsuccessful.

Oracle first filed its lawsuit in December in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, alleging the Pentagon crafted overly narrow contract requirements and failed to investigate relationships between former Defense Department employees and Amazon.

The newest allegations may bolster Oracle’s argument that terms for the cloud project violate federal procurement standards. The cloud project involves transitioning massive amount of Defense Department data to a commercially-operated cloud system.

Oracle’s lawsuit also made conflict-of-interest allegations about Anthony DeMartino, former deputy chief of staff in the secretary of defense’s office. DeMartino had previously consulted for Amazon Web Services before assuming his role at the Pentagon.

In February, a judge paused court proceedings in the case to allow the Pentagon to review new information about potential conflicts of interests. The Pentagon said it determined that the acquisition process for the contract wasn’t tainted by alleged conflicts of interest.

In November, the U.S. Government Accountability Office also rejected Oracle’s conflict-of-interest allegations in a separate protest. The watchdog agency said the evidence it reviewed indicated that neither DeMartino nor Ubhi had substantive input into the contract’s terms or the procurement process.

Tech companies including Oracle banded together in an informal coalition last year to urge the Defense Department to split the contract among several suppliers.

Earlier: New Amazon Bias Charge Likely to Delay Pentagon’s Cloud Contract

They said the winner-take-all approach would lock the Pentagon into a single vendor and would heighten security risks. The department has said that making multiple awards under current acquisition law would be a slow process that could prevent it from quickly delivering new capabilities.

The JEDI contract could threaten the growth of a longstanding business that IBM and Oracle have with the Defense Department as it seeks to move its legacy technologies into a commercially-operated cloud system. Both companies were late entrants into the cloud market and have struggled to catch up to Amazon in the private and public sectors.

Amazon was widely seen as the frontrunner for the cloud contract because it previously won a $600 million deal cloud deal from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and obtained higher levels of federal security authorizations than its peers.

Challenge Requirements

Oracle Executive Vice President Kenneth Glueck, who leads the company’s Washington lobbying operation, said in a recent interview with Bloomberg News that the company will continue to challenge requirements for the contract in conversations with lawmakers on Capitol Hill.

“You read the RFP, and it just screams Amazon,” Glueck said in an interview April 26, referring to the Defense Department’s request for proposals. “The RFP emphasizes all the things Amazon is very good at” and “completely de-emphasizes the things they’re not very good at.”"
"By protecting Trump, Republicans risk limiting their ability to hold future Democratic presidents accountable",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/by-protecting-trump-republicans-risk-limiting-their-ability-to-hold-future-democratic-presidents-accountable,"Republicans ready to go to bat for President Trump in his ongoing battle to deny the requests of House Democrats risk limiting the ability of Republicans in Congress to hold future Democratic presidents accountable.

To be sure, it is not in the interest of Americans to allow the Congress to cripple any presidency by endless demands for documents and official testimony to investigate any claims that can be ginned up for political reasons. But at the same time, it is counter to the public interest to allow the executive branch to blanketly deny Congressional investigators access to relevant information, and thus escape accountability. There are a lot of gray areas between these extremes, and every administration, in one way or another, tests the boundaries. Our system, in an awkward way, has tried to establish some sort of balance.

As those in the opposition soon discover, the reality is that congressional oversight power is limited. A congressional subpoena, or a contempt finding such as the one Democrats are voting for today with regards to Attorney General William Barr, is not as powerful as a criminal one issued by a court of law, nor does it have the same implications. If the executive branch digs in, Congress runs out of tools in its box. It can take the administration to court, as Democrats plan to do with Trump’s tax returns, but then court proceedings can delay the release of information for years, well after they lose political relevance.

During the Obama administration, Republican investigators were frustrated by then-Attorney General Eric Holder’s refusal to hand over documents related to the botched Fast and Furious operation, in which thousands of guns were allowed to “walk” into Mexico, where they ended up in the hands of drug cartels and were linked to the death of a U.S. border patrol agent. Holder, who lied in congressional testimony , also hid behind executive privilege in releasing documents, and was held in contempt. But his Department of Justice still dragged its feet in turning over documents, even after court orders. It wasn’t until 2018, six years after the Congressional contempt finding, that the Jeff Sessions-led Justice Department announced it was handing over all of the documents. There are also plenty of examples of Bill Clinton and his Justice Department trying to stymie investigations, for instance, the one into potential campaign finance violations in his 1996 reelection campaign.

This isn’t to focus on one side. There are examples from the Reagan and Bush administrations, and of course, the Nixon administration of Republican presidents trying to thwart congressional investigations.

The reason I raise this is that the history of previous Democratic administrations fighting congressional document requests is that they have made Republicans feel more justified in defending him in disputes with the Democratic House.

Republicans should be aware, however, that any principles that Trump establishes in rebuffing congressional investigators could be used (or further built upon) by future Democratic presidents seeking to avoid scrutiny from Republicans in Congress. Republicans should not see defending Trump on every matter as necessary, even if they believe that the Robert Mueller report vindicated him on the Russia issue.

There are two aspects of Trump’s defiance that I find particularly worrisome.

One is the specific issue of Trump’s tax returns. I’ve called on him to release his tax returns ever since the 2016 campaign, and still believe he ought to in the name of transparency, and this is true even if he can convince a court that he is not obligated to hand them over to Congress.

The public should be able to have an understanding of where the president’s income is coming from and what his taxes look like. That Trump entered the presidential race in a unique position as a man with a global business empire and that he has complicated taxes should not be an excuse not to release them. It’s actually a stronger argument in favor of making them public.

Americans should be able to get a firm idea of Trump’s business dealings, of potential conflicts of interest, and of potential avenues through which foreign governments can try to gain influence by way of businesses. This is important independently of the motivations that Democrats have in trying to use them to embarrass him politically.

For over three years , Trump has argued that he cannot release his tax returns while he’s under audit. In reality, even if we take him at his word that he has been under perpetual audit, nothing would prevent him from releasing tax returns while under audit, nor should it have any bearing on whether he releases taxes from years unaffected by the claimed audit.

There is no law requiring presidents to hand over their tax returns, though that has been the modern practice. Barack Obama released his tax returns, yet many conservatives were fixated by his refusal to release his college records. Trump got in on the action just ahead of the 2012 election , offering Obama $5 million to a charity of his choice, stating, ""President Obama is the least transparent president in the history of this country."" Whatever biographical details some conservatives thought Obama’s college records would reveal, they are clearly less relevant to his presidency than Trump’s sources of income.

If Trump is able to rebuff congressional investigators by successfully arguing in court that their demand for his tax returns does not serve a legislative purpose , it will create a disincentive for future presidents — including Democratic ones — to release their tax returns if they contain any information that could potentially be politically damaging.

Another aspect of Trump’s posture that’s worrisome is his blanket statement, “We’re fighting all the subpoenas .""

As noted above, there are plenty of examples of presidents invoking executive privilege to block congressional requests for documents or official testimony. But there is a difference between invoking privilege in each individual case, for specific reasons, and declaring an intention up front to be broadly uncooperative because members of the popularly elected opposition party “ aren’t impartial people .”

Again, if Trump is able to set a standard under which presidents can broadly declare their intention not to cooperate with congressional investigations, this standard will inevitably come back to haunt Republicans.

The standoff between Trump and Democrats should be viewed independently of current political considerations and seen as part of a much larger battle over the powers of congressional oversight and the executive branch. Republicans need to consider what they believe the proper balance should be if a Democrat were in power, and act accordingly."

The House Judiciary Committee will proceed with a vote to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress on Wednesday, Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) confirmed late Monday, as the Justice Department attempts to fend off the effort ahead of a negotiating session with the Democratic-led committee on Tuesday.

Nadler's firm stance comes as he seeks punitive actions against the attorney general for defying a subpoena for special counsel Robert Mueller’s unredacted report on the Russia investigation and its underlying evidence. It also comes hours after the Justice Department put forward a last-ditch plea to negotiate with the panel, offering a Wednesday meeting but later agreeing to Nadler’s demand for a Tuesday sit-down.

Story Continued Below

“At the moment, our plans to consider holding Attorney General Barr accountable for his failure to comply with our subpoena still stand,” Nadler said in a statement. “My hope is that we make concrete progress at tomorrow’s meeting towards resolving this dispute. The committee remains committed to finding a reasonable accommodation.”

In a letter to Nadler earlier Monday, Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd invited the chairman to a negotiation session on Wednesday to discuss an “acceptable accommodation” that would potentially give more lawmakers access to a less-redacted version of the report, in addition to “possible disclosure of certain materials” cited in Mueller’s report.

Boyd’s letter came hours after the committee took its first formal step toward holding Barr in contempt of Congress for defying the panel’s subpoena for Mueller's unredacted report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, when Nadler announced that it planned to consider a contempt citation against Barr on Wednesday morning.

A vote of approval from the Democrat-led committee would send the measure to the full House for consideration later this month. Nadler said he would put the contempt proceedings on hold if the Justice Department engages in a “good-faith” effort to give Democrats access to the requested information.

“The attorney general’s failure to comply with our subpoena, after extensive accommodation efforts, leaves us no choice but to initiate contempt proceedings in order to enforce the subpoena and access the full, unredacted report,” Nadler said in a statement before the DOJ released its letter.

Democrats have argued that the redacted version Barr made public last month is insufficient to consider a potential congressional response to Mueller's findings, particularly his evidence that President Donald Trump attempted to thwart the investigation.

The committee launched its own obstruction of justice investigation against the president earlier this year. The contempt citation explicitly mentions that probe, which is also centered on allegations of “public corruption and other abuses of power” by the president.

“Attorney General Barr failed to comply with the committee’s request for these documents and thereby has hindered the committee’s constitutional, oversight, and legislative functions,” the citation states.

The contempt citation also references the Justice Department’s long-standing policy against indicting a sitting president, noting that Mueller accepted those guidelines in declining to charge Trump with obstruction of justice.

“Congress is therefore the only body able to hold the president to account for improper conduct in our tripartite system, and urgently requires the subpoenaed material to determine whether and how to proceed with its constitutional duty to provide checks and balances on the president and executive branch,” the citation states. “Otherwise, the president remains insulated from legal consequences and sits above the law.”

The Justice Department said last week it would not comply with the committee’s subpoena for the unredacted report and the underlying evidence, arguing that it amounts to illegitimate congressional oversight. Nadler gave Barr until Monday morning to respond to an augmented offer; the Justice Department did not respond to that offer, and has maintained that it would be violating the law if it complied with the Democrats’ request.

Boyd slammed Nadler for refusing to view the less-redacted version of Mueller’s report, which still includes redactions of grand-jury information. Boyd said Nadler’s refusal “naturally raises questions about the sincerity of the committee’s interest in and purported need for the redacted material.”

All six House and Senate Democrats declined to read the less-redacted version of the report offered to a select group of senior lawmakers, arguing that the offer should have included dozens more members of the committees investigating matters connected to Mueller's findings.

In response to the formal contempt notice on Monday, the committee’s top Republican, Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, called Nadler’s move “illogical and disingenuous” because the Justice Department is still negotiating with the panel.

“Democrats have launched a proxy war smearing the attorney general when their anger actually lies with the president and the special counsel, who found neither conspiracy nor obstruction,” Collins said in a statement.

Democrats have been demanding Mueller's complete report and underlying evidence for months, a call that intensified after Mueller submitted his findings to Barr in late March. But Barr held on to the report for a month while he reviewed and redacted it for several categories of sensitive information. The public version of the report he released contained limited redactions but included none of Mueller's underlying material — evidence Democrats say they need to determine whether Trump committed impeachable offenses.

Though Mueller concluded that he lacked sufficient evidence to prove any Americans aided the vast Russian effort to interfere in the 2016 election, he described repeated efforts by Trump to sideline the investigation altogether and to encourage witnesses to refrain from full cooperation.

Mueller did not formally conclude that Trump obstructed justice — a determination he said was largely a result of the DOJ restrictions against indicting a sitting president — but Barr has since used Mueller's evidence to absolve Trump of the potential crime.

Barr testified for five hours to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and described sharp disagreements with the legal theories undergirding Mueller's findings — including whether Trump's tweets can be persuasive evidence of obstruction and suggesting Mueller told him privately, despite not indicating it in his report, that his obstruction decision was not based on the longstanding DOJ restriction.

Barr skipped a hearing House Democrats had called last Thursday after his aides objected to Democrats' request to allow committee lawyers from both parties to question Barr for 30 minutes each. Democrats previously authorized Nadler to subpoena Barr a second time to compel his appearance before their committee, though he hasn't issued it yet.

The impact of a contempt citation could be simply symbolic. Republicans held Barack Obama’s attorney general, Eric Holder, in contempt of Congress for failing to turn over documents. Some Democrats have floated the possibility of using punitive enforcement mechanisms against Barr for defying their subpoena, including levying fines against the attorney general.

A Bible on display at the Manchester Veterans Affairs Medical Center is now the subject of a federal lawsuit. The Bible was carried by a prisoner of war in World War II and then made part of a memorial in the Manchester VA, near the entrance. >> Download the FREE WMUR appA patient, James Chamberlain, filed a lawsuit Tuesday to have the Bible removed from the Missing Man Table, where it is displayed inside a secure case.The Bible had been removed in February after a plea from the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, whose leaders said 14 patients complained to them about the Bible's placement. The organization asked the VA to remove the Bible, calling its presence intolerable and unconstitutional.""Right now, the VA is a train wreck of unconstitutionality as they elevate Christianity to the supreme position of dominance in direct violation of our U.S. Constitution,"" said Michael Weinstein of MRFF. ""It's shameful. It's disgraceful.""VA officials moved the Bible to a nearby display case, sparking opposing efforts to get the Bible moved back to its original spot.After a few weeks, VA officials moved the Bible back, leading to the lawsuit from Chamberlain, the 15th patient to file a complaint with the foundation, according to the lawsuit.Veteran Paul Martin's group, the Northeast POW-MIA Network, obtained the WWII-era bible for the display in September last year.""Everybody's entitled to their opinion, but I think it's a shame,"" Martin said. ""It would be a shame that that Bible be taken from that table.""In the lawsuit, Chamberlain said he is a devout Christian, but he ""believes that our Constitution prohibits the establishment by the government of any specific religious belief and prohibits discrimination against any person because of their religious beliefs or lack thereof. Despite his strong personal religious beliefs, he believes that the Christian Bible has no place being displayed on the POW/MIA table at the entrance way to the MVAMC, where he gets his care."" Curt Cashour, press secretary for the Department of Veterans Affairs, released a statement about the lawsuit:""This lawsuit – backed by a group known for questionable practices and unsuccessful lawsuits – is nothing more than an attempt to force VA into censoring a show of respect for America’s POW/MIA community. Make no mistake: VA will not be bullied on this issue. After receiving a complaint in late January about a Bible included in a Northeast POW/MIA Network-sponsored POW/MIA table, Manchester VAMC officials temporarily removed the Bible from the display out of an abundance of caution. Following that removal, Manchester VAMC received an outpouring of complaints from Veterans and other stakeholders – many of whom dropped off Bibles at the facility – in protest of this action. After consulting with legal counsel, Manchester VAMC has again placed the Bible on display, where it will remain indefinitely as part of the POW/MIA table, a secular tribute to America’s POW/MIA community. We apologize to the Veterans, families and other stakeholders who were offended by the facility’s incorrect removal of this Bible.""Mike Berry, chief of staff and director of military affairs for First Liberty Institute, which represents the veterans group who donated the memorial table, has also released a statement:“POW/MIA Remembrance displays have a long, cherished history in our nation. Veterans organizations like the Northeast POW/MIA Network should be able to honor and remember those killed, captured or missing with a display that includes a Bible donated by a WWII veteran that represents the strength through faith necessary for American service members to survive.”Many veterans visiting the display had strong feelings on the issue.""It's a spiritual item that many of us veterans look to for support,"" Marine Guy Emerson said. ""I think it would be a shame and a sin to remove it.""""I feel this is a sacred place, and it should be respected,"" Air Force veteran John Fee said.

"Kellyanne Conway on investigating FBI, DOJ leaks: 'What is everyone afraid of?'",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/kellyanne-conway-on-investigating-fbi-doj-leaks-what-is-everyone-afraid-of,"White House counselor Kellyanne Conway on Monday taunted top-level officials in former President Barack Obama’s FBI and CIA Monday, asking why they'd be nervous about President Trump’s Justice Department investigating leaks they made to media in an attempt to hurt Trump.

“What is everyone afraid of?” Conway quipped during an appearance on ""Fox and Friends."" “What do you have to hide? How did this all start? Bill Barr, the attorney general, made clear that perhaps there is an investigation into at least eight of these leaks.”

The “leaks” Conway are referring to are alleged communications between top Obama-era intelligence officials and members of the press during the 2016 presidential election and first year of Trump’s presidency.

In 2017, Trump famously fired former FBI Director James Comey — today a prominent anti-Trump figure who the president has dismissed as a “liar” and a “leaker.”

The same year, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was forced to resign from the department after it was discovered he leaked information to the press about former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

During a congressional testimony last week, Attorney General William Barr sent Republicans into a frenzy by citing spying on Trump’s 2016 campaign.

Barr’s statement gave fuel to an already red-hot narrative spun by the White House and leading Republicans who have railed against an anti-Trump bias at the highest levels of the Department of Justice and criminal intelligence agencies.

After Mueller found no collusion between the president and Russia, Trump encouraged his allies on Capitol Hill and Barr to “investigate the investigators.”

“Mueller, and the A.G. based on Mueller findings (and great intelligence), have already ruled No Collusion, No Obstruction,” Trump tweeted last month. “These were crimes committed by Crooked Hillary, the DNC, Dirty Cops and others! INVESTIGATE THE INVESTIGATORS!”

Now that scrutiny has shifted in part to how the Mueller probe began, Conway smirked at the thought of anti-Trump figures shaking in their boots.

“I, for one, as a citizen of this country, want to know if intelligence officers were leaking information to the press,” Conway said. “I think a few of them look a little nervous these days.”"
US Dept. of Energy Announces Frontier Supercomputer: Cray and AMD to Build 1.5 Exaflop Machine,https://www.anandtech.com,['Ryan Smith'],,,,https://www.anandtech.com/show/14302/us-dept-of-energy-announces-frontier-supercomputer-cray-and-amd-1-5-exaflops,"The history of the computing industry is one of constant progress. Processors get faster, storage gets cheaper, and memory gets denser. We see the repercussions of this advancement through all aspects of society, and that extends to the top as well, where national governments continue to invest in bigger and better supercomputers. One part technological necessity and one part technological race, the exascale era of supercomputers is about to begin, as orders for the first exaFLOP-capable are now going out. It’s only fitting then that this morning the United States Department of Energy is announcing the contract for their fastest supercomputer yet, the Frontier system, which will be built by Cray and AMD.

Frontier is planned for delivery in 2021, and when it’s activated it will become the second and most powerful of the US DOE’s two planned 2021 exascale systems, with performance expected to reach 1.5 exaFLOPS. The ambitious system won’t come cheaply, however; with a price tag of over 500 million dollars for the system alone – and another 100 million dollars for R&D – Frontier is among the most expensive supercomputers ever ordered by the US Department of Energy.

The new supercomputer is being built as part of the US DOE’s CORAL-2 program for supercomputers, with Frontier scheduled to replace Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s current Summit supercomputer. Summit is the current reigning champion in the supercomputer world, with 200 petaFLOPS of performance, and accordingly the US DOE and Oak Ridge are aiming to significantly improve on its performance for the new computer. All told, Frontier should be able to deliver over 7x the performance of Summit, and is expected to be the fastest supercomputer in the world once it’s activated.

Like Summit (and Titan before it), Frontier is an open science system, meaning that it’s available to academic researchers to run simulations and experiments on. Accordingly, the lab is expecting the supercomputer to be used for a wide range of projects across numerous disciplines, including not only traditional modeling and simulation tasks, but also more data-driven techniques for artificial intelligence and data analytics. In fact the latter is a bit of new ground for the lab and the system’s eventual users; just as we’ve seen in the enterprise space over the past few years, neural network-based AI is becoming an increasingly popular technique to solve problems and extract analysis from large datasets, and now researchers are looking at how to refine those techniques from the current-generation systems and apply them to exascale-level projects.

US Department of Energy Supercomputers Frontier Aurora Summit CPU Architecture AMD EPYC

(Future Zen) Intel Xeon Scalable IBM POWER9 GPU Architecture Radeon Instinct Intel Xe NVIDIA Volta Performance (RPEAK) 1.5 EFLOPS 1 EFLOPS 200 PFLOPS Power Consumption ~30MW N/A 13MW Nodes 100 Cabinets N/A 3,400 Laboratory Oak Ridge Argonne Oak Ridge Vendor Cray Intel IBM Year 2021 2021 2018

Frontier: Powered by Cray & AMD

Officially, the prime contractor for Frontier will be Cray. But looking at the specifications, you could be excused for thinking it was AMD. Cray for its part is partnering with the chipmaker for the system, and as a result AMD is providing most of the core hardware for the new supercomputer. Designed as a next-generation CPU + accelerator system, with a mix of CPUs and GPUs doing the heavy compute work, AMD will be supplying both the CPUs and GPUs for Frontier. And as the principle processor provider, AMD will also be taking on a lot of the responsibility for developing the software stack as well, with the company working with Cray to develop an enhanced version of their ROCm environment to best extract performance from the massive cluster of CPUs and GPUs.

On the CPU side of matters, AMD will be supplying a customized next-generation EPYC CPU. AMD has confirmed that it’s going to be using a future generation of their Zen CPU cores, and given the timing of the project, we’re almost certainly looking at a Zen 3 or Zen 4 design here. Just how custom AMD’s CPU is remains to be seen, but their announcement has revealed that Frontier’s CPUs will include new instructions for the optimization of AI and supercomputing workloads.

Meanwhile on the GPU side of matters, AMD and Cray are holding their cards a little closer. Rather than naming any architecture or architectural generation, AMD is only saying that the GPUs are “based on the Radeon Instinct family” and have “yet to be announced.” AMD’s current public roadmap goes out to “Next Gen” in 2020, and with GPU development cycles averaging 2 years, this may be the architecture we see. But with the particular needs for a supercomputer, AMD may have something slightly more bespoke.

What the company is confirming for now is that they aren’t holding back on features. The HPC-focused GPU is being designed with Frontier in mind and will incorporate mixed precision compute support. Feeding the beast will be HBM memory, and AMD will be tapping a version of Infinity Fabric to connect the CPUs and GPUs.

In fact while AMD has kept the details on the technology light, it sounds like this version of IF will be the most advanced version yet. AMD is specifically noting that it’s an “incredibly” coherent fabric, calling it the first fully optimized CPU + GPU design for supercomputing. AMD’s GPUs and CPUs will be arranged in a 4-to-1 ratio, with 4 GPUs for each EPYC CPU. It’s worth noting that AMD’s slide shows a mesh with every GPU connected to the CPU and two other GPUs, but I’m not reading too much into this quite yet, as AMD hasn’t disclosed any other details on the IF setup.

With AMD going up to the blade level, tying together all of these nodes will be Cray’s job. For Frontier the supercomputer vendor is launching their new Slingshot interconnect, an equally ambitious interconnect that will support adaptive routing, congestion management, and quality-of-service features. Slingshot is capable of 200Gb/sec per port, with individual blades incorporating a port for each GPU in the blade so that other nodes can directly read and write data to a GPU’s memory. As a result Frontier will have a significant amount of interconnect bandwidth, which is all but necessary in order to allow the system to scale to exaFLOP levels.

Overall, Frontier will be organized into over 100 Cray Shasta cabinets. And while Cray has not announced a specific power consumption figure for Frontier, with each cabinet rated for 300KW, this would put the complete system at over 30MW. Which to put things in context, this is over twice the power consumption of the 13MW Summit. So while Frontier is a significantly faster system than the supercomputer it replaces, Cray, AMD, and the US DOE are all feeling the pinch of Dennard scaling slowing down, as power efficiency gains get harder to achieve. All told, in a passing comment made in the press briefing, it sounds like Oak Ridge will be installing a total of 40MW of capacity for Frontier, which is a significant amount of power to say the least.

Along with furthering the US’s own supercomputing leadership goals, securing the Frontier contract also represents big wins for Cray and AMD. Cray is now involved in both 2021 exascale systems, reinforcing their own place in the supercomputing world. Meanwhile for AMD, who is spending this current generation from the outside looking in, they have now secured a major and prestigious win for both their CPU and GPU divisions.

In fact it’s interesting to note that of the two 2021 exascale systems being ordered, both are coming from full-service processor vendors that supply both CPUs and GPUs. Current-generation systems like Summit use mixed vendors – e.g. IBM + NVIDIA – so the move to integrated vendors is a big shift for these CPU + accelerator systems. Clearly there are technological and procurement benefits to using a single vendor for all of the processors, which benefits both AMD and Intel. Though it’s worth noting that the CORAL-2 program requires the DOE to buy systems based on two different architectures, so if the future is integrated systems, then AMD and Intel are the logical choices.

At any rate, with the contract placed for Frontier, the job is only half-done. AMD and Cray will need to continue developing their hardware and software for the system, not to mention locking down the specific specifications for the finished supercomputer. So expect to continue to hear news about Frontier trickle out over the next couple of years, leading up to its installation in 2021."
Shareholders Demand To Know How Northrop Grumman Will Protect Human Rights While Building Massive DHS Database,https://www.eff.org,"['Jason Kelley', 'Jyoti Panday']",05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/05/shareholders-northrop-grumman-demand-know-how-company-will-protect-human-rights,"Over the next few years, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) plans to implement an enormous biometric collection program which will endanger the rights of citizens and foreigners alike. The agency intends to collect at least seven types of biometric identifiers, including face and voice data, DNA, scars, and tattoos, often from questionable sources, and from innocent people.

But DHS isn’t building all of the technology: Northrop Grumman, a defense contractor, won the nearly 100 million-dollar, 42-month contract to “develop increments one and two” of the project, named HART (Homeland Advanced Recognition Technology). Now, a group of concerned investors are demanding that the Board of Directors of the company explain how they will protect human rights while building the tech behind the massive, privacy-invasive database.

It’s unsurprising that shareholders are recognizing the serious harm to civil and human rights the company will be linked to through its work on this project.

The Tri-State Coalition for Responsible Investment (Tri-CRI) filed the shareholder resolution in November after discussions with company management failed. The resolution asks the board to explain how the company will abide by its human rights policy, which reflects the U.N.’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights, while building a database that will greatly expand DHS’s ability to surveil innocent people. Their fears are well-founded: as EFF reported, HART will chill and deter people from exercising their First Amendment protected rights to speak, assemble, and associate—all rights also recognized under the UN’s Declaration of Human Rights, and presumably, by Northrop Grumman’s policy. If it is serious about its commitment to human rights, the shareholders say, the company must step up and explain how it squares that commitment with the harms inherent in this project. Voting on the resolution will take place May 15.

According to Northrop Grumman’s press release, “HART will offer a more accurate, robust way to identify adversaries” using “advanced, proven technologies.” But far from being proven or accurate, face recognition—one of the first components of HART to be built, and which DHS intends to rely on to identify people across a variety of its mission areas—has a high rate of inaccuracy, even according to DHS’s tests of its own systems, and is known to misidentify people of color and women at higher rates than others. In their shareholder resolution, Tri-CRI lay this out in addition to other harms posed by the technology:

There are concerns that the algorithms used to identify facial images that may be stored in the database have inherent racial bias. The HART database will amplify the surveillance capabilities of government agencies, presenting risks to privacy and First Amendment rights and causing harm to immigrant communities. Through the provision of services through the DHS contract, Northrop Grumman may be linked or contribute to these adverse human rights impacts.

Shareholders aren’t alone in their concerns with this technology: a coalition of over 85 groups across a spectrum of civil society recently demanded that other companies, including Amazon, Microsoft, and Google halt all governmental sales of face recognition technology. Amazon faces similar shareholder action later this month. And the pushback isn’t just coming from advocacy groups. Senators have asked DHS to pause at least one aspect of the HART program—the use of facial recognition in airports—until a proper rulemaking. The OIG is investigating the proposal as well, to “assess whether biometric data collected at pilot locations has improved DHS's ability to verify departures.” The Government Accountability Office has criticized the reliability of DHS’s data, and Congress even withheld funds in previous years from DHS’s Office of Biometric Identity Management. Even major cities, including San Francisco and Oakland, are considering permanent bans on any city department utilizing facial recognition technology—an indicator of how dangerous the technology is.

Facial recognition isn’t the only problem with HART. EFF filed comments criticizing DHS’s plan to collect, store, and share the biometric and biographic records it receives from external agencies, and to exempt this information from the federal Privacy Act, making it difficult if not impossible for individuals to review the data collected. In addition, the broad, vague scope of DHS’s proposal makes it exceedingly difficult for the American public to track and comment on the over-collection and overuse of biometric data.

Other data DHS is planning to collect—including information about people’s “relationship patterns” and from officer “encounters” with the public—can be used to identify political affiliations, religious activities, and familial and friendly relationships. These data points are also frequently colored by conjecture and bias. This, combined with the fact that the biometric data will be shared with federal agencies outside of DHS, as well as state and local law enforcement and foreign governments, poses a very real threat to First Amendment-protected activities. DHS must do more to minimize the threats to privacy and civil liberties posed by this vast new trove of highly sensitive personal data—and Northrop Grumman should look carefully at these and other criticisms when responding to shareholders’ concerns.

DHS’s legacy IDENT fingerprint database, which HART builds off of, contains information on 220-million unique individuals—an enormous increase from 20 years ago when IDENT only contained information on 1.8-million people. Between IDENT and other DHS-managed databases, the agency already manages over 10-billion biographic records and adds 10-15 million more each week. Northrop Grumman is set to help the agency—which includes the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)—expand the scope of this unimaginably vast data trove exponentially, with new, questionable data sources gathered from ineffective and dangerous technology.

Private companies aren’t subject to the same pressure as elected officials and government agencies, but it’s unsurprising that shareholders are recognizing the serious harm to civil and human rights the company will be linked to through its work on this project. Transparency is often the first step towards accountability, and we are glad to see shareholders holding the company to account, and pressing it to publicly report how it applies its human rights policy to its work building technology that endangers human rights.

Dems look to bypass EPA with asbestos ban,https://thehill.com,[],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/442716-dems-want-asbestos-ban-now-epa-says-it-needs-more-time,"House Democrats hope to sidestep the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with a bill that would ban asbestos within a year.

In a Wednesday hearing before the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Environment and Climate Change, Democrats grilled EPA chemical staff on why the agency hasn’t taken more restrictive actions on the harmful substance three years after passing a law to give the agency more authority to regulate dangerous chemicals.

“I wish today’s hearing wasn’t necessary and this bill wasn't necessary, but asbestos is still being imported into the U.S. and still being used in this country, and still killing about 40,000 Americans every year,” said committee Chairman Frank Pallone Jr. Frank Joseph PalloneDem senators call for probe into EPA officials over memo language 'Medicare for All' gets boost from first congressional hearing Overnight Health Care: House Dems hold first hearing on 'Medicare for All' | Trump urges Dem senator to revive ObamaCare talks | Booming cannabis market puts pressure on FDA MORE (D-N.J.). ADVERTISEMENT

The EPA has been under heavy criticism for its latest action on asbestos, something the agency argues will limit the use of asbestos in the U.S. but critics say could reintroduce some asbestos products to the market.

The agency has resisted calls to ban the cancer-causing substance outright, even against the wishes of some of its staff, arguing it must continue to go through its risk evaluation process, even if lengthier than some might prefer.

The New York Times reported Wednesday that senior EPA officials ignored the advice of scientists and lawyers in restricting rather than banning asbestos.

“Rather than allow for (even with restrictions) any new uses for asbestos, E.P.A. should seek to ban all new uses of asbestos because the extreme harm from this chemical substance outweighs any benefit — and because there are adequate alternatives to asbestos,” staff members wrote in a memo from August.

“Based on some of these communications it seems clear that numerous EPA career staff believe the agency is not fully pursuing efforts to reduce asbestos exposure, and I hope these expert voices have a role as the process moves forward,” he said.

Asbestos is still sometimes used in the construction of roads and production of chlorine, among other products, but more than 60 countries have banned the use of the substance or products that contain it.

“The U.S. must do the same,” argued Tonko, but “I have little confidence that EPA will move forward on a reasonable timeline with the only acceptable outcome: a complete asbestos ban.”

Congress banned asbestos in 1989 but a court overturned that law in 1991, allowing limited uses of asbestos to continue.

Committee Republicans accused Democrats of politicizing the issue, trying to sidestep a science-based EPA process that could help the agency avoid future litigation.

“Let me be honest here.

Rep. Greg Walden Gregory (Greg) Paul WaldenRepublicans troll Democrats with proposals to rename upcoming health care bill Trump laments social media 'getting worse' for conservatives, warns he'll 'monitor the censorship' This week: Barr back in hot seat over Mueller report MORE (R-Ore.) said that although he’d like to see an end to mesothelioma, the committee needed to carefully consider what unintended consequences a ban could have.

“I’m concerned about the immediate loss of 36 percent — that’s over one third — of our national chlorine production” and the risk that would pose to hospitals and drinking water supplies, he said.

For its part, the EPA continues to stress that its rule is the first meaningful action on asbestos in 30 years.

Alexandra Dapolito Dunn, assistant administrator of the EPA’s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, told the committee the rule is an “aggressive and critical step” in addressing asbestos, stressing the need to go through a measured process in considering the risk factors associated with asbestos.

Dunn told The Hill in April that the agency may eventually ban asbestos.

Committee Democrats made clear they have lost faith in Dunn’s office under the Trump administration.

“Unfortunately, it’s now clear that despite the best efforts of our committee the Trump EPA is not using the tools we gave it to regulate dangerous chemicals,” Pallone Jr. said, adding that EPA’s actions “have been so legally suspect we need to pass this bill regardless of whether EPA were to announce it’s moving forward with a full ban of asbestos.”"
Microsoft and VA team up to help disabled veterans play video games,https://rebootcamp.militarytimes.com,['Joshua Axelrod'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://rebootcamp.militarytimes.com/news/transition/2019/05/08/microsoft-and-va-team-up-to-help-disabled-veterans-play-video-games/,"Disabled veteran gamers are in for a treat thanks to a recent partnership between Microsoft and the Department of Veterans Affairs.

The Xbox adaptive controller was created so veterans with disabilities and others can play “Halo,” “Kingdom Hearts 3” or whatever games they’re into just as everyone else can.

“It’s a very different approach to a game controller from what I think people conceptualize a game controller to be,” said Bryce Johnson, the inclusive lead at Microsoft Devices. “This is not one-size fits all; this is the opposite of that. You can use this thing to adapt to you.”

Rebootcamp Recommendations

While the controller is currently available to buy, Microsoft donated controllers, consoles, games and other adaptive gaming equipment to 22 VA rehab centers around the country. Veterans can use the controllers for free at facilities in Washington, D.C., Texas, Alabama, Ohio, Tennessee, Minnesota, Virginia, Missouri, Florida, Colorado, New York and California.

The idea for the adaptive controller was born during the 2015 edition of Microsoft’s annual hackathon, according to Johnson. That’s when Johnson and his Microsoft colleagues met Sgt. Josh Price, who had lost his right arm from his elbow down.

Johnson recalled watching Price use a customized Xbox controller created by Ken Jones, founder of the nonprofit Warfighter Engaged, which is dedicated to coming up with innovative ways for the disabled to enjoy gaming.

“It was super important for us to see it because we had to recognize what people were going through to play games and how much they were willing to do,” Johnson said.

After developing their own adaptive controller, Microsoft approached the VA to make sure veterans had access to it at their facilities.

“The options for video-gaming have been relatively limited,” said Dr. Leif Nelson, the VA’s director of national veterans sports programs and special events. “That’s what’s exciting about this: It’s another option for us to open up the world of esports.”

Jones has been working in adaptive gaming since 2012, when he began to use his engineering skills to create custom controllers for specific disabilities upon request. He eventually turned those projects into Warfighter Engaged, and he was delighted to work with Microsoft on their Xbox adaptive controller.

He said that Xbox controllers can be modified to “do just about anything,” which makes adapting them for veterans’ individual needs fairly simple.

“So it’s about as universal as you’re possibly going to get,” Jones said. “It’s basically a dream come true for people who modify controllers and for people who need it.”

Gaming is also a therapeutic tool for veterans, both physically and mentally, Jones said. That’s why making it easier for veterans to play, through innovations like the Xbox adaptive controller, is a big deal.

“There is some physical therapy going on there,” he said. “It’s moving your muscles around. But a lot of it is cognitive therapy decision-making. It’s just a way of relaxing and doing something that you wanted to do before.”

Nelson, who is a doctor of physical therapy, said gaming can also help veterans avoid isolation.

“It’s a community now and a way to socially engage and interact,” Nelson said. “And that’s what we’re trying to do with our veterans.”

That element of gaming was vital for Dave Crouse, a Marine Corps veteran and director of veterans services at video-game nonprofit Stack Up. He said that the military lifestyle while deployed is a lot of “hurry up and wait,” and many of those extra hours are spent playing video games.

Crouse served from 2003 to 2014 and specialized in explosive ordnance disposal. He lost his left hand and left eye during an operation in Cambodia in 2013, so he knows exactly how crucial video games can be for a veteran’s recovery and how useful something like the Xbox adaptive controller can be for that purpose.

”For me, it is the perfect form of escapism,” he said. “It engages me mentally and physically, and it gives me this cool escape, whether it’s just to decompress or to put some distance between me and the challenges I’m facing.”

There are many ways for veterans to deal with the lingering effects of PTSD, from motorcycle-riding to extreme sports. The best method for Crouse has been playing video games, and products like the Xbox adaptive controller give him and many others the means to continue participating in an activity they love."
Pompeo abruptly cancels trip to Germany,https://www.cnn.com,"['Devan Cole', 'Nicole Gaouette']",05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/07/politics/mike-pompeo-cancels-trip/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Secretary of State Mike Pompeo abruptly canceled a scheduled trip to Germany, where he was planning to meet with Chancellor Angela Merkel ""due to pressing issues,"" the State Department said early Tuesday.

No specific reason was given for the cancellation. The press pool traveling with Pompeo has not been told where they are going next, and have been warned they may not be able to report from the country they are going to until after their departure.

""Unfortunately, we must reschedule the Berlin meetings due to pressing issues. We look forward to rescheduling this important set of meetings. The Secretary looks forward to being in Berlin soon,"" State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said, according to the press pool traveling with Pompeo.

The sudden schedule change comes two days after the Pentagon deployed a carrier and a bomber task force to the Middle East, in response to ""specific and credible"" intelligence that suggested Iranian forces and proxies were planning to target US forces in Syria, Iraq and at sea.

The carrier group has been ordered to Strait of Hormuz in order to send a deterrent message to Iran, US officials said Sunday. The move is likely to heighten tensions as Tehran explicitly warned the US in April against any moves to block or interfere with the Strait. The 21-mile-wide waterway separates Iran from other Gulf countries and is a crucial conduit for the global economy, with 30% of the world's crude oil passing through it.

"Impeach Trump? House Democrats are stuck if they do, stuck if they don’t.",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Amber Phillips', 'Reporter For The Fix Covering Congress', 'May At Am']",05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/05/08/impeach-trump-house-democrats-are-stuck-if-they-do-stuck-if-they-dont/,"There’s a valid case to be made that Congress must do something to punish President Trump’s obstruction-y behavior, as outlined in Robert S. Mueller III’s Russia report. If nothing else, the argument goes, a warning must be sent to future presidents that this is not okay.

Republicans’ reflexive allegiance to Trump means it’s on House Democrats to act. And that’s precisely why their leadership is hesitant to start impeachment proceedings.

Their political opponents are casting everything related to investigating Trump as a partisan move, which makes it nearly impossible for Democrats to convince voters that they are trying to fulfill their duty as a coequal branch of government and hold this president accountable. Even if they do have the purest of intentions, a big chunk of the country won’t believe them.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) summed this up Tuesday at Cornell University: “We can’t impeach him for political reasons, and we can’t not impeach him for political reasons. We have to see where the facts take us.”

She said Trump “is goading us to impeach him.” In an interview Wednesday with Washington Post Live, she added that he is “self-impeachable,” a somewhat vague term that, in context with her other remarks, suggests that Pelosi thinks he’s leaving Democrats no choice but to consider action.

“Every single day the president is making a case — he’s becoming self-impeachable, in terms of some of the things he’s doing,” Pelosi said.

Pelosi astutely noted that Trump doesn’t seem to care if he gets impeached. He might even see a political benefit in having Democrats investigate his tax returns, his finances, his involvement in hush-money payments to women and his attempts to stop the special counsel investigation into Russian election interference. The very existence of an investigation is being weaponized. In that climate, how is Congress supposed to get anything done?

[The 6 most potentially damaging congressional investigations into Trump]

Even the sole bipartisan investigation in Congress seems concerned about how the strong political currents will sweep up and muddy its facts.

The Senate Intelligence Committee has found a “mountain” of evidence about how Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election and could publicize its findings soon. The committee chairman, Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), told The Washington Post’s Karoun Demirjian that the panel’s report will have a lot more detail about Russia’s interference than Mueller shared. Though Burr hinted that the committee’s investigation does not implicate Trump’s campaign, he seemed worried that the delicate bipartisan findings will lose all nuance in the light of day.

“The tough thing is, everything that we’re going to report on already has a narrative,” Burr said.

Congress has always struggled to be taken at face value. It’s difficult for the public to untangle lawmakers’ intentions from their partisanship, because Congress is a political body. And it doesn’t help that the two times a president has been impeached, it has been by the opposite party.

But today’s House Democrats are struggling to navigate a particularly perfect storm of partisanship that makes their constitutionally mandated task of overseeing the executive branch especially difficult.

Trump has remade the Republican Party into an extremely loyal branch of, well, him. The same day that Pelosi made her remarks about impeachment and partisanship, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said on the Senate floor that any questions about Trump related to Russia and obstruction of justice should be “case closed,” ignoring the fact that Mueller suggested Congress should examine his findings. McConnell is also dunking his head in the sand about a legal assessment from more than 700 former federal prosecutors, Republican and Democratic, who signed a letter saying that Trump would have been charged with obstruction of justice were he not the president.

But in this Republican Party, loyalty to Trump is what helps you keep your job. So House Democrats must go it alone, which only adds to the perception that they are investigating Trump because he’s the opposition.

Then there’s the fact that the nation is a year and a half out from an election. Elections supercharge whatever politicization already exists, and this election is especially high stakes for congressional Democrats. They are trying to keep control of the House, battling Republicans for the Senate and desperately want to win the White House.

That means that even if Democrats wanted to impeach Trump, Trump can play the victim. He has before. Polls show that a majority of Americans could be sympathetic to him: They don’t want Congress to impeach Trump even if most think he lied.

So Democrats are stuck. Not impeaching Trump could forever cast them as the party that had a chance to punish a president who may have broken the law and backed off because they wanted to keep their jobs. But even considering impeaching Trump may cost many of them their jobs, in part because of how hyperpartisan today’s politics are. As Trump gives Congress more reasons to consider his impeachment, this dynamic appears to be weighing heavily on Pelosi."
"Administration announces additional 30,000 seasonal worker visas",https://www.cnn.com,['Geneva Sands'],05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/06/politics/seasonal-worker-visas/index.html,"(CNN) The Trump administration is making an additional 30,000 seasonal worker visas available for 2019, according to a joint rule published Monday by the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Labor.

The additional visas come on top of the visas already made available for the year.

The work visas, which allow employers to hire foreign workers for temporary, non-agricultural jobs, will only be available to workers who already received H-2B status in the past three fiscal years. Availability is also restricted to businesses who would ""suffer irreparable harm"" without the additional workers, US Citizenship and Immigration Services announced on Monday.

The increase was expected, as USCIS alerted Capitol Hill in April that it intended to make this decision and the rule would be forthcoming.

In March, a group of senators asked Homeland Security to raise the number of available visas above the 66,000 statutory annual cap. The demand for seasonal workers was ""so extreme"" this year that the Labor Department's website almost crashed, according to a letter sent to then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday defended Trump’s use of executive privilege to withhold U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s full report from House Democrats, but said it should not prevent Mueller from testifying before lawmakers.

In his first hearing since being sworn in as secretary, the Trump administration official frequently put the onus on lawmakers for responding to global warming. He said that while he believes in climate change, Congress has not directed him to respond to it.

Bernhardt told the committee that there are more than 600 instances in current laws where the secretary is directed that he or she “shall” do something. ADVERTISEMENT

“You know what there’s not – is a ‘shall’ for ‘I shall manage the land to stop climate change’ or something similar to that,” he said.

Bernhardt also discussed development of fossil fuels on public lands, saying he would not stop oil and gas development – including offshore drilling – without direction from Congress.

The Trump Cabinet official also clarified that his department will finish its five-year drilling plan, despite reports that it was indefinitely sidelined.

Bernhardt repeatedly emphasized that concerns from states would be paramount in making a determination at the federal level.

“I’m not aware of a single lease that was ever developed over the opposition of a state,” he said.

The list includes the exotic -- Romania gold coin, a dozen small gold-covered Zodiac figurines -- as well as the more quotidian -- an assortment of books, 24 avocados, a box of dates, some pens and bath soaps.

Ross, who has been caught napping during the president's speeches and during meetings, also received three bottles of instant coffee. And he's been presented with a ""giant-print"" reference Bible. Another gift giver settled on the classic choice of champagne - a 2006 bottle of Dom Perignon (which can be found online for about $130 to $150).

The gift list reveals hints of who, at home and abroad, may be trying to curry favor with Ross, who took office in February 2017.

The Commerce Department provided few details about who sent the gifts and their value, but some descriptions point to foreign governments in China, Thailand, Mexico, Canada, South Korea, Ghana, Uzbekistan, Japan, Kazakhstan, Colombia, Kuwait and United Arab Emirates.

Other gifts include an AmCham (American Chamber of Commerce) crystal business card holder, and a ""thumb drive with Secretary Ross speech and some other ceremony highlights from Tenaris Day."" Tenaris is a pipe supplier for oil and gas companies.

As Commerce Secretary, Ross plays a key role in crafting U.S. trade policy and amplifying American products and industries.

""Any of the gifts that indicate that they are made of gold or silver--that would suggest that they have some significant and intrinsic value,"" said Virginia Cantor, chief ethics counsel for the advocacy group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. ""You definitely need transparency in order to be able to determine whether it would present a potential conflict of interest.""

A Commerce Department spokesperson tells CBS News high-value gifts are appraised and sold, according to federal regulations on gifting limits.

Ross has previously faced criticism for financial disclosure inaccuracies and concerns about his compliance with conflict of interest laws.

The 81-year-old investor, known as the ""king of bankruptcy"" for his predilection for buying bankrupt companies, has also been lampooned as financially out-of-touch with most Americans, after suggesting in January furloughed federal workers should take out bank loans to pay their bills.

Though Ross has claimed he's a billionaire, Forbes removed him in 2017 from its list of billionaires after it said financial disclosure forms showed he had less than $700 million in assets."

At around 2:47 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to price, rose to 2.48%, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond climbed to 2.887%.

Wall Street's renewed anxiety over negotiations between Beijing and Washington began Sunday, when President Donald Trump tweeted that current 10% tariffs on $200 billion of goods imported from China will be increased to 25% on Friday.

Trump's weekend message — which at the time appeared to come without provocation — was preceded by a diplomatic document from China that included reversals that undermined key U.S. demands, Reuters reported Wednesday.

In each of the seven chapters of the draft trade deal, Beijing reportedly removed commitments to change laws to remedy theft of intellectual property, reneged on access to financial services, and deleted agreements on currency manipulation. High-level Chinese and U.S. officials will meet in Washington over the next two days in an attempt to reach a permanent solution and avoid the telegraphed tax increase.

Meanwhile, China's Commerce Ministry said later on Wednesday that Beijing will respond if the U.S. hikes tariffs to 25%.

""The escalation of trade friction is not in the interests of the people of the two countries and the people of the world,"" the ministry said. ""The Chinese side deeply regrets that if the US tariff measures are implemented, China will have to take necessary countermeasures."""

Green Mountain College

Vermont's ailing higher education sector has gotten a cash injection from an unlikely source: the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which has approved low-interest loans of $94.2 million to five private schools during the past six years.

The money doesn't guarantee a school's survival. Two colleges that received loans are shutting down, and it's unclear whether they'll repay Uncle Sam. The College of St. Joseph in Rutland, set to close this month, borrowed $2.4 million and still owes $1 million. Green Mountain College in Poultney, which will cease to operate shortly after its final commencement May 19, owes $19.5 million. The school's administration put its $20 million campus up as collateral for the loan.

Vermont Law School in South Royalton owes $17.7 million that it borrowed in 2018, the same year it slashed salaries and eliminated tenure for most of its professors in a bid to erase fiscal deficits.

Goddard College in Plainfield borrowed $2.1 million in 2016. The school's financial problems prompted its accreditor to put it on probation last fall.

Bennington College obtained the largest loan approval since 2013, a package worth more than $50 million.

The schools borrowed through the USDA Rural Development Community Facilities Programs, which have quietly become a national resource for financially stressed colleges. The USDA has awarded roughly $1.7 billion in the past three years in low-interest loans and grants to help rural schools improve facilities and reconsolidate higher-interest debt.

Paul Costello, executive director of the Vermont Council on Rural Development, said colleges bring multiple benefits to rural areas, and government support such as the USDA loans is important.

""A college brings youth, energy and vitality,"" he said. ""It brings well-educated faculty and staff ... and relatively good paying jobs. It brings street traffic in the downtown. It brings people interested in nightlife and entertainment, so it really lifts the spirits.""

But the loans have critics — especially among conservatives.

""The USDA should not be the lender of last resort, and that's kind of what's happening,"" said Daren Bakst, senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, a think tank in Washington, D.C. ""It's not the taxpayers' role to serve as a bailout to small, struggling colleges.""

Green Mountain College's situation shows that ""clearly the USDA did not do a very good job in determining whether or not this was a wise loan in the first place,"" Bakst added.

Green Mountain College announced in January that it would close. The disclosure came only nine months after it received cash from the loan, most of which was immediately used to pay off higher-interest debts. The infusion was meant to pull the school out of a financial tailspin, said Bob Allen, president of the college. Allen arrived at Green Mountain College in 2016 after a long career in business, including 25 years as a senior executive at the Vermont Country Store.

""I really thought I could be instrumental in turning this place around,"" Allen said glumly during an interview in his office on April 29.

At Vermont Law School, a USDA loan has helped right the ship, at least for now. Its president, Tom McHenry, said Vermont's only law school used its federal loan to pay off higher-interest debt to reduce payments. He expects the school to be in the black next year. ""The loan helped us tremendously,"" he told Seven Days. ""We are having no problem making the payments and, given our recent restructuring, we are in a much, much stronger financial situation.""

Bennington College, a small private institution with about 735 students, qualified in 2017 for financing totaling $52.6 million — a $47.6 million direct loan from USDA and a $5 million USDA-guaranteed loan through TD Bank. It, too, sought funds to pay off higher-interest debt; it also wanted to finance renovation of its centerpiece building, the Commons, in a bid to attract more students.

The USDA's agreement with Bennington calls for the feds to hand over the $47.6 million upon completion of the Commons project, scheduled for later this year. In the meantime, the college obtained bridge financing from the Vermont Economic Development Authority, its 2018 audit shows.

Bennington College president Mariko Silver would not comment on the loan or the health of the college. She announced on April 22 that she plans to leave the school in July to become president and CEO of the Henry Luce Foundation.

Jennifer Scott, president of the College of St. Joseph, did not return messages seeking comment, nor did Goddard College president Bernard Bull.

They chose not to answer the question: Should taxpayer money be used to underwrite these loans?

Borrowers do get vetted, first by USDA officials in Vermont, and then by their bosses in Washington, D.C., who make the final call. Vermont's congressional delegation cheers on some applications.

In 2017 for instance, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) signed a letter assuring U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue that Green Mountain College ""is an important educational institution and local employer in our state."" They explained that the loan it sought would consolidate its debts and save on interest.

Leahy deferred a request for comment to his spokesperson David Carle.

Carle noted via email that the loan was for refinancing. The USDA did not add to the school's debt and is attempting to help colleges deal with rising costs and declining student populations, he wrote.

But even with the financial restructuring, Green Mountain College remained in the red. Last month banners on campus still proclaimed that it's one of the top schools for sustainability programs.

""Calling yourself first in sustainability and then shutting down — how ironic,"" said sophomore Chriss Davis, a 21-year-old from Delaware, as she dismounted from a bicycle that pulled a trailer full of recycling and compost buckets, which she distributes for her campus work-study job.

Most of the 427 undergrads at the private college must transfer to new schools.

They'll have fewer choices in Vermont. In addition to Green Mountain College and the College of St. Joseph, Southern Vermont College in Bennington is shuttering. The closings will reduce the tally of Vermont colleges from 21 to 18.

That underscores a trend that imperils the state's higher education sector, which accounts for a sizable portion of the Vermont economy. A 2017 report from the Vermont Higher Education Council said colleges drew $1 billion in tuition annually, employed 11,000 people and boasted a payroll of $588 million. A declining number of high school grads in the Northeast has translated to steadily declining enrollment and deficits at numerous Vermont colleges.

College closures worry local officials, particularly in Poultney, where the impact could be economically ""devastating,"" Costello said. ""People are deeply concerned.""

Green Mountain College employs 150 people and has an annual $6.8 million payroll. The future of its campus — 22 buildings, including the prominent Ames Hall with its white pillared portico, as well 155 acres of land complete with a goat yard, pigpen and chicken coops — is not known.

Would the USDA foreclose on a small private college such as Green Mountain?

Jon Muise, Vermont area director for the USDA Rural Development program, would not comment. He referred questions to acting public information officer Megan Roush. She said the USDA would not speculate on ""hypothetical questions"" about a possible default.

State economic development leaders said temporary federal control of the campus could be a plus. The government would safeguard the interests of the community better than a private lender would, said Ted Brady, deputy secretary of the Vermont Agency of Commerce and Community Development. Brady knows the program well: He's a former Leahy staffer who has helped several colleges obtain the loans. He is also a former Vermont director for the USDA Rural Development program.

He recalled rare instances when smaller recipients, from daycare centers to ambulance squads, defaulted.

""The common practice then was that you try to recover as much of the loan and as much of the taxpayers' money as possible while still ensuring you're looking after the best interests of the community,"" Brady said.

Two groups have made overtures about acquiring part or all of the Poultney campus, including alumni who have banded together with a campaign called SaveGMC. But with closure imminent, no offer with viable funding has been made, Allen said. The college paid its first $635,000 installment on the loan and is not in default — thus far.

The USDA is already starting to act like a landlord, albeit a reluctant one.

""They are anxious. They encouraged us to put it on the market, which we've done,"" Allen said, noting that the campus is listed with real estate firm Colliers International.

Allen also said that with the USDA's cooperation, the college has contracted with a trustee to oversee the campus after July 1. Massachusetts accounting firm Verdolino & Lowey will help manage the property, Allen said. ""The concern in town is, as you could imagine, who's going to cut the grass and maintain the buildings while they are unoccupied.""

Students are counting down the final days with a mix of emotions. Davis feels frustrated; she transferred to Poultney five months before the closure announcement. ""No one knew,"" she said. ""I almost feel, like, lied to, in a way.""

Sophomore Shalako Sharp has no regrets about his time at Green Mountain College. ""I wanted to go to the mountains, somewhere beautiful, in nature,"" said the young man from Louisiana.

Grants covered most of his tuition and he found the professors ""amazing,'' including those in his renewable energy and ecological design major.

He's transferring to Prescott College in Arizona, which is one of nine ""teach out"" colleges that have agreed to accept Green Mountain College students. Sharp said he will move west feeling ""so happy that I came here. It's been the best experience of my life."""
Judge rules EPA must enforce Obama-era landfill pollution regs,https://thehill.com,[],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/442444-judge-rules-epa-must-enforce-obama-era-landfill-pollution-regs,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must begin enforcing pollution regulations that were set for landfills under the Obama administration.

Haywood Gilliam Jr., a U.S. district judge in Northern California, sided with California and seven other states late Monday, ordering the EPA to begin reviewing state plans for reducing pollution from landfills.

Landfills are the third largest source of methane pollution in the U.S., releasing the highly heat-trapping gas into the air as landfill contents decompose.

Gilliam said the EPA was long overdue in meeting its obligations and ordered the agency to review state proposals and begin promulgating regulations by fall.

“Once again, we’ve held the EPA accountable for its failure to perform its mandatory duties under the Clean Air Act, and for its unwillingness to protect public health,” California Attorney General Xavier Becerra Xavier BecerraOvernight Energy: Interior chief says climate response falls on Congress | Bernhardt insists officials will complete offshore drilling plans | Judge rules EPA must enforce Obama landfill pollution rules Judge rules EPA must enforce Obama-era landfill pollution regs Trump administration creates new religious, moral protections for health workers MORE (D) said in a statement. “We celebrate this ruling requiring EPA to fulfill its long-overdue mandatory duties to control emissions from landfills.”

An EPA spokesman said they would review the decision.

The agency quickly began reconsidering the Obama-era landfill guidelines shortly after President Trump Donald John TrumpDOJ threatens executive privilege over Mueller report if Dems carry out contempt vote Trump touts 'BIG FIREWORKS' returning to Mt. Rushmore for July 4 Trump taps ex-State spokeswoman Heather Nauert to help oversee White House fellowships MORE took office, announcing in May of 2017 that they would hold off on implementation while reviewing the rule.

In October of 2018, the agency again announced a delay, giving states until August of this year to submit their methane reduction plans.

Becerra argued the EPA had no legal basis for delaying implementation and enforcement of the regulation.

Gilliam, an Obama appointee, has sided against the Trump administration a number of times over the past two years, including Trump’s emergency declaration for the border wall and rollback of contraception requirements under the Affordable Care Act."
Mnuchin refuses to turn over Trump taxes to House Democrats,https://www.cnn.com,"['Donna Borak', 'Lauren Fox']",05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/06/politics/tax-returns-trump-congress-showdown/index.html,"(CNN) Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Monday denied a request from House Democrats for access to six years of President Donald Trump's personal tax returns.

""I am informing you now that the Department may not lawfully fulfill the Committee's request,"" Mnuchin wrote in his one-page letter, written in consultation with lawyers from the Department of Justice.

Mnuchin added that the Department of Justice would issue a formal legal opinion.

The denial comes after two missed deadlines by the Treasury secretary, who again in his letter said the request by House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal under an obscure statute of tax law is ""unprecedented,"" arguing it raises ""serious constitutional questions"" that could have dire consequences for taxpayer privacy.

Trump has refused to release his tax information, first as a candidate and now as president, breaking a precedent going back to Watergate.

The fight over Trump's tax returns is escalating just as the President has made increasingly clear that he expects his administration officials to fight requests from the opposing party Attorney General William Barr declined a Democratic request to testify last week in the House about special counsel Robert Mueller's report, a day after appearing in the Republican-controlled Senate.

An administration official familiar with the matter said the Trump administration is not backing down in the fight over the President's tax returns.

""It appears the Justice Department is prepared to litigate"" the matter in the courts if Neal goes that route, the official said.

Neal said in a statement Monday that he was still determining next steps.

""Today, Secretary Mnuchin notified me that the IRS will not provide the documents I requested under Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code,"" Neal said. ""I will consult with counsel and determine the appropriate response.""

The committee chairman could issue a subpoena on top of his request, or Democrats could move to hold the Treasury Secretary or IRS Commissioner for whom the original request was addressed to in contempt of Congress.

Some Democrats made clear Monday that they are eager to escalate, citing the Mueller report as well as the conviction of Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen.

""On a day when his former fixer heads to jail and his current fixer heads the Department of Justice, President Trump obstructs both Mueller and his tax returns from speaking for themselves,"" Texas Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett said in a statement. ""We need immediate legal action. We cannot allow this bad president to set bad precedent.""

The top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, Texas Rep. Kevin Brady, applauded the decision not to turn over Trump's returns.

""After consulting with the Justice Department the Treasury Department has come to the firm conclusion that we have known since day one: this request from House Democrats to weaponize the tax code for purely political reasons is illegitimate and should be treated as such,"" Brady said in a statement. ""This politically motivated abuse of the law violates our Constitution -- and serves no legislative purpose. Abusing the tax writing Committee's authority to go after a political enemy sets a dangerous precedent, and the Administration is right not to go along with it.""

Democrats initially directed their request to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig , the only person with the legal authority to turn over the returns, but Mnuchin has interceded twice in the matter, citing his role overseeing the federal tax collector.

Mnuchin said in April he would deliver a response by May 6.

The Justice Department has declined to comment on the matter.

The fight over the request may ultimately to lead to a court fight -- which would be a rare example of Congress suing the executive branch for information. The Trump administration is already stonewalling other Democratic committee chairman on everything from the Mueller report to interviews with former White House counsel Don McGahn.

Neal made his initial ask for Trump's tax information on April 3 after a months-long deliberation with staff, committee members and House lawyers.

He also sent a follow-up letter demanding that Treasury comply with the request no later than April 23. But Treasury missed the deadlines, a strategy Democrats have argued was an effort to delay the process

Democrats on the tax-writing committee have argued that they have the ability to request Trump's personal tax information under an obscure statute that permits three people to request personal tax information of any individual: the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, the Senate Finance Committee chairman and the chief of staff for the Joint Committee on Taxation.

The statute says that the secretary of the Treasury ""shall furnish"" it.

The statute has been used by Congress before, including in the Republican investigation under President Barack Obama into whether the IRS was discriminating against conservative groups applying for non-profit status. Requests for information using the law are also made on a regular basis for research purposes.

Neal has argued that he needs Trump's taxes in order to conduct oversight of the IRS's presidential audit program to both understand how the IRS is using the program and to see if the program needs to be codified into law.

But Mnuchin has asserted the ""unprecedented"" request raises ""serious constitutional issues"" that could have dire consequences for taxpayer privacy and has consulted with the Justice Department on the matter.

The Treasury secretary has also raised concerns that setting such a precedent could be ""potentially weaponizing"" the IRS.

The Massachusetts Democrat has previously indicated that defying his request would be interpreted as noncompliance and lead to an escalation of a standoff between the Trump administration and House Democrats.

""It is not the proper function of the IRS, Treasury or Justice to question or second guess the motivations of the committee or its reasonable determinations regarding its need for the requested tax returns and return information,"" Neal wrote to Rettig in response to the missed deadline on April 23. ""Please know that if you fail to comply, your failure will be interpreted as a denial of my request.""

In interviews last month, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney told Fox News that there was no world in which Democrats would get the President's tax returns.

Democrats are up against a barrage of denied requests from the administration, forcing leadership into tough decisions about what oversight priorities are worth pursuing in court.

House Democrats are lodged in an all-out-battle with the Department of Justice after the agency refused to hand over an unredacted Mueller report by Wednesday's deadline. That was despite a subpoena from House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler. Nadler has said he plans to hold the Attorney General in contempt of Congress if the report is not turned over in upcoming days.

Trump's personal lawyers also sued last week to block banks and an accounting firm from turning over Trump's financial records to the House Financial Services, House Intelligence and House Oversight Committees, a move that has led some Democratic chairs to question what the President has to hide.

""Whether it is refusing to sit down in an interview with Mueller or whether it is constantly obstructing justice by trying to stop testimonies and stop people from cooperating, whether it is filing a lawsuit, he obviously has something to hide,"" House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters said last week.

Waters's committee has subpoenaed at least 9 financial institutions with ties to the President.

""He's obviously afraid that we are going to learn more about his relationships with Deutsche Bank, more about his bank records, perhaps, more about whether or not there is money laundering that has been involved in some ways. We have enough information and we have enough to help us to guide us moving forward to help us with these subpoenas,"" Waters said."
"WV MetroNews Manchin, Collins urge DOJ to drop support of Obamacare lawsuit",http://wvmetronews.com,['Alex Thomas'],05-07-2019,2019,5,http://wvmetronews.com/2019/05/07/manchin-collins-urge-doj-to-drop-support-of-obamacare-lawsuit/,"By Alex Thomas in News | May 07, 2019 at 9:52PM

CHARLESTON, W.Va. — Two U.S. senators on Tuesday asked Attorney General William Barr for the Justice Department to drop its support of a ruling on the constitutionality of the federal health care law.

West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin and Maine Republican Susan Collins sent a letter to Barr as former President Barack Obama’s healthcare law faces a challenge from a coalition of states and the Trump administration that could mean the end of the Affordable Care Act.

“Overturning the ACA will put millions of Americans and hundreds of thousands of West Virginians and Mainers at risk of losing their health insurance, including thousands of our constituents who gained health insurance through the Medicaid expansion, and thousands more who gained insurance through the ACA exchanges,” the senators said.

“With so much at stake, we urge you and the administration to reconsider this position and to defend the consumer protections for seniors, young adults, women, children, and working families.”

Judge Reed O’Connor of the District Court for the Northern District of Texas ruled in December against “Obamacare” because of its individual mandate, which required people to purchase health insurance. O’Connor said the provision, which Congress eliminated in the 2017 tax law, was essential to the healthcare law.

A coalition of states including West Virginia is arguing against the law’s legal standing. Then-Maine Gov. Paul LePage, a Republican, signed onto the lawsuit last year, yet then-state Attorney General Janet Mills declined further involvement. Mills, a Democrat, became governor in January.

The Justice Department in March came out in support of affirming O’Connor’s ruling.

Manchin and Collins told Barr millions of Americans would be at risk of losing their insurance coverage if the law is struck down, including people with pre-existing conditions and individuals who gained insurance coverage through state Medicaid expansion programs.

“It is also alarming that in the midst of the devastating opioid epidemic, millions of Americans suffering from substance use disorders would lose access to the treatment that they need to recover. It is no exaggeration to say that this is a matter of life and death to many of these Americans,” the senators wrote.

According to Manchin, around 800,000 West Virginians have a pre-existing condition. The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources tweeted Monday less than 156,000 West Virginians are enrolled in the state’s Medicaid expansion program.

Other individuals who would be at risk of losing their insurance coverage includes young people still on their parents’ insurance plans.

“Congress can work together to fix legislatively the parts of the law that aren’t working, but we must not let this flawed court decision stand and devastate millions of seniors, young adults, women, children, and working families,” Manchin and Collins added. “We urge the administration and the Department of Justice to reconsider the decision not to defend the critical consumer protections that have provided healthcare to millions of Americans around the country.”

Over the last year, Manchin has led multiple Democratic attempts to get the Senate Legal Counsel to intervene in the lawsuit. Manchin and Collins in 2017 opposed attempts to repeal and replace the health care law, but Collins backed a proposal giving states the option to operate under the statute.

Collins voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, while Manchin opposed the legislation.

Both senators voted in February to confirm Barr as attorney general.

Manchin told MetroNews last month he plans to introduce with Collins a bill funding a reinsurance program for high-cost individuals. Collins previously backed a similar proposal with Florida Democrat Bill Nelson, who lost his reelection bid in the 2018 election cycle.

The state coalition and the Trump administration last week submitted briefs to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans supporting O’Connor’s ruling."
Justice Department releases redacted Mueller report — again,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice-department-releases-redacted-mueller-report-again,"The Justice Department released a second copy of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Monday evening, following a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by BuzzFeed and the Electronic Privacy and Information Center.

The lightly-redacted version of Mueller's report appears to be identical to the 448-page document that was released in April, except it sheds more light on the redactions by explaining why the blacked-out information is exempted from release under FOIA.

Democrats in Congress are threatening to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt for declining to provide them with an unredacted version of the report, and this successful move by BuzzFeed and EPIC may make it easier for their battle for the full report to move forward in federal court.

Along with the report itself, the Justice Department included a letter from senior counsel Vanessa Brinkman addressed to BuzzFeed reporter Jason Leopold, who had filed a FOIA request for the report back on March 21, 2019. Brinkman said the Office of Information Policy had processed the Mueller report under FOIA and had made it available on the Justice Department website. Brinkman also said she had “determined that the Report is appropriate for release with excisions” and listed the different reasons for redactions, including exemptions related to: protecting sources and methods, safeguarding law enforcement techniques, shielding ongoing law enforcement proceedings, keeping grand jury testimony confidential, ensuring deliberative process privilege, avoiding invasions of privacy, and ensuring a fair trial.

One example of how the latest version of Mueller's report adds a bit more clarity to the redaction process can be seen by comparing the short overview section on “Russian Hacking Operations” early in the document. In the originally released version, a few lines in the WikiLeaks section are said to be redacted due to “Harm to Ongoing Matter.” But in the version released Monday, DOJ explains those sentences are blacked out due to exemptions “(b)(6), (b)(7)(A), (b)(7)(B), (b)(7)(C)”, which are related to improper disclosures of information, interference with enforcement proceedings, deprivation of the right to fair trial, and invasion of privacy respectively.

Leopold tweeted earlier in the day: “We intend to challenge all of the redactions.”

Mueller wrapped up the Russia investigation in March and the DOJ released a redacted version of his report in mid-April. The report showed Mueller's team did not find sufficient evidence showing criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin during the 2016 election. Mueller did not, however, clear Trump of obstruction of justice. Barr says he determined there is insufficient evidence to prove an obstruction crime, but Democrats argue Mueller's report, which outlines 10 instances of possible obstruction, leaves it up to Congress to investigate and decide.

Just days before Mueller's report was released the first time, the judge in the FOIA case appeared to be sympathetic to the arguments being made by BuzzFeed, leveling critiques at what he seemed to see as the secrecy being practiced by the Justice Department. ”Obviously there is a real concern about whether there will be transparency … I hope that the government will be as transparent as it can be,"" said Judge Reggie Walton of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

Taking aim at Barr directly, Walton said, “The Attorney General has created an environment that has caused a significant part of the American public to be concerned about whether there will be full transparency.” The release of the redacted report is just the beginning of this litigation, and the case will likely continue moving forward in federal court shortly.

The same night the Justice Department released this second version of the Mueller report, the Justice Department was also engaged in a high-profile back-and-forth with the Democrat-run House Judiciary Committee over the department's refusal to turn over an unredacted version of the report.

Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., released a statement late Monday evening saying, “I am pleased that the Department of Justice has agreed to meet with my staff tomorrow — and not Wednesday afternoon, as originally proposed by DOJ.”

“It remains vital that the Committee obtain access to the full, unredacted report and the underlying materials,” Nadler said. “At the moment, our plans to consider holding Attorney General Barr accountable for his failure to comply with our subpoena still stand.”

Earlier in the day, Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said, “The Department remains willing to accommodate Congress’s legitimate needs, but must do so consistent with the law.”"

Columnist

Teenagers, known for their immaturity, need stable adult guidance. The Department of Homeland Security is no different.

But like children shuffled among a succession of foster parents, the department, still in its teens, has been hampered by a chronic lack of steady leadership. Currently, numerous top positions — including secretary, deputy secretary and three of four undersecretary slots — have no confirmed appointees.

Vacancies among the political appointees who set policy for the third-largest department is an old and continuing story. What a House hearing revealed is just how damaging the many openings can be for the department’s work and its employees.

Just 47 percent of key department slots are filled with confirmed appointees, according to the Political Appointee Tracker published by The Washington Post and the Partnership for Public Service. Only Interior is worse, at 41 percent, among Cabinet-level agencies.

The Department of Homeland Security started as a jumbled mess when it began operations in 2003, in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. It was forged from 22 separate agencies “into a unified, integrated Department,” at least according to its website.

A more realistic view comes from John Roth, the department’s former inspector general. As the 2014-2017 independent watchdog within the agency, Roth had a prime perch to observe the department’s workings and inefficiencies.

“In the best of times, DHS is an unruly and difficult-to-manage organization,” Roth told the House Committee on Homeland Security on Wednesday. “We are not in the best of times. The nature and extent of senior leadership vacancies in the department is cause for concern, as such pervasive vacancies significantly hamper the department’s ability to carry out its all-important mission.”

Chairman Bennie G. Thompson (D-Miss.) called the session to examine the question in the hearing’s title: “Trouble at the Top: Are Vacancies at the Department of Homeland Security Undermining the Mission?”

Comments by Roth and others left no doubt that the answer is yes.

After examining the root causes of the department’s “persistent shortfalls,” Roth pointed to poor unity of effort.

“DHS has demonstrated an inability to mesh divergent components, with different histories, cultures, and missions, into a single agency with a unity of effort,” he said. “Too often, the components operated as stand-alone entities or, worse, in competition with each other. Knitting together a unified DHS with all components pulling together to protect our homeland security is a top challenge of the department and requires strong and committed leadership and oversight. This goal is thwarted by the pervasive senior leadership vacancies.”

The shortfalls are widespread, he said, touching “nearly every area of the department,” including:

· Personnel management and morale — Since inception, “DHS has suffered poor employee morale and a dysfunctional work environment.” While morale has improved, the department ranks last among large agencies in employment engagement scores calculated in the Best Places to Work in the Federal Government report.

· Acquisition management — “Most of DHS major acquisition programs continue to cost more than expected, take longer to deploy than planned, or deliver less capability than promised.”

· Grants management, particularly at the department’s Federal Emergency Management Agency, which “does a fairly poor job of ensuring that the money is not wasted. We believed the cause to be a failure of leadership within and oversight over FEMA, in addition to structural and systemic issues inherent in the program.”

These and other problems are exacerbated by “a lack of personnel within the departmental leadership offices to focus on and address overarching issues,” Roth said.

Despite a bevy of problems, Gene L. Dodaro, who directs the Government Accountability Office (GAO) as comptroller general of the United States, said DHS “has made important progress in strengthening its management functions.” On April 19, however, he sent DHS a 19-page letter, including an enclosure, “detailing 26 open recommendations that GAO believes warrant the highest priority personal attention from the department and its components.”

But personal attention from whom? The letter was sent to Kevin K. McAleenan, the acting secretary, who is surrounded by other temporary actors.

“Current vacancies in top leadership positions could pose a challenge to addressing high-risk areas and priority recommendations that span DHS’s diverse missions,” Dodaro said, “which include preventing terrorism and enhancing security, managing our borders, administering immigration laws, securing cyberspace, and responding to disasters.”

Despite the claim of “a unified, integrated Department,” Roth said the department’s “vast law enforcement enterprise … does not work together as a unified organization … time and again we saw the law enforcement agencies operating independently without the necessary oversight and no real effort to compel coordination.”

In a well-functioning bureaucracy, officials in the secretary’s office and the deputy secretary’s office would corral problems like these. Unfortunately, Roth said those offices “are simply too thinly staffed to be able to even be aware of, much less effectively manage, the significant and varied issues that face DHS.”

Thompson blamed the White House for the current lack of department leadership, saying President Trump “has decimated the leadership ranks of his own Department of Homeland Security.""

“In recent weeks alone, President Trump has: dismissed Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen; circumvented the law by forcing Acting Deputy Secretary and Undersecretary for Management Claire Grady to resign so he could install Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan as acting secretary; asked Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Administrator David Pekoske to serve as deputy secretary while also running TSA; and pulled the nomination of Ronald Vitiello for Immigration and Customs Enforcement director, prompting his resignation,” Thompson said in his opening statement.

“In addition to the secretary and deputy secretary vacancies, at least 12 other critical positions across the department’s key components and offices are operating without permanent leadership. The president has failed to nominate anyone to fill most of these vacancies, even though many have been held by acting officials for the entirety of the Trump administration. Moreover, there are another 50 senior leadership positions vacant throughout the department, including those tasked with overseeing the daily operations of DHS.

“This chaos appears to be by design,” Thompson added, “orchestrated by a president who wants to be able to remove the department’s leadership on a whim.”

The White House and DHS did not respond to requests for comments. Rep. Mike D. Rogers (Ala.), the committee’s ranking member, and other Republicans on the panel pointed out that the department also had vacancies during the Obama administration. The big difference, of course, is Obama’s Democrats did not run the Senate for most of his administration. Republicans now control the White House and the Senate, which confirms presidential nominees.

“Management vacancies, mismanagement and poor employee morale have plagued the Department of Homeland Security since it was created … ” Rogers said. “Every day, DHS employees do an exceptional job carrying out their critical missions. No one should blame the men and women of DHS for problems Congress has allowed to fester.”

"As EPA stalls, 43 states have water sites contaminated with toxic chemicals",https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/water-toxic-chemicals-pfas-states-2f68b1c6b7f3/,"Toxic chemicals found in nonstick cooking pans and other household items have contaminated more than 600 water sources across at least 43 states, according to a new report, with Michigan by far the most impacted.

The findings underscore the wider water crisis facing the United States and are likely to increase pressure on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to enact stricter limits on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), toxic chemicals that can increase the risk of cancer and other severe health problems.

New analysis published Monday by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) and Northeastern University finds that 610 water sources across the country contain PFAS. The water systems include drinking water sources that serve upwards of 19 million people, along with military and industrial sites, dumps, and airports. PFAS itself is found in everything from firefighting foam to rain jackets.

Using data from sources including the federal Safe Drinking Water Information System and the Pentagon, the authors mapped the nationwide prevalence of PFAS. The version released Monday reflects an updated map — the last version was released in July 2018 and found 172 contaminated sites in 40 states. And it is likely that the new report still doesn’t account for many contaminated sites around the country.

“We believe the locations shown on our map may be only the tip of a toxic iceberg,” said Bill Walker, EWG vice president and editor in chief, in an email to ThinkProgress.

CREDIT: EWG

Michigan, a state grappling with ongoing water crises, stands out as the most severely impacted state. The updated map identifies 192 contaminated sites in Michigan alone, the vast majority of which are drinking water sources.

An ongoing lead contamination crisis in Flint, Michigan, is the state’s most well-known water problem. The city’s residents say that five years after their water first became contaminated, they are still experiencing health impacts associated with Flint’s water, like rashes and headaches. But PFAS has also become a problem in the state — last July, two communities in Kalamazoo County were given bottled water after their drinking source was found to contain dangerously high levels of the chemicals.

Under scrutiny over water issues in the aftermath of Flint, state officials have been hard at work testing the water for chemicals in an effort to identify the scope of the PFAS problem. That work has been critical; EWG credited a multi-agency effort overseen by the state as helping to identify impacted areas. Michigan environmental officials have said there may be as many as 11,000 PFAS-contaminated sites in the state.

According to the new report, California comes in second after Michigan with 47 known sites, while New Jersey is third with 43 sites. But Walker of EWG told ThinkProgress that without efforts like those underway in Michigan, gauging the full scale of the problem is a challenge.

“Most other states have not conducted the kind of comprehensive multi-agency detection effort that Michigan has,” he said.

For years, communities in states like West Virginia and Pennsylvania have struggled with staggering cancer rates and other health problems, trends residents now link to PFAS exposure. They have repeatedly lobbied for the EPA to act and several told ThinkProgress in March that they feel the agency is not doing enough — even as EPA officials argue the agency is taking the crisis seriously.

In February, then-Acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler unveiled an “action plan” to tackle PFAS following more than two decades of alarm from impacted communities. But Wheeler’s announcement failed to establish a Maximum Containment Level (MCL) for PFAS in drinking water, something advocates say is critical to addressing the crisis. Currently, the agency has a non-enforceable health advisory level of 70 parts per trillion that applies to only two types of PFAS: PFOA and PFOS. Health experts have said that PFAS chemicals could pose a risk to humans at much lower levels.

Moreover, a draft of interim recommendations for PFAS cleanup released in April was panned by EWG and other groups as “woefully inadequate,” in no small part because it relies on the 70 parts per trillion guidance. The recommendations also do not legally require the Pentagon or the chemical industry to clean up contaminated sites. According to the Defense Department, at least 126 military bases have reported possibly harmful PFAS levels, and EWG identifies 117 military sites on its map. Chemical companies like DuPont are meanwhile associated with mass-PFAS contamination in areas like Parkersburg, West Virginia.

EPA testing has also historically set a level for detection that EWG says is too high. According to Walker, “more than 100 million Americans could have PFAS in their water supplies” if the detection level reflected the lower points at which studies have show averse health effects to occur.

It is unclear when or if the EPA will address such discrepancies. Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-PA) last week introduced a bill that would require the agency to create a drinking water standard for all PFAS chemicals. But the bill would give the EPA two years to do so — a timeline unlikely to appease communities currently struggling with contamination."
"New York attorney general sues Trump Treasury, IRS",https://thehill.com,[],05-06-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/finance/442315-new-york-attorney-general-sues-trump-treasury-irs,"New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) on Monday filed a lawsuit against the Treasury Department and IRS, arguing that the agencies have failed to respond to information requests about their guidance reducing donor disclosure requirements for certain tax-exempt groups.

""My office depends on these critical donor disclosure forms to be able to adequately oversee non-profit organizations in New York,"" said James, who filed the suit alongside New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal (D).

“Not only was this policy change made without notice, the Treasury and the IRS are now refusing to comply with the law to release information about the rationale for these changes. No one is above the law — not even the federal government — and we will use every tool to ensure they comply with these regulations to provide transparency and accountability.""

The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, is the latest example of Democratic state attorneys general suing the Trump administration. James just took office at the beginning of the year and has quickly made it clear that she's going to aggressively pursue legal action against the president's business dealings and policies.

Treasury and the IRS in July released guidance that eliminates a requirement for certain tax-exempt groups to provide the names and addresses of major donors on annual forms. Groups that no longer have to include this information on forms include 501(c)(4) social welfare organizations such as the National Rifle Association and American Civil Liberties Union, labor unions and chambers of commerce.

The Trump administration and many congressional Republicans have said that the guidance helps to protect taxpayers' privacy and prevent taxpayers for being targeted for their political beliefs.

But Democrats in Congress have criticized the guidance, saying that it makes it easier for foreign governments to influence U.S. politics through donations to ""dark money"" groups.

In October, the New York and New Jersey attorneys general filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request asking for information about the origins and development of the guidance. They noted that the guidance has a direct impact on state filing requirements for tax-exempt groups operating in their states.

The IRS so far has only partially produced the information that the attorneys general have requested. The attorneys general haven't had any independent communication with Treasury's FOIA office since October, according to the lawsuit.

The New York and New Jersey attorneys general are asking the court to order Treasury and the IRS to promptly disclose all records that are relevant to the FOIA requests.

An IRS spokesman declined to comment on the lawsuit because it's pending litigation."
