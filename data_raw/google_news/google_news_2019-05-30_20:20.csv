"Trump Tweets, and Then Retracts, Statement That Russia Helped Him Get Elected",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Peter Baker', 'Eileen Sullivan']",05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/30/us/politics/trump-russia-help-elected.html,"After two years of investigation, Mr. Mueller reported that he could not establish any illegal conspiracy between Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russia, but he ratified the findings of the intelligence agencies that Moscow made an aggressive effort to tilt the election in Mr. Trump’s favor.

Mr. Trump has been reluctant to fully embrace the intelligence agencies’ findings that Russia was behind the 2016 election interference, but he has consistently argued that he alone was responsible for his unexpected victory. The “Russia hoax,” Mr. Trump has argued, is one fabricated by Democrats who are angry they lost the White House.

The president’s contradictory statements came a day after Mr. Mueller spoke publicly for the first time about his investigation’s findings. The president and his critics had conflicting interpretations about Mr. Mueller’s brief remarks — Mr. Trump and his supporters took them to mean “case closed,” while his critics saw them as a call to impeachment.

During his encounter with reporters outside the White House and in subsequent Twitter posts, Mr. Trump revived personal attacks on Mr. Mueller, asserting that the special counsel should never have been chosen for that position — he was “highly conflicted” — and had failed to get the job he really wanted, F.B.I. director, an accusation addressed and countered in Mr. Mueller’s final report. Mr. Mueller, who previously served as F.B.I. director in two administrations, did not go to the White House looking for a job, Stephen K. Bannon, who was one of the president’s senior advisers at the time, told investigators.

Mr. Bannon, the report said, “recalled telling the president that the purported conflicts were ‘ridiculous’ and that none of them was real or could come close to justifying precluding Mueller from serving as special counsel.” Donald F. McGahn II, who was then Mr. Trump’s White House counsel, likewise considered the supposed conflicts to be “silly” and hardly disqualifying, according to the report."
Trump weighs plan to choke off asylum for Central Americans,https://www.politico.com,"['Ian Kullgren', 'Ted Hesson', 'Anita Kumar']",05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/asylum-restrictions-trump-central-america-1489012,"Central American migrants are detained by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agents at the border wall in Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua state, Mexico, on May 7. | Herika Martinez/AFP/Getty Images immigration Trump weighs plan to choke off asylum for Central Americans The draft proposal would deny asylum to thousands of migrants waiting just south of the border.

President Donald Trump is considering sweeping restrictions on asylum that would effectively block Central American migrants from entering the U.S., according to several administration officials and advocates briefed on the plan.

A draft proposal circulating among Trump’s Homeland Security advisers would prohibit migrants from seeking asylum if they have resided in a country other than their own before coming to the U.S., according to a DHS official and an outside advocate familiar with the plan.

If executed, it would deny asylum to thousands of migrants waiting just south of the border, many of whom have trekked a perilous journey through Mexico.

Trump alluded to the asylum changes Thursday as he departed for Colorado, telling reporters he is “going to do something very dramatic on the border"" and would announce it in a ""big league statement.""

""It will be a statement having to do with the border and having to do with people illegally coming over the border,"" he said. ""And it will be my biggest statement, so far, on the border. We have brought something to the light of the people. They see now it's a national emergency, and most people agree.""

Trump said he would not be closing the border as he has threatened numerous times. ""The asylum procedures are ridiculous,"" he said. ""No place in the world has what we have in terms of ridiculous immigration laws.""

The White House did not respond to questions about the president’s remarks but two people familiar with the proposal said he was referring to asylum changes.

Immigration advocates familiar with the proposal expressed alarm at its scope, even as they questioned whether it would hold up in court. U.S. law allows refugees to request asylum when they arrive on U.S. soil but has long included an exemption for those who have already emigrated to a safe country.

""This decision will cause a chain reaction — Central Americans who are fleeing for their lives being forced back into the burning house they are escaping,"" said Pili Tobar, deputy director of America’s Voice, an immigration advocacy group. ""A rational approach ... is to treat this like the regional refugee crisis that it is and bolster our asylum and refugee process instead of slamming the door shut with a childish hope that migrants will not come or conditions causing them to flee will get better on their own.""

The move could reach beyond Central America, affecting asylum seekers in other parts of the world, according to an activist who has been briefed on the issue.

Trump, frustrated with his administration's inability to halt the tide of immigrants at the southern border, has orchestrated a major staffing shakeup at the Homeland Security Department to get tougher on the issue.

His new acting Homeland Security Secretary, Kevin McAleenan, just returned from a trip to Guatemala where he urged officials to try to stop the flow of migrants leaving the Central American country.

While the details of the new restrictions are still in flux, many migrants have been held up by Trump‘s “remain in Mexico” policy that forces asylum seekers to stay in Mexico while their asylum requests are pending.

“It’s unbelievably extreme to try to inhibit anyone who comes through another country in their quest for asylum,” said Kerri Talbot, the federal advocacy director for Immigration Hub, an advocacy group for migrants. “It basically means it would block all Central Americans from coming to the U.S.”

While Trump aides believe they can make the changes through an administrative rule, they are also seeking a legislative fix that would be far less vulnerable to a court challenge. Similar language is included in Trump’s emerging immigration bill that boosts security at the southern border and pushes the nation to admit more high-skilled, well-educated immigrants, rather than immigrants who enter the U.S. based on family ties, according to two people familiar with the proposal.

White House staff, including Ja’Ron Smith and Theodore Wold — both special assistants to the president for domestic policy — briefed Republican senators' offices on the proposed legislation Wednesday, according to a person familiar with the meeting. The White House expects to release the legislation in the coming days.

Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which has pushed to restrict asylum claims, said the administration has been looking for ways to make the changes for some time.

“People don’t have a right to pick and choose where they ask for asylum,” he said.

The proposal has been considered in the past by Republicans. It was included in a wide-ranging immigration House bill last year that was killed."

""I don't know what happened. I wasn't involved. I would not have done that,"" Trump told ABC News Senior Washington Correspondent Terry Moran. ""I was very angry with John McCain because he killed health care. I was not a big fan of John McCain in any way, shape or form.""

Later, asked if he or the White House should apologize for the directive, the president said he can't apologize because he didn't know anything about it and doesn't know who did it.

""I can't because I didn't know anything about it,"" Trump tells @KFaulders when asked if he should apologize for U.S.S. John McCain directive.

""We'll probably find out who did they thought they were doing me a favor because they know I'm not a fan of John McCain. John McCain killed health care for the Republican party and he killed health care for the nation.""

Earlier, on an overseas trip, acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan said he would never dishonor the name of a great American patriot like Sen. McCain.

""I never authorized, I never approved any action around the movement or activity regarding that ship. Furthermore, I would never dishonor the memory of a great American patriot like Senator McCain. I also think it’s important, I’d never disrespect the young men and women that crew that ship. I’ve asked my chief of staff to look into the matter.”

On ABC's ""The View,"" Meghan McCain, the late senator's daughter, defended her father's legacy and said that Trump's actions have affected her grieving process.

""It's a bizarre way to say goodbye,"" she said. ""It is weaponizing his legacy.""

“The president’s actions have consequences and when you repeatedly are attacking my father and war heroes it creates a culture in the military where people are clearly fearful to show my father’s name in one way or another,” she said. “ And that, I think, that is what has started this chain of events and actions.”

“I don’t blame the people in the military” McCain said. “I have nothing but respect for people who serve.”

“You’re putting people in the military in horrific situations, they’re fearful of their jobs,” she added. “If, God forbid, you’re a sailor on this ship you think there’s going to be some retribution and I think it’s horrible. I think it’s bad as Americans and I think we really have to look at the kind of culture that’s being put in place.”

“It’s impossible to go through the grief process when my father, who has been dead 10 months, is constantly in the news cycle because the president is so obsessed with the fact that he’s never going to be a great man like he was,” McCain said to applause from the audience.

Cher won't apologize for implying she wants Donald Trump to be sexually assaulted in prison in deleted tweet,https://www.foxnews.com,['Tyler Mccarthy'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/cher-deletes-tweet-donald-trump-sexually-assault,"Cher admitted that a tweet in which she implied she wanted Donald Trump to be sexually assaulted in prison went a bit too far.

The 73-year-old singer is never shy about posting her unfiltered thoughts on Donald Trump and the Republican party. Cher was one of the slew of celebrities calling for the president’s impeachment in the wake of Robert Mueller’s first public statement about the Russia investigation. However, she removed a tweet that she later claimed was a little much.

CHER SLAMS DONALD TRUMP JR., IVANKA TRUMP AS 'NOT WORTH A DAMN' IN FIERY TWEET

According to Yahoo Celebrity, the Oscar-winner wrote in a since-deleted tweet that she would love to see Trump thrown out of office, locked in jail and “Toy Boy Big Bubba.” The line seemed to suggest that she wanted to see the president assaulted.

Fortunately, Cher wrote a follow-up tweet explaining why she took down the first, but stopped short of apologizing for her language.

“This is Not Apology,It’s a Cher ‘wtf Moment’.Dont Usually Delete My Twts,But Sometimes I Need 2 Check Myself.What I Thought Of As Stupid Joke’On Paper’,Went 2 Far.Think trump Belongs In Jail,but Big Bubba Joke Was Wrong.If I Twt,I Have a Responsibility. THERES IS A LINE NOT 2,” she wrote.

Opinions are split on Cher’s explanation with some Twitter users slamming the star for her rhetoric and others praising her for censoring herself. It’s a rare moment of self-reflection for the star, whose tweets got the attention of Trump last month.

The star called the president an “ignorant thug” in an attempt to reject praise he gave her on a different post in which she implied the city of Los Angeles is overlooking its homeless veterans in an effort to focus on immigration issues.

Trump fixates on IQ as a measure of self-worth,https://www.politico.com,"['Andrew Restuccia', 'Natasha Bertrand']",05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/donald-trump-iq-intelligence-1347149,"“Sorry losers and haters, but my I.Q. is one of the highest -and you all know it! Please don't feel so stupid or insecure, it's not your fault,” Donald Trump tweeted in 2013. | Alex Wong/Getty Images white house Trump fixates on IQ as a measure of self-worth People who know Trump suspect his IQ obsession stems in part from a desire to project an image of success, despite scattered business failings and allegations of incompetence.

It was January 2004 and Donald Trump was on the “Today Show” to promote a new reality TV series called “The Apprentice.”

Almost immediately after the interview began, Trump started bragging about the unparalleled intellect of the contestants who would compete for a job at one of his companies.

Story Continued Below

“These are 16 brilliant people. I mean, they have close to 200 IQs, all of them,” he told host Matt Lauer. “And some may be beautiful and some may not be beautiful. But everybody has an incredible brain.”

It wasn’t the first time Trump fixated on IQ as a measure of a person’s worth — or, as is frequently the case, worthlessness. And it wouldn’t be the last. Fifteen years later, Trump, now president of the United States, still uses IQ as a shorthand for intelligence, dividing the people in his orbit into winners and losers.

In private, according to interviews with a half-dozen people close to him, Trump frequently asserts that people he likes have genius-level IQs. At various points during his presidency, he’s told aides that Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson and Apple CEO Tim Cook are high-IQ individuals, for example, former White House officials said. Trump has also dubbed himself a “very stable genius” on multiple occasions.

And the president is quick to accuse his political enemies of having low IQs, as he did when he repeated North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un’s criticism of former Vice President Joe Biden, one of his leading Democratic challengers.

“I was actually sticking up for Sleepy Joe Biden while on foreign soil. Kim Jong Un called him a ‘low IQ idiot,’ and many other things, whereas I related the quote of Chairman Kim as a much softer ‘low IQ individual,’” Trump said Tuesday after the Biden campaign criticized him for tweeting during his trip to Japan that he smiled when Kim insulted Biden’s intelligence.

While the exact reason for Trump’s IQ obsession is difficult to nail down, people who know him suspect it stems in part from his desire to project an image of success and competence, despite scattered business failings and repeated allegations from critics that he’s incompetent. Trump is also known for being thin-skinned. He often fires back at anyone who criticizes him with a barrage of insults, while simultaneously building himself up.

“I don’t think you have to put him on the couch to see that someone who has such a consistent need to build himself up and belittle everyone else must have some problems with self-esteem,” said Trump biographer Gwenda Blair, who wrote a book about the Trump family. “It’s a lifelong theme for him.”

“Part of it comes from his insecurities about not being perceived as intelligent,” a former White House official added.

In recent years, Trump has accused Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), actor Robert De Niro, Washington Post staffers, former President George W. Bush, comedian Jon Stewart, Republican strategist Rick Wilson, MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski, and Rick Perry, now his Energy secretary, of having low IQs.

He once suggested he’d like to compare his IQ to that of then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, adding, “And I can tell you who is going to win.” He privately mocked former Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ intelligence, according to a former White House official. All the while, Trump has claimed his Cabinet has the highest IQ of any assembled in history.

“Sorry losers and haters, but my I.Q. is one of the highest -and you all know it! Please don't feel so stupid or insecure, it's not your fault,” Trump tweeted in 2013.

Just last week, the president again referred to himself as an “extremely stable genius,” and he has spent years insisting he has a high IQ score, though he has never revealed the exact number. When a Twitter critic challenged him in 2013 to prove his high IQ, Trump responded simply, “The highest, asshole!”

Democrats are increasingly fed up with Trump's name calling, encouraging journalists to ignore it altogether and arguing it's a sign that the president isn't serious about policy or governing.

Trump has been obsessing over IQ and pedigree for decades, long before he moved to the White House. Barbara Res, a former Trump Organization official, recalled that Trump used to brag about one of his executives graduating from Yale Law School at the top of the class, even though Yale Law doesn’t rank its students. Trump later made the same false assertion about Brett Kavanaugh.

“He always used to say that he had a very high IQ,” Res added, recalling her decade-plus working alongside him.

Trump’s black-and-white view of intelligence was formed long before psychologists embraced a more nuanced definition of the term. In 1983, for example, developmental psychologist Howard Gardner put forward his theory of multiple intelligences, which stressed that people learn in many different ways and suggested IQ tests were too narrow.

“Measuring someone’s intelligence is not simply a matter of taking one test with a sharpened No. 2 pencil. Donald Trump came of age before that whole notion, for sure,” Blair said. “He’s still thinking in terms of that No. 2 pencil.”

Recently, however, IQ measurement has found increasing resonance among alt-right and white supremacist groups, who have linked IQ and race to argue for limits on immigration from certain ethnic groups.

Trump, who attended the Wharton School of business at the University of Pennsylvania, has an affinity for people who graduated from prestigious universities.

He warmed up to his former staff secretary, Rob Porter, once he learned that Porter attended Harvard University and was a Rhodes scholar at Oxford, according to two people familiar with the matter. “This guy is so smart,” he’d sometimes tell other staffers of Porter. “He was a Rhodes Scholar!”

He was similarly impressed with the credentials of his two Supreme Court picks: Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch. The president has regularly touted their Ivy League educations in conversations with allies, and White House aides believe attending a top-tier law school is one of Trump’s prerequisites for any future nominee to the high court.

Trump has also frequently mentioned his late uncle, a former physics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, calling him “a great, brilliant genius,” last year.

But Trump himself has long been reluctant to reveal any details about his own schooling. Trump’s longtime fixer Michael Cohen told lawmakers in February that his boss regularly instructed him to pressure the reality TV star’s alma maters with letters warning of jail time if they released Trump's grades.

“I’m talking about a man who declares himself brilliant, but directed me to threaten his high school, his colleges and the College Board to never release his grades or SAT scores,” Cohen told the House Oversight Committee.

The White House press office did not respond to a request for comment, nor did it respond to an inquiry about Trump’s IQ score.

The president’s elitism stands in stark contrast to the central messages of his campaign, which promised to upend establishment Washington and sought to appeal to disaffected white working-class voters. But Trump’s advisers say the dichotomy works in his favor, arguing that the president’s business experience and lavish lifestyle is one of the things that makes him appealing to his base.

“He’s a populist in a way, but he’s a populist only in terms of his policies,” said another former White House official. “His personal message has always had a real elitist flavor to it.”

'Molecules of freedom': US Energy Department tries rebranding natural gas,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/molecules-freedom-us-energy-department-rebranding-natural-gas/story?id=63366255,"In a press release touting exports of natural gas, the Department of Energy referred to the fossil fuel as ""molecules of U.S. freedom.""

The statement, dated May 28, issued from the Tenth Clean Energy Ministerial in Vancouver, British Columbia, was touting a natural gas facility on Quintana Island in Texas.

An expansion of the Freeport LNG Terminal -- with ""LNG"" referring to natural gas that's liquefied, for easier transport -- will support 3,000 additional engineering and construction jobs, the department said in the statement.

""Increasing export capacity from the Freeport LNG project is critical to spreading freedom gas throughout the world by giving America's allies a diverse and affordable source of clean energy,"" said Under Secretary of Energy Mark Menezes. ""Further, more exports of U.S. LNG to the world means more U.S. jobs and more domestic economic growth and cleaner air here at home and around the globe.""

Menezes added: ""There's no doubt today's announcement furthers this Administration's commitment to promoting energy security and diversity worldwide.""

Charles Rex Arbogast/AP, FILE

Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy Steven Winberg, who signed the export order and also attended the Clean Energy Ministerial, said he was ""pleased that the Department of Energy is doing what it can to promote an efficient regulatory system that allows for molecules of U.S. freedom to be exported to the world.""

The department said it expects domestic natural gas production to reach record rates this year and again in 2020.

Natural gas burns cleaner than coal, according to data compiled by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, contributing about 117 pounds of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere per million British thermal units compared with 200 pounds from coal. Natural gas leaks also are responsible for about one-third of all U.S. emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas that contributes significantly to climate change."
"DOJ watchdog: Former FBI official illegally leaked court docs, disclosed 'sensitive' information and took gift from media",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-watchdog-finds-fmr-fbi-deputy-assistant-director-leaked-sensitive-information-took-gift-from-media-but-declines-prosecution,"The Justice Department's internal watchdog announced in an investigative summary released Wednesday that an unnamed former FBI deputy assistant director engaged in ""misconduct,"" including leaking ""sensitive"" information to the media, violating federal law by disclosing sealed court records and taking a gift from someone in the media.

Nevertheless, the inspector general (IG) indicated, without explanation, that ""prosecution of the DAD [deputy assistant director] was declined."" The investigation's findings will be referred to the FBI for potential further action, the IG said.

The official became the second high-level FBI employee to be formally rebuked by the IG over media contacts seen as improper. Former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe was fired from the bureau in March 2018 by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions after an inspector general report revealed that he ""lacked candor"" when discussing his communications about federal probes with members of the media.

The IG first indicated in its June 2018 report on DOJ and FBI misconduct that ""although FBI policy strictly limits the employees who are authorized to speak to the media, we found that this policy appeared to be widely ignored during the period we reviewed.""

The IG, flagging what it called an apparent ""cultural"" problem at the bureau, said at the time it would announce the conclusion of multiple separate ""investigations"" into the matter at a later date. The Wednesday report appeared to be the opening salvo in those reports. A distinct, comprehensive IG report covering a variety of additional matters, including potential FBI surveillance abuses, is expected in a matter of weeks.

John Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, and John Huber, the U.S. attorney in Utah, are conducting independent parallel probes into the FBI and DOJ. Last week, President Trump authorized Attorney General William Barr to declassify and release materials pertinent to the reviews.

The investigative summary released Wednesday specifically found by a preponderance of evidence that the DAD had ""engaged in misconduct when the DAD accepted a ticket, valued at approximately $225, to attend a media-sponsored dinner, as a gift from a member of the media, in violation of federal regulations and FBI policy.""

STRZOK'S SPECIAL COUNSEL PHONE TOTALLY WIPED BY RECORDS OFFICER WHO ASSUMED NOTHING IMPORTANT WAS ON THERE

The report also assessed that the DAD ""disclosed to the media the existence of information that had been filed under seal in federal court, in violation of 18 USC § 401, Contempt of Court, provided without authorization FBI law enforcement sensitive information to reporters on multiple occasions; and had dozens of official contacts with the media without authorization, in violation of FBI policy."" Contempt of court can be punished by a jail term or a fine, at the court's discretion.

Media leaks played a central role in advancing the narrative that the Trump campaign may have colluded with Russia, and Republican lawmakers have charged that the FBI and DOJ planted sensitive information to further their own political and investigative goals.

The FBI, for example, extensively relied on news articles -- including one from Yahoo News -- to obtain a surveillance warrant to monitor former Trump aide Carter Page. The FBI did not inform the FISA court that the Yahoo article relied on a source that, according to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the FBI knew was politically motivated. Internal FBI text messages obtained by Fox News also show FBI brass fretting that a senior DOJ officials had similar concerns about a FISA source's bias.

And text messages between ex-FBI employees and former lovers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, unearthed last year, revealed that government officials were ""leaking like mad"" in the run-up to the Trump-Russia collusion probe.

""In addition to the significant number of communications between FBI employees and journalists, we identified social interactions between FBI employees and journalists that were, at a minimum, inconsistent with FBI policy and department ethics rules,"" the IG wrote in June. ""For example, we identified instances where FBI employees received tickets to sporting events from journalists, went on golfing outings with media representatives, were treated to drinks and meals after work by reporters, and were the guests of journalists at nonpublic social events.""

The IG concluded by describing ""the harm caused by leaks, fear of potential leaks, and a culture of unauthorized media contacts.""

""We do not believe the problem is with the FBI’s policy, which we found to be clear and unambiguous,"" the IG added. ""Rather, we concluded that these leaks highlight the need to change what appears to be a cultural attitude.""

""It will be a statement having to do with the border and having to do with people illegally coming over the border,"" Trump said."" And it will be my biggest statement, so far, on the border. We have brought something to the light of the people. They see now it's a national emergency, and most people agree. The Democrats agree, too, but they won't give us the legislation you need to fix it.""

The president teased the announcement as he left the White House on a trip to Colorado but revealed little when reporters pressed him for more.

""Right now, when you catch somebody, you have to release them,"" Trump answered, blaming Democrats. ""They won't give us the legislation. Whether it's chain migration or whether it's a lottery, they won't give us any. And the asylum procedures are ridiculous. No place in the world has what we have in terms of ridiculous immigration laws.""

Trump's latest political move on illegal immigration comes as administration officials told ABC News in Guatemala that they are now targeting transportation networks for migrants with the same focus and effort as drug smugglers.

It’s the latest push by the administration to try to contain the crisis at the border that’s overwhelmed border communities and tested Trump’s “America First"" policy.

Migrants families are arriving in record numbers this year, with officials expecting to handle some 1 million people at the southern border this year -- double the number of last year. The reasons are complex, ranging from poverty to threats from gangs to weather-related disasters that have wiped out farmland.

The Trump administration also blames court-ordered limits on the ability to detain children past 20 days, insisting that has only encouraged travelers to bring children with the promise of a quick release where they will able to live and work waiting for an overwhelmed immigration court system to take up their case.

Critics counter that the president has done little to address the humanitarian crisis in Central America and say his threats to close the border and build a wall may have even encouraged the latest rush of asylum seekers.

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan tells ABC’s Matt Gutman in an interview in Guatemala this week that he was visiting the country to forge a new relationship with the country's security forces. The goal is to break up human smuggling networks that are charging people some $6,000 to $7,000 to reach the U.S.

McAleenan called Guatemala the ""epicenter"" of the migration issue with 40 percent of the migrants arriving at the border coming from there.

""We've got to work with them here to address these smugglers at the front end of the process,"" McAleenan said in the interview.

That view – addressing the root cause of the migration and going after transportation networks -- has long been pushed by the Homeland Security Department, including under McAleenan's predecessor Kirstjen Nielsen. But with the president's repeated promise of ""America First,"" Trump has shown little appetite – at least publicly – to address the crisis through diplomatic channels and foreign aid.

This spring, the State Department announced Trump wanted to cut all direct assistance to Guatemala, as well as El Salvador and Honduras -- the three countries that represent the vast majority of asylum seekers arriving at the U.S. border.

As the Washington Post’s Anne Rumsey Gearan reports, Trump wanted to host Varadkar at his golf club and hotel in Doonbeg, in County Clare, Ireland.

The Irish prime minister (known as the taoiseach) declined, reportedly favoring Dromoland Castle Hotel, about 30 miles away, which has hosted US presidents, including George W. Bush.

But Trump must’ve rejected that option, so a more neutral locale has been agreed on: the Shannon airport, also in County Clare.

According to reports, the debate over the visit location threatened to derail the meeting between the two leaders, as Varadkar objected going to Trump’s private club and Trump threatened to just go to his club in Scotland instead, according to the Irish Times.

So the compromise was reached — a place where no one wants to go, the airport.

The New York Times reports that the Shannon airport has hosted international meetings in the past, so even if this is not exactly a fancy state visit, there is some precedent. The other people who probably aren’t thrilled about this are those who will be traveling through the airport during the president’s visit. They’ve been warned to factor in an additional 15 minutes to their travel time (but let’s be honest, it’s probably going to be a way longer delay than that).

And Trump will get a chance to visit his golf course. He’ll travel the following morning to France to attend a D-Day commemoration celebration, and will then return to Doonbeg, in Ireland, to spend the night at his golf club.

Seriously, the president’s bilateral meeting with Irish PM Varadkar is going to take place at the VIP lounge at Shannon. Trump wanted it st his nearby golf club. The Irish said no thanks. So, across from the Duty Free and next to the Irish Coffee bar at the airport. Perfect. — Anne Rumsey Gearan (@agearan) May 29, 2019

Trump hosted Varadkar at the White House this March, but the US president abruptly canceled a visit with the Irish prime minister last November.

Protesters prepared to demonstrate ahead of that November visit, and they’re likely to gather again, something Varadkar himself acknowledged.

“I’d say to them, this is a democracy and peaceful protest is part of democracy,” Varadkar said earlier this month, about possible Trump protests. “And I would certainly never criticize anyone for taking part in a protest if that’s the way they wish to express their views.”

That might be why Trump was eager to decamp for his golf resort in Doonbeg, where the town is expected to drape itself in American flags ahead of his visit.

Trump is visiting the United Kingdom ahead of his visit to Ireland and France, and protests are expected in London ahead of his visit there, too. When Trump visited last summer, the president largely avoided the city and its protests (and gigantic Trump baby blimp) by hanging out with Prime Minister Theresa May at her Chequers estate — and enjoying a respite at his golf course in Scotland."
U.S. police chiefs call for meeting with Homeland Security over immigration issues,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Tom Jackman', 'Reporter Covering Criminal Justice Locally', 'May At Pm']",05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/crime-law/2019/05/30/us-police-chiefs-call-meeting-with-homeland-security-over-immigration-issues/,"

MIAMI — The police chiefs of America’s largest cities on Thursday called on the federal Department of Homeland Security to meet with them as their departments struggle with the influx of immigrants from the southern border. The chiefs said they want to hear how federal immigration authorities plan to deal with relocating immigrants to their cities and how they will handle “sanctuary city” status declared by local governments, and the police want a voice in the federal policymaking process.

The Major Cities Chiefs Association, comprising the chiefs and sheriffs of the 69 largest law enforcement agencies in the United States, formed an immigration working group at its meeting here, led by Houston police Chief Art Acevedo, who has openly opposed a Texas law banning sanctuary cities. Acevedo and other chiefs here said they do not take immigration status into account when performing their duties, only whether someone is breaking the law or has been a crime victim. They see immigration enforcement as a federal responsibility, not one for local police.

“From our perspective,” Acevedo said in an interview, “there is no such thing as a ‘sanctuary city’ in terms of taking action against those who would do harm to members of our communities.” Police have long felt that taking on immigration enforcement by routinely checking a person’s status will deter immigrants from reporting crime or cooperating with investigations. Acevedo said there had been a nearly 43 percent drop in reporting of sexual assaults in Houston by its Hispanic community in 2017.

The chiefs’ working group wants to discuss the federal policy on Immigration and Customs Enforcement civil detainers for undocumented immigrants, which a number of police departments and jails have refused to recognize since they are not criminal warrants. They also want to talk about the issue of notifying ICE before releasing prisoners who have immigration detainers. “The immigration authorities have to pick them up,” Acevedo said. “We don’t turn them over.”

Some chiefs told Acevedo that their local social service agencies are being overwhelmed by busloads of suddenly relocated immigrants. “There needs to be a sense of urgency,” Acevedo said, “when we see asylum seekers that are being distributed throughout the country. We need to know what is the plan and what is the impact on public safety. We need to be part of the discussion because while immigration enforcement is a federal issue, these decisions have an impact on the safety and security of the American people, and that is our primary responsibility.”

In a statement, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said the agency “has repeatedly and extensively worked with our country’s law enforcement officials to address the current immigration crisis facing our homeland and keep our communities safe. In fact, former Secretary Nielsen met with the Law Enforcement Immigration Task Force, co-chaired by Chief Acevedo, this past February to discuss law enforcement concerns and Acting Secretary McAleenan continues to meet with various law enforcement leaders to seek feedback and identify viable, lasting solutions to the ongoing crisis and achieve the Department’s humanitarian and security mission.”

Ex-State Department head of diplomatic security 'surprised' by Hillary Clinton's private email use,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ex-state-department-head-of-diplomatic-security-surprised-by-hillary-clintons-private-email-use,"The official in charge of protecting State Department staff said he was ""surprised"" to learn that Hillary Clinton used a personal email address to conduct government business.

Eric Boswell, the former head of diplomatic security, acknowledged in a deposition this month that he warned Clinton and other State Department staff against the use of personal emails.

""We also urge Department users to minimize the use of personal web email for business, as some compromised home systems have been reconfigured by these actors to automatically forward copies of all composed emails to an undisclosed recipient,"" read a 2011 memo that bore his signature.

Clinton was a recipient of the memo, but Boswell could not confirm whether the secretary of state actually read it.

Boswell, who stepped down from his position in 2012, said he and other former State Department officials had spoken about Clinton's use of the private email address clintonemail.com as a ""general issue.""

""We were surprised,"" he added.

Boswell participated in a deposition this month as part of a court-ordered discovery related to Clinton’s use of an unauthorized email server during her time as secretary of state. A federal judge ruled that several Obama administration officials would have to answer conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch's questions about whether Clinton intentionally attempted to evade the Freedom of Information Act by using a nongovernment email system.

Boswell also warned Clinton against her use of Blackberry devices in the executive offices of the State Department. In a previously declassified memo to Cheryl Mills, Clinton's chief of staff, Boswell said the secretary of state should discontinue her use of the device due to ""vulnerabilities and risks."" Although Clinton assured Boswell she read the internal memo and ""gets it,"" an email obtained by Judicial Watch indicates she still carried the device ""[a]gainst the advice of the security hawks.""

The debate over whether Clinton's home-based email server, which she claims was set up for convenience, remains alive today. During a hearing with Attorney General William Barr this month, Rep. Louie Gohmert accused FBI Director Christopher Wray of a pro-Clinton cover-up by not pressing the intelligence community for proof that it was not hacked by China.

Also this month, partially redacted documents were released by the FBI that were part of the bureau's ""Midyear Exam"" investigation, which looked into Clinton's mishandling of classified information on her unauthorized private email servers while serving as secretary of state. The documents put on display a sense of alarm among Clinton's staff following what they feared to be a hack of the server and glaring security oversights.

The FBI investigation into Clinton's emails came to a conclusion during the 2016 presidential election. Former FBI Director James Comey publicly recommended in 2016 that no charges be brought against Clinton, who was then a candidate for president, but admonished Clinton and her colleagues for being ""extremely careless"" in handling classified information.

One of the main controversies stemming from Clinton's emails was how a technician managing the server deleted 33,000 emails. The FBI was only able to recover about 5,000 of the emails, which were released in tranches up until earlier this year as part of a Judicial Watch lawsuit. Clinton has said she ""never received nor sent any material that was marked classified,"" but the FBI found 110 emails did contain classified information.

Clinton has long blamed the FBI's handling of the investigation as a reason for her 2016 loss to President Trump."

Ron Wyden said the Treasury Department's response to congressional requests for the president's tax returns was “unresponsive and wholly unacceptable.” | AP Photo/Cliff Owen finance & tax Wyden threatens to hold nominees over Trump tax return defiance

Sen. Ron Wyden threatened on Thursday to put a hold on Treasury Department nominees unless the administration offers fuller answers about congressional efforts to obtain President Donald Trump’s tax returns.

Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, had pressed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a letter this month about the administration’s handling of House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal’s request for Trump’s returns. He said Thursday that the department’s response — which came not from Mnuchin, but from Justin Sok of Treasury’s legislative affairs office — was “unresponsive and wholly unacceptable.”

Story Continued Below

“If the Treasury Department refuses to answer our questions, I am prepared to again place a hold on department nominees as I did previously when routine requests for information went unanswered,” the Oregon Democrat added. “Congress needs to take action to force the administration to comply with oversight.”

Wyden had already said last week that Brent McIntosh, Treasury’s general counsel and Trump’s nominee to be Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, “needs to be prepared to thoroughly answer” questions about his role in the department’s refusal to comply with Neal’s request and a subsequent subpoena if he wanted the position.

Several other Treasury nominees could face a hold: Brian McGuire for assistant secretary for legislative affairs, Michael Faulkender for assistant secretary for economic policy, Brian Callanan for general counsel and Geoffrey William Seiji Okamoto for deputy undersecretary.

In his letter to Mnuchin this month, Wyden asked how often tax committees had sought tax return information this century and how frequently that request has been handled by the Treasury secretary instead of the IRS commissioner.

Sok’s response maintained that Neal’s request was “categorically different” than previous committee requests for “statistical data to inform the drafting of tax legislation,” similar to the arguments that Mnuchin has made in public. Mnuchin repeatedly has said that Neal’s stated reason for requesting Trump’s returns — to conduct fuller oversight of the IRS’ capabilities in its routine auditing of presidents — is a cover and that Democrats are merely seeking ways to embarrass the president.

Wyden placed holds on Treasury nominees last year — including Justin Muzinich, Trump’s choice to be deputy secretary — because he believed the administration was stonewalling requests for oversight information. Muzinich was confirmed in December.

Cuba “Sonic Attack” Mystery: How The State Department Botched Its Investigation,https://www.buzzfeednews.com,"['Dan Vergano', 'Buzzfeed News Reporter']",,,,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/danvergano/havana-syndrome-research-cuba-sonic-attack,"“The fundamental problem is you can’t trust anybody here,” said one medical ethicist. “Not the US State Department and not the Cuban government.”

The second time the American diplomat felt the attack was in her apartment kitchen, after a long day working at the US Embassy in Havana. “I felt an extreme pressure like the full, frontal top of my face was exploding off my head.” Unsteady on her feet afterward, unable to work, she was medevaced to Miami and diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury. But what caused that injury, and more like it to dozens of other US diplomats and their families? That’s still unknown — and may stay that way due to the way the US State Department began the medical investigation into what happened. “Day to day, we still don’t know how to attribute it,” said the injured diplomat, who spoke to BuzzFeed News anonymously to preserve her future chances of working overseas. For the past three years, diplomats working in Cuba have complained of an array of mysterious ailments and symptoms — dizziness, headaches, difficulty concentrating — that often started with reports of metallic shrieks inside their homes in Havana. Many report long-lasting, perhaps permanent effects. The “Havana syndrome” mystery has been the subject of intense, and public, scrutiny, with much of it focused on the search for some sort of weapon — ultrasound, microwaves, psychology, and even crickets have been offered as explanations. Yet despite intense political pressure, international headlines, sanctions against Cuba, and withdrawal of most US diplomats from Havana, very little still is known about the cause of the “health attacks” as then–secretary of state Rex Tillerson described them in 2017, that affected at least 40 US and Canadian personnel working in the country. The syndrome is now under investigation by the big guns in biomedicine, federal health agencies, and the US National Academies of Science. But public health experts who spoke to BuzzFeed News said the State Department dropped the ball by not opening the investigation earlier to a wider swath of medical experts outside of its immediate sphere.

“The fundamental problem is you can’t trust anybody here.”

According to interviews with public health officials and affected personnel, as well as documents obtained by BuzzFeed News via a Freedom of Information Act request that included hundreds of emails exchanged between researchers and the US Navy’s research office, much of the early research into the mystery may have been botched or biased. The initial investigation was confined to two competing sets of researchers, both eager to publish studies on their own work, and whose findings have been at odds with each other. In one case, researchers were also seeking to promote their own newly approved medical device as a diagnostic tool. And until now, the effort has lacked broader oversight by an institution capable of cross-disciplinary research. “The fundamental problem is you can’t trust anybody here,” said medical ethicist Sergio Litewka of the University of Miami, who has written about the political cloud of secrecy and distrust surrounding the diplomats’ injuries. “Not the US State Department and not the Cuban government.” (BuzzFeed has filed a lawsuit with the State Department requesting its communications related to the medical research into the injuries, after the agency denied a request for them on medical privacy and ongoing investigation grounds.) The two medical teams the State Department first tasked with treating victims — one from the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine and the other from the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine — diagnosed the diplomats with injuries centered on their own respective areas of research expertise: inner ear damage and concussions. That drew criticism from other medical experts who saw them and the State Department as embracing familiar theories while closing off other explanations, ranging from viruses to poison to mass psychology. “Medical groups do tend to see what they are used to seeing,” University of Virginia applied ethics professor Deborah Johnson told BuzzFeed News, comparing the situation to the joke about intoxicated people who look for lost keys under a streetlamp because that’s where the light is. “It’s why it is best to hear from a lot of disciplines in an investigation.” Until now only those two US medical teams have reported, inconclusively, on the injuries to 26 US diplomats (and 14 Canadian ones) that began in Havana in late 2016. The US National Academy of Sciences will begin an investigation starting in the next few weeks, consisting of three standing committees of varied specialists investigating for a year. But outside experts are worried it might be too late to crack the case, starting now one year after the last report of injuries in Havana. They also fear that the State Department and other federal agencies have hobbled the medical investigation by keeping the details closed and hidden from the outside world. “The National Academy is an excellent choice, likely to bring in sophisticated scientists with a good arm’s length from the political players,” UCLA neuroscientist Mark Cohen told BuzzFeed News. “I hope that the NAS will also take the step of bringing in experts from outside the US, as well.”

Emails show the teams quarreled, refused to share data, and disagreed over study authorship, as they raced to publish in high-prestige publications.

The State Department does not fund medical research but, after the teams from Miami and UPenn failed to reach a consensus, did ask the CDC to investigate the injuries in December 2017. The CDC has not yet published the results of its investigation, more than a year later. The NIH’s brain trauma research, now open to injured diplomats and their families, is a five-year study. “Our response continues to be guided by the medical facts,” State Department senior medical adviser Behzad Shahbazian told BuzzFeed News in a statement. “World-class brain injury specialists and other scientists” at UPenn, NIH, and CDC, he said, “continue to examine the medical data to gain a better understanding of the nature and mechanism of injury that caused these patients’ symptoms.” But according to public records obtained by BuzzFeed News, emails show the teams quarreled, refused to share data, and disagreed over study authorship, as they raced to publish in high-prestige publications. (The UPenn team requested copies of their own emails, and then declined to comment on them to BuzzFeed News. The Miami-led team responded after it was presented with a list of incidents in the emails.) The emails show the Miami-led team discussed turning the investigation into a multiyear effort at the US Office of Naval Research (ONR) and, more unusual, also looked at the research on the injured diplomats as a marketing opportunity for diagnostic goggles — a medical device that one researcher and his university had a patent application on. (Via a spokesperson, the researcher denied having a financial interest in the patent.) They also worried about “State trying to reclaim ownership” of the investigation, according to their communications, which also privately suggest some saw little chance that the cause of the illnesses that started more than two years ago in Havana would ever be found.

Miami Herald / Getty Images Workers at the US Embassy in Havana leave the building on Sept. 29, 2017, after the State Department announced that it was withdrawing all but essential personnel from the embassy because Cuba could no longer guarantee diplomats’ safety.

In November 2016, the first cases of strange noises and injuries began appearing among a handful of diplomats posted to Havana. Initial reports were of buzzing sounds inside private homes. Embassy security at first thought these were just noises meant to annoy staff, according to US Senate testimony by State Department security official Todd Brown. The erratic nature of the incidents, a few one week, and then none another, added to the confusion, but by February 2017 it was clear that around half a dozen embassy staff were ill with headaches, hearing loss, or vertigo.

From the beginning, the medical investigation into these reports was ad hoc, a side project run by the doctors tasked with diagnosing and treating the diplomats and their families. The research investigation was allowed by the State Department, but not run by it. “I literally got this call, ‘This is the State Department, we have a problem,’” University of Miami medical school otolaryngologist Michael Hoffer told a Pentagon-sponsored presentation last August. “All of these individuals had experienced a loud noise or pressure before and during the symptoms.”

Hoffer, a former Navy doctor with two decades of military experience, had experience with blast victims who sustained traumatic brain injuries during the Iraq War, even receiving funding from the NFL Foundation for his research. Since Miami was the evacuation point for the embassy, it made sense for the State Department to ask the University of Miami expert to look at what resembled head injuries. He and his colleagues examined evacuated staff members with injuries in Miami, giving them neurologic, hearing, and physical exams. He later traveled to Havana to see many more, mostly unaffected personnel. In late March 2017, embassy staff were gathered in Havana by then-ambassador Jeffrey DeLaurentis, who warned them about the incidents and said they would be evaluated if they wished. It was the first time many had heard about the injuries or the sounds. According to news reports, Canadian diplomats and their families, including children, also began reporting such ailments that month — including headaches, nosebleeds, dizziness, and ringing in the ears — from similar sound-linked incidents. (Fifteen Canadians, including five diplomats, sued their country in February, charging that their government “downplayed the seriousness of the situation, hoarded and concealed critical health and safety information, and gave false, misleading, and incomplete information to diplomatic staff."") And the injuries kept coming. “Like a teapot on steroids, such a very high-pitched sound,” the injured American diplomat told BuzzFeed News about the incident in her Havana apartment in April 2017, one month after the embassy town hall. While in her apartment kitchen, “I literally had to duck around a corner to get away from it,” she said.

“Like a teapot on steroids, such a very high-pitched sound.”

Her vision started to blur over the next three days, so she went to a Cuban eye doctor, who diagnosed bleeding in her retinas. “We couldn’t tell the [Cuban doctor] anything,” she said, but the State Department quickly evacuated her as soon as she alerted them about the problem. She stayed in Florida for about six weeks for treatment for her eyes, before returning to Havana “to resume life.” Shortly after her return, there was a second incident in the apartment, accompanied by a buzzing noise. She said, “A sudden force on my face was pulling it up, everywhere above the nose.” Afterward she felt unsteady while walking and had fatigue and difficulty concentrating. She was evacuated to Miami, where she was evaluated for a traumatic blast injury, in the process donning a pair of experimental diagnostic goggles that tracked her eyes to measure the severity of her vertigo, and serving as a data point in Hoffer’s research. (Essentially, the goggles claim to track how the pupils of the eyes constrict in response to seeing objects move back and forth, an involuntary response that people with even mild traumatic brain injuries find difficult.) By April, the University of Miami’s Hoffer had invited his longtime colleagues, bioengineer Carey Balaban of the University of Pittsburgh and Kurt Yankaskas, their grant officer at the US Navy’s Office of Naval Research hearing loss program, to collaborate on investigating the diplomats’ injuries. The three scientists discussed inner ear “cavitation,” damaging implosions of blood bubbles caused by focused sound waves, as an explanation. In an email obtained by BuzzFeed News, Balaban shared a proposal for a “blood vessel” grant with Yankaskas later that same month. Still more diplomats reported injuries. On May 23, 2017, the State Department told Cuba to send two of its diplomats home from its Washington, DC, embassy, unsatisfied with the Castro government’s protests of innocence concerning the injuries. Cuba had a long history of constant surveillance aimed at US diplomats. It was also known to engage in petty harassment, such as leaving unplugged refrigerators and cigarettes in ashtrays after break-ins. It made the notion of the regime lacking any knowledge of the injuries, or responsibility for them, implausible in US eyes. In all, Hoffer’s team would see 25 diplomats or their families affected by the incidents, 10 who lived with them but were unaffected in Miami, and another 105 unaffected personnel seen separately in Havana. “There was no media attention given to what was happening in Cuba when we saw these individuals,” Hoffer said at the later Pentagon teleconference, calling the group “in a sense, pure.” On July 6, 2017, Hoffer and other medical experts met with federal officials, reportedly including top State Department medical officer Charles Rosenfarb, to discuss the still-secret injuries with the diplomats. The expert panel “came to a consensus that the initial findings were most likely related to neurotrauma from a non-natural source,” according to the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). That consensus was perhaps unsurprising, given the experts who were looking under the lamppost: They included neurologists and hearing specialists from the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, and the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, according to a State Department email asking them for travel receipts. But there were no infectious disease, toxicology, tropical medicine, or psychiatric experts listed as meeting specialists — no one who might have had a competing explanation for the injuries was present. Competing theories would, however, come into play much later. Complicating any collaboration, and the research overall, was secrecy about the injuries. This remains a problem today. BuzzFeed News asked the four scientists from Johns Hopkins who were listed as participants in the July 2017 meeting, for example, to comment on the progress of the medical investigation into the Havana injuries so far. A university media representative said that one, otolaryngologist Frank Lin of the Cochlear Center for Hearing and Public Health, had signed a nondisclosure agreement, and that the rest “can’t comment” for undisclosed reasons. The July 2017 meeting also included neurosurgeon Douglas Smith of the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. The State Department looked to his Penn Center for Brain Injury and Repair, a highly regarded center for the treatment of brain injuries near Washington, DC, where many of the injured diplomats and their families lived, for their extended treatment. “It was good care, they took very good care of us,” the injured diplomat said of UPenn. “They told me, ‘We need to fix you and make you better,’; they would treat us like anyone else who came into their center with our symptoms.” Outside, however, a storm was brewing. On Aug. 9, 2017, in answer to a question from a CBS News correspondent, State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said that some embassy personnel “reported some incidents which have caused a variety of physical symptoms,” and mentioned the expulsion of Cuban diplomats in May. Headlines quickly erupted of “hearing loss” and “brain damage” to diplomats caused by an “acoustic attack,” all suggestions that outside experts have later found questionable. Cuban state television in October 2017 blamed the noises heard by the diplomats in the incidents on cicadas or crickets, something the diplomat interviewed by BuzzFeed News scoffed at. “I’ve heard cicadas before,” she said. “It sounded different.” In September, another injured diplomat who spoke to BuzzFeed News under similar conditions of anonymity was evacuated from Havana ahead of Hurricane Irma, which devastated the island. He had heard a buzzing noise in his home and the sensation of pressure, followed by problems with vertigo. “I fell out of my chair at work,” he said. He was also evaluated at UPenn, and is back at work now in the US, although he still has trouble concentrating. “I don’t function at the level I did before,” he said, and worries about the long-term effects, especially, he said, in light of the US government’s longtime wrangling with war veterans with unexplained illness tied to Agent Orange and Gulf War syndrome.

By the middle of August, according to emails reviewed by BuzzFeed News, Hoffer’s University of Pittsburgh colleague Balaban was corresponding with Smith about collaborating on a study of how UPenn’s brain images of injured diplomats might explain how ultrasound beams could selectively damage a person’s inner ear from a distance.

“Your data will be very important in narrowing down plausible scenarios,” Balaban wrote in an Aug. 20, 2017, email to Smith. Smith was dubious, asking how ultrasound “can go through air and [a] possible glass pane, then the skull, to selectively affect the brain.” Competition to publish research results first is the lifeblood of US scientific process. But for Havana syndrome, this drive pitted the two medical teams against each other in a race to publish in the world’s two most prestigious medical journals, the New England Journal of Medicine and the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). The fastest team, from UPenn, would submit a paper to a journal within a few weeks of looking at the last diplomats in their study. By November 2017, Hoffer and Balaban were drafting a paper on the diplomats that they had seen, which they planned to submit to the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine. That same month, the Food and Drug Administration approved sales by Pittsburgh-based Neuro Kinetics Inc. of the diagnostic goggles that Hoffer used to assess the diplomats’ injuries. Along with his university, Balaban had applied for a patent on the goggles with Neuro Kinetics. They shared the news with Yankaskas, their US Navy ONR grant officer:

BuzzFeed News

“It does not seem imprudent to speculate that a highly specific unidentified energy exposure, perceived as a sound or pressure, could be producing a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) or similar inner ear concussion,” said a December 2017 update of the draft paper, obtained via FOIA request. It compiled symptoms that ranged from ringing ears to foggy thinking to dizziness, all signs of inner ear damage, to come to this conclusion. Such symptoms were hallmarks of the blast damage to the head that the medical team had seen and diagnosed during the Iraq War. Those investigations, too, were not without controversy. The Defense Department’s inspector general in 2011 released a report critical of research that Hoffer and Balaban had conducted on US soldiers at Camp Al Taqaddum, Iraq, who were injured by explosions from 2008 to 2009. “Neurological assessments did not adhere to clinical practice guidelines” for mild traumatic brain injury, the report found. It also said that a “potential financial conflict of interest” in the experimental antioxidant tablets was not revealed to the injured personnel in the study, a research ethics violation. (Hoffer held patents on a method of administering the tablets.) A US Navy representative told Time, “The evidence suggests that no physical harm was caused by the administration of the investigational drug,” after the report came out. To close out 2017, the State Department asked the NIH to investigate the diplomats’ injuries — a move the top Republican and Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee called for on Dec. 5 — with staff members quoted as critical of the medical investigation.

AFP Contributor / AFP / Getty Images Reflection of the US Embassy in Havana, Oct. 3, 2017.

In January 2018, the journal JAMA notified Balaban and Hoffer that the UPenn doctors had submitted their paper and added them as coauthors. The notice led to an angry face-off between Smith and Balaban, who wanted to see the data and delay publication of the JAMA paper. He told Smith he had complained to ethics officials at the University of Pittsburgh, which posed the threat of a scientific misconduct investigation. (University of Pittsburgh’s communications office did not respond when asked if there had been an outcome of that complaint.)



BuzzFeed News “In or out” email from Smith to Balaban, Feb. 9, 2018.

JAMA released the UPenn study online less than a week after Smith told Balaban he was either “in or out,” without him or Hoffer as authors. The study of 21 people, 11 women and 10 men, concluded “they had sustained injury to widespread brain networks,” a constellation of symptoms similar to concussions caused by physical impacts. “Clinically, it’s clear they have suffered some sort of neurological insult. Something happened,” UPenn’s Randel Swanson, the lead author on the study, then told BuzzFeed News.

Other experts weren’t so certain. Neuroimaging expert Arthur Toga of the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California told BuzzFeed News the study was “inconclusive,” noting its MRI results didn’t indicate anything grossly wrong with the diplomats’ brains that corresponded to their symptoms. Neuroscientist Sergio Della Sala of the University of Edinburgh said that the study’s standard for brain damage, seen in only two or three patients, was so loose as to describe roughly 40% of the general population as having brain damage.

“Clinically, it’s clear they have suffered some sort of neurological insult. Something happened.”

The JAMA study authors noted that privacy and secrecy restrictions precluded the release of some of the data about the injured diplomats, noting that only Smith and Swanson were responsible for the data. Nonetheless, they ruled out a viral cause of the injuries, because no one had reported a fever, and called poisoning unlikely to have worked so quickly after the sounds heard by 18 of the 21 patients, some of them on the island for less than 24 hours before reporting symptoms. It also ruled out a mass psychology or “functional” disorders, triggered by everything from whiplash to migraines, because the diplomats wanted to return to work and didn’t show signs of “malingering.” This last conclusion is at odds with how “psychogenic” injuries actually work — people suffer physically from injuries triggered by stress in such cases, often with symptoms like dizziness, headaches, and the others reported in some of the Havana cases. They do not fake injury to get time off work. Despite the presence of neuropsychologists on the UPenn team, the description called into question how well the JAMA study authors had really investigated the possibility of psychology to explain the injuries, medical sociologist Robert Bartholomew, coauthor of Outbreak! The Encyclopedia of Extraordinary Social Behavior, told BuzzFeed News. Four days after the study appeared in JAMA, the State Department’s Rosenfarb gave Balaban and his colleagues authorization to publish their own paper in submission with the New England Journal of Medicine. “My apology for the delay,” said Rosenfarb. They had lost the high-prestige publication race, and the delay hadn’t helped, according to an April 2018 email from Balaban. “An NEJM editor has asked us for rights of a first look before the JAMA paper was published. Our release occurred after the JAMA on-line edition appeared,” he wrote to a University of Pittsburgh publicist planning a news conference with the University of Miami’s medical school on publication of their paper, now under consideration by the journal Frontiers in Neurology. Plans for the press conference included a presentation of the Neuro Kinetics goggles that the paper described as able to uniquely diagnose people with the Havana injuries, as well as setting up advance interviews with the Miami Herald and the New York Times. A draft of the paper in review with Frontiers lists no financial conflicts of interest in the study.

BuzzFeed News A University of Pittsburgh email from Balaban, April 17, 2018.

That seems troublesome to neurologist Mitchell Joseph Valdés-Sosa of the Cuban Neuroscience Center, a leader on a Cuban panel that concluded in 2017 that the injuries were likely caused by mass hysteria. “There could be a conflict of interest, and that could have [led] to confirmation bias,” he told BuzzFeed News by email. “Their hypothesis could have been that they were going to find evidence of vestibular [inner ear] damage, which is what the [Neuro Kinetics] helmet measures.”

In response to this concern, University of Pittsburgh media relations director Joe Miksch told BuzzFeed News by email, “Balaban has not and will not receive any financial benefit from Neuro Kinetics or the sales of the Neuro Kinetics diagnostic goggles, even if the patent is granted.” He did not answer whether Balaban’s employer, the university, which owns intellectual property on the patent and can license the invention, would financially benefit from the goggles. The university has not entered into any license with Neuro Kinetics, according to Miksch. The last report of a US diplomat injured in Havana came one year ago, in May 2018. Cuba’s foreign ministry said the US State Department had informed it that a woman had “reported health symptoms as a result of ‘undefined sounds’ in her place of residence.” That same month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reported that two US diplomats in China reported the same sort of illness “entirely consistent” with the past Cuban cases, prompting the State Department to launch a task force with the Health and Human Services and Energy departments to investigate. (Eventually 15 US diplomats from China would be investigated for such incidents, with the Associated Press later reporting that 14 of them were ruled out from suffering the syndrome, with the 15th inconclusive.) In August, a series of letters critical of the JAMA study were published in that journal, written by a mixture of neurologists critical of the brain damage claims, and experts in “functional” disorders triggered by stress who blasted its dismissal of psychology as an explanation.

“Research with this patient cohort was not originally anticipated due to secrecy and privacy concerns,” Smith and his colleagues said in response to the letters. They restated the criteria for “neuropsychological impairment” and wrote, “we are performing advanced neuroimaging studies of the patient cohort, hoping to identify structural brain changes that may underlie the neurological manifestations.” These studies have still not been published. As mentioned, after asking to see the public records of communications released to BuzzFeed News, Smith did not reply to requests for comment. “I can only vet the (published) cognitive data, and these do not hold water,” Della Sala, the editor of the journal Cortex, told BuzzFeed News by email. “These further explanations made things even worse.” Also unpublished was the submitted Frontiers in Neurology paper by Hoffer’s team. The next appearance of their results instead came in August in talks at a “SOFWERX” Defense Department think tank in Tampa, where Hoffer discussed the injuries suffered by the diplomats. Balaban described the “Frey effect” in his talk, the production of clicking noises in the ears by exposure to microwaves, a phenomenon researched in the 1970s. “So, the ability of radiofrequency to affect the nervous system is real,” he said.

Balaban also touted the Neuro Kinetics goggles at the talk, claiming a 90% ability to tell Havana subjects apart from either blast victims or healthy people. “This is a fieldable technology,” he said.

“The promotion of the silly goggles is a shameless attempt at commercial promotion,” said Cohen, the UCLA neuroscientist. Little more than a week after Hoffer’s Tampa appearance, the New York Times published a story citing the Frey effect and suggesting that microwaves were the prime suspects as the technology that hurt the diplomats, with an endorsement of the idea from UPenn’s Smith. This caused some suspicion on both Hoffer’s and Balaban’s part that their August presentation had been eavesdropped upon and their ideas pilfered (in reality, a University of California, San Diego, news release had touted the idea a few days ahead of the story).

BuzzFeed News Email from Hoffer, Sept. 2, 2018.

“I think State trying to reclaim ownership [is] a strong possibility because we noted that the Penn group (which is a group entirely composed of clinicians) now is convince[d] this is microwaves,” Hoffer wrote in a Sept. 2 note to Balaban and Georgetown University neuroethicist James Giordano, another colleague. “Definitely smacks of what we call ‘Penngazzi’. Lol.” The group discussed arguing for the Office of Naval Research, instead of the State Department, to lead an investigation into a “multi-layer” plethora of various kinds of energy beams causing the Havana injuries. They also discussed dropping a “red herring” as part of a “misinformation” campaign at their next talk, scheduled for later that week at a Pentagon-sponsored teleconference.

(As mentioned, BuzzFeed News has filed a lawsuit with the State Department for public records of Hoffer’s communications on his research.) “There was no misinformation campaign,” Hoffer told BuzzFeed News by email. The “red herring” was a symptom to distinguish real Havana syndrome patients from pretenders, he said. “Indeed, we have seen patients who present themselves as such.”

“Definitely smacks of what we call ‘Penngazzi’. Lol.”

When asked about the context of the email suggesting the State Department was trying to reclaim ownership, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine media relations director Joanna Palmer replied, by email, “Dr. Hoffer has no further comment.” Meanwhile, outside experts threw cold water on microwaves, calling the Frey effect wildly implausible as an explanation for the injuries, since its inner ear clicking noises it caused were far too weak to damage tissues. “Maybe Fidel Castro is subjecting them to an ESP attack from beyond the grave,” said University of Pennsylvania bioengineer Kenneth Foster to BuzzFeed News, when shown the discussion of the “multi-layered” radiation attack idea. Foster, who has no affiliation with UPenn’s medical school team, first described the mechanism behind the clicking effect in 1974, but is dubious it is in play in Cuba. “Unless there is some independent evidence for an exposure of some kind, one could speculate endlessly.” Nevertheless, the Pentagon teleconference received press coverage, noting Balaban’s theory of some confluence of radiation and ultrasound perhaps triggering targeted cavitation in the inner ears of the injured diplomats. “I do not believe that we are close to claiming victory. In fact, I doubt that we can identify ‘the source’ for Cuba,” Balaban wrote to ONR’s Yankaskas in the aftermath of the news coverage. In the outside world, skepticism abounded about both mystery noise-making secret weapons and the diagnoses of the research teams. On Oct. 8, 2018, a neuroscience reporter from another news outlet contacted Yankaskas at ONR, for example, asking whether they could discuss “wildly implausible” ideas that Balaban had presented, and questioned whether he had a “proprietary interest” in the diagnostic goggles. Yankaskas forwarded the interview request to Balaban the same day, writing: “He’s the same reporter that I mentioned this morning.”

The cascading effects of U.S. protectionism on U.S. producers and consumers constitute an ongoing tutorial about what Daniel Patrick Moynihan called “iatrogenic government.” In medicine, an iatrogenic ailment is one inadvertently caused by a physician or medicine. Iatrogenic government — except the damage it is doing is not inadvertent — was on display last week.

The Trump administration unveiled a plan to disburse $16 billion to farmers as balm for wounds — predictable and predicted — from the retaliation of other nations, especially China, against U.S. exports in response to the administration’s tariffs. The $16 billion does not need to be approved by Congress because not much that presidents do nowadays needs to be. The president said the sum will be paid for by the billions of dollars the treasury takes in from China. The evident sincerity of his frequently reiterated belief that exporters to the United States pay the tariffs that U.S. importers and consumers pay is more alarming than mere meretriciousness would be.

The $16 billion is not the first such tranche ($12 billion was disbursed last year), and the $28 billion probably will not be the government’s final restitution, using other people’s money, for damages it is doing. So, taxpayers who are paying more for imported goods covered by the administration’s tariffs (which are taxes Americans pay) are also paying to compensate some other Americans for injuries inflicted on them in response to the tariffs that are injuring the taxpayers.

President Trump, who deserves Winston Churchill’s description of U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles (a “bull . . . who carries his china closet with him”), has tweeted that the government could buy $15 billion worth of surplus commodities (for you keeping score at home, that would bring tariff compensation for farmers to $43 billion) from U.S farmers (“@POTUS loves his farmers,” Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has tweeted) and ship the commodities to developing nations. What could possibly go wrong?

In a masterpiece of understatement, Darci Vetter, President Barack Obama’s chief agricultural trade negotiator, told Politico that this could have “serious market implications” in recipient countries. Implications such as the devastation of local agriculture, the largest industry in many developing nations.

The administration might be pleased that some non-Chinese companies that manufacture in China are moving production elsewhere to avoid U.S. tariffs on goods from China, thereby slowing that nation’s economy. What could possibly go wrong? Presumably the administration has thought through the consequences of promoting an economic slowdown in the country that buys many U.S. goods — e.g., China is one of Boeing’s biggest customers, and Cadillac sells more cars in China than in the United States.

Zachary Karabell, an investor writing in the Wall Street Journal, has noted that China is not as vulnerable to U.S. pressure as Japan was in the 1980s, when the United States purchased about a third of Japanese exports and supplied about half of its foreign investment and much of its national defense. “China has a $700 billion trade relationship with the U.S., including imports and exports, but it has a $3 trillion trade relationship with the rest of the world.”

The New York Times recently reported that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a member of an administration that purports to be a dike against a rising tide of socialism, is “encouraging [U.S.] firms to reorient their supply chains and source their products elsewhere” — meaning, out of China. Capitalists believe that market signals, not political appointees with political agendas, give satisfactory encouragement for reasonable commercial behaviors.

Today’s system is capitalism leavened by cronyism and administered by know-it-alls. What could possibly go wrong? A report by a Federal Reserve researcher and two University of Chicago economists has found that tariffs on washing machines raised their cost by $86 on average — but also raised the prices of dryers by $92 as, the New York Times reports, “manufacturers of laundry equipment used the tariffs as an opportunity to raise prices on things that were not, in fact, affected by the tariffs.” The tariffs, according to the report, have created about 1,800 U.S. manufacturing jobs, but at a cost of more than $817,000 a job.

This is the art of the deal as practiced by him who relishes his self-bestowed sobriquet “Tariff Man,” and who explains tariffs this way: “When people or countries come in to raid the great wealth of our Nation, I want them to pay for the privilege of doing so.” Is that clear? Perhaps not, but this is: Protectionism is yet another example of government being the disease for which it pretends to be the cure.

The US just banned 12 pesticides that are like nicotine for bees. Here's how dangerous they are.,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Aria Bendix'],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.businessinsider.com/epa-banned-pesticides-killing-bees-2019-5,"Give a bee neonicotinoids, and it can become addicted.

The pesticide, whose name literally means ""nicotine-like,"" has been used commercially since the 1980s as a way to protect crops from being destroyed by insects. But it was never meant to hurt bees, which are vital to producing crops such as fruits, vegetables, and almonds.

In bees, the effects of neonicotinoids are similar to those of nicotine in humans. Not only is the pesticide detrimental to their health, but bees also tend to prefer it to their own food source. Bees that are exposed to neonicotinoids can experience problems with their central nervous systems, often resulting in impaired memory, movement, and even death.

For years, beekeepers have warned that the pesticides are killing their hives. Any major decline in honeybee numbers could have severe implications for the human diet, since bees pollinate about a third of the world's crops.

Recently, concerns about this threat translated into action in the US.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced a ban on 12 neonicotinoid pesticides from three agro-chemical companies: Syngenta, Valent, and Bayer. Seven of these pesticides are used as a protective coating for crops like soybeans, cotton, and corn.

When farmers use neonicotinoids on their crops, the pesticides can leech into water supplies, which then get absorbed by flowers that serve as vital food sources for bees. In 2017, beekeepers in the US reported losing about 40% of their hives — a trend that has continued in years since.

Read more: I attended a breakfast with food that would disappear if honeybees went extinct. It was a disturbing glimpse at a future without avocados and coffee.

Of the list of EPA-banned pesticides, six are made by Syngenta. These products contain the active ingredient thiamethoxam, a neonicotinoid that can cause bees to become hyperactive in the short term and can impair their motor function in the long term. High doses of thiamethoxam might also make honeybees less tolerant to a virus called Chronic Bee Paralysis, which can kill them.

The other EPA-banned pesticides (two from Bayer and four from Valent) contain clothianidin, a neonicotinoid that's thought to be slightly more toxic than thiamethoxam. One of Bayer's now-banned products is used as a protective coating for potatoes, while the other is a household rose- and flower-care product. In a statement, Bayer's vice president and associate general counsel, Kristine Kring, said those products aren't sold in the US and have ""little or no commercial significance"" for Bayer.

Studies have shown that clothianidin impairs a bee colony's immune response and ability to reproduce. Exposure to clothianidin especially threatens the lives of queen bees, which are the backbone of a hive. A recent study published in the journal Nature Communications found that bee colonies in clothianidin-treated fields saw up to 66% fewer males than colonies that weren't exposed to the chemical, and up to 74% fewer queen bees.

Clothianidin can also lead to colony collapse disorder, in which the majority of worker bees die out and leave behind a queen. A 2017 study in the journal Science found that exposure to clothianidin also makes colonies less likely to clear out dead or sick bees from their hives, which means more bees can become infected over time.

But agro-chemical companies like Syngenta have argued that without neonicotinoids, crops would more easily fall victim to disease or pests. They might also experience water loss, since a pesticide coating helps seal in moisture.

While the EPA ban represents a landmark win for environmentalists, it's still the result of a compromise. The decision follows a December 2018 settlement in which Syngenta, Valent, and Bayer volunteered to give up their rights to sell, use, and distribute the 12 pesticide products. This leaves 47 neonicotinoid-based products on the market.

In a statement to Business Insider, Bayer said the settlement ""represents a big win for growers, sound science, and our regulatory system.""

But the battle between agrochemical companies and environmentalists isn't over. The 47 neonicotinoids allowed by the EPA must be re-registered by 2022, giving environmentalists a few more years to push for a total ban.

The European Union has already banned almost all outdoor uses of neonicotinoids following a 2018 food safety report, which determined that the pesticide poses a risk to bees."
EPA's Fuzzy Math Not Helping Environment or Economy,https://www.realclearpolitics.com,[],05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/05/29/epas_fuzzy_math_not_helping_environment_or_economy_140438.html,"There’s nothing Washington loves better than a false dichotomy. Tax or cut. Spend or slash. Regulate or deregulate. Either you’re for the former or you’re for the latter. Well, that isn’t how life really works, and -- especially when it comes to regulation -- it certainly isn’t how manufacturers think. Everyone wants clean water and clean air, everyone wants an economy that delivers growth and opportunity, and neither idea is in conflict with the other. The challenge is how do we achieve both?

The answer is not to regulate too much or regulate too little, but simply regulate smarter. This is the common-sense idea underpinning a recent policy announcement from the Environmental Protection Agency -- something that manufacturers strongly support and, if fully enacted, something that could have the greatest positive impact on the future of American manufacturing than any other EPA action in recent memory.

Recently, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler (pictured) ordered his agency to develop reforms that would increase consistency and transparency in the consideration of costs and benefits in the EPA rule-making process. This may sound arcane, but it actually matters a lot. There is hardly any trust or balance in the current cost-benefit equation. Nor is there much transparency in the assembly process for rules and regulations that it relies on. For example, when the EPA measured the benefits of its carbon-reducing rules, it used a metric that counted benefits 300 years into the future. Of the 17 rules the EPA issued between 2000 and 2013 that cost $1 billion or more, more than 97% of the benefits claimed were from reductions of a single pollutant (particulate matter), which almost necessarily meant the EPA double-counted benefits from rule to rule.

On the cost side, the EPA regularly avoids a statutory requirement to examine the impact of its regulations on small businesses, even though small firms make up the supply chain of virtually every regulated industry. It has also displayed frustrating inconsistency from rule to rule in terms of the costs it measures. For instance, the agency’s 2010 fuel economy rule measured only the costs and benefits to cars, despite the fact that the rule simultaneously triggered New Source Review permitting requirements for millions of buildings by making greenhouse gases “regulated pollutants.”

In perhaps the most egregious example, the EPA once considered setting a standard for ozone so strict that the controls needed to meet it didn’t exist. In its cost-benefit analysis, the EPA simply called these “unknown controls” and assigned them a modest cost. We measured the true cost of these standards and arrived at a different conclusion: It would have been the most expensive regulation ever.

No one wins when an agency this important is forced to rely on a system this flawed. Overcounting benefits threatens environmental action by eroding trust in what the agency says and puts out. Undercounting costs threatens manufacturers, our economy and the livelihoods of countless middle-class workers and families who obviously bear the brunt when reality eventually sets in (as it inevitability must). No one should want either of these things, and no one should have anything to fear from a serious, reliable and consistent set of standards for measuring costs and benefits into the future. Having reliable data to go on and smarter regulations based off of that data will go a long way toward getting us all closer to the better future that -- in the end -- every American wants. Greener and cleaner. Stronger and more prosperous.

The EPA has done a good job over the years cleaning up the environment, and regulations are a big part of its success. What manufacturers need now is for the agency to get those regulations right the first time. We don’t want zero regulation. We don’t want massive regulation. We just want better regulation. The way to get there is through a smarter and more consistent evaluation of the costs and benefits that they rely on, just as the EPA administrator himself recently proposed. Now, it’s up to the administrator and his team to issue rules fixing this process for good."
Trump administration urges Supreme Court to fast-track decision on DACA,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Camilo Montoya-Galvez'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-on-daca-administration-urges-supreme-court-to-fast-track-decision-on-immigration-program/,"The Trump administration is urging the Supreme Court to quickly determine if it will hear oral arguments in a prolonged legal battle over President Trump's decision to terminate the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which shields approximately 800,000 undocumented immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children from deportation.

In a brief filed with little fanfare late last week, the Justice Department asked the conservative-leaning court to announce whether it intends to hold arguments before the end of June on several petitions concerning the administration's 2017 decision to wind down the program.

U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco, who represents the federal government before the high court, said it's ""critical"" for the justices to make a decision before they enter their summer recess. This would allow the government and plaintiffs to prepare briefs for oral arguments before the court's fall term, Francisco said in his brief.

The solicitor general raised several concerns about the prolonged litigation surrounding the program, which has been kept alive after several lower courts ruled against the administration. Francisco urged the court to ""expedite"" his request and consolidate the handful of cases for consideration next term.

In one passage, Francisco suggested that efforts by Congress to address the situation of those covered under DACA were being stymied by the ongoing court cases. ""The very existence of this pending litigation (and lingering uncertainty) continues to impede efforts to enact legislation addressing the legitimate policy concerns underlying the DACA policy,"" he wrote.

Several efforts to place young undocumented immigrants, dubbed DREAMers, on a pathway to citizenship have failed for nearly two decades. Although Mr. Trump has expressed some sympathy for this group of immigrants, he has repeatedly opposed stand-alone bills to legalize DACA recipients, and his administration did not include a permanent fix for the program in its latest immigration plan, spearheaded by White House senior adviser Jared Kushner.

In the coming weeks, House Democrats are set hold a floor vote on their latest version of the DREAM Act, which would put millions of young undocumented immigrants — as well as immigrants with temporary protections — on a pathway to U.S. citizenship.

The Supreme Court is expected to consider the Justice Department's latest petition Thursday during a closed-door session.

Since then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced in 2017 that the government would move to gradually dismantle the program, four federal circuit courts have issued injunctions — one as recently as last week — blocking the administration from ending the program. Since late last year, the Justice Department has asked the Supreme Court, which now includes two justices appointed by the president, to take up the case.

The government currently allows DACA recipients to renew their protections — valid for two years — but it is not accepting new applications."

Zinke told the Chronicle he was open to returning to Washington after the 2020 elections.

The former Navy SEAL and Montana congressman announced he would leave his post at the Department of the Interior in December of last year, following a string of ethics investigations.

Zinke’s behavior spurred more than a dozen investigations into his conduct in office, including probes into whether he improperly blocked an American Indian casino project after a competitor’s lobbying and scrutiny over a land deal involving a foundation he led and a company backed by David Lesar, chairman of oilfield services company Halliburton.

Interior’s Office of Inspector General also found that Zinke violated department policies by letting his wife travel in government vehicles, but the office cleared him of potential violations related to his official travel, including flying on a jet owned by an oil executive and using a private plane on a trip that included a political fundraiser.

Zinke was dismissive of the investigations.

“There’s an allegation and the opposition demands an investigation with great fanfare,” he said. “Washington has become a city that has a lot of anger, a lot of hatred, a lot of fake news and false allegations. The two sides are trying to destroy each other rather than work together.”"
Minneapolis police 'behind the ball' on years-old Department of Justice report,http://www.startribune.com,"['Libor Jany', 'Libor.Jany Startribune.Com', 'Glen Stubbe', 'Star Tribune']",,,,http://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-police-behind-the-ball-on-years-old-department-of-justice-report/510595072/,"When it comes to policy issues, there’s not much about the Minneapolis Police Department that Chuck Turchick doesn’t know.

So when it appeared that the department was slow to make federal government-recommended changes to how it handles potentially troublesome officers, Turchick, a longtime observer of the city’s police force, started asking questions. Others are doing the same.

More than four years after a Justice Department review of the department’s internal discipline process determined that Minneapolis police practices fell short, officials have yet to reveal which recommendations for improvement have been implemented.

The closest thing to a public answer came at a meeting this month of the Police Conduct Oversight Commission (PCOC), a policy-shaping civilian group whose monthly meetings Turchick regularly attends.

Turchick, who prides himself on being a persistent advocate of department reform, again urged the commission to push for answers about the report. Commissioner Laura Westphal said she asked for a status update earlier this year and was assured by Deputy Police Chief Henry Halvorson, who runs the professional standards bureau, that the department was working to implement the remaining recommendations.

“He agrees and admits that they are behind the ball on getting it properly organized and updating us on it,” said Westphal, one of a handful of commission holdovers from the administration of former Chief Janeé Harteau, who requested the yearlong study amid criticism of the department’s tactics.

Minneapolis Police Chief Janeé Harteau

“That’s the first positive sign that I’ve got since last July,” Turchick responded.

The report in question, released in early 2015 by the U.S. Justice Department’s Office of Justice Programs (OJP), called on the department to rethink its coaching program for officers, expand racial sensitivity training and overhaul its Early Intervention System (EIS) for flagging troubled officers and getting them help before they misbehave.

The 34-page report pointed to five key areas of improvement for the department to consider, ranging from ramping up community knowledge and trust of police oversight to addressing inconsistencies on how officers are coached.

At the time the report was released, Harteau promised a new internal data-based accountability system, replacing an old process that critics long had argued allowed bad cops to slip through the cracks.

Many of the report’s recommendations have already been implemented out of the public’s eye, department spokeswoman Sgt. Darcy Horn said via e-mail.

Harteau, who was ousted as chief in 2017 after then-officer Mohamed Noor fatally shot Justine Ruszczyk Damond, oversaw the overhaul of the EIS, which now uses metrics such as use of force, involvement in a traffic incident and sick time to evaluate officers.

After the report’s release, Harteau applauded its findings as “progressive steps we can take to enhance our community relationships and increase public trust and accountability.”

Acting on the Justice Department’s advice, the Police Department launched a two-week leadership academy for new sergeants and lieutenants, which covers topics ranging from de-escalation tactics to handling a police-involved shooting.

Additionally, the department has beefed up its community relations and communications departments, Horn said.

Still, other changes have taken longer to take hold, Horn said.

After the report’s publication, department officials pledged to establish a new EIS policy — but as of this month, Horn said, those guidelines were still taking shape. Supervisors also still don’t have direct access to information collected about their officers, but they should have it by the end of the year, she said.

Council Member Cam Gordon, who served on the communications subcommittee, says that even though current Chief Medaria Arradondo has implemented many of his predecessor’s reforms, it wouldn’t surprise him if some were either postponed or quietly abandoned. That usually happens when administrations change, he said.

“Maybe they’ve all helped to move us in the right direction slowly, but it’s hard to track what exactly happened,” he said of past reforms, adding that the OJP report only reinforced that impression. “When the chief changed, I’m not sure what kept and what didn’t.”

Imani Jaafar, who was briefly on the police conduct and oversight subcommittee, said she didn’t know whether the group’s recommendations were ever addressed, and if they were, whether that was adequately communicated to the public.

“I do think it just seemed that it was an initiative that Chief Harteau had wanted to move forward, and I haven’t really heard much about [it] at all in the last few years,” said Jaafar, director of the Office of Police Conduct Review. The city board investigates citizen complaints against Minneapolis police.

Others were less surprised by the outcome.

Longtime police critic Spike Moss said he is frustrated by the lack of federal action to enforce the changes.

“There’s no fairness, because they’re the ones who say, ‘We don’t want that investigated, we don’t want that looked at,’ ” said Moss, who was part of a 2003 federal mediation board that called for a host of reforms. “Not one office of any kind is doing something on behalf of us.”

Turchick said he has not yet heard from police officials about their plans.

In an e-mail last fall to Arradondo — on which he copied other department officials, council members and all eight PCOC commissioners — Turchick wondered “whether or how” the proposed changes have been carried out.

“In the short time I did serve on the Police Conduct and Oversight Sub-Committee, some implementation suggestions I had made were approved unanimously,” wrote Turchick, who participated in work groups involved in the report. “But I never heard what happened to those recommendations.”

Clear-cut answers have been hard to come by, Turchick said, although a department spokesman recently e-mailed him to meet to discuss his concerns about the report’s findings.

“I never get a response,” he said in a recent interview. “That is not a good way to build trust in the Police Department, and even city officials.”"
Emails show Trump EPA overruled career staff on Wisconsin air pollution,https://www.reuters.com,"['Timothy Gardner', 'Min Read']",05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-epa-smog/emails-show-trump-epa-overruled-career-staff-on-wisconsin-air-pollution-idUSKCN1SY2BP,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Politically appointed U.S. environmental officials last year overruled concerns of career scientists about air pollution in a Wisconsin county where U.S. President Donald Trump has pushed for a factory to be built by Foxconn Technology Co, newly released internal emails show.

Trump has been a supporter of the Taiwanese technology giant Foxconn building a flat screen factory in Racine County Wisconsin, a project the company said could create up to 13,000 jobs. He announced the project at a ceremony in 2017 and has claimed it is proof of his ability to revive U.S. manufacturing. Former Wisconsin governor Scott Walker, a Republican, helped secure about $4 billion in tax breaks for the project.

But Racine County has suffered some of the state’s worst cases of smog, also known as ozone, pollution that causes premature deaths from lung and heart complications.

The emails obtained by the Sierra Club and Clean Wisconsin under a freedom of information request show Trump administration officials, including then-administrator Scott Pruitt, overruled career EPA scientists to exempt Racine County from a list of counties that break smog standards. That has freed Foxconn from having to make millions of dollars in pollution control devices, if the project is eventually built.

The Racine County case is latest example of the administration overlooking concerns flagged by agency scientists over other issues such as climate change or hazardous chemicals.

“My background is in air pollution health effects and more specifically on acute exposures, so for me personally this is hard to digest and support,” Lars Perlmutt, an EPA scientist, wrote to colleagues in an April email last year about pressure to make the exemption, one of the emails shows.

Jenny Liljegren, a scientist in the air and radiation division in EPA’s Midwest region, said she was “in disbelief” about the pressure from officials to make the exemptions. “I do not see a sound technical basis for the areas we are being directed to finalize in Wisconsin.”

In an exchange of emails with Liljegren, another EPA scientist, Eric Svingen, complained that Wisconsin “cherry picked” air quality data over wider areas of the state to suggest that emissions that form smog were not ultimately doing so within the Wisconsin borders.

“These emails show is that the political leadership appeared to be injecting itself in this process in a way that’s contrary to having fact-based decisions,” said Janet McCabe, head of air quality at the EPA under former President Barack Obama.

Foxconn did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In April the company, an Apple Inc supplier, said it was committed to its contract to build the flat screen plant and research facilities in Wisconsin.

EPA spokesman Michael Abboud referred questions about the emails to a brief the agency filed May 10 in the case. The brief said that EPA considers a wide range of information in deciding which areas are in compliance with air pollution rules and that “each designation is intensely fact-driven.”

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Illinois, which neighbors Wisconsin and could see greater levels of pollution, sued the EPA last year over the exemption in Racine County and the agency is also under pressure from lawsuits from environmental groups.

In the May 10 brief, the EPA asked a federal appeals court to take another look at the smog exemption decisions under Pruitt, but until the court makes any ruling companies do not have to purchase the pollution equipment."
Kamala Harris proposes having DOJ approve new abortion laws in certain states,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/kamala-harris-proposes-having-doj-approve-new-abortion-laws-in-certain-states,"Presidential hopeful Sen. Kamala Harris released a plan Tuesday that would mandate states where past anti-abortion laws have been overturned by the courts to have any new ones approved by the Department of Justice.

“Under the plan, states and localities will be subject to the preclearance requirement if they have a pattern of violating Roe v. Wade in the preceding 25 years,” the California Democrat said.

“Any change with respect to abortion in a covered jurisdiction will remain legally unenforceable until DOJ determines it comports with the standards laid out by the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade,” she said.

Harris termed her plan the Reproduction Rights Act and wants to codify abortion into state laws nationwide. The plan also allows women and healthcare providers to sue the Department of Justice if “hostile administrations” seek to approve anti-abortion laws.

The plan, which would be similar to the Voting Rights Act, is a response to a slew of anti-abortion laws passed this year in a dozen conservative states, including Georgia, Alabama, and Missouri.

The presidential hopeful’s competitor Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., called this month for Congress to pass legislation to guarantee abortion protections if Roe v. Wade is overturned.

Harris is polling fourth in RealCearPolitics' polling average at 8%, behind former Vice President Joe Biden, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, and Warren.

"Homeland Security, Guatemala bust illegal immigrant smuggling cartel",https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Stephen Dinan']",05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/may/29/homeland-security-guatemala-bust-illegal-immigrant/,"Homeland Security agents and Guatemalan authorities busted a significant smuggling organization Wednesday, arresting nine people who were involved in transporting thousands of illegal immigrants from across the globe through Latin America and into the U.S.

The bust was the first fruit of a new cooperation agreement signed this week between the U.S. and Guatemala, authorizing the two countries to pool information and resources to go after the smugglers who are fueling the illegal immigrant surge.

Authorities dubbed the operation the Merida organization, after Lidia Fausta Merida-Lopez, whom a Homeland Security official identified as the ringleader. The organization had assets of $10 million, and facilitated smuggling of people from Guatemala, elsewhere in Central America and South America, and even from terrorist-connected countries such as Somalia and Pakistan.

“They’ve moved thousands of people,” the official said. “They’re diverse, they’re connected and linked to narcotics smuggling organizations, they’re truly a transnational criminal organization.”

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan was in Guatemala on Wednesday where he is engaged in meetings with Central American governments, looking to find ways to stop the surge of their people fleeing their countries and headed north.

Earlier this week he inked the cooperation deal with Guatemala, which he said is a geographic “chokepoint” for migration from the south up through Mexico. If the U.S. can stiffen Guatemala’s enforcement, it can cut into the overall flows.

“You’ve got to come through Guatemala, so if we can create a border security situation that’s more robust on the Guatemalan border with Honduras, the Guatemalan border with El Salvador … that’s going to disrupt this cycle,” Mr. McAleenan said.

If successful, that could give the U.S. other options besides relying on Mexico, which U.S. officials say has been an iffy partner, swinging from tough talk to lax enforcement.

The agreement he reached with Guatemala commits the U.S. to helping provide better training, information sharing and support as authorities there try to take down some of the smuggling operations that are siphoning its people away. The agreement does not call for any additional financial assistance for Guatemala, the Homeland Security official said.

He said Homeland Security Investigations agents, who are part of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), began looking into the Merida organization in January, and found it was moving “special interest aliens,” or people from countries outside the ones that usually make up illegal migration to the U.S.

The organization would charge up to $3,500 to smuggle a child into the U.S. and up to $12,500 for adults, depending on where in the U.S. the wanted to reach, and the mode of transportation it took to get them there.

Latin American press accounts said nine of the Merida organization’s 10 leaders were arrested in Wednesday’s operation. Some migrants being held by the organization were also arrested.

Both U.S. and Guatemalan authorities said the organization was set up like a franchise operation, with smugglers able to control different pieces of the methods and routes, and the organizers chiefly facilitating the passage among those operators.

They used word of mouth, their reputation for getting people successfully into the U.S., and sometimes social media to advertise their services.

The nine arrested Wednesday will be prosecuted in Guatemala.

Mr. McAleenan said taking out smuggling organizations will cut into the flow of people headed north.

“Without those organizations migrants can’t move out of the country,” he said

The operation comes as the border crisis remains a heated debate in Washington.

Congress left town last week without a deal on the $4.5 billion emergency spending request President Trump made to provide better care for the record numbers of illegal immigrant children and families streaming into the U.S. each month.

Most of that money is designated for Health and Human Services, which under a law passed by Congress is required to care for unaccompanied alien children (UAC) who arrive at the border. But some of the money is designated for Homeland Security, and would be used to feed and care for the families and children, and to replenish ICE’s detention budget.

Mr. McAleenan said he was “extremely concerned” that Congress hasn’t approved the money.

“The failure to act on that request is frankly unconscionable, and putting children at risk,” he said.

As for ICE, he said it will face “very stark choices” of either releasing more new border crossers, releasing criminals caught in the country’s interior, or slashing money in other accounts to fund ICE’s detention beds.

“I don’t like any of those choices. I prefer that Congress act on the request,” the acting secretary said.

Treasury Dept. Declines to Label China a Currency Manipulator,https://www.nytimes.com,['Alan Rappeport'],05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/us/politics/treasury-declines-to-label-china-currency-manipulator.html,"In addition, if a country actively intervenes in foreign exchange markets for six out of 12 months, rather than the current eight-month threshold, it will be closer to being flagged for manipulation.

A Treasury Department official said that even with the new thresholds, no country in recent years would have been designated. China meets only one of the thresholds, but the department used its discretion to add it to the watch list because of the size of its trade surplus.

Last week, the Commerce Department proposed a rule change that would allow the United States to expand its ability to penalize countries that manipulate their currencies.

It proposed expanding a type of remedy that is typically used to levy tariffs on products that are determined to be unfairly subsidized by foreign governments. Under the proposed rule, so-called countervailing duties could be imposed when foreign governments “subsidize” their products by weakening their currencies relative to the United States dollar, the department said.

A senior Treasury Department official said the Commerce Department proposal was a separate matter that would not affect how the Treasury executed its designations.

Although the Trump administration has complained about China’s currency practices, the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said during a congressional hearing last week that the weakening of China’s currency would help minimize the impact of Mr. Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods.

As a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump made labeling China a currency manipulator a central plank of his economic policy, promising in his “contract” with American voters that he would direct the secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator in the first 100 days of his presidency."

Parrot Among Manufacturers Chosen by DoD for U.S Army Recon Drone Program,https://dronelife.com,[],05-29-2019,2019,5,https://dronelife.com/2019/05/29/parrot-among-manufacturers-chosen-by-dod-for-u-s-army-recon-drone-program/,"The U.S. Department of Defense is looking for “eye in the sky” technologies: personal reconnaissance drones that can give soldiers on the battlefield a situational advantage.

In an effort to uncover the next-generation of short-range Reconnaissance drones for the U.S. Army, the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) and the Army’s Maneuver Center of Excellence (MCoE) are investing $11m to identify and prototype new capabilities with commercial manufacturers.

The six chosen companies are based in the U.S, with the notable exception of French manufacturer Parrot. The remaining five are Skydio, Altavian, Teal Drones, Vantage Robotics, and Lumenier.

The solicitation was issued in November 2018, with the funding going towards the development of prototypes that can support soldiers on the ground with a rapidly deployable scouting capability.

There are a few criteria that have been set out by the DIU and the MCoE as part of the solicitation process. These include a flight time of around 30 minutes, a range of up to three kilometres, a weight of three pounds or less, and a time from standard-issue rucksack to launch of less than 2 minutes.

Read more: Why the US Army DJI Ban is Probably Justified

U.S Army looks for homemade solutions

With the obvious exception of Parrot, the ambition here is clearly to develop solutions with companies based in the United States.

It should come as no surprise that industry leader DJI is not taking part in the innovation effort. There are wider issues overshadowing this particular exploration of drone technology.

Last week CNN broke the news that DHS’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has warned that Chinese-manufactured drones pose a “potential risk to an organization’s information.”

Plus, President Trump recently signed an executive order effectively stopping U.S. companies from using telecoms equipment provided by Chinese firm Huawei as an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China continues.

Even though DJI has the tech to provide the required tools to the US Army and has done in the past, it looks as though any dealings with a Chinese manufacturer are off the table. In fact, all commercial off-the-shelf drones were prohibited by the Department of Defense in May last year.

Parrot could well turn out to be the beneficiary. Founder and CEO Henri Seydoux said, “Parrot is proud to have been selected by the Army to work on this highly strategic project. The United States has always been a major market for the Parrot Group, whether it is for our well-known consumer range or our advanced professional offering.

“We have always been at the forefront creating advanced, easy to use, compact and reliable drone-based solutions. We also perfectly understand how small unmanned aircraft, such as the Parrot ANAFI platform, have the potential to become a key part of the defense system.

We look forward to focusing our advanced R&D on meeting the high standards set by the U.S. Army, to integrate drone efficiency in their day to day operations and support the world-leading U.S army.”

As hinted by Seydoux, the ANAFI platform has been designed to be adapted to suit a range of different commercial purposes. The recent ANAFI Thermal would appear to tick most of the U.S Army’s boxes.

Much will depend on the extra capabilities the chosen manufacturers can come up with. It’s easy to imagine a Skydio R1 with a range of new, security-focused skills built on top of its autonomy engine, for example.

Return of the State Department news briefing,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Carol Morello', 'National Reporter Focusing On Foreign Policy', 'State Department']",05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/return-of-the-state-department-news-briefing/2019/05/28/60b804ef-d4d5-4073-b5b0-ee4e370d9a57_story.html,"The State Department spokeswoman was at the lectern again Tuesday, fielding questions from reporters about hot spots causing diplomatic agita.

Morgan Ortagus had some dismissive words for Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and the Iranian regime. She referred questions about a Middle East peace plan to the White House. She called Secretary of State Mike Pompeo “incredibly supportive” of President Trump and his foreign policy agenda.

Nothing Ortagus said was particularly groundbreaking. But the fact she was answering reporters’ questions at all was news in itself.

Ending an intermittent hiatus, the State Department’s regular news briefing is coming back. After a couple of off-camera practice runs such as Tuesday’s, on-camera briefings are expected to resume later this week, possibly as early as Wednesday.

Ortagus has promised to try to answer questions almost every weekday when she is not traveling with Pompeo. That will come as a relief to diplomats posted at embassies around Washington who follow the briefings closely, listening for any admonitions of their government’s transgressions.

The resumption of news briefings also sets the State Department apart in an administration in which many normal practices have been abandoned.

The Defense Department has gone almost a year without a press-secretary briefing, though Kiss frontman Gene Simmons and actor Gerard Butler have both done star turns on the Pentagon podium.

The White House briefing room has been gathering dust since press secretary Sarah Sanders last showed up March 11 for only her second briefing of 2019. Trump has said he directed Sanders “not to bother” with the tradition, calling the press corps rude and inaccurate.

The State Department briefings, a fixture since the Eisenhower administration, have served a small, targeted audience looking for gleanings of a shift in U.S. foreign policy and reaction to events around the world. They amplify the United States’ message, provide guidance to embassies and diplomats in Foggy Bottom and underscore the American belief in transparency even in the case of questions from Tass and Pravda.

The State Department used to brief daily. But in the Trump administration, the timetable shrank to no more than twice a week, and often less.

Robert Palladino, the deputy spokesman, held the last briefing on April 11. That was barely a week after Ortagus was named as a replacement for Heather Nauert.

Ortagus is a Navy Reserve officer who was the spokeswoman for the U.S. Agency for International Development during the George W. Bush administration and worked in public diplomacy in Baghdad. She was an intelligence analyst and most recently a contributor on Fox News.

Ortagus describes herself as a foreign policy wonk who watched the televised State Department briefings when she was in college and had a printout portrait of former secretary Condoleezza Rice on her dorm-room wall.

In recent months, State Department officials have tried to “widen the aperture” of news organizations that cover Pompeo’s diplomacy, as Palladino was overheard telling a Christian broadcaster he invited to a briefing last month. They have invited reporters from Breitbart and the conservative website Townhall to accompany them on overseas trips while limiting the number of seats available to other media outlets."

The department asked for three weeks to make redactions on ""a few entries"" because of ongoing law enforcement efforts, and a judge said she would give the agency that time.

CNN had asked the court to make the lists public. The unsealing would not necessarily reveal the details of the court filings, but instead give the public a broader overview of how, when and for what Mueller was going to the federal court to gather evidence.

Mueller said in his final report that his team had received almost 800 search, seizure and communications warrants from federal courts in the investigation, yet his office wouldn't give more detail. It's still unknown exactly how many of those were approved by judges in federal court in DC.

Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the DC District Court has shown the government three lists of unknown length that give limited information about these matters. It is possible that the lists will reveal how often Mueller approached technology and communications companies for access to information -- with the targets of many of the warrants not named in these lists.

Trump Takes Credit for Obama’s Gains for Vets,https://www.snopes.com,['Associated Press'],05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.snopes.com/ap/2019/05/27/trump-takes-credit-for-obamas-gains-for-vets/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Boastful on the occasion of Memorial Day, President Donald Trump and his Veterans Affairs secretary are claiming full credit for health care improvements that were underway before they took office.

Trump said he passed a private-sector health care program, Veterans Choice, after failed attempts by past presidents for the last “45 years.” That’s not true. The Choice program, which allows veterans to see doctors outside the government-run VA system at taxpayer expense, was first passed in 2014 under President Barack Obama.

Trump’s VA secretary, Robert Wilkie, also is distorting the facts. Faulting previous “bad leadership” at VA, Wilkie suggested it was his own efforts that improved waiting times at VA medical centers and brought new offerings of same-day mental health service. The problem: The study cited by Wilkie on wait times covers the period from 2014 to 2017, before Wilkie took the helm as VA secretary. Same-day mental health services at VA were started during the Obama administration under Wilkie’s predecessor, David Shulkin.

A look at the claims:

TRUMP: “We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability to give our veterans the care that they deserve and they have been trying to pass these things for 45 years.” — Montoursville, Pennsylvania, rally on May 20.

THE FACTS: Wrong. Trump is not the first president in 45 years to get Congress to pass Veterans Choice; Obama did it in the wake of a scandal at VA’s medical center in Phoenix, where some veterans died while waiting months for appointments. The program currently allows veterans to see doctors outside the VA system if they must wait more than 30 days for an appointment or drive more than 40 miles (65 kilometers) to a VA facility.

Trump did expand eligibility for the program. Now, starting June 6, veterans are to have that option for a private doctor if their VA wait is only 20 days (28 for specialty care) or their drive is only 30 minutes.

Still, VA’s top health official, Dr. Richard Stone, described the new program’s start to “almost be a non-event” in testimony to Congress. That’s in part because wait times in the private sector are typically longer than at VA. In 2018, 34 percent of all VA appointments were with outside physicians, down from 36 percent in 2017.

Also key to the Choice program’s success is an overhaul of VA’s electronic medical records to allow seamless sharing of them with private physicians, a process expected to take up to 10 years. Wilkie has said full implementation of the expanded Choice program is “years” away.

WILKIE: “The first thing I did was change out the leadership at VA. … (The president) also allowed me to change out leadership in the VA centers. If someone wasn’t walking the post, getting to know the people who work for her or him, or getting to know those veterans, they had to leave. And, as a result, the Journal of the American Medical Association this year said that our waiting times are now as good or better than any in the private sector.” — interview Thursday with Fox News.

THE FACTS: It’s true that a study by the medical association came out in January that found wait times at VA medical centers on average were better than the private sector. But the improvement wasn’t a “result” of anything that Wilkie did: The study involved a period largely covering the Obama administration — and before Wilkie became acting VA secretary in late March 2018.

In fact, in a VA press release in January announcing the study’s results, Wilkie credits the department’s “concerted” effort to improve access to care “since 2014.”

The study covered four specialties, primary care, dermatology, cardiology and orthopedics.

It found that in 2014, the average wait time at VA medical centers was 22.5 days, compared with 18.7 days in the private sector, which was not statistically different. By 2017, the wait time at VA improved to 17.7 days, while increasing to 29.8 days for private doctors. Wait times at VA medical centers were shorter in all specialties except orthopedics.

According to the study, the number of patients seen yearly in VA increased slightly between 2014 and 2017, to about 5.1 million. VA patient satisfaction also rose, according to patient surveys cited in the study.

WILKIE: The VA “had suffered from bad leadership. And that’s a bipartisan comment. And the second thing I had to do was make sure that as we approach our veteran population that we make sure that they are at the center, their needs are at the center of what we do … I think we’ve had it backwards at VA for many years. … One of the things that we’re doing at VA is that we have same-day mental health service. … It is huge.” — interview with Fox News.

THE FACTS: Same-day mental health service started at VA before Trump took office in January 2017, let alone Wilkie.

VA’s effort to provide same-day primary and mental-health care when medically necessary at every VA medical center was publicized in April 2016 under the Obama administration. At the time, Shulkin was helping lead the effort as VA’s top health official. By late 2016, the department’s blog announced that the goal of same-day mental health services would be achieved by year’s end.

A Dec. 23, 2016, article in the Harvard Business Review cites new same-day services at all VA hospitals as evidence of notable progress at the department. Shulkin, who was then named by Trump to be his VA secretary, told Congress in late January 2017 the services already were fully in place.

Trump selected Wilkie to be his VA secretary after firing Shulkin in March 2018 because of ethics charges and internal rebellion at the department over the role of private care for veterans. Trump’s initial replacement choice, White House doctor Ronny Jackson, withdrew after allegations of workplace misconduct surfaced. While Wilkie has been credited by both parties in Congress for bringing stability to the department, the VA improvements he attributes to himself this past week are misplaced."
"Edmund Morris, acclaimed presidential biographer of Roosevelt and Reagan, has died at 78",https://www.cbsnews.com,['Brian Pascus'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/edmund-morris-died-acclaimed-biographer-presidents-theodore-roosevelt-ronald-reagan-dead-age-78/,"Edmund Morris, the famed author who wrote acclaimed presidential biographies of Theodore Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan, died Friday in Danbury, Connecticut, according to The New York Times. The cause of death was not disclosed, though The Times did report the 78-year-old was at a hospital following a stroke he suffered Thursday.

Morris was a true master of biographical literature. He won the 1980 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography and the 1980 National Book Award for biography for his first book, ""The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt."" The book was the first in a trilogy of works exploring the 26th president's life, the others being ""Theodore Rex,"" published in 2001 and ""Colonel Roosevelt,"" published in 2010.

Edmund Morris, author of ""Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan,"" poses at Random House in New York, Wednesday, Sept. 29, 1999. Morris said he welcomes the controversy over the literary technique he uses in the biography, in which he makes himself a fictional character in Reagan's early life and invents a few other people, too. (AP Photo/Marty Lederhandler) MARTY LEDERHANDLER

In 1999, he published his most controversial work, ""Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan,"" an authorized biography written in an experimental style. Starting in 1985, Morris had been granted ""fly-on-the-wall"" privileges by the Reagan White House, allowing him to interview the President and First Lady and their children. He wrote the biography to include a fictional Edmund Morris who was added to the narrative as an observer and one of Reagan's childhood friends. Within the book, the fictional Edmund Morris told the story of the 40th president's life from his childhood in Illinois to the White House. While some praised the book, others were not so kind.

Morris was born May 27, 1940 in Nairobi, Kenya, the son of South African parents. He married Sylvia Jukes Morris in 1968. According to the author's Penguin Random House biography page, Morris worked as an advertising copywriter in London before immigrating to the United States in 1968. His other biographies included a work on Ludwig von Beethoven titled ""Beethoven: The Universal Composer"" as well as a collection of essays.

According to The New York Times, he is survived by his wife, a brother, Eric and a sister, Judy Davidowitz."
"Former Homeland Security chief Janet Napolitano sees many dangers, but not from migrants",https://www.azcentral.com,"['Ronald Hansen', 'Published A.M.

Guns, cyberwarfare and climate change currently pose the biggest threats to the U.S., not undocumented immigrants, said Janet Napolitano, the former secretary of Homeland Security and former Arizona governor.

""If you watch the news today, you would think the Department of Homeland Security was really the Department of the Southwest Border because that's all it does,"" Napolitano told about 250 people Tuesday night at the Madison Center for the Arts in Phoenix. ""In terms of evaluating what risks really affect the security and safety of Americans, I would not put the southwest border on the list. It's not a threat to the safety of Americans.""

Napolitano, a Democrat who served in President Barack Obama's Cabinet, outlined a politically charged message of her new book, ""How Safe Are We? Homeland Security Since 9/11,"" which seems to run counter to President Donald Trump's central concern of tightening security along the nation's southern border.

During an hour-long talk led by Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego, Napolitano said that, in some ways, the nation is safer than it once was, such as in preventing the specific kind of attack terrorists used in 2001 in New York, Virginia and Pennsylvania.

For more stories that matter, subscribe to azcentral.com.

But the nation remains ""woefully ill-prepared"" on other threats, she said.

Napolitano acknowledged few consider climate change a homeland security issue.

She said the more extreme weather it brings, from wildfires to tornadoes and hurricanes, kill people and destroy property. Additionally, it fuels drought, disease and discord in other parts of the world, such as Syria and Yemen, which can breed terrorist threats, she said.

""That's another connection between global warming and homeland security,"" Napolitano said.

The United States treats mass killings by gunfire as a law-enforcement issue, she said but doesn't adequately explore the public-health implications of such violence.

And the nation has done almost nothing meaningful to prevent cyberattacks, most notably including Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, Napolitano said.

""Our nation's critical infrastructure — our utilities, our telecommunications, our banks, our water systems, our traffic systems — are all linked. And they're all susceptible to hacking,"" she said. ""This country is still woefully ill-prepared to protect itself and its critical infrastructure.""

Asked by an audience member about the increases in migrants entering the nation from points in California and Arizona, Napolitano took a swipe at the Trump administration's former practice of separating migrant families, which was halted after a public outcry.

""I think that the whole family-separation debacle was government malpractice at every level,"" she said.

The problem, according to Napolitano, began with a legal decision to charge people apprehended at the border as criminals, taking the matter from Homeland Security, which routinely handles such cases, and put it in the hands of agencies like the Bureau of Prisons, which doesn't accommodate families.

Doing so, she said, required the additional intervention of the Department of Health and Human Services as well.

""It was a wrong policy and it was contrary to our values the way that happened,"" Napolitano said. ""I'm glad that it seems to have stopped.""

Napolitano, the president of the University of California, was twice elected governor of Arizona in 2002 and 2006. She left the post in 2009 to serve as Obama's first Homeland Security chief. She left that position for her current job in 2013.

Napolitano has touted the presidential prospects for former Vice President Joe Biden, whom she recently described on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" as the kind of Democrat who could win in a traditionally Republican-leaning state such as Arizona. Western Democrats are a different breed than East Coast Democrats, she said.

""I’m not surprised Vice President Biden has come out of the gates so strongly because I do believe within the Democratic Party there is a core, a core of what I think of as kind of pragmatic progressives who want the country to be working in a more united fashion,"" Napolitano said.

""They’re very conscious and supportive of civil rights, women's rights and human rights, but also kind of skeptical of some of the ideas coming from the far left.""

"State Department calls Russian, Syrian airstrikes a 'reckless escalation'",https://thehill.com,[],05-28-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/international/middle-east-north-africa/445802-state-department-calls-russian-syrian,"The State Department on Tuesday called recent Russian and Syrian government airstrikes in northwest Syria a “reckless escalation” as Syrian president Bashar Assad seeks to oust rebels from the country’s Idlib province.

“Indiscriminate attacks on civilians and public infrastructure such as schools, markets and hospitals is a reckless escalation of the conflict and is unacceptable,” State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said.

“The violence must end,” she added.

Recent government airstrikes, backed by Assad’s allies in Moscow, have uprooted more than 300,000 people and killed 229 civilians, according to the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations.

The statement came nearly a week after the State Department said it had seen signs that Assad may have renewed his use of chemical weapons in northwest Syria, warning Damascus of a quick response if such an attack were proved.

Idlib is home to thousands of anti-government fighters and has been a focal point of clashes as Assad seeks to wipe out any remaining opposition to his government.

Syria's civil war first began in 2011 and has left hundreds of thousands of civilians dead and forced millions of Syrians to flee violence.

Lindsey Graham: Not One Democrat Cares If FISA Court Was Defrauded By FBI And DOJ,https://www.realclearpolitics.com,[],05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/05/26/lindsey_graham_not_one_democrat_cares_if_fisa_court_was_defrauded_by_fbi_and_doj.html,"This week on ""FOX News Sunday,"" Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham said he strongly supported President Trump's decision to authorize the attorney general to declassify information related to the Russia investigation and he is disappointed that the Democrats don't seem interested in finding out more about why and how the investigation started.



""I want all the documents around the FISA warrant application released. I want to find out exactly how the counterintelligence operation began. I think transparency is good for the American people. Not one Democrat seems to care.""





""I was the hero when I said let's support Mueller,"" Graham said. ""I wish some Democrat would come forward to find out if the FISA court was defrauded by the FBI and the Department of Justice.""



""We’re not compromising national security here. We’re trying to create a system to make sure this never happens again by shedding light on what happened with the FISA warrant process, the counterintelligence investigation,"" he also said. ""Did they have a lawful reason to surveil President Trump's campaign?""



""Did they lie to the FISA court? Every American should want to find that out.""





And joining us now from South Carolina, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee.



Senator, President Trump, as we just reported, has given Attorney General Barr, quote, full and complete authority to get in declassify all government secrets related to the Russia investigation. Here is the president.



DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I declassified everything, everything they want. I put it under the auspices of the attorney general. He's going to be in charge of it.



WALLACE: Senator, any problem with that?



SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: No, not at all from my point of view. I was one of the Republicans insisting that Mueller be allowed to do his job. I never thought it was a witch hunt. The report is in, no collusion. No -- you know, Mueller didn't do anything on obstruction.



Now, I’m insisting that we get to the bottom of this. I want all the documents around the FISA warrant application released. I want to find out exactly how the counterintelligence operation began. I think transparency is good for the American people. Not one Democrat seems to care.



I was the hero when I said let's support Mueller. I wish some Democrat would come forward to find out if the FISA court was defrauded by the FBI and the Department of Justice.



So, I support Attorney General Barr to make this as transparent as possible.



WALLACE: Critics make two points, particularly about this issue of declassifying, because these are, after all, the crown jewels of the intelligence community, including reportedly the identity of a key informant who is close to Vladimir Putin.



Here are the two questions that they raised: One, can Barr be trusted with these secrets? And two, can he be trusted not to cherry-pick the information to make a case for the president?



GRAHAM: Well, I think he can be trusted. I’m going to look at this. You know, nobody doubted my trust or my ability to be fair when I supported Mueller.



The people who are about this are worried about being exposed for taking the law in their own hands. It doesn't surprise me that the people we are looking at, they don't want transparency.



We’re not compromising national security here. We’re trying to create a system to make sure this never happens again by shedding light on what happened with the FISA warrant process, the counterintelligence investigation. Did they have a lawful reason to surveil President Trump's campaign? Did they lie to the FISA court?



Every American should want to find that out.

"Trump EPA backs away from smog breaks for Foxconn, Indiana steel mills",https://www.chicagotribune.com,['Michael Hawthorne'],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-met-foxconn-indiana-smog-trump-epa-20190516-story.html,"When the Trump administration exempted parts of the Chicago area last year from federal limits on lung-damaging smog, it delivered a huge financial break to steel mills, chemical plants and other industries that are some of the region’s biggest polluters.

Scott Pruitt, who at the time headed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, also freed the Foxconn Technology Group from spending millions of dollars on pollution-control equipment as it builds a new electronics plant in southeast Wisconsin, just north of the Illinois border in an area with some of the region’s dirtiest air.

But faced with a legal challenge from environmental groups and a coalition of cities and states, including Chicago and Illinois, federal lawyers are having second thoughts about Pruitt’s controversial decision.

In a few densely worded paragraphs buried at the end of a 63-page document, attorneys for the EPA and Justice Department asked a federal appeals court this month for what, in legal terms, amounts to a do-over.

Administration officials aren’t admitting they did anything wrong, the lawyers contend. But they can see EPA data showing the region’s smog problems are getting worse, not better, and that polluters in four counties singled out by Pruitt for special treatment are contributing to chronically dirty air breathed by millions of people.

The court shouldn’t rule against the Trump administration, the lawyers pleaded. Rather, they said, it “could benefit from additional explanations” and the EPA could end up revising its designations.

“These federal attorneys looked at the record, relied on their professional judgment and realized there isn’t any evidence to justify Pruitt’s last-minute switcheroo,” said Howard Learner, executive director of the Environmental Law and Policy Center, one of the nonprofit groups that sued to overturn the EPA’s smog designations in Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin.

By dramatically reducing the size of areas required to crack down on dirty air, Pruitt overruled the agency’s career scientists, a move that saved Foxconn and other polluters from either installing more effective pollution-control equipment, scaling back production to reduce emissions or brokering costly trading agreements with cleaner industries.

Other beneficiaries included then-Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican who made Foxconn the centerpiece of his 2018 re-election campaign. Walker already had wooed the company to Racine County with $3 billion in financial incentives, promises to relax state environmental laws and access to Lake Michigan water.

Walker, who ended up losing to Democrat Tony Evers in November, blamed Chicago for making the air unhealthy to breathe in Wisconsin. But an EPA staff analysis concluded Wisconsin is at least partially responsible for its own smog problems, and documents filed with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources show Foxconn will be a major new source of smog-forming pollution.

Newly released emails show EPA scientists strongly objected to Pruitt’s decision, which they said could not be supported with data despite political pressure from Trump administration officials and then-House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican. The emails were obtained Friday by the Sierra Club and Clean Wisconsin as part of a federal public records request.

“I do not see a sound technical basis for the areas we are being directed to finalize in Wisconsin,” Jennifer Liljegren, an EPA scientist, wrote to colleagues in an April 11, 2018, email. “I will need the wordsmithing of the legal and policy experts if we are really going to do this — I am still in disbelief.”

One of the recipients of that email, EPA scientist Lars Perlmutt, replied, “I have a background in air pollution health effects and more specifically on acute exposures, so for me personally, this is hard to digest and support.”

Another email from Liljegren concluded that Wisconsin polluters are responsible for up to 15 percent of the smog detected by air quality monitors — enough to register violations in all of the areas exempted by Pruitt.

Smog, also known as ground-level ozone, is formed by a reaction between sunlight and pollution from car tailpipes, power plants and factories, fumes from volatile solvents and gasoline vapors. After a scientific review required every five years by the federal Clean Air Act, the Obama EPA tightened the national smog standard in 2015 to 70 parts per billion, down from the 75 ppb limit set during the Bush administration.

Average smog concentrations in the counties at issue exceeded the new federal limit during the past three years, according to monitoring data. In Racine County, for instance, smog levels peaked at 90 ppb last year and averaged 78 ppb between 2016 and 2018, even without Foxconn operating.

More perplexing is Pruitt’s reversal of the EPA staff designation for northwest suburban McHenry County.

Unlike Wisconsin officials, who under Walker insisted the state’s air was clean enough to pass muster, the Illinois EPA had repeatedly included McHenry in its lists of areas required to take additional smog-fighting measures. Monitoring data supports that decision: Smog concentrations in McHenry averaged 72 ppb between 2016 and 2018 and peaked at 77 ppb last year.

But Alec Messina, a former industry lobbyist who headed the state agency under Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, abruptly reversed course after phone conversations with Clint Woods, a top Pruitt aide."
CoreLogic Counsel Leaves Amid Federal Antitrust Inquiry,https://therealdeal.com,['Kevin Rebong'],05-29-2019,2019,5,https://therealdeal.com/national/2019/05/29/corelogics-chief-counsel-is-leaving-the-company-as-it-deals-with-a-doj-inquiry/,"The move comes a week after the US Department of Justice demanded the multiple listings service vendor hands over its data

The chief legal officer at CoreLogic, the multiple listings service vendor and housing analytics firm, is leaving the company as it handles an inquiry by the U.S. Justice Department into multiple listings services.

In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said Arnold Pinkston had “accepted another professional opportunity” and would leave the company June 14 and that his departure is “not the result of any disagreements with the company.”

Last week, CoreLogic notified clients of a request by the U.S. Department of Justice for MLS data relating to buyer broker commissions and its policy language around the appropriate handling of the data.

Multiple listings service vendors and major residential brokerages have received increasing scrutiny for antitrust concerns in recent months following a class action lawsuit filed by homesellers. The lawsuit was filed last year against the “big four” national residential brokerage companies Realogy, Re/MAX, HomeServices of America and Keller Williams, as well as the National Association of Realtors. It alleges the brokerages conspired with the industry group to determine buyer agents’ compensation by introducing rules that require all brokers to offer buyer broker compensation when listing a property on a MLS. As a result, the homesellers allege this has driven up costs to the seller and stifled competition.

CoreLogic was targeted in a separate lawsuit earlier this month in Texas, where the Austin Board of Realtors have accused the firm of selling home sale data to a local appraisal organization."

IOWA -- Iowa's USDA staff are encouraging landowners interested in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) to visit local service centers soon. Saying it is important to plan before crop growth makes it difficult to examine the field.

The USDA is accepting new CRP applications beginning June 3rd.

The Farm Service Agency (FSA) announced a limited continuous CRP signup in the 2018 Farm Bill, prioritizing water-quality practices.

That includes grassed waterways, filter strips, saturated buffers, and wetland restoration.

Iowa's State Director of the FSA Amanda De Jong says, “Producers new to the program and those with expiring CRP contracts need to visit our offices to enroll or reenroll. Visiting our offices early will ensure timely processing of CRP applications.”

Continuous signup enrollment contracts last 10 to 15 years."
DoJ Should Butt Out of the Qualcomm Case,https://www.eetimes.com,"['George Leopold', 'Brian Santo']",,,,https://www.eetimes.com/author.asp?section_id=36&doc_id=1334751,"By , 1

The United States Department of Justice, whose mission is to enforce the law and administer justice (however elusive) is meddling in an antitrust case in which a federal judge struck down the core of dominant wireless chip maker Qualcomm’s business model.

The landmark ruling issued earlier this month by U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh prohibits Qualcomm from cutting exclusive licensing deals. Judge Koh also decided Qualcomm must make key modem chip IP available under license to its chip rivals. The ruling comes as the rollout of 5G wireless technology emerges as a national security cause célèbre for the Trump administration that has effectively blacklisted 5G first-mover and modem chip also-ran Huawei.

DoJ Weighs in on FTC vs. Qcomm

“There is a sufficient likelihood that Qualcomm will hold monopoly power in the 5G modem chip market such that exclusive dealing agreements for the supply of modem chips could foreclose competition in that emerging market,” Judge Koh wrote.

Judge Lucy Koh is being pressured by the feds.

The Justice Department inappropriately sought to sway Koh’s ruling when it undertook the unusual and highly political step of filing a “statement of interest” that constitutes another shot across the bow of an independent American judiciary. Judge Koh was essentially being pressured to think twice before ruling against Qualcomm, which few would dispute has a stranglehold in the 5G modem chip market.

Not even mighty Intel Corp. is willing to take on Qualcomm in the 5G silicon race, exiting the market as soon as Qualcomm settled a cellular patent dispute with Apple last month. (Judge Koh’s ruling invalidates that deal.)

There was a time in conservative economic theory when the government kept its paws off of emerging markets. In those days, the government dared not pick “winners and losers.” Just as what is left of the Republican Party in the Trump era no longer cares about federal budget deficits, the bedrock principle of not favoring one corporation or technology over another has gone the way of the dodo bird.

It is widely assumed DoJ will keep up the pressure on Judge Koh to go easy on Qualcomm, citing U.S. national security concerns as the Trump Administration continues to target 5G competitor Huawei. In so doing, it reinforces a troubling pattern by politicizing the administration of justice. Mark A. Lemley, a law professor at Stanford University, hardly a bastion of antitrust fervor, told our Rick Merritt: “This is a very surprising move by the DOJ. It is extremely rare for them to interfere in the Federal Trade Commission’s cases.”

Back in the 1990s, we interviewed Huawei officials at its sprawling headquarters in Shenzhen. At the time, there was growing suspicion that Huawei had pilfered key networking technologies from its U.S. partner Cisco Systems. During our interview, Huawei managers sized us up, sticking with strictly technical subjects and the marketing spiels they had just learned to master.

Finally, we asked about the Cisco allegations. Interview over!

Huawei’s unwillingness to even address the IP theft issue was telling. We had hit a raw nerve. As the Trump administration targets Huawei, one cannot help but think the country standing for free enterprise and unprecedented technological innovation is behaving in much the same way as those Huawei bosses.

Justice Department meddling in the Federal Trade Commission case against Qualcomm isn’t just troubling. It threatens to undermine the rule of law and the principle of an independent judiciary.

From an antitrust standpoint, FTC actions are often about changing corporate behavior. A decade ago, Intel wisely settled when the agency alleged anticompetitive behavior. The chip maker moved on and the processor market continued to thrive.

Qualcomm can appeal Judge Koh’s ruling, as it promises to do. Fine. That’s how our judicial system works. Meantime, the Justice Department should butt out and let justice takes its course.

"At DHS’s Biometric Technology Rally, fresh faces for hungry hardware",https://www.fedscoop.com,['Tajha Chappellet-Lanier'],05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.fedscoop.com/2019-dhs-biometric-tech-rally/,"Written by Tajha Chappellet-Lanier

The use of biometric technology by federal law enforcement agencies is drawing increased public scrutiny and even bipartisan calls for regulation. But at a Department of Homeland Security event earlier this month in Maryland, people were literally lining up to help the government improve its use of the hardware.

DHS’s Biometric Technology Rally, the first edition of which took place in 2018, focuses on gathering performance data in order to assess and potentially improve the capabilities of available facial recognition technology, fingerprint scanners and iris-scanning systems — or sometimes a combination thereof.

Over the course of two weeks, 12 companies tested their technologies on more than 400 paid volunteers. Assigned to 12 side-by-side “lanes” inside the cavernous back room of the Maryland Test Facility (MdTF), the invited companies were looking to see how their respective hardware would perform when faced with long lines of people. Did the system capture the data necessary to make an identification? How quickly? Was it intuitive for a diverse group of volunteers?

“Our real focus here is to work on these technologies, to make sure that they are more effective, and to figure out how to make sure that they are more likely to be acceptable, easy to use for the general public,” Arun Vemury, director of DHS’s Biometric Technology Center, told reporters from the waiting room-like entrance of MdTF in Upper Marlboro. Signs on the walls warned against “unauthorized photos.”

“We don’t just want to have technologies that are out there that are difficult or hard to use,” Vemury said. “All of these things lead to failures, lead to problems, lead to negative perceptions on the use of the technologies.”

For companies, participating in the rally is a way to get essentially free performance data. Normally, one company told FedScoop, they would collect this kind of data by commissioning a study. But this can get pricey. In this case, the Science and Technology Directorate’s research and development budget foots the bill — Vemury said a test like this one can cost anywhere from several hundred thousand dollars up to $1 million.

For DHS, meanwhile, the rally is a chance to see what’s out there. It’s also, importantly, a chance to shape what’s out there. “We want people to try hard things and be innovative here,” Vemury said.

And there was some evidence of this innovation among the 12 participants — multinational “augmented identity” company IDEMIA, for example, was testing a slightly awkward mockup of a combination face-and-contactless-fingerprint-scanner station. A representative of the relatively new SAFR team at RealNetworks, which identifies faces in live video, said his project is a “startup” compared to the others. RealNetworks — which initially made its name making software for streaming internet video in the 1990s — will use the results of the rally as a way to decide whether this is a tech capacity they want to invest in further, he said.

To encourage this kind of risk-taking, DHS will mask the names of the company participants when it releases the results of the rally.

Conversation about some of the more controversial issues surrounding biometrics — privacy, civil liberties and the like — existed only in a very peripheral sense at the MdTF. A few of the companies using iris-scanning technology quietly mentioned that their tech requires the consent of the scanned, but they did not necessarily explain how that fact distinguishes them from other forms of biometrics.

Facial recognition companies — the segment of the industry that tends to face the most criticism — touted the “convenience” of their systems and cited real-world deployments across the globe. Vemury spoke about the value of exposing regular people (the volunteers) to how these technologies actually work — television portrayals “might not be realistic,” he suggested. He mentioned the task of making biometric security “publicly acceptable” on several occasions.

Volunteers seemed sold. One regular volunteer, who found out about the opportunity in an ad at his local fire station, told FedScoop he likes to travel and would happily trade his face for in-airport convenience. “I think it’s fantastic,” he said.

The second part of the rally, which has yet to be completed, will see DHS test 15 competing matching algorithms."
