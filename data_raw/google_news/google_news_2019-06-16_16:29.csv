President Donald Trump may not be seeing red, white and blue on a newly revamped Air Force One after all.

A House Democrat added a provision to the annual defense policy bill to put a stop to the president's patriotic design project. It will keep two new versions of the Boeing 747 aircraft within the projected spending target by banning certain paint jobs and other extras.

Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Conn., said the provision is necessary to avoid extra spending that goes beyond the project's $3.9 billion budget. The contract for the planes includes an ""over and under"" clause that could allow the project spending to go out of control, he warned.

""It will be a well-appointed plane when the new ones roll out,"" Courtney said during a marathon session for the defense legislation before the House Armed Services Committee ""What we're trying to do is just make sure that the 'over and above' clause provision of the Air Force One contract does not become basically a back door for the program to hemorrhage in terms of additional costs.""

The amendment was adopted at the end of the hours-long hearing Thursday morning as part of the House panel's overall passage of the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA.

The amendment comes just days after Trump was lauding a new rendering of the jet during an interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos. Some said the new look would take its traditional colors from shades of blue to red, white and blue that appeared very similar to the president's campaign look.

Trump also said it's a much bigger version than the current model.

""Here's your new Air Force One and I'm doing that for other presidents not for me,"" Trump told Stephanopolous.

Boeing and Trump reached a new $3.9 billion deal on the plan in July. The new Air Force One could be unveiled as early as 2024.

Courtney said concerns on spending arose in June 2018 after the Air Force sought to add a new $25 million refrigeration system to the president's plane.

The Connecticut Democrat, who chairs the House Armed Services subpanel on Seapower and Projection Forces, said his committee got involved in the issue after word of the plan got out.

""Our subcommittee ...is trying to exercise more oversight,"" he said.

Courtney said the committee coordinated with then-Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson, who then cancelled the plans for that system."
"Immigrants’ sponsors to be on hook for ‘every dollar’ if new arrivals end up on dole, new Trump appointee warns",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Dom Calicchio', 'Ken Cuccinelli', 'Acting Director', 'U.S. Citizenship', 'Immigration Services']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/immigrants-sponsors-to-be-on-hook-for-every-dollar-if-they-end-up-on-dole-new-trump-appointee-warns,"Sponsors of legal immigrants to the United States received word Friday that they’ll be on the hook “for every dollar” if those immigrants end up receiving welfare funds or other public support instead of earning a living and paying taxes.

The message came Ken Cuccinelli, a former Virginia state attorney general who last week became acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) following his appointment by President Trump.

“If the sponsored immigrant receives any federal means-tested public benefits, the sponsor will be expected to reimburse the benefits-granting agency for every dollar of benefits received by the immigrant,” Cuccinelli wrote in a USCIS memo.

“If the sponsored immigrant receives any federal means-tested public benefits, the sponsor will be expected to reimburse the benefits-granting agency for every dollar of benefits received by the immigrant.” — Ken Cuccinelli, acting director, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services

'Enforceable contract'

In addition, the same message instructed agents who work for USCIS to remind applicants and sponsors that “the Affidavit of Support is a legal and enforceable contract between the sponsor and the federal government.”

TRUMP NAMES IMMIGRATION HARDLINER CUCCINELLI AS ACTING HEAD OF USCIS

According to Cuccinelli, all federal agencies dealing with immigration issues will be working to update or initiate procedures and regulations to make sure that immigrants who are ineligible for public benefits do not receive them, in accordance with a May 23 directive from the president.

PRESIDENT TRUMP: 'I DON'T WANT IMMIGRANTS THAT WILL BE DEPENDENT ON WELFARE'

“The President has made it a priority to ensure that every individual who seeks to come to the United States is self-sufficient, temporarily or permanently,” Cuccinelli wrote. “The principle of self-sufficiency has been enshrined in our immigration laws since the 1800s, and we as an agency must ensure that immigrants who become part of this great country abide by this principle.”

“The President has made it a priority to ensure that every individual who seeks to come to the United States is self-sufficient, temporarily or permanently.” — Ken Cuccinelli, acting director, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services

Cuccinelli took over at USCIS last Monday, coming to the job with a reputation as a hardliner on immigration issues. For example, he has been an advocate for denying citizenship to American-born children of parents living in the U.S. illegally and for limiting in-state tuition at public universities to citizens or legal residents.

He replaced Lee Francis Cissna, who reportedly had lost President Trump’s confidence.

Critical of McConnell, others in GOP

But Trump likely named Cuccinelli an acting director because his chances of winning Senate confirmation were said to be slim, Roll Call reported.

The outspoken Cuccinelli, as president of the Senate Conservatives Fund, a political action committee that has opposed many incumbent Republicans, has been critical of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and others in the GOP.

“Mitch McConnell has filled the Senate with people like Lisa Murkowski, John McCain, Shelley Moore Capito, Lamar Alexander and Dean Heller who all promised the voters they would repeal Obamacare, but when the time came to do it they refused,” Cuccinelli wrote in an August 2017 fundraising memo, according to Roll Call. “Instead of admitting his mistake, McConnell is blaming the President for having ‘excessive expectations’ even though he was the one who set those expectations with years of empty promises!”

Trump’s appointment of Cuccinelli came as the president is dealing with a growing crisis as tens of thousands of Central American migrants cross the U.S.-Mexico border each month, overwhelming the system, and he has struggled to deliver on his signature issue of reduced immigration and tighter border security.

State Department says senior UN official’s visit to China 'highly inappropriate',https://www.foxnews.com,['Ben Evansky'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/state-department-says-senior-un-officials-visit-to-china-highly-inappropriate,"The State Department criticized an upcoming visit of the UN’s counter-terrorism Czar to China as, “highly inappropriate,” after it was revealed the official was going to a province that has witnessed persecution of ethnic Muslims for their religious beliefs by the Chinese government.

The U.N. has faced ongoing criticism of cozying up to China – adding fuel to the fire the U.N. has allowed Vladimir Voronkov, the United Nations Under-Secretary for the UN’s counter-terrorism office to visit Xinjiang, which is home to some one million persecuted Uighur and ethnic Muslims.

State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said that Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan called UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Friday, “to convey deep concerns,” regarding Vornonkov’s planned visit to Xinjiang, China.

“The Deputy Secretary expressed that such a visit is highly inappropriate in view of the unprecedented repression campaign underway in Xinjiang against Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other Muslims.”

US SPEAKS UP FOR MINORITY MUSLIM UIGHURS IN CHINA - WHILE ISLAMIC COUNTRIES STAY MOSTLY SILENT

Ortagus continued, “The Deputy Secretary noted that Beijing continues to paint its repressive campaign against Uighurs and other Muslims as legitimate counterterrorism efforts when it is not, and stressed that the UN’s topmost counterterrorism official is putting at risk the UN’s reputation and credibility on counterterrorism and human rights by lending credence to these false claims.”

Proposing a solution, “The Deputy Secretary advocated for unmonitored and unhindered access to all camps and detainees in Xinjiang by UN human rights officials.”

China has faced growing scrutiny over its internment camps that hold approximately 1 million Muslims in the Xinjiang region of Western China.

A recent State Department country report on human rights practices in China noted: “Members of the minority Uighur ethnic group reported systematic torture and other degrading treatment…survivors stated that authorities subjected individuals in custody to electrocution, waterboarding, stress positions, injection of unknown substances and cold cells.”

In April, Antonio Guterres the UN Secretary-General faced criticism for not raising the issue of the Uighurs directly with President Xi Jinping on a visit there. Instead, his spokesman told reporters that he had discussed the situation in Xinjiang with, “Chinese authorities.”

KEANU REEVES' PICTURE AMONG TOOLS IN CHINA'S CRACKDOWN ON UIGHUR MINORITY

China’s new ambassador to the UN in Geneva confirmed to reporters this week that China had invited Michelle Bachelet, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit the camps in the region. Her spokesperson told the Associated Press that her office is in negotiations for “full access,” for the trip to take place.

Last month during a session of the UN Human Rights Council in Switzerland, the Executive Director of UN Watch, Hillel Neuer, took to the floor against the continuous objections of China and described the conditions ethnic Muslims were living under.

“Surveillance and repression in Xinjiang has increased dramatically,” he said. “Biometric data is collected from residents, passports confiscated, religious activity restricted. China bans long beards, public prayers and Muslim veils.”

Despite its human rights violations, China is a member of the U.N. Human Rights Council.

The Trump administration withdrew from the UN Human Rights Council in June of last year. Nikki Haley, the then United States ambassador to the UN said the council was, “a protector of human rights abusers, and a cesspool of political bias.”

"A President With a Taste for Planes Has a Plan for Air Force One: Paint It Red, White and Blue",https://www.nytimes.com,['Katie Rogers'],06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/14/us/politics/trump-air-force-one-paint-job.html,"WASHINGTON — As someone who fancies himself an aviation expert — he did once have his own airline, after all — President Trump indulged his interest this week in a number of ways.

He ordered an F-35, a (very loud) $80 million fighter jet, to fly over the White House during the visit of the president of Poland. He stood on the South Lawn watching the landing of a pricey new VH-92 helicopter, which is referred to as Marine One when he is aboard. And in maybe his most satisfying moments of the week, he detailed his plans to give Air Force One — perhaps the most famous plane in the world — a new paint job.

“I like the concept of red, white and blue,” Mr. Trump said in an interview with “Fox & Friends” on Friday, describing the makeover he envisions for the plane, a specially fitted Boeing 747 with iconic cyan and white coloring. “The baby blue doesn’t fit with us.”

For other presidents, all of this would have amounted to a few too many aeronautical activities to stuff into a week packed with mounting aggression toward Iran, tariff threats and a head-of-state visit. Not for this one. In fact, it’s hard not to think that this sort of sky-toy-packed schedule is closer to what Mr. Trump, with his peculiar fixation with all things aviation, originally envisioned for his presidency."

"U.S., others object to U.N. counterterrorism chief visit to China's Xinjiang",https://www.reuters.com,"['Michelle Nichols', 'Min Read']",06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-rights-un/u-s-others-object-to-u-n-counterterrorism-chief-visit-to-chinas-xinjiang-idUSKCN1TF2NW,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States and other western countries have objected to a visit by the United Nations counterterrorism chief to China’s remote Xinjiang, where U.N. experts say some one million ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims are held in detention centers.

Vladimir Voronkov, a veteran Russian diplomat who heads the U.N. Counterterrorism Office, is in China at the invitation of Beijing and is due to visit Xinjiang’s capital Urumqi, according to an email sent by his office to countries that raised concerns.

Diplomats said that along with the United States several other countries, including Britain, also complained.

U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan spoke with U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres on Friday “to convey deep concerns” about Voronkov’s trip because “Beijing continues to paint its repressive campaign against Uighurs and other Muslims as legitimate counterterrorism efforts when it is not.”

“The Deputy Secretary expressed that such a visit is highly inappropriate in view of the unprecedented repression campaign underway in Xinjiang against Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other Muslims,” the U.S. State Department said in a statement.

“The U.N.’s topmost counterterrorism official is putting at risk the U.N.’s reputation and credibility on counterterrorism and human rights by lending credence to these false claims,” the statement said.

China has been condemned internationally for setting up the detention complexes, which it describes as “education training centers” helping to stamp out extremism and give people new skills. Western states are worried Voronkov’s visit will validate China’s justification for the centers, diplomats said.

“China will, and is, actively saying that what they’re doing in Xinjiang is good terrorism prevention,” said a U.N. Security Council diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.

“The visit by Voronkov validates their narrative that this is a counterterrorism issue, when we would see it more as a human rights issue,” said the diplomat, adding that if Voronkov did not speak out after visiting Xinjiang then “silence could be seen as implicit acceptance, at worst U.N. complicity.”

The email from Voronkov’s office, seen by Reuters, said China planned the itinerary for Voronkov, whose office helps states implement a global counterterrorism strategy adopted by the U.N. General Assembly. The email said his office does “not expect any public statements” on his visit to Xinjiang.

He will be visiting Xinjiang before U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet, who has repeatedly pushed China to grant the United Nations access to investigate reports of disappearances and arbitrary detentions, particularly of Muslims in Xinjiang.

“This mission is not connected in any manner to upcoming visits by other senior U.N. officials, including the High Commissioner of Human Rights. We would like to assure you that (Voronkov’s) visit is not intended to undermine or overshadow the visit of Ms. Bachelet,” the email said.

China’s envoy in Geneva said on Thursday that he hoped Bachelet would visit China, including Xinjiang, and “we hope to define a time which is convenient to both sides.” The last visit by a U.N. human rights chief to China was in 2005.

The email from Voronkov’s office said he had already visited Russia, Britain, the United States and France which, along with China, make up the five permanent veto-wielding members of the U.N. Security Council.

Human Rights Watch U.N. director Louis Charbonneau said that instead of sending Voronkov to Xinjiang, Guterres should “be calling for the immediate closure of ‘political education’ camps” and pushing for unfettered access for Bachelet and other rights experts.

Guterres raised the plight of Muslims in China’s Xinjiang region with the Chinese government’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, during a visit to Beijing in April."
DOJ defends Mnuchin’s refusal to hand over Trump’s tax returns,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Alex Pappas', 'Alex Pappas Is A Politics Reporter At Foxnews.Com.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-defends-mnuchins-refusal-to-hand-over-trumps-tax-returns,"The Justice Department released an opinion Friday defending Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s refusal to comply with a House Democratic subpoena for six years of President Trump’s personal and business tax returns.

Last month, Mnuchin said he consulted with the Department of Justice in making the decision not to hand over the returns to the House Ways and Means Committee, saying the request “lacks a legitimate legislative purpose.”

HOUSE DEMOCRAT SUBPOENAS MNUCHIN, IRS FOR TRUMP’S TAX RETURNS

In its opinion Friday, the DOJ’s Office of Legal Counsel said that it advised the Treasury Department to deny the request.

“While the Executive Branch should accord due deference and respect to congressional requests, Treasury was not obliged to accept the Committee’s stated purpose without question, and based on all the facts and circumstances, we agreed that the Committee lacked a legitimate legislative purpose for its request,” the opinion states.

Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Richard Neal, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee issued subpoenas last month to Mnuchin and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig for the tax returns.

“While I do not take this step lightly, I believe this action gives us the best opportunity to succeed and obtain the requested material,” Neal said in a statement at the time.

The topic has been a contentious one for the president since his time on the campaign trail in 2015, and throughout his administration, as he has refused to release his financial information. Trump repeatedly has claimed that his tax returns are complicated, and he has maintained that he will not release them while they are under audit by the IRS.

Last week, The New York Times obtained Trump’s federal income tax returns between 1985 and 1994. The documents revealed that Trump claimed to have lost $1.17 billion from his real estate businesses during that decade. The Times added that it had compared Trump’s tax information with other high-income earners and found that Trump “appears to have lost more money than nearly any other individual American taxpayer. The newspaper also reported that the losses were so substantial, that in the eight of the 10 years in question, Trump was able to avoid paying income tax.

House Democrats have been targeting Trump’s tax returns and financial documents since they took the majority in Congress in January. As part of their lead-off ethics package, which Trump’s lawyers cited in their filing Wednesday, Democrats’ legislation required presidents to disclose at least 10 years of their tax returns to the public, in what was an apparent swipe at Trump.

In response to the special counsel’s report, Democrats are piecing together a package of legislation focused largely on shielding elections from foreign influence, including proposals to bar candidates from accepting foreign help of any kind, while making it mandatory that campaigns alert the FBI when such offers are extended.

But some lawmakers want to press further, eying legislation to nullify the Department of Justice's (DOJ) long-standing determination that presidents cannot be charged with federal crimes while they remain in office.

“It's definitely on the menu,” said Rep. Gerry Connolly Gerald (Gerry) Edward ConnollyDems eye repeal of Justice rule barring presidential indictments Dems eye repeal of Justice rule barring presidential indictments Swing-state Democrats see trouble in proposed pay hike MORE (D-Va.), a member of the House Oversight and Reform Committee. “I'm in favor of expanding enforcement tools and accountability tools, and that's definitely one of them.”

Rep. Hakeem Jeffries Hakeem Sekou JeffriesDems eye repeal of Justice rule barring presidential indictments Dems eye repeal of Justice rule barring presidential indictments Dem committees win new powers to investigate Trump MORE (N.Y.), chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, is also signaling his support. While he has not been involved in talks about specific proposals, Jeffries said, “It strikes me as a reasonable thing to consider.”

“It's fair to say that one of the options we should consider is revisiting that Department of Justice rule so you don't have a rogue and lawless president immunized from criminal prosecution,” he said.

It's unclear how or when the proposal might surface. Connolly said it could appear as part of a larger spending package or as an authorization bill out of the House Judiciary Committee. “But I guarantee you it will be a topic of discussion,” he said.

At issue is a Justice Department policy stretching back 46 years, when former President Nixon was coming under increasing fire surrounding a Watergate scandal that would eventually lead to his impeachment and resignation. In that 1973 memorandum, the DOJ’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) resolved that a sitting president cannot be subject to prosecution for federal crimes.

The rationale hinged on bandwidth. The president's unique responsibilities, the authors determined, “have become so onerous that a President may not be able fully to discharge the powers and duties of his office if he had to defend a criminal prosecution.” With that in mind, the OLC concluded, the only way to remove a sitting president is through impeachment.

The DOJ revisited the question in 2000, following the impeachment of former President Clinton, finding that “the conclusion reached by the Department in 1973 still represents the best interpretation of the Constitution.”

Mueller leaned heavily on that policy last month in outlining his findings during a brief appearance at the DOJ, where he made clear the agency’s guidelines precluded his team from recommending charges against Trump related to the obstruction allegations it had investigated.

“The special counsel’s office is part of the Department of Justice, and, by regulation, it was bound by that department policy,” he said. “Charging the president with a crime was therefore not an option we could consider.”

Democrats were quick to punch back, arguing that no one — not even the president — is immune to the nation’s laws.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiElection security bills face GOP buzzsaw Election security bills face GOP buzzsaw Dems eye repeal of Justice rule barring presidential indictments MORE (D-Calif.) hammered the DOJ policy, expressing “the deepest disappointment in the Department of Justice holding the president above the law.” It's a sentiment that's virtually unanimous in her liberal-leaning caucus, which is conducting investigations of its own — and scrambling for ways to hold Trump to account for allegations of wrongdoing.

“Quoting the president, ‘I could shoot somebody, and my followers wouldn't leave me.’ Does that mean the president could get away with murder?” asked Rep.

They had just ousted a king who flaunted that.”

Quigley said legislation to invalidate the DOJ policy is “a great idea.”

Such a bill has little chance of being considered in the Senate, which is controlled by Trump's Republican allies. But some Democrats see it as a viable messaging tool heading into the 2020 elections.

“If I were a Republican member of the Senate, I wouldn't want to have to explain why the president is not subject to the laws of the United States,” said Rep. Dan Kildee Daniel (Dan) Timothy KildeeDems eye repeal of Justice rule barring presidential indictments Dems eye repeal of Justice rule barring presidential indictments Democratic lawmaker says Trump isn't 'leaving us any choice' on impeachment MORE (D-Mich.).

Warren's idea is catching on with Democrats in the Capitol, who have grown increasingly frustrated with the administration's stonewalling of their investigations.

Barbara Lee Barbara Jean LeeDems eye repeal of Justice rule barring presidential indictments Dems eye repeal of Justice rule barring presidential indictments Democrats set stage for next shutdown fight with wall-free spending bill MORE (D-Calif.). “It needs to happen.”

Not all Democrats, however, are so eager to jump on board. Rep.

“That's why you have impeachment,” she said. “Because when the president is unfit — and it doesn't have to be criminal — when the Congress decides that he's not fit to be president, then that's what impeachment is for. That's what we're supposed to do.”

“There's an old saying that bad facts make bad law,” he said. “And I'd be careful of making sweeping legal decisions based on Trump's conduct.”

Still, there appear to be no divisions among the Democrats when it comes to the idea that the Constitution provides no license for presidents to flout the law with impunity.

DOJ establishes transnational elder fraud strike force,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-establishes-transnational-elder-fraud-strike-force/story?id=63714167,"The Justice Department has formed a transnational elder fraud strike force to combat the growing international problem of elder fraud.

Elder fraud is when fraudsters prey on older victims who can be more susceptible to when approached to give money to sympathetic causes and in some cases threatened and harassed by criminals.

Recently, three Peruvian men pleaded guilty to extorting older Americans through a Spanish-speaking call center.

""For example, one such script directed the callers to falsely and fraudulently claim to be government attorneys and to state that the victims faced lawsuits and fines for not paying for or receiving packages. Other scripts included similar stories where the callers falsely claimed to be attorneys with courts or credit bureaus in the United States,"" the indictment in the case reads.

The effort, announced Thursday, combines six U.S. Attorney's offices from California to Georgia, FBI Special Agents and the Postal Inspection Agency -- all in an effort to combat elder fraud in the United States.

“Fraud against the elderly is on the rise,"" Attorney General William Barr said in a release. “One of the most significant and pernicious causes for this increase is foreign-based fraud schemes. The new Transnational Elder Fraud Strike Force will bring together the expertise and resources of our prosecutors, federal and international law enforcement partners, and other government agencies to better target, investigate, and prosecute criminals abroad who prey on our elderly at home. The Department of Justice is committed to ending the victimization of elders across the country.”

Earlier this year, the attorney general announced the largest ever crackdown on elder fraud in country by highlighting the case of William Webster, the former FBI director who was targeted for months by scammers abroad.

“It doesn’t matter where these criminals live. We’re committed to keeping our elderly citizens safe, whether they’re being targeted door-to-door, over the phone, or online, from thousands of miles away,” FBI Director Christopher Wray said.

Barr has said that he had been a victim of one of the scams in 2017. While he was not attorney general at the time, fraudsters asked for money using his old official portrait.

He highlighted his story at a roundtable event in March.

""People took my official Justice Department portrait from 1992, so I was looking pretty good in 1992 and they put it up on Facebook and other online sites and I was telling people as the former attorney general I had access to special federal grant money and if they just sent some money I could tell them how to get some major grants,"" he explained.

Barr said he had the pages taken down, but from time to time even leading up to when he was nominated to be attorney general he would get calls from people around the country which he called ""heartbreaking."""
DOJ lost track of foreign nationals with criminal histories after bringing them to US: audit,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Alex Pappas', 'Alex Pappas Is A Politics Reporter At Foxnews.Com.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-lost-track-of-foreign-nationals-with-criminal-histories-brought-into-us-for-court-cases-audit,"The Justice Department has lost track of numerous foreign nationals who were brought into the United States to help with law enforcement cases and may have criminal histories of their own – something that could be putting the public ""at risk,"" the DOJ’s inspector general warned in a newly released audit.

The report released by the Office of the Inspector General identified 62 foreign nationals brought into the U.S. who have since ""absconded"" from Justice Department oversight. The audit called this “especially problematic” because “these individuals often have criminal histories or are involved with criminal organizations.”

“Therefore, there are risks associated with these individuals remaining in the United States unsupervised and the public can be at risk,” the report said.

HOUSE DEMS VOTE TO HOLD BARR, ROSS IN CONTEMPT, AS TRUMP ASSERTS EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE OVER CENSUS

The report warned that others could be missing too: As of August 2018, the Department of Homeland Security was still seeking current information for 665 people identified as DOJ-sponsored foreign nationals as part of its own tracking.

A Justice Department spokesman, Alexei Woltornist, told Fox News: “The Department of Justice is aware of the findings of the IG report and is working on remedying the problem.”

In total, the department has sponsored thousands of foreign nationals under this program -- 5,496 between 2015 and 2017, spanning the Obama and Trump administrations, the audit said. Agencies involved include the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, United States Attorney’s Offices and the United States Marshals Service.

According to the audit, these foreign nationals – who may otherwise be considered inadmissible to the United States because of their criminal history – are brought to the U.S. to help support investigations and prosecutions.

“Significant risks accompany the sponsoring of foreign nationals to support law enforcement investigations because these individuals may be associated with criminal activity and motivated only by the ability to reside in the United States,” the report said.

But the report said the inspector general’s office does not “have assurance” that the DOJ and its law enforcement agencies have “adequately executed their monitoring responsibilities to mitigate the risks involved with sponsoring foreign nationals and to fulfill their obligation to protect the public.”

While the Justice Department and the other agencies have performed monitoring activities, problems have been identified in the process.

The report said some of the sponsored foreign nationals are not actually subject to “any routine monitoring requirements” because of “weaknesses in the monitoring policies at some DOJ components.”

And the report noted 18 instances where the Justice Department did not renew the sponsorship or termination of a foreign national in a timely matter, leading to those individuals falling into “an illegal status while residing in the United States.”

“We are concerned that the monitoring policies and practices currently executed by the DOJ components that sponsor foreign nationals do not adequately mitigate the risks associated with bringing individuals into the United States who may have criminal backgrounds or involvement in disreputable activities, or who may be associated with such individuals,” the report said.

In a response included in the audit, the Justice Department defended the use of the so-called S visa program, which allows long-term stays for foreign nationals in the United States when their presence could assist in combatting criminal and terrorism activities.

“The S visa program has played a crucial role in the successful prosecution or investigation of significant criminal or terrorist organization enterprises, and has enabled federal investigators and prosecutors to bring to justice dangerous criminals,” Jennifer A.H. Hodge, the acting deputy assistant attorney general, wrote in an April letter.

There have been risk concerns involving other federal government programs designed to expedite the admittance of foreign nationals into the United States. Then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in 2017 revamped a program that puts foreign-born recruits on a fast-track to U.S. citizenship in exchange for military service as doctors, nurses and language experts after Defense Department investigators discovered “potential security risks” with the Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest program."
DOJ edges closer to T-Mobile-Sprint approval,https://www.cnet.com,['Marguerite Reardon'],06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnet.com/news/doj-edges-closer-to-t-mobile-sprint-approval/,"Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

The US Justice Department is getting close to approving T-Mobile's $26 billion merger with Sprint if the companies agree to sell multiple assets to help create a new wireless carrier, according to The New York Times. The paper reports that three unnamed sources close to the DOJ have said the agency could approve the deal as soon as next week, so long as a new nationwide phone carrier can be created to ensure sufficient competition in the wireless market.

T-Mobile and Sprint have already struck a deal with the Federal Communications Commission to sell off Sprint's prepaid brand Boost Mobile in exchange for the agency's blessing. The FCC and the DOJ must each sign off on the deal. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has already said he'd support the merger if the companies agreed to sell Boost and if they make other commitments, such as meeting build-out requirements for 5G wireless service. In addition to the Boost sale, the DOJ is also asking T-Mobile and Sprint to divest wireless spectrum, according to the Times.

Reports that the DOJ wanted the companies to sell off assets to create a new carrier first circulated last month. But the Times report suggests a deal is imminent.

Such an agreement could weaken the case for the states suing to stop the merger. A group of 10 state attorneys general, led by New York Attorney General Letitia James and California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, filed their suit earlier this week, saying that the merged company would ""deprive consumers of the benefits of competition and drive up prices for cellphone services.""

The lawsuit to block the merger is set for a pretrial hearing next week in federal court in New York City, according to Reuters.

T-Mobile declined to comment on the report. Sprint, the DOJ and the New York Attorney General's office weren't immediately available for comment."
Federal watchdog opens inquiry into EPA handling of Minnesota PolyMet pollution permit,http://www.startribune.com,"['Jennifer Bjorhus', 'Jennifer.Bjorhus Startribune.Com']",,,,http://www.startribune.com/federal-watchdog-opens-inquiry-into-how-the-epa-handled-minnesota-pollution-permit/511333592/,"The Environmental Protection Agency Office of Inspector General has opened an investigation into the agency’s handling of a crucial pollution permit for Minnesota’s first copper mine after a retired agency attorney raised questions about the episode.

The investigation was announced June 12, the same day the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released documents related to the water quality permit requested by several parties, including the Minnesota-based advocacy group WaterLegacy and U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn.

Release of the documents shows that written comments by EPA regulators, challenging key parts of the permit, were never formally submitted for the public record and were never sent to officials at the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA). Instead, the comments were read to MPCA staff over the telephone last spring, a practice that the retired EPA attorney described as “bizarre.”

The Star Tribune has also requested the documents, but the EPA hasn’t yet provided them.

The documents relate to a crucial state water quality permit issued to PolyMet Mining, a Toronto-based minerals firm that wants to build a $1 billion copper-nickel mine in northeast Minnesota. After years of review, PolyMet cleared most of Minnesota’s regulatory hurdles in late 2018. The newly released documents include seven pages of detailed criticism by EPA Region 5 staff in Chicago, which oversees Minnesota’s enforcement of federal pollution laws, outlining deficiencies in the permit that the MPCA issued to PolyMet last December. It is the first time the EPA’s official comments on the permit, which will regulate dangerous pollutants in effluent from the mine, have been made public.

The written comments note that the permit would “authorize discharges that would exceed Minnesota’s federally-approved human health and/or aquatic life water quality standards for mercury, copper, arsenic, cadmium, and zinc.” In one core passage, they said the permit lacked specific effluent limits, known as WQBELs, which are numeric limits on how much of a pollutant can be in the effluent pumped out a discharge pipe.

A retired EPA attorney from Boston, Jeffry Fowley, learned of the phoned-in comments from confidential sources in January and filed a complaint with the EPA’s Office of Inspector General.

The sources told him EPA leadership in Region 5 were suppressing staff comments. Fowley has called it “serious improper conduct” and “unethical.”

“In all my years of experience, I have never heard of a situation where EPA personnel have read written comments on a permit to state personnel over the phone,” Fowley said in a sworn declaration filed with the Minnesota Court of Appeals.

MPCA officials told the Star Tribune there was nothing unusual about their exchange with the EPA, and that they did incorporate many of the agency’s concerns into the final permit for PolyMet.

In an interview Friday, Fowley said he and Minnesota’s Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, which also filed a complaint, were pleased with the Inspector General’s decision.

“I think the fact that they’re taking up this one indicates they think there is something seriously wrong,” Fowley said.

McCollum, who waged a monthslong public battle to obtain the EPA documents, had only brief comments. In a statement to the Star Tribune she said her role was to “ensure transparency.”

“Now the courts and the public have the information needed to determine whether the final permit adequately addresses the many concerns raised by the EPA,” said McCollum, who leads a House subcommittee that oversees the EPA.

Differing documents

In a letter to McCollum with the documents, EPA Acting Associate Administrator Joseph Brazauskas said it’s common practice for complex permitting decisions to be handled verbally rather than in writing.

“EPA Region 5 Administrator Cathy Stepp has specifically encouraged EPA staff to work more collaboratively and speak ‘face-to-face’ with state officials,” Brazauskas wrote.

Brazauskas also said the EPA hadn’t planned to release the written comments because it considers them private under the “deliberative process privilege” exemption to the federal Freedom of Information Act.

However, he said, the agency had given the comments voluntarily to the Fond du Lac tribe, so it could no longer withhold them.

The EPA’s written comments were also sent to WaterLegacy, an advocacy group in St. Paul, and the Fond du Lac Band, whose land is downstream from PolyMet’s proposed mine near Babbitt.

The parties together have challenged the water permit over its lack of stringent, federally enforceable limits on nearly two dozen pollutants regulated by the Clean Water Act.

The documents received by WaterLegacy, however, differ slightly from those sent to McCollum; they include a separate letter from Kevin Pierard, a senior official in the EPA’s Chicago office, to Jeff Udd, the MPCA’s director of metallic mining, which underscores the fact that the EPA’s concerns were conveyed by phone, not in writing.

Many sections in this copy of the written comments were underlined and numbered; across the top Pierard wrote by hand that the underlined sections were “conveyed verbally” to the MPCA on April 5, 2018, and lists the MPCA staff on the phone call.

The phone conversation occurred several weeks after the public comment period on PolyMet’s draft permit closed in March 2018, meaning that the EPA-written criticisms were never entered in the public record.

The EPA’s criticisms should have been public from the start, said WaterLegacy lawyer Paula Maccabee.

“They are some of the strongest comments I’ve ever seen,” she said. “It’s like one of the most important documents in this entire case, and it’s not in the administrative record.”

‘Rigorous’ review

MPCA officials and former MPCA Commissioner John Linc Stine said nothing improper occurred in the episode and that the final PolyMet permit did reflect some of the EPA comments.

In an interview, Stine said nothing requires the EPA to submit written comments during the public comment period. He also said that the concerns the EPA read over the telephone were similar to comments other stakeholders had filed previously.

“It didn’t strike me that there was anything that was plowing new ground,” he said.

In a statement, MPCA spokesman Darin Broton described the PolyMet permit process as “rigorous” and said the agency discussed technical issues with the EPA frequently.

“Based on those conversations, as well as other comments received … during the official comment period, the MPCA made substantive changes to the draft permit, including additional limits for arsenic, cobalt, lead, nickel and mercury; and new language was added that clearly states that the discharge must not violate water quality standards,” Broton said. “That’s why the EPA did not object to the MPCA’s final permit.”

Several MPCA staff members have filed sworn statements as part of an appeal filed by WaterLegacy, making similar arguments.

Former MPCA staff attorney Michael Schmidt said in his declaration that no one tried to conceal anything. They noted how quickly the EPA staff read the comments on the phone that day, making note-taking difficult.

In an interview Friday, Fowley, the former EPA attorney, accused both the EPA and the MPCA of a “coverup.” He said confidential sources told him that the EPA’s Region 5 staff were so frustrated about their unheeded concerns that they filed a memo Dec. 18 — just before the permit was issued — documenting the issues that had not been resolved. Fowley said the memo contained sufficient information to justify an EPA objection to the permit.

Fowley characterized PolyMet’s permit as weak, and “an end run around the … requirements of the Clean Water Act.”

“It’s kind of like if instead of speed limits they told people not to drive too fast,” Fowley said. “I’ve never seen this situation before.”"
Gillibrand says she wouldn't stand in way if her DOJ wanted to investigate Trump,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Paul Steinhauser', 'Paul Steinhauser Is A Politics Reporter Based In New Hampshire.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gillibrand-wont-stand-in-way-if-her-justice-department-wanted-to-investigate-trump,"Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand says if elected to the White House, she wouldn’t stand in the way if her Department of Justice wanted to investigate Donald Trump for obstruction of justice.

And the senator from New York told Fox News on Friday that she believes the Republican president’s alleged obstruction of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation “amounts to a crime.”

“As president of the United States, I will restore what’s been lost and that is an independent Department of Justice. They would be able to make that decision independent of me as president,” she said, while campaigning in the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire.

She becomes the latest 2020 Democratic candidate to at least open the door to a Trump prosecution once he's out of office.

California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris said this week she believes the only reason Mueller didn’t recommend prosecuting Trump was because of the Justice Department’s policy against indicting a sitting president. In an interview with NPR, Harris said that once out of office, Trump would be subject to charges – and she suggested the Justice Department in a Harris presidency would pursue them.

HARRIS SAYS IF ELECTED, HER DOJ WOULD HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO PROSECUTE TRUMP

“I believe that they would have no choice and that they should, yes,” Harris said.

Another 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, said this week that if elected president, he could also support a Justice Department criminal investigation into Trump.

“To the extent that there’s an obstruction case, then yes, DOJ’s got to deal with it,” Buttigieg said in an interview with The Atlantic published Thursday.

But Buttigieg added that he would only take such a step if there was a “credible allegation.”

Mueller spent two years investigating any possible collusion between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia to sway the election toward the GOP nominee at the expense of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

In his recent report, Mueller detailed extensive contact between the Trump campaign and Moscow. But he did not find evidence of a criminal conspiracy. And he didn’t take a clear position on whether the president obstructed justice. Trump himself, in an interview with ABC News, disputed a central allegation from his former White House counsel that he tried to have Mueller removed.

Asked by Fox News whether she believed Trump deserved to be investigated, Gillibrand answered: “Do I believe what he’s done already amounts to a crime? I do.”

And she emphasized that “the American people, no matter what, are entitled to facts, transparency, and accountability.”

Another Democratic presidential candidate, entrepreneur Andrew Yang, disagrees with his rivals.

“If you look around the world, one pattern that America should seek to avoid is prosecuting past leaders and presidents and imprisoning them,"" Yang told Fox News on Thursday. ""That’s something that America has never fallen into and that’s the way I would hope that we proceed with me in the White House.”

Trump, meanwhile, has fired back at Democrats accusing him of a crime -- especially after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said last week she wants to see him in prison. Speaking Friday to ""Fox & Friends,"" he called her accusation of a ""criminal coverup"" a ""fascist"" and ""disgraceful"" statement."
"Justice Department says Congress' request of Trump's tax returns lacks ""legitimate purpose""",https://www.cbsnews.com,"['Grace Segers', 'Grace Segers Is A Politics Reporter For Cbs News Digital.']",06-15-2019,2019,6,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tax-returns-justice-department-says-congress-cannot-force-irs-to-provide-federal-returns-2019-06-15/,"The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel released a memo Friday supporting the Treasury Department's position that Congress is not entitled to see President Trump's tax returns, alleging Congress exceeded its authority in its request. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin refused to comply with a House subpoena for Mr. Trump's federal tax returns in May, saying members of Congress did not have a ""legitimate purpose"" to review the returns.

The House Ways and Means Committee issued the subpoena for the president's tax returns to Mnuchin and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig last Friday after Mnuchin denied the committee's initial request. Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal says the committee is entitled to the returns under section 6103(f) of the IRS code, in order to conduct oversight and determine whether the IRS is enforcing laws.

Mnuchin argued that Congress doesn't have a ""legitimate legislative purpose"" in requesting the president's private tax information, and in its memo Friday the Office of Legal Counsel agreed.

""Under the facts and circumstances, the Secretary of the Treasury reasonably and correctly concluded that the Committee's asserted interest in reviewing the Internal Revenue Service's audits of presidential returns was pretextual and that its true aim was to make the President's tax returns public, which is not a legitimate legislative purpose,"" the Office of Legal Counsel said in the memo.

Democrats in Congress have argued that viewing Mr. Trump's tax returns has legitimate legislative purpose in that it would reveal the financial dealings of the president and potential ethical issues. Neal threatened to sue the Treasury Department for refusing to respond to the subpoena.

However, while members of Congress may face an uphill battle in obtaining Mr. Trump's federal tax returns, they could have more luck with his New York state tax returns. The New York state legislature passed a measure in May to allow the leaders of the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Finance Committee or the Joint Committee on Taxation to access any New York state tax returns filed by elected officials and top appointed officials.

The chemicals are often referred to as “forever chemicals” because of the time it takes them to break down.

The EPA has said it will decide by the end of the year whether it will set drinking water standards for PFAS.

The amendment, filed as part of the annual defense policy bill, would put pressure on the agency to speed up that timeline, adopting a drinking water standard within two years for two specific types of PFAS.

The EPA said it would not comment on pending legislation.

The compromise measure from a bipartisan group of senators on the Environment and Public Works Committee provides an early glimpse at how Congress plans to address the issue this year.

The EPA currently recommends no more than 70 parts per trillion of PFAS in drinking water. But many states, tired of waiting for standards from the federal government, have passed their own drinking water standards that are tougher than what the EPA currently recommends.

Attempting to force the EPA to set a standard would likely meet resistance from some Republicans.

At a recent House hearing on PFAS, several GOP lawmakers said they were wary of getting ahead of agency scientists and recommending a specific response.

But other Republicans argue the agency has been delaying action while the problem spreads.

The amendment does not, however, make Superfund cleanup money available for places where PFAS has contaminated drinking water.

Carper has been pushing to designate PFAS a hazardous substance under the Superfund law as a way to force responsible parties to clean up the chemical.

In some cases, that party would be the military itself, which has identified more than 400 military sites with suspected PFAS contamination."
Trump administration to move USDA researchers to Kansas City area,https://www.politico.com,"['Liz Crampton', 'Ryan Mccrimmon', 'Burgess Everett', 'Nancy Cook', 'John Bresnahan']",06-13-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/13/usda-kansas-city-area-1529072,"Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue argued in a statement that the Kansas City region will better position the department to attract people “with training and interest in agriculture” because the area is a proven “hub for all things agriculture."" | Alex Wroblewski/Getty Images Agriculture Trump administration to move USDA researchers to Kansas City area

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has chosen to relocate two of USDA's research agencies to the Kansas City area, the final step in a process to reshape the department's research wing that has drawn objections from several congressional Democrats.

Perdue said in announcing the new home of the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture on Thursday that the move would bring the research agencies closer to major farming regions, improve customer service and save taxpayer dollars — about $20 million per year over 15 years.

Story Continued Below

But many employees at ERS, who conduct research into areas such as climate change, nutrition and the farm economy, and at NIFA, who arrange federal grants for agricultural research institutions, have told POLITICO they believe the move is rooted in politics.

Several current and former staffers at the agencies have warned that relocation could disrupt operations and drive out experienced researchers. The proposal has already sparked a brain-drain of veteran economists from ERS, and some lawmakers and ERS staff allege relocation is a back-door attempt to shrink the agency and clamp down on research that doesn't align with the Trump administration's priorities.

Democrats have questioned the relocation plan and blamed USDA for not providing detailed justification since the concept was first unveiled in August 2018. The House USDA-FDA appropriations bill for fiscal 2020 would prohibit USDA from moving forward with the relocation, but the measure is unlikely to become law before the move is carried out.

Perdue argued in a statement that the Kansas City region will better position the department to attract people “with training and interest in agriculture” because the area is a proven “hub for all things agriculture” and already boasts a “significant presence” of USDA and federal government employees, in addition to the Kansas City Federal Reserve.

“The Kansas City Region will allow ERS and NIFA to increase efficiencies and effectiveness and bring important resources and manpower closer to all of our customers,” he said.

“This agriculture talent pool, in addition to multiple land-grant and research universities within driving distance, provides access to a stable labor force for the future,” he added.

The department has not settled on a location in the Kansas City area. The General Services Administration will release a proposal early next month, allowing interested parties to submit bids, Perdue said Thursday afternoon. In the meantime, employees will be relocated as soon as mid-July and will be placed in temporary office space that fits up to 200 workers.

USDA has argued since the relocation proposal was first announced that the high cost of living in the Washington, D.C., area hinders recruitment and retention at the agencies.

The anticipated savings of $20 million per year will allow more funding to be directed to research initiatives to address “critical needs like rural prosperity and agricultural competitiveness,” Perdue said, adding that the savings will also enable the agencies to maintain service and staffing “even in the face of tightening budgets.”

State and local governments sweetened the deal by offering a package of $26 million in incentives, the secretary said. Perdue refused to reveal what the Kansas City region offered to attract USDA.

""These are proprietary discussions from our perspective,"" he told reporters. ""If the local community chooses to disclose those, they can do so at their will.""

The total savings of the projected move — about $300 million over 15 years — is based on a cost-benefit analysis of relocation to the Kansas City area that the department released on Thursday. Several congressional Democrats have called on the department for months to release such a study.

In announcing the pick, USDA backed down on another element of its plan that had drawn pushback from lawmakers — moving ERS within the department's organizational structure so that it would fall under the Office of the Chief Economist. The agency will remain under the department's Research, Education, and Economics mission area.

""While we believe there is considerable synergies and benefits to a realignment, after hearing feedback from stakeholders and members of Congress, USDA will not move forward with the realignment plans,"" the release said.

Critics of that part of the plan, including several current and former ERS employees interviewed by POLITICO, argued the realignment could subject the agency's research to political influence by positioning it closer to the Office of the Secretary. The House fiscal 2020 spending bill for USDA had sought to block the realignment.

The Kansas City region was selected from a pool of more than 130 locations that had expressed interest in hosting the agencies. Now, the move is on a fast-track timeline.

Agency employees are expected to receive relocation letters on Thursday. Employees anticipate being given 30 days to decide whether to move, according to union leaders.

Employees of both agencies have voted to unionize in the face of the relocation, and leaders at the American Federation of Government Employees, which is representing the workers, have vowed to press for a delay.

Union representatives said employees were not given advance notice of the announcement — something Perdue said on Wednesday he would do. They learned of the site selection through media reports, according to union leaders.

During a town hall briefing following the announcement, nearly 20 employees silently protested Perdue by turning their backs to him while he addressed staff.

""Secretary Perdue continually speaks of transparency and communicating to employees but has failed on both fronts,"" said Kevin Hunt, acting vice president of the ERS union. ""The announcement today highlights his disregard for the rights and wellbeing of employees.""

In a letter to employees shared with POLITICO, Perdue said he knows ""that this time, especially for the employees directly affected, has been personally and professionally challenging. I am grateful for your patience and your continued hard work.""

The secretary said he wrote the letter because he wanted employees to hear the news from him first. But a notice containing the letter was not distributed among staff until 10:37 a.m. Thursday — well after media reports were published and Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.) had hailed the decision in a press release.

The four U.S. senators from Missouri and Kansas — all Republicans — issued a joint statement praising Perdue for selecting the Kansas City area. One of them, Senate Agriculture Chairman Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), said that ""agricultural research is a critical function of USDA, and I am committed to ensuring we continue to support and strengthen the research mission that our U.S. producers rely on.""

But some Democrats from other parts of the country were critical of the decision.

Reps. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio) and Del. Stacey Plaskett (D-V.I.), who lead House Agriculture subcommittees that have jurisdiction over the USDA research agencies, criticized Thursday's announcement and said the entire process has lacked transparency.

Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-Maine), a House Appropriations Committee member who co-sponsored a bill to stop the move, said she was ""appalled"" with USDA's decision to force ""staffers to uproot their lives to Kansas City in order to keep their livelihoods.""

She also noted that a USDA Inspector General investigation ""examining the viability of this relocation is not complete.""

USDA paid the consulting firm Ernst & Young $340,000 to run the site selection process.

Columnist

The Trump administration presents a series of unanswerable moral riddles. What’s worse — President Trump’s outrageous acts? His gaslighting? His followers’ eagerness to join him in coverups and lies? All three were on display this week, as they have been pretty much every week since Jan 20, 2017.

First, the misconduct: Having claimed that he did not collude with Russia in 2016, Trump now proudly advertises his willingness to collude with any foreign government in the future. If a regime offered him useful information, he told George Stephanopoulos of ABC News, “Oh, I think I’d want to hear it.”

“I would not have thought that I needed to say this,” responded Ellen L. Weintraub, chair of the Federal Election Commission: “It is illegal for any person to solicit, accept, or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a U.S. election.”

Next came the gaslighting. Trump indignantly tweeted: “I meet and talk to ‘foreign governments’ every day. I just met with the Queen of England (U.K.), the Prince of Wales, the P.M. of the United Kingdom, the P.M. of Ireland, the President of France and the President of Poland. We talked about ‘Everything!’ Should I immediately call the FBI about these calls and meetings? How ridiculous! I would never be trusted again. With that being said, my full answer is rarely played by the Fake News Media. They purposely leave out the part that matters.”

Actually, the media didn’t leave out any part of his answer. It was the president who, in his ham-handed attempt at cleanup, left out the truth. Stephanopoulos wasn’t asking him whether, as president, it was proper for him to have diplomatic exchanges with foreign heads of state. He was asking whether Trump, as a candidate, would accept help from a foreign government. So Trump is, as usual, throwing out absurdities and falsehoods to distract from what he said and to give his followers — some cynical, others credulous — an excuse to claim that it was all fake news.

Trump’s trucklers did not disappoint. On Laura Ingraham’s Fox News show, Victor Davis Hanson of the Hoover Institution said the lesson was that “you shouldn’t ever talk to George Stephanopoulos,” and Ingraham was perturbed that someone (perhaps a 400-pound coach potato?) put Trump “in that situation — I don’t get it.” On “Fox & Friends,” co-host Ainsley Earhardt said it was ridiculous for Trump to report foreign assistance to the FBI: “What’s the FBI going to do?” Uh, stop the election interference?

A common trope among the Trumpkins was that criticism of their idol for making use of foreign election assistance was hypocritical because, as Sean Hannity argued: “Hillary Clinton literally empowered a foreign agent who produced a dossier for the Russian lies.” This whataboutism was echoed by the likes of Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who should be smart enough to know better.

In reality (remember that quaint concept?), there is nothing illegal or unethical about the Clinton campaign paying a U.S. research firm, Fusion GPS, which employed a former British intelligence officer, Christopher Steele, who talked to actual Russians to probe Trump’s suspicious Russia links. Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee admitted as much: This is standard opposition research. It is not remotely equivalent to the Russian government helping Trump win. It’s actually similar to the Trump campaign hiring Cambridge Analytica, a British consulting firm. Moreover, Steele did go to the FBI — something that Trump boasts about never having done.

Few Republicans were willing to defend Trump’s egregious comments outright. Instead, they deflected and minimized. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) made it sound as if the real problem was Democrats “trying to keep the 2016 election alive.” Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said that this was not one of Trump’s “best statements” (please cite Trump’s best statement, Senator), but he praised Trump for his “refreshing habit of saying what he thinks.” I can think of many ways to describe the president bragging about breaking the law, but “refreshing” isn’t one of them. I suppose that’s one reason I’m not a Republican member of Congress.

The final indignity came when Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) led Republicans’ successful effort to block a bill sponsored by Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) to require campaigns to disclose any foreign offers of assistance to the FBI. This is of a piece with McConnell blocking a raft of other bills designed to defend U.S. elections from foreign interference. The most benign explanation is that Republicans are afraid of embarrassing Trump and incurring his wrath. The more sinister explanation is that they are secretly rooting for Russian help again in 2020. The two explanations are not, of course, incompatible. Either way, Republicans are putting partisan self-interest above the nation’s interest.

Beyond the issue of foreign election interference, this sordid episode shows how an utterly amoral president in league with power-hungry Republicans and the ratings-driven conservative media-industrial complex has hijacked U.S. politics. Considerations of truth, justice and the national interest are utterly alien to our new overlords. All that matters is “owning” the “libtards” — and enjoying the spoils of power.

"Kamala Harris: If elected, my DOJ would have 'no choice' but to prosecute Trump",https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-if-president-doj-would-have-no-choice-but-to-charge-trump,"2020 candidate Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., has issued a stunning warning to President Trump that seems to echo controversial recent comments from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, saying her Justice Department would likely charge him with obstruction of justice if she wins the White House.

Harris, in a newly released interview, said she believes the only reason former Special Counsel Robert Mueller did not recommend prosecuting Trump was because of the Justice Department’s policy against indicting a sitting president. Once out of office, Trump would be subject to charges -- and Harris was emphatic in saying the DOJ should pursue them.

DEMS' LONG GAME? PELOSI RAISES PROSPECT OF PROSECUTING TRUMP ONCE HE LEAVES OFFICE

“I believe that they would have no choice and that they should, yes,” Harris said on this week’s NPR Politics Podcast.

The former California attorney general and San Francisco district attorney cited the importance of holding everyone accountable for their actions.

“I mean look, people might, you know, question why I became a prosecutor,” Harris said. “Well, I’ll tell you one of the reasons – I believe there should be accountability. Everyone should be held accountable, and the president is not above the law.”

Harris is not the first high-profile Democrat to suggest that not only should Congress pursue impeachment against Trump -- but he should face criminal charges once out of office.

Pelosi, D-Calif., reportedly told colleagues last week: “I don’t want to see him impeached, I want to see him in prison.”

REP. WARREN DAVIDSON: PELOSI MENTIONED TRUMP IMPRISONMENT TO ‘KEEP IMPEACHMENT ZEALOTS IN LINE’

Trump reacted to this by calling Pelosi ""a nasty, vindictive, horrible person.""

Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., however, had no problem with Pelosi's remarks.

""I don’t have any difficulty with those words,"" Cicilline told ""Fox News Sunday,"" comparing them to when then-candidate Trump inspired ""lock her up"" chants when he ran against Hillary Clinton. A 2018 New York Times report also said that Trump looked into prosecuting Clinton, as well as former FBI Director James Comey.

Joining the chorus of Democrats hinting that prosecuting Trump might be appropriate was another 2020 candidate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. The progressive Democrat said recently that Trump would be ""carried out in handcuffs"" if he were anyone else, though she did not openly advocate charges against him.

Asked Wednesday if he would advocate Trump's prosecution, fellow candidate Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., said “no one is above the law” while leaving the question open.

“To be very blunt, if my attorney general at the Department of Justice finds that there is probable cause that a law has been broken by anyone, I expect him to hold the alleged offender accountable no matter who they are or what title they’ve held in the past,” he said. “I’m not going to be a president that undermines the independence of the DOJ or the judiciary in a way that I’ve seen this administration do.”

Newly released documents detail EPA's concerns over PolyMet,https://www.mprnews.org,"['Dan Kraker', 'Jim Mone', 'Ap Photo']",06-13-2019,2019,6,https://www.mprnews.org/story/2019/06/13/newly-released-documents-detail-epas-concerns-over-polymet,"A former iron ore processing plant near Hoyt Lakes, Minn., that would become part of a proposed PolyMet copper-nickel mine is seen in February 2016.

Updated 7:57 p.m. | Posted 5:23 p.m.

Staff scientists at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had serious concerns last year that the PolyMet copper-nickel mine might not be able to meet state and federal water quality standards under the Clean Water Act, according to documents released Thursday.

The scientists' comments were written more than a year ago in response to a key permit the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency issued to PolyMet Mining. But they were never submitted. Instead, they were released this week as part of a Freedom of Information Act case an environmental group filed against the EPA in an attempt to make them public.

In court filings, the St. Paul-based advocacy group WaterLegacy questioned whether the EPA comments had been suppressed as the MPCA developed the final water quality permit it eventually granted to PolyMet last December.

WaterLegacy and Minnesota U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum applauded the documents' release.

""All Minnesotans have a stake in ensuring that the quality of our water is protected, and the public has a right to access essential information about whether a project of this magnitude meets the spirit and letter of the law,"" said McCollum, who, as chair of a House subcommittee with jurisdiction over the EPA, had also pushed for the release of the documents.

The water quality permit and an air quality permit were the last two state approvals PolyMet needed to move ahead with its NorthMet copper-nickel mining project, which would be located near Babbitt and Hoyt Lakes in northeastern Minnesota. It capped a review and permitting process for the controversial development — which is set to become Minnesota's first copper-nickel mine — that's stretched well beyond a decade.

Copper-nickel mining poses potentially more severe environmental risks than the state's long-established iron ore mining industry because the process used to extract the minerals from the sulfide rock can result in acid mine drainage, which can leach heavy metals and other pollutants into nearby surface and groundwater.

That's why the project's water quality permit, which sets limits on the pollutants that can be released into groundwater, lakes and streams, was so heavily scrutinized when the MPCA announced it had been issued in December.

Four environmental groups — the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy, the Center for Biological Diversity, Friends of the Boundary Waters Wilderness and WaterLegacy — along with the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, quickly challenged the water quality permit at the Minnesota Court of Appeals. They argued the permit failed to comply with federal and state standards.

Soon after, in January, retired EPA attorney Jeffry Fowley filed a complaint with the agency's inspector general, alleging that administrators in the EPA's Chicago office had ""suppressed"" staff comments that were critical of the PolyMet water quality permit.

But in a brief filed Wednesday in the appeals court case, the MPCA acknowledged it had come to an agreement with the EPA ""that EPA would provide oral [rather than written] comments to MPCA."" The documents EPA released Thursday show that EPA staff had significant concerns about the permit. EPA scientists were especially concerned that it failed to include specific limits on the amount of pollutants the mine can discharge, — known as ""water quality-based effluent limits"" — which are put in place to ensure that projects can meet federal environmental standards.

EPA staff had prepared detailed written comments, but the agency never filed an objection to the MPCA's permit plan. And instead of publicly submitting those comments in writing during the public comment period part of the permitting process, staffers at both agencies agreed that the EPA would read them to MPCA staffers over the phone.

As a result, the EPA scientists' concerns did not become a part of the administrative record, which appeals courts rule on — and which the Minnesota Court of Appeals will rely on in its review of the MPCA's decision to issue the permit.

Fowley, the former EPA attorney who filed the inspector general complaint, said in a filing included in WaterLegacy's appeals court case that it was ""highly unusual"" that written comments on such a complex permit would not be part of the public record. ""In all of my years of experience,"" he wrote, ""I have never heard of a situation where EPA personnel have read written comments on a permit to state personnel over the phone.""

Fowley worked for 37 years at the EPA office in Boston and specialized in Clean Water Act compliance. ""The apparent purpose for only receiving such comments over the phone would be to obtain them off the record — to avoid the MPCA receiving written comments which it would then need to be put into the administrative record for the permit and to which it would then need to respond,"" he wrote.

Fowley told the court last week that the EPA's inspector general had begun a preliminary inquiry into his complaint. The office announced Wednesday it was beginning an audit of the water quality permit issued by the MPCA ""to determine whether the EPA followed appropriate Clean Water Act ... regulations to review the PolyMet permit approved by Minnesota and issued in 2018.""

But in interviews and court filings, the MPCA argues it engaged in a robust back-and-forth with EPA staffers for several years in developing PolyMet's water quality permit. Officials insist it was neither out of the ordinary — nor unethical — for the agency to receive comments from federal regulators over the phone.

""I think it was the most effective way for [EPA] to make the comments and for us to react to them,"" said John Linc Stine, who was MPCA commissioner while the PolyMet water quality permit was being developed.

""There had been years and years of document exchange and comment back and forth,"" he continued. ""So, it seemed right to me to handle it by phone calls, so that we could get the permit finally resolved and drafted.""

Linc Stine said it wasn't unusual for the EPA not to submit written comments. MPCA officials said the agency's staffers engaged in regular conference calls with their EPA counterparts, and continually incorporated their feedback into the draft water quality permit.

But Paula Maccabee, WaterLegacy's attorney and advocacy director, said it's commonplace for the EPA to provide written comments on major industrial permits in Minnesota — and for the MPCA to provide detailed responses.

MPCA spokesperson Darin Broton emphasized that staffers from the state and federal agencies had frequent conversations during the permitting process. Those conversations, he said, resulted in substantive changes to the permit along the way, including additional limits on the discharge of several pollutants — including arsenic, lead and mercury — and ""language prohibiting violation of water quality standards.""

Broton said that's why the EPA did not object to the MPCA's final permit when the state agency sent it to them for final review.

But the Fond du Lac Band and environmental groups that brought the appeals court case argue that the limits included in the permit are weak and unenforceable, and aren't the same kind of restrictions that EPA scientists asked for in the comment letter released Thursday.

They also argue the permit, as written, could actually act as a shield to protect the company from potential liability.

""Without those effluent limits, Minnesota water quality won't be protected from the state's first proposed toxic sulfide mine,"" Water Legacy's Maccabee said.

WaterLegacy's appeals court case is one of several lawsuits making its way through state and federal courts seeking to overturn various approvals PolyMet received to build its mine.

Barring a successful legal challenge, PolyMet is clear to begin construction of the state's first-ever copper-nickel mine, once it raises the estimated $1 billion it will cost to build it. Later this month, PolyMet is expected to conclude a stock offering to clear debt from its balance sheet, which could result in the Swiss mining and commodities giant Glencore winning majority ownership of the company."
Feds gone wild: DOJ's stunning inability to prosecute its own bad actors,https://thehill.com,[],06-13-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/opinion/criminal-justice/448383-feds-gone-wild-dojs-stunning-inability-to-prosecute-its-own-bad,"One was caught red-handed engaged in nepotism. Another, a lawyer no less, admitted to shoplifting at a Marine barracks store. A third leaked sealed court information to the news media. And a fourth engaged in fraud by turning a government garage into a personal repair shop.

Four cases, all solved in the past month, with suspects who cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars and significant breaches of public trust.

But these weren’t your everyday perps.

All were U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) employees who are supposed to catch other criminals while working for the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and U.S. attorneys’ offices. Instead, they broke the law or violated the rules. And all managed to escape prosecution, despite their proven transgressions.

ADVERTISEMENT

Recent Justice Department disciplinary files tell an undeniable story.

Under the leadership of Inspector General (IG) Michael Horowitz, DOJ’s internal watchdog is doing an outstanding job of policing bad conduct inside America’s premier law enforcement agency.

And DOJ is doing a poor job of punishing its own.

In cases closed in the past month, more than a half-dozen FBI, DEA, U.S. attorney and U.S. marshal officials were allowed to retire, do volunteer work, or keep their jobs as they escaped criminal charges that everyday Americans probably would not.

In most instances, the decisions were made by federal prosecutors who work with the very figures impacted by or committing the bad conduct. In local law enforcement, that go-easy phenomenon is known as the “thin blue line.”

Spokespersons for the Justice Department and FBI did not respond to a request for comment.

The troubling pattern of weak punishment emerges as DOJ heads into one of its most ambitious internal affairs probes in recent history. Attorney General William Barr, Horowitz and special U.S. Attorney John Durham are investigating whether the FBI and other intelligence agencies violated the law with the Trump-Russia investigation.

Even before the recent spate of closed inspector general investigations, questions surfaced about DOJ’s willingness to punish its own. That’s because fired FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe Andrew George McCabeMcCabe says it's 'absolutely' time to launch impeachment inquiry into Trump McCabe says it's 'absolutely' time to launch impeachment inquiry into Trump Feds gone wild: DOJ's stunning inability to prosecute its own bad actors MORE was recommended for prosecution more than 15 months ago for lying about news leaks, and so far has faced no criminal charges.

To put that into perspective, it took special counsel Robert Mueller just a few months to bring charges against multiple figures associated with President Trump’s campaign accused of lying or other process crimes.

It’s still possible that McCabe could face prosecution. But the recent spate of fresh wrongdoing inside DOJ doesn’t portray a compelling pattern of enforcement or punishment.

Take, for example, the DEA executive who just this week was found to have engaged in nepotism by routing hundreds of thousands of dollars to contractor jobs for his son and retired colleagues or friends.

Horowitz spared few words for the egregious scheme. “The senior DEA official wasted and misused hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxpayer funds and engaged in misconduct when he took actions to get his son and former colleagues contractor positions and that his actions constituted misconduct in violation of federal ethics regulations, the DEA Standards of Conduct, and the Federal Acquisition Regulation,” he reported this week.

The official also engaged in a “lack of candor,” the investigative file showed.

Despite the established wrongdoing, criminal prosecution “was declined” and “the senior DEA official retired from his position.” In short, he kept his retirement benefits.

Likewise, the inspector general had harsh words for the FBI special agent in charge (SAC) who used the bureau’s official garage to perform repairs on his and other employees’ personal vehicles, calling it, among other things, a “dereliction of supervisory responsibility,” and a misuse of tax dollars for “private gain.”

“The SAC took advantage of the SAC’s official position for personal benefit by arranging to have the SAC’s personal vehicle repaired by an FBI employee in exchange for compensation, in violation of federal regulations regarding standards of conduct for federal employees and FBI policy,” the investigative file concluded. “The OIG also found that the SAC was derelict in the SAC’s supervisory responsibilities by allowing use of the FBI repair facility to conduct repairs and maintenance on personal vehicles belonging to FBI employees.”

And then there was the FBI lawyer who got caught in an embarrassing criminal act at the Marine Corps barracks (MCB) commissary in Quantico, Va.

“The FBI attorney admitted to placing numerous cosmetic items, valued at $257.99 and belonging to the MCB Quantico Exchange, into her purse without the intention to pay for them and did not pay for them before leaving the store. The FBI attorney further admitted that between February 2016 and her arrest in February 2018 she had shoplifted at the MCB Quantico Exchange one to two additional times, and at other private retailers in the area on two to three occasions,” the inspector general reported on May 14.

The investigation concluded her conduct violated federal criminal law and FBI policy regarding unprofessional conduct. But here was the outcome: “Criminal prosecution was deferred pending the FBI attorney’s completion of 125 hours of community service, after which all charges were dismissed.”

A few weeks of community service, and she was still in her job at the time the IG issued its report.

Two weeks ago, another DOJ official, an assistant U.S. attorney, escaped charges even after it was documented that he violated federal laws by possessing, transporting and consuming marijuana-laced edibles that he claimed he needed to treat back pain. He also was caught lying about his wrongdoing and 'fessed up only when his estranged wife threatened him during their divorce proceedings. Nonetheless, “criminal prosecution by federal and state authorities was declined,” the IG reported May 30.

One of the internal affairs cases that stunned members of Congress this month directly grew out of the interwoven Hillary Clinton email and Russia collusion investigations in 2016, during then-FBI Director James Comey James Brien ComeyFive memorable moments from Sarah Sanders at the White House Five memorable moments from Sarah Sanders at the White House Under Trump, our democracy is for sale MORE’s tenure.

The IG concluded that an FBI deputy assistant director engaged in multiple improper news media leaks while those investigations were ongoing, including one that violated a sealed court order, and accepted an improper gratuity from the news media. But prosecution was declined, yet again. FBI officials say they are considering discipline against the supervisor.

Records I reviewed indicate that more misconduct eerily similar to that already uncovered is being investigated. For example, the IG fraud unit opened a case in March and began interviewing whistleblowers about a new contract fraud matter inside the DEA, emails show.

It used to be that those who were entrusted to enforce the law were held to the highest standards.

Today, however, there is a troubling pattern of officers being held to a lower standard inside a department where critics fear there is a dual system of justice.

Holds Back Documents

Updated at 5:53 p.m. ET

The separation-of-powers standoff between Congress and the executive branch deepened on Wednesday over a dispute about access to materials involving the controversial citizenship question planned for the 2020 census.

The Justice Department notified the House oversight committee that it's withholding documents sought by the panel's chairman because it says they're shielded by executive privilege — the doctrine that permits an administration to conceal some of its internal workings.

The letter from Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd arrived electronically at the Capitol at the same time Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., had convened a hearing at which the committee debated whether to find Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt of Congress.

After a day's worth of discussion and amendments, it did, voting 24 to 15 by the late afternoon on contempt for the Cabinet officials.

Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., who has lately stepped up his criticism of Trump, broke with Republicans to support the measure.

The dispute over documents

Boyd's letter blamed Cummings for the administration's invocation of privilege.

The Justice Department has already provided tens of thousands of documents and access to witnesses but nothing is ever enough, officials say — and Democrats' threats of contempt meant these talks can't continue.

Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said after the Oversight Committee contempt vote made no sense.

""The committee's attempt to define the Department of Justice's good-faith cooperation as 'contempt' defies logic,"" she said. ""Today's action by Chairman Cummings and his committee undermines Congress's credibility with the American people.""

The Justice Department has provided Congress with tens of thousands of documents and access to witnesses on the census matter, Kupec said, over months of prior negotiations.

Cummings and the Democrats blame Barr, Ross and the administration for what they've called an effort to ""stonewall"" their investigation.

Critics argue that Trump's administration wants to use a question about citizenship on the 2020 census to suppress some responses, including those of Latinos, and Democrats say they want unredacted communications to see how the question was discussed inside the government.

""The census is critical to our democracy and our constituents,"" Cummings said. ""We must protect the integrity of the Census, and we must stand up for Congress' authority under the Constitution to conduct meaningful oversight.

The action in the committee on Wednesday followed a vote by the full House on Tuesday authorizing chairmen such as Cummings to file civil contempt lawsuits in order to try to obtain testimony or evidence.

That's what may happen now following the oversight committee session on Wednesday: Cummings, with the assent of the House leadership, could file suit and ask a judge to order Barr and Ross to provide the census materials he wants.

Republicans have criticized Democrats' litigation strategy as a waste of taxpayer dollars given the court costs involved and also as a dangerous road for the House. If members of Congress file suit but lose, Republicans warn, they could harm the oversight powers of the House over the long term."
USDA Corn Yield Estimate Still Too High,https://www.agweb.com,[],,,,https://www.agweb.com/article/usda-corn-yield-estimate-still-too-high/,"It’s been a long, arduous planting season for farmers across the U.S. Many farmers are wondering what this will mean for yields, ending stocks and, consequentially, corn prices.

“I think the drop-dead week will be this week for planting,” Michael Cordonnier of Soybean and Corn Advisor, Inc., told AgriTalk Host Chip Flory. “If you plant your corn at this time in June you’ve probably got at least a 20% yield drag. If you go at the end of this week that could go up to 30% or 40%. This is very serious, and we won’t know the yields until later in summer.”

So far, the market isn’t reflecting the tough season.

“USDA’s World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimate (WASDE) showed us down 3 million corn acres with a harvest estimate of 91.7%,” Cordonnier says. “I think a 90% harvest for grain is optimistic—it might be in the 88% to 89% and then lower yield. When you combine all these things, you’re going to get a much lower production number.”

Cordonnier estimates farmers will finish with 86 million corn acres planted, with 90% harvested for grain and a 165 bu./acre yield—putting total production at 12.8 million bu. His yield estimate is just slightly lower than USDA’s 166 bu./acre estimate.

With lower production and unchanged demand, the market could provide positive pricing opportunities.

“The burdensome corn carryout could be gone by the end of the summer,” Cordonnier says. “We’re going to need price rationing to ration the demand.”

South American farmers will be closely watching U.S. corn production, he notes.

“This is a corn story, primarily, in the U.S.,” says Cordonnier. “So, I do think corn acres will go up in South America, especially Argentina. They’re going to take out some soybeans to put in more corn.”"
"DHS chief reveals startling stat on asylum seekers who skip hearings, disappear",https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dhs-secretary-reveals-startling-stat-on-asylum-seekers-who-skip-hearings-disappear,"The acting Homeland Security secretary gave lawmakers a glimpse Tuesday into just how many asylum seekers skip their hearings after being released into the United States -- telling a Senate panel that a recent program found 90 percent miss their court dates.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., asked Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan how many asylum seekers coming across the southern border show up for their hearings.

BORDER ARRESTS SKYROCKET IN MAY, AS OFFICIALS DECLARE 'FULL-BLOWN EMERGENCY'

“It depends on demographic, the court, but we see too many cases where people are not showing up,” he said, telling Graham that DHS recently conducted a pilot program with family units.

“Out of those 7,000 cases, 90 received final orders of removal in absentia, 90 percent,” he said.

“90 percent did not show up?” Graham asked.

“Correct, that is a recent sample from families crossing the border,” McAleenan clarified.

McAleenan’s testimony also painted a grim portrait of a border crisis that shows no signs of easing, with Border Patrol overwhelmed and underfunded. The secretary described authorities as hamstrung by laws that limit how long they can keep migrants in custody.

“Currently due to a single district court order, we cannot obtain effective immigration enforcement results for the families arriving at our border -- they cannot be held for longer than 21 days and do not receive rulings from immigration courts for years,” he said.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported that it encountered 144,000 migrants at the border in May, a level not seen in decades, describing the situation as a “full-blown emergency.” McAleenan said that 60,000 children have entered into DHS custody in just the last 40 days.

McAleenan told lawmakers they also suffer due to “misaligned” asylum standards, meaning many of those who demonstrate “credible fear” of returning home -- the initial bar for claiming asylum -- are later judged not to have a valid asylum claim.

He also said the restrictions on how long family units can be held mean that a child is now seen as a passport to the U.S. -- a perception he said is based in reality. He testified that only 30 percent of those coming to the border are actually trying to avoid being captured.

“Unless you’re a single adult, it is very unlikely you’ll be repatriated,” he said.

McAleenan urged Congress to act to end those loopholes and to grant requested DHS funding, and suggested that moves to make asylum seekers claim asylum in their home countries or designated third-countries could help solve the crisis.

Graham’s “Secure and Protect Act of 2019,” being discussed at the hearing, would include a provision to establish refugee processing centers in Mexico and Central America, and the senator asked the DHS chief if such an approach would work.

“First of all, it would break the back of the smuggling organizations, they’re profiting from this cycle.” McAleenan said. ""It would provide access to asylum in country in a much safer manner than taking this dangerous journey and it would stop this flow immediately.”

“I believe the vast majority [of the migrant flow] would stop,” he said.

Democrats, meanwhile, suggested that the administration bears some of the blame for the situation at the border, with Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., pointing to McAleenan's recent appointment as an example of dysfunction at the department.

“In less than two and a half years, there have already been four heads of this department, we have before us an acting secretary who has been on the job for more than two months,"" he said. ""We cannot face this crisis effectively with a revolving door policy in the leadership at the Department of Homeland Security.”

McAleenan’s testimony comes amid continued negotiations between the Trump administration and Mexico on immigration. The U.S. announced on Friday that it had reached a deal with Mexico to drop threatened tariffs on Mexican imports in exchange for Mexico increasing efforts to limit U.S.-bound migration flows from Central America.

An administration source told Fox News Tuesday that a new deal for Mexico becoming a safe third country for asylum seekers was completed, but not yet announced.

DOJ audit reveals FBI lost track of dozens of foreign nationals,https://www.ktvz.com,"['Josh Campbell', 'Cnn Law Enforcement Analyst']",06-15-2019,2019,6,https://www.ktvz.com/news/politics/doj-audit-reveals-fbi-lost-track-of-dozens-of-foreign-nationals/1086546551,"Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

(CNN) - The FBI lost track of dozens of foreign nationals it sponsored for entry into the United States to assist with investigations, the Justice Department's internal watchdog found.

The revelation stems from an audit by the DOJ Office of Inspector General into the department's use of immigration tools that allow law enforcement to sponsor non-US citizens to enter the country without requiring a traditional visa or residency.

This special category of immigration status is often used by the department to permit the entry of cooperating witnesses and confidential informants, who may be required to take part in investigative operations or trial testimony. Many of these individuals would ordinarily be unable to obtain traditional lawful immigration status due to their connections to criminal enterprises.

An agreement with the Department of Homeland Security -- the federal agency charged with conferring immigration status -- requires sponsoring law enforcement agencies assume full responsibility for tracking and monitoring the location and activities of foreign nationals they sponsor for entry.

In its review of the use of these special provisions by Justice Department component agencies, the inspector general found that the FBI was unable to account for at least 61 foreign nationals it sponsored. Furthermore, rather than proactively reporting the total number of those who disappeared, the bureau only notified DHS of 32 individuals no longer under the agency's control.

""Granting entry for critical witnesses and informants can be very important to investigations, particular in major drug trafficking and national security cases,"" Greg Brower, former FBI assistant director and United States Attorney, said. ""However, since these individuals are often associated with crime, DOJ component agencies cannot simply lose track of them.""

DHS is responsible for a person's removal when the person, who is granted immigration status for a law enforcement purpose, absconds.

The process involves placing the individual's name into an immigration watchlist system as well as entering their identifying information into the national criminal database used by police departments and border agents across the country. However, if sponsoring agencies fail to notify DHS that they have lost control of a particular person, there is no way for DHS to properly flag the person as now residing in the country illegally.

While the inspector general noted the bureau's failure to account for the whereabouts of numerous people, the watchdog did indicate that proper vetting was generally sufficiently conducted prior to the entry of foreign nationals sponsored by the FBI, ATF, DEA, and US Marshals Service. This procedure included checking criminal databases and conducting a national security risk assessment in order to determine whether the individual posed a threat.

""Losing track of informants and witnesses is obviously a serious problem that needs to be fixed, but the report also makes clear that recipients were thoroughly vetted by investigators before being permitted into the country,"" said Jennifer Rodgers, CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor. ""Truly dangerous people would have never been allowed in using these tools.""

Asked for comment, a spokesperson for the FBI referred CNN to the bureau's response in the appendix section of the report. In it, the agency accepts all of the inspector general's recommendations for improvement and notes that efforts are currently underway to locate the missing foreign nationals and better work with DHS to improve tracking mechanisms.

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security declined to comment on the audit.

Although the inspector general suggests initial screening was done appropriately, the report also admonishes the Justice Department on the potential threat such individuals might pose to public safety.

""Significant risks accompany the sponsoring of foreign nationals for use in law enforcement investigations,"" the report notes, ""because these individuals may be associated with criminal activity and motivated only by the ability to temporarily reside in the United States.""

The inspector general also states, ""DOJ components must be vigilant in exercising their responsibilities for overseeing sponsored foreign nationals to fulfill their obligations to DHS, to protect the public, and to achieve their objectives of furthering investigations and prosecutions.""

In addition to addressing the issue of missing witnesses and informants, the report also faulted the FBI and DEA for allowing foreign national sponsorships to lapse without proper renewals.

In a sampling of the FBI's 3,059 sponsorships from fiscal years 2015-2017, investigators found several instances where a sponsoring agent missed the deadline for renewing a person's status -- sometimes by months -- meaning the sponsored foreign national was technically residing in the US illegally and subject to deportation.

Trump's Justice Department should change its tune on antitrust policy,https://thehill.com,[],06-15-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/448573-trumps-justice-department-should-change-its-tune-on-antitrust-policy,"As a former associate deputy attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, serving under Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrTrump's Justice Department should change its tune on antitrust policy Schiff blasts DOJ over memo on withholding Trump tax returns Trump remarks deepen distrust with intelligence community MORE, I see how the Antitrust Division could positively resolve a developing controversy.

Just one day after The Hollywood Reporter published an article arguing that examining the regulations pertaining to music licensing may be one of the Trump Department of Justice’s (DOJ) top antitrust targets, the Antitrust Division on June 5 re-opened a review into the consent decrees with the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) and Broadcast Music Inc. (BMI).

From threats of impeachment and investigations embroiling Barr personally, to investigations into apparent intelligence agency misconduct, DOJ certainly has a lot on its plate. And yet, despite all these concerns, the Antitrust Division has re-opened a review of the ASCAP and BMI consent decrees from 1941, even though DOJ concluded one just three years ago, determining after a two-year review that they should not alter the decrees.

Review processes are rarely reopened this soon after closure. Such occurrences typically mean one thing — the peddling of misinformation from stakeholders who have a hard time taking no for an answer.

Given Barr’s track record cutting through talking points, and knowing the importance of the ASCAP and BMI consent decrees, I question that this is the work of current AG Barr, especially given everything else competing for his attention. DOJ’s statements on this issue have come from the Antitrust Division head, not the attorney general himself. But Barr has the opportunity to steer the process in the right direction so that performers and consumers of music do not suffer higher costs and fewer opportunities to succeed.

So, what exactly do ASCAP and BMI do, and why do they need to remain restrained?

Almost anyone who has attended law school has read the ASCAP and BMI case law and understands the consent decrees’ significance to the music marketplace. Professors across the political spectrum utilize them as hallmarks of the efficacy of U.S. antitrust law.

Consisting of music publishers, songwriters and composers, the two organizations boast vast membership that has given them control of 90 percent of the music licensing market. Consequently, any bar, club, store or performing arts center that wants to play or perform music on its premises must receive the licensing rights to do so through them.

Although they provide important market efficiencies, ASCAP and BMI use the non-existence of competition and market pressure in the government-created intellectual property industry to their advantage. There is nothing condemnable about this; the job of ASCAP and BMI is to look out for the needs of members, not the industry at large. That is supposed to be the responsibility of DOJ, which must use the Sherman and Clayton Antitrust Acts to ensure competition and innovation in government-created industries.

In 1941, that is what the Justice Department did. It put ASCAP and BMI under consent decrees, which are antitrust orders that, without forcing the institutions in question to admit wrongdoing, stipulate that they keep prices at reasonable rates or else face consequences. The decrees authorize blanket licenses for everything in the repertoires of ASCAP and BMI to any individual or business that requests them.

In 2016, a DOJ review of the ASCAP and BMI consent decrees found that “the industry has developed in the context of, and in reliance on, these consent decrees and that they therefore should remain in place.” This was the right call, since ASCAP and BMI are just as massive and anti-competitive as they were in the 1940s.

To understand this, one needs only to look at the action DOJ has taken against their predatory behavior in recent years, even with the decrees in place. In one case, ASCAP even agreed to settle for $1.75 million to end further legal action by DOJ. If things are this bad today, intuition should lead anyone to believe that the Trump administration responding to the two monopolies’ calls to relax their antitrust agreements would only make things worse. And yet, that seems to be what the Antitrust Division may be planning to do.

Last year, Congress passed language in the Music Modernization Act (MMA) requiring that it remain apprised on future review processes before the DOJ makes a formal decision. This guidance from the House and Senate Judiciary Committees should go a long way toward ensuring that Barr’s department comes to the right decision.

Making the right call will mean everything to local musicians and the audiences and venues that host and listen to them. Although the royalty system for music overwhelmingly favors the top touring acts, by bringing music licensing pricing closer to market levels, the antitrust decrees protect the playing rights of up-and-coming musicians, who rely more heavily on the use of cover songs. Changing them considerably will cause even more venues to go bankrupt, opt to raise prices or stop supporting music because of the considerable costs. This will harm no one more than the performers and listeners of music themselves.

DOJ’s policy should be to ensure that fair markets exist in areas where the government’s footprint inherently breeds monopolies, such as the copyright industry. Failing to keep the consent decrees as they are will not only run a whole marketplace amuck; it also inevitably will lead to law professors across the country one day utilizing the music industry as a case study in the failures of government, rather than hailing it as a success story.

"T-Mobile, Sprint vow to fight state AGs if they get DOJ approval",https://www.foxbusiness.com,"['Lydia Moynihan', 'Charles Gasparino']",,,,https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/t-mobile-sprint-vow-to-fight-state-ags-if-they-get-doj-approval,"T-Mobile US. Inc., and Sprint Corp., are prepared to fight the 10 state attorneys general suing to block their $26 billion merger if the U.S. Department of Justice approves the deal, FOX Business Network has learned.

Continue Reading Below

The coalition of state AGs led by New York Attorney General Letitia James and California’s Xavier Beccera filed a lawsuit in Manhattan federal court on Tuesday to stop the deal on antitrust grounds, arguing the merger would reduce the number of major wireless carriers to three from four, and possibly lead to higher prices for consumers. The move briefly upended the negotiations between the companies and the DOJ’s Antitrust Division, which had been making progress toward a possible solution.

But on Wednesday, officials from T-Mobile and Sprint both resumed their consultation with the DOJ’s Antitrust Division, and importantly, developed a legal strategy to fight the state AG lawsuit, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

That strategy is to proceed with attempting to convince the DOJ to approve the deal, and if that happens, fight what the companies believe is a long-shot attempt to block the merger by the states, these people said. The companies believe that even if a court issues an injunction to block the deal, the state case is weakened by the fact it was filed before the DOJ finished its discussions with the companies about their agreement to make further concessions to address antitrust concerns, they added.

Press officials from T-Mobile and Sprint had no comment. A DOJ spokesman also declined comment. A spokesman for the New York Attorney General had no immediate comment.

Even with the latest twist to hit the merger, officials at T-Mobile and Sprint believe a final decision from the DOJ’s Antitrust Division could come by next week.

In their negotiations with the DOJ, T-Mobile and Sprint have discussed concessions including selling wireless spectrum and additional businesses outside the Sprint’s Boost Mobile prepaid service. The companies agreed to sell Boost, build out their rural network, and not raise wireless prices for three years in order to receive approval from the Federal Communications Commission for the merger to proceed.

The state attorneys general ""saw what the DOJ was likely to propose as a remedy and didn’t like it, so jumped the gun and sued."" Peter Adderton, founder of Boost

The Trump administration has made the development of fifth-generation wireless networks, also known as 5G, both a national security and an economic objective. The development of such super-fast wireless networks are expected to be an economic boom, adding potentially hundreds of billions of dollars to the U.S. gross domestic product. The companies have also argued that a combined T-Mobile and Sprint will be better able to compete on price with wireless heavyweights AT&T and Verizon and gain ground in the area of 5G.

But DOJ staffers are eager to nix the merger on the grounds that fewer major carriers will lead to higher prices—the same argument made by the state AGs. They can be overruled by antitrust chief Makan Delrahim, who is said to be officially undecided but may be warming to the companies’ argument that the merger would not lead to high prices, particularly, after additional concessions are agreed upon.

Progress toward forming a set of concessions may be behind the state lawsuit, according to Boost founder Peter Adderton. The state AGs “saw what the DOJ was likely to propose as a remedy and didn’t like it, so jumped the gun and sued,” Adderton said Tuesday in an interview with FOX Business.

Another theory for the lawsuit is that the “states just got frustrated with the slowness of the process at DOJ,” said Craig Moffett of MoffetNathanson Research. “There’s a fair amount of pressure on DOJ to end this process,” he added.

An antitrust lawyer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the state AGs' announcement may signal the DOJ is looking to approve the deal. “The state AGs want to get ahead of the DOJ decision… and undermine whatever action [the Department of] Justice is going to take."" However, a ruling with concessions could “take the wind out of the state AG’s sails,” this person told FOX Business.

Another possibility is the DOJ is looking to file its own suit and the state AGs want to deny the Trump administration a pro-consumer victory by launching their lawsuit first.

In filing their lawsuit, the attorneys general blindsided Delharim and his staff, which wasn’t notified of the filing, this person added. Officials at the DOJ’s Antitrust Division were recently in negotiations to appease the state attorneys general and prevent state legal action from taking place.

FOX Business has also learned that the AGs are attempting to recruit other states to create the strongest possible case that might find a sympathetic judge to block the deal, or delay it indefinitely through an injunction. “If the states win their injunction, it’s not a slam dunk but it could make the merger messy,” Moffett notes, adding that an injunction could prevent the deal from closing, forcing one or both of the parties to walk away.

Still, legal experts say the states face an uphill battle in looking to kill the merger if the DOJ approves it.

Not only do states have fewer resources than the feds, they also have a higher bar to meet to prove their case: They must show the merger would cause “irreparable harm” whereas the FCC’s “general interest” paradigm and the DOJ’s mandate to keep markets competitive are much broader and less restricting, experts say.

As the telecom deal continues to face opposition, some on Wall Street are looking at what may happen if the companies call it quits. In an unusual provision, T-Mobile is not required to pay Sprint the agreed upon $600 million break-up fee if Sprint’s debt doesn’t meet minimum credit ratings from the three major bond-rating services.

Sprint’s debt must have at least a “B-2” bond rating from Moody’s Investors Service, a “B” rating from S&P Global and “B-plus” from Fitch Ratings.

Sprint is the smallest of the major wireless carriers, and its finances are considered the most suspect contributing to a stock price that is just above penny-stock levels. Ironically, its shaky finances could help the deal gain approval; Delrahim told FOX Business in an April interview that he was considering the so-called “failing firm defense,” meaning he was weighing the argument made by company officials that if Sprint wasn’t purchased by T-Mobile it might fall into bankruptcy and the number of wireless carriers would be reduced."

Up Next × SHARE COPY LINK Gov. Mike Parson and a bipartisan group of local lawmakers celebrated the signing of the “Border War Bill” that will end tax breaks for companies moving from Missouri to Kansas, and vice versa, if both states enact the rules. .

Kansas and Missouri leaders have enticed the federal government into shipping hundreds of high-paying jobs from Washington to Kansas City through an unusual level of cooperation between the two states.

But now it’s time for the competition to begin.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Thursday that it would be relocating two research agencies—and hundreds of jobs—to the Kansas City region. But the USDA didn’t specify which side of the state line will be the new home for the Economic Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture.

“We have not determined which side of the river we’re going to be on,” Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue told reporters Thursday. “The Kansas City metropolitan area submitted really as a region and they wanted to be counted that way and that’s what we’ve chosen. Obviously, different states will have different incentives in that way as well. We don’t know exactly whether it will be Missouri or Kansas at this point.”

Perdue said the USDA will save $20 million annually in rent and employment costs by moving about 550 research jobs to Kansas City. He also touted $26 million in unspecified incentives he said that state and local governments have offered to the USDA for the relocation.

Those incentives could determine which side of the border the jobs land, but Perdue’s been tight-lipped about what the cities and states have offered.

Greg LeRoy, executive director of the watchdog group Good Jobs First, accused the USDA of engaging in an Amazon-style selection process that made states compete for the jobs with incentives.

“It’s outrageous that the USDA would run an auction. This is the extreme version of privatized behavior by the federal government. Uncle Sam has no business running auctions, dangling jobs on state and local taxpayers,” he said.





LeRoy said the final competition the USDA is setting up between Kansas and Missouri is reminiscent of how corporations set municipalities against each other after a region has been selected.

“This is classic site location consultant chicanery...This is an ugly, extreme version of Uncle Sam imitating Jeff Bezos. Yuck. If I were a Missouri or Kansas taxpayer, I would never stand for this. And as a federal taxpayer I’m cross-eyed.”

Perdue said the USDA considers the incentives proprietary and won’t reveal them at this time. But local governments are free to disclose them if they choose. So far, however, the states and municipalities are keeping a tight lid on the packages they’ve offered.

The Kansas Department of Commerce confirmed it has offered an incentive package, but declined to share specific details.

In a written statement, Kansas Commerce Secretary David Toland said the agency is confident “numerous advantages will put Kansas over the top” in the selection process.

“Kansas is on the cutting edge in the bioscience and agriculture industries with a cluster of prominent industry leaders located within our state. When it comes to research, technology and innovation, Kansas is the clear choice,” Toland said. “We look forward to continuing our conversation with USDA representatives and showing them the many great advantages that come with having a location in Kansas.”

The Missouri Department of Economic Development and Missouri Gov. Mike Parson’s office also won’t say what incentives the state is offering.

“Many of the details in the USDA project are still under negotiation, so we are treating it as an active project,” said Steele Shippy, Parson’s spokesman. “When projects are still in active negotiations, we do not publicly disclose project details.”

Kansas City Mayor Sly James’ office also did not disclose whether the city had offered incentives to the USDA.





SHARE COPY LINK The USDA’s decision to move hundreds of research jobs out of Washington to Kansas City has triggered a backlash among federal employees. Employees stood in silent protest during a meeting about the move to Kansas City.

Dave Trabert, the president of the Kansas Policy Institute, a free market think tank, said he agrees with the USDA’s decision to move the jobs out of Washington but thinks the states should not be offering incentives to make that happen.

“This is one of the dumbest ideas I’ve ever heard coming out of government. Taking taxpayer money and giving it to another government. Are you kidding me?” Trabert said. “Perdue says this is going to save the feds a lot of money over time, so they should fund their own transition.”

Crosby Kemper III, executive director of the Kansas City Public Library and a frequent critic of the city’s approach to economic development, called the relocation of the jobs a “big net benefit to KC” and said the two states should work together to offer an incentives package “that is identical for all the taxing jurisdictions.”

To win the USDA jobs, the two states exhibited a rare level of cooperation and beat out 135 competing proposals to bring the agencies to the Kansas City metro. Policymakers from both states have been reluctant to diverge from their all-for-one messaging.





But the the old regional competitive tensions haven’t simply disappeared. Policymakers have been clear about their preferences for which side of the state line the jobs should go.

In a statement, Parson said that Missouri agriculture has “unrivaled diversity, access to cutting-edge research at our land grant universities, and a thriving agribusiness environment.”

The selection of Kansas City as the new home of the research agencies came the same week that Parson and Kelly both took significant steps intended to end the border war on economic development in which the two states sought to lure companies back and forth across the state line. Parson signed legislation on Tuesday; Kelly said Friday that she was preparing an executive order.

Kelly drew a distinction between the two states’ pursuit of the final landing spot for the USDA agencies and the usual border skirmishes, where private companies gain lucrative incentives while adding few, if any, new jobs to the local economy.

“I think that’s just different because [USDA is not] an established company in Kansas City, Missouri, that they’re trying to lure across the border,” she said to reporters. “This is completely new and different. And Missouri’s betting on that, too.”

After Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Missouri, received word of the decision from a USDA deputy secretary Wednesday night, he said he immediately called Rep. Sharice Davids, the freshman Democrat who represents the adjacent Kansas district.





“I told her, ‘Either side that wins, both sides win,’” Cleaver said. “You look at Sprint, for example, I have a large number of constituents who work at Sprint in Johnson County, so I’m not going to be that disappointed (if the USDA picks Kansas).”

Still, that doesn’t mean the former Kansas City mayor wants to see those federal jobs in Davids’ district.

“She’s one of my favorite human beings on the planet. Nevertheless, I prefer that it be relocated to Kansas City, Missouri, and I’m going to work very hard to get that done.”

Cleaver said the Missouri side of the border has more buildings ready for federal workers to move into right away. Cleaver said teams from the federal government would be reviewing three sites in Missouri and two in Kansas.

Davids emphasized that the announcement is great for both states, but noted the quality of public schools in Kansas and said she’d be pointing that out the USDA.

“They can definitely look forward to hearing from me to let them know the benefits of having a facility on the Kansas side,” Davids said

Now that the USDA has picked the Kansas City region, responsibility falls to General Services Administration to find the building and sign the lease for the ERS and NIFA.

“It will be done fairly,” Perdue said. “They will probably have a [request for] proposal out on the street some time around the 1st of July.”

The GSA, which handles leasing on behalf of the federal government, operates on a general mandate to find the best value for taxpayers. That may put pricing pressure on building owners vying to land the USDA lease.

The USDA is looking for existing buildings with 120,000 square feet of available Class A, or top of the line, space to lease.

While the GSA will put out a proposal, multiple sources told The Star that six areas in the region got initial attention from the USDA. Those are:

The Sprint Campus in Overland Park

The Renner Ridge Corporate Center

Sublease space available at Shook, Hardy & Bacon’s headquarters near Crown Center

Crown Center

A Quality Hill office building at 8th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue

City Center Square in downtown Kansas City “They (GSA) will then ascertain different value levels of those proposals and make the best choice for the venue we need to be in,” Perdue said. GSA’s leasing decisions have at times prompted controversy in the Kansas City region. The Environmental Protection Agency leased space in a downtown Kansas City, Kansas building until 2011, when GSA moved the agency and its 700 jobs to the former headquarters of Applebee’s International in Lenexa. KCK leaders objected to moving jobs out of the city’s urban core. But downtown Kansas City interests also cheered GSA’s decision to move 1,000 federal employees from the Bannister Federal Complex to the Two Pershing Square building near Union Station in 2015. Kansas City Councilwoman Jolie Justus, who is running for Kansas City mayor, said she hoped the jobs would land in downtown Kansas City.



“I think that having it in downtown Kansas City with transit lines running in and out and more housing opportunities available would be the preferred location,” she said, “and if there’s anything I can do to help with that, I’m going to chip in and help with that.” But she drew a distinction between USDA’s relocation and previous iterations of the “Border War,” where the region was “using incentives to take Kansas jobs from Missouri and Missouri jobs from Kansas.” “Now it’s a healthy competition to bring new jobs into the entire region,” Justus said. “At the end of the day, the entire region wins.” Her opponent, Councilman Quinton Lucas, said he hoped the region would work together on the project to identify “the best package possible.” “I think there’s a way to do that,” Lucas said. “I don’t think it has to be acrimonious.”

Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kansas, the Senate Agriculture chairman, hasn’t been shy about sharing his preference that the jobs end up in Johnson County.

“We’d love to have it in Johnson County. That’s the best quality of living that I know of,” Roberts said the week before Kansas City was selected. “It’s like Eisenhower is president again.”"
"Editorial: EPA, emissions changes have to make sense",https://triblive.com,[],06-14-2019,2019,6,https://triblive.com/opinion/editorial-epa-emissions-changes-have-to-make-sense/,"TribLIVE's Daily and Weekly email newsletters deliver the news you want and information you need, right to your inbox.

Pennsylvania doesn’t have the same earthquake building code requirements as California.

The state doesn’t demand you inspect your home for dinosaurs before you sell it.

It makes sense that things that aren’t a problem aren’t regulated. Even if there was an earthquake in Central Pennsylvania this week, it’s not the kind of thing that swallowed homes and broke bridges. No special building standards required.

So it makes perfect sense that the Legislature has proposed eliminating vehicle emissions testing in more counties.

There was a reason to monitor and lower the filth belched out by cars and trucks when the rules were passed, but now all it does is take money away from vehicle owners. The money doesn’t even go to the state, but just covers the cost of the test itself. The garages that perform it, however, have to invest money in expensive, specialized equipment.

For all of that, only 4% of vehicles fail a test that is only administered to those least likely to fail. Older vehicles and those that use diesel are exempt. It’s already not required in 42 of Pennsylvania’s 67 counties.

On Wednesday, the Senate Transportation Committee passed a bill that would remove counties — including Westmoreland — that meet or exceed air quality and allow testing only every two years for other counties.

That makes sense. If the air quality is good, why keep making people pay to test newer cars that pose less problem?

What is more concerning that there are several things happening at the state and national level at the same time for the same reason that might individually make sense but together could be a problem.

Like the summer gas requirement. The more expensive, lower-polluting blend has been waived until July 1 because of a damaged pipeline, but Allegheny County is no longer required by the state and the Environmental Protection Agency to use the pricier fuel. A final decision on removing it is pending.

The reason for the change? Newer cars cause less pollution. The regulation isn’t necessary.

But last year, the federal government was talking about rolling back emissions standards for new cars, saying they were too high. This month, the EPA’s Science Advisory Board voted to review the science on the agency’s recommendations.

It doesn’t take a genius to see that the math there doesn’t add up to something good. We can’t say the cars don’t need inspection because they are better and the gas doesn’t need to be as good because the cars are more efficient and then take away the rules that make the better, efficient cars.

That just doesn’t make sense."
US report finds sky is the limit for geothermal energy beneath us,https://arstechnica.com,['Scott K. Johnson'],,,,https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/06/report-geothermal-could-power-up-to-16-of-us-grid-by-2050/,"With all attention focused on the plummeting prices and soaring popularity of solar and wind, geothermal energy is probably under-appreciated. Sure, you might think, it’s great where you can get it—in, say, Iceland or the Geysers area of California—but those are exceptions, right? Not entirely. Geothermal power sources come in many forms, and they're typically much more subtle than steam shooting out of the ground. In reality, geothermal energy could be a big player in our future mix.

That is made clear by the US Department of Energy’s recently released “GeoVision” report. The report follows similar evaluations of wind, solar, and hydropower energy and leans on information from national labs and other science agencies. It summarizes what we know about the physical resources in the US and also examines the factors that have been limiting geothermal’s deployment. Overall, the report shows that we could do a whole lot more with geothermal energy—both for generating electricity and for heating and cooling—than we currently do.

Heat and power

There are opportunities to more than double the amount of electricity generated at conventional types of hydrothermal sites, where wells can easily tap into hot water underground. That's economical on the current grid. But the biggest growth potential, according to the report, is in so-called “enhanced geothermal systems.” These involve areas where the temperatures are hot but the bedrock lacks enough fractures and pathways for hot water to circulate freely—or simply lacks the water entirely.

The technology used in natural gas fracking—injecting pressurized fluid underground to form fractures in the rock that released trapped gas into horizontally drilled wells—could be adapted to generate electricity in sites like these. Creating fractures and/or injecting water to get heated by these rocks eventually results in a similar geothermal plant setup, but it takes a lot more engineering than just jamming a straw into a source that's already sending hot water to the surface.

Advancing enhanced geothermal techniques alone could produce 45 gigawatts of electricity by 2050. Add in the more conventional plants, and you’re at 60 gigawatts—26 times more than current geothermal generation. And in a scenario where natural gas prices go up, making geothermal even more competitive, we could double that to 120 gigawatts. That would be fully 16 percent of the total projected 2050 generation in the US.

Additionally, that electricity can be generated around the clock and can even be flexibly ramped up or down, making it an excellent pairing with intermittent forms of renewable energy like wind and solar.

On the heating (and cooling) side, there are two main areas of opportunity. Traditional ground-source heat pumps circulate fluid through loops in the ground to provide cooling in the summer and heating in the winter, and they could be much more widely adopted with minimal effort. The report estimates that installations could increase 14 times over, to 28 million homes by 2050, covering 23 percent of national residential demand. Accounting for limitations in how quickly the market could realistically change brings the number down to 19 million homes—still a massive increase.

There’s even more potential for district heating systems, where a single, large geothermal installation pipes heat to all the buildings in an area. There are only a handful of such systems operating in the US today (Boise, Idaho, has an example), but the report finds more than 17,000 locations where it would make sense, covering heating needs for 45 million homes.

Limited adoption

The report focuses a great deal on the barriers that have so far prevented this eye-popping potential from being realized. Some barriers are indeed technological—those enhanced geothermal systems have yet to reach maturity, for example. Some barriers are simply down to a lack of awareness that things like ground-source heat pumps are already viable options.

But the biggest barriers are financial. Geothermal power plant projects suffer from much higher capital costs (and therefore slower payback times) than other forms of renewable energy. Techniques for placing wells at traditional hydrothermal sites are surprisingly unsuccessful, with many wells failing to produce enough to go into use. With better maps and more advanced site characterization, the misses could be reduced, bringing down costs.

The report also highlights permitting on federal lands as less than smooth. Between awkward overlaps when multiple agencies are involved and backlogs in understaffed departments, it points to approvals that could be consolidated to simplify the process. Streamlining, the report says, could shorten the time it takes to complete a project and reduce the financial risk of starting one. Separately, the constant uncertainty surrounding short-term tax credits for renewable projects also does geothermal no favors.

The 2050 scenarios in the report are based on plausible improvements to these barriers combined with modeling of the economics and operation of the nation’s energy grid. To make the projected numbers a reality, a set of key steps are laid out. Those include the streamlining of permitting, continuing research into the engineering of “enhanced geothermal systems,” improving methods for reducing trial and error at new installations, and outreach to increase awareness of geothermal options.

The other key is maximizing the value of each project. As flexibility is increasingly valued on the grid, compensating geothermal for that value would make it more profitable. There are also a variety of possible industrial uses for heat across the range of ground temperatures—everything from warming greenhouses to aiding cement production. A broader set of applications could help grow the geothermal industry, bringing costs down with scale.

If you’re a geothermal fan and an optimist, the report lays out a tantalizing amount of potential, although it lists plenty of challenges between here and there. In an intro to the report, DOE Geothermal Technologies Office Director Susan Hamm writes, “[T]his report shows us how to move the geothermal dial from what we know exists to what we envision is possible over the next 30 years. The GeoVision analysis takes us beyond a declaration of resource potential by illustrating what is real today and painting a picture of what could be real tomorrow.”"

State Department Defends Saudi Arms Sales Before Hostile House Panel,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Catie Edmondson', 'Edward Wong']",06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/us/politics/arms-sales-saudi-arabia.html,"WASHINGTON — A senior State Department official on Wednesday defended the Trump administration’s use of an emergency declaration to push through arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, telling a hostile House committee that holding back the weapons would have offered an opening to commercial rivals in China and Russia.

In a contentious hearing, lawmakers from both parties pressed R. Clarke Cooper, the assistant secretary of state in the bureau of political-military affairs, to detail when the administration first developed the plan to declare an emergency and sell weapons to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates against Congress’s will.

Lawmakers are outraged by the decision by President Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in late May to use a loophole in the Arms Export Control Act to push through more than $8 billion worth of weapons sales, almost all to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The two countries are leading an air war against rebels in Yemen that has resulted in a humanitarian disaster and thousands of civilian deaths, many of them children. In both chambers, bipartisan groups of lawmakers are already moving to block the sales, many of which Democrats had informally held up since last year.

Members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee asked whether the emergency declaration was being discussed within the administration when Mr. Pompeo and Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan briefed legislators in a closed-door meeting on threats posed by Iran, which took place three days before Mr. Trump declared the emergency on May 24."
"A top DOJ official just outlined why the agency has everything it needs to go after Big Tech — and Facebook, Google, and Amazon should be nervous",https://www.businessinsider.com,['Troy Wolverton'],06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.businessinsider.com/makan-delrahim-doj-no-need-new-antirust-laws-big-tech-2019-6,"Makan Delrahim thinks the current legal code is more than sufficient to safeguard competition in the tech industry.

As federal enforcement officials begin to scrutinize Alphabet, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon over potential antitrust violations, some policymakers and legal experts have questioned whether new laws are needed to rein in the companies. But in a speech at a conference in Tel Aviv, Israel, on Tuesday, Makan, the top antitrust official in the Department of Justice, made clear he's not among them.

""We already have in our possession the tools we need to enforce the antitrust laws in cases involving digital technologies,"" Makan, an assistant attorney general, said in the speech, which CNBC previously reported. ""US antitrust law is flexible enough to be applied to markets old and new.""

Pointing to the US government's case 20 years ago against Microsoft and the nation's long history of challenging the power of dominant companies, he added: ""Those who say we need new or amended antitrust laws to address monopoly concerns should look to history and take heart.""

Debate has been growing over what, if anything, policymakers should do about the power wielded by the largest tech companies. Google's parent, Alphabet, has already been fined by European regulators three times for anticompetitive actions. Apple just lost a decision at the US Supreme Court in an antitrust case and is the subject of a formal antitrust complaint in Europe made by Spotify. Facebook has drawn intense scrutiny for all the data it's collected on its billions of users and the ways in which its immense social network have been hijacked to spread propaganda.

Antitrust laws are old but adequate

Earlier this month, The Washington Post reported that the DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission had divvied up oversight over the four biggest tech companies, with the DOJ looking at Apple and Alphabet and the FTC taking on Amazon and Facebook.

But some antitrust experts and other policymakers have argued that new laws are needed to control the companies. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is running for president, has called for legislation that would classify as ""utilities"" any tech company with more than $25 billion in revenue that runs a marketplace or has its own platform. It would also bar those tech utilities from owning companies that participate on their service.

The US has two major antitrust laws — the Sherman Antitrust Act and the Clayton Antitrust Act. Each is more than 100 years old and was written in an earlier era of monopolies, but in Delrahim's view, both are robust enough to handle any of today's problems.

""Through their general wording, and their focus on competitive process and consumer welfare, the antitrust laws allow US courts to continue to apply legal principles and sound economic reasoning to identify harmful practices that the antitrust laws should prevent,"" he said.

The DOJ is concerned with more than just prices

In recent years, many antitrust experts on the left have charged that the courts and enforcement regulators have paid too much attention to consumer prices when it comes to evaluating the impact of a company's dominance over a particular market or potential mergers. But Delrahim pushed back against that view.

The DOJ recognizes that monopolies sometimes lower prices and that limited competition can have harms other than just increased consumer costs, he said. Innovation and quality can also be hampered when companies have too much power or too few rivals to keep them honest.

""The Antitrust Division does not take a myopic view of competition,"" Delrahim said, calling it ""well-settled"" that competition ""has price and non-price dimensions.""

But as the DOJ ramps of its investigations of Alphabet and Apple, Delrahim himself is now facing criticism. Warren on Tuesday called for him to recuse himself from any investigations into the two companies because of lobbying work he did for them. Delrahim lobbied on Google's behalf in 2007 for its acquisition of DoubleClick and on Apple's behalf in 2006 and 2007 on patent issues.

""Your past work as a lobbyist for two of the largest and most scrutinized tech companies in the world creates the appearance of conflict of interest,"" Warren said in a letter to Delrahim, which was previously reported by The Verge. ""As the head of the antitrust division at the DOJ, you should not be supervising investigations into former clients who paid you tens of thousands of dollars to lobby the federal government.""

The Energy 202: 'Just do your jobs': Ex-EPA chiefs go off on Trump administration,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Dino Grandoni', 'Reporter Covering Energy', 'Environmental Policy']",06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/06/12/the-energy-202-just-do-your-jobs-ex-epa-chiefs-go-off-on-trump-administration/5d00011a1ad2e55f2de7c082/,"THE LIGHTBULB

""Afraid."" ""Concerned."" Or just plan ticked off.

That is what past leaders of the Environmental Protection Agency said they felt when they think about the direction the agency has taken under President Trump.

Four former EPA chiefs — three Republicans and one Democrat — spent Tuesday criticizing the EPA's shrinking size and ambition in testimony on Capitol Hill, saying the agency has moved away from its core duties under Trump, The Post's Brady Dennis and I reported.

“I’m deeply concerned that five decades of environmental progress are at risk because of the attitude and approach of the current administration” Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican who led the agency during the George W. Bush administration, told lawmakers on the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

""Climate change is real, and the administration is abdicating its responsibilities by denying it,"" added Whitman, once the governor of the coastal state of New Jersey.

Similar worries dominated the testimony of Gina McCarthy, who led the EPA during the final years of the Obama administration and has been an outspoken critic of the current one.

Like Whitman, McCarthy bemoaned the exodus of longtime EPA employees and what she calls the sinking morale of many career staffers. She and others raised questions about whether the Trump administration is adequately relying on science to drive its policy decisions, and said the White House is ignoring the threat of climate change amid an aggressive push to scale back environmental regulations.

And for McCarthy, the Trump administration is in the process of rolling back her own work.

“I’m here for one reason and one reason only, and it’s not to weep about all my precious rules being rolled back. Although I admit that the constant roll back is beginning to tick me off a bit,"" McCarthy said. ""Maybe even more than just a bit.""

""I’m here to remind the political leadership at the EPA that what they do matters, and it’s time for them to step up and to do their jobs. Just do your jobs,"" she continued, adding the current EPA seemed to value lowering costs to industry more than safeguarding public health.

The EPA did not respond to a request for comment on the testimony. Earlier this year, the agency touted its work during the first two years under Trump, highlighting dozens of deregulatory actions and saying that it had “continued to deliver on its promise to provide greater regulatory certainty while protecting public health and the environment.”

The Hill hearing was intended to “address the mission and future” of the agency, according to Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.), the committee chairman. It comes after seven past EPA chiefs, representing Republican and Democratic administrations, wrote to House lawmakers in April, offering Congress help with oversight of the agency.

“We are united that there has never been a more important time for us to put aside our differences and advocate collectively for public health and the environment,” they wrote in the letter, which was first reported by E&E News.

The letter was signed by the EPA’s first administrator, William Ruckelshaus, a Republican who also has been critical of the Trump administration’s approach, as well as a host of other past leaders.

The ex-EPA chiefs, who served under Reagan, Obama and both Bushes, pressed Congress to use its oversight power to rein in the current deregulatory push and to ensure the EPA relies on science over politics in its actions. House Democrats who invited the former officials echoed their concerns and promised they are already looking into the rollback of air and chemical rules.

“The four former administrators with us this morning truly know what is at stake and how to accomplish EPA’s mission,” Pallone said.

Some Republicans on the committee criticized McCarthy’s management of the EPA for what they saw as exceeding her authority, pointing to the EPA’s efforts to drastically slash emissions from coal-fired power plants.

“Under her leadership, I think the EPA went rogue,” Rep. David B. McKinley (R-W.Va.) said.

Other Republicans emphasized how often their constituents, many of whom are rural farmers, have to contend with difficult-to-understand regulations on pesticides and fertilizers. And at times, the former administrators acknowledged the challenges of making the public understand their work.

“It’s not an accident that the president can say the kind of things he said about wanting to break up EPA into little bits,” said former administrator William Reilly, who served under George H.W. Bush.

But Reilly still expressed apprehension with what he sees as the pro-industry direction the agency has taken, with its revisions to Obama-era air pollution rules on mercury and methane.

He noted that while the EPA needs to consider the ""economic impact"" of its actions, ""the environment and health come first.""

Lee Thomas, a Republican who led the EPA from 1985 to 1989, compared the current EPA management to the tenure of Anne Gorsuch Burford — Reagan’s controversial first EPA administrator.

Burford, the mother of Supreme Court Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, resigned amid sharp budget cuts, a rift between political and career staff and a scandal over mismanagement of the Superfund cleanup program.

“EPA in 1983 was in the middle of chaos and turmoil,” Thomas said. “There were six different congressional committees that were investigating what was going on at EPA … There was a deregulatory agenda. There was an attack on science at many levels.”

“All that sound familiar?” he added. “ Well there’s an awful lot of that going on today.”

POWER PLAYS

— 2020 watch: Joe Biden told a Greenpeace activist he supports having a climate-focused presidential debate. “We should,” Biden said when asked on a ropeline after a speech in Iowa. “I think that’s what we should be doing. …Yeah, I’m all in. Take a look at what I’m talking about – and by the way, the first climate change plan in the history of the Congress? Biden.”

The context: “Biden has been at pains to emphasize his devotion to climate action, especially since an aide was quoted as saying Biden would take a ‘middle road’ to fighting climate change — a characterization he strongly disputes,” The Post’s David Weigel reports. Biden’s remarks make him the 15th Democratic candidate to endorse a climate debate.

Meanwhile: The chair of the Democratic National Committee defended his decision not to hold a single-issue debate. He called climate change an “urgent threat” and insisted he’s “confident that climate change will receive more attention than ever before — and deservedly so.” But he said “[t]o amend these rules now, after having enforced them throughout this primary process, would be putting our thumb on the scale,” he said in a post on Medium. “If we change our guidelines at the request of one candidate who has made climate change their campaign’s signature issue, how do we say no to the numerous other requests we’ve had?”

In response: Democratic contender and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D), who is running on a climate change platform, said the DNC “won’t recognize the climate crisis as an existential threat, but instead has chosen to treat it as a pet issue of one candidate.”

Trump in Iowa: While speaking at the Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy in Council Bluffs, the president touted his work on ethanol while taking a jab at Biden. “I fought very hard for ethanol,” Trump told the audience. “Under the previous administration, our leaders rejected American energy and they rejected ethanol.""

Biden fires back: The former vice president criticized the Trump administration’s tariffs between the United States and China, which he said “crushed” the state’s farmers, during remarks in Iowa, The Post’s Matt Viser, John Wagner and Jenna Johnson report. “[Trump] thinks he’s being tough,” Biden said. “Well, it’s easy to be tough when someone else is feeling the pain.”

Biden's legacy on ethanol: The ex-vice president ""was considered instrumental in orchestrating the blending cuts as a way to help struggling refineries on the East Coast deal with rising compliance costs under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard,” per Reuters. “A federal court struck down the cuts in 2016. But the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has yet to make the biofuel industry whole for the lost gallons despite repeated promises to do so.”

— It'll be harder for China to choke the U.S. of “rare earth” minerals than it thinks: Amid escalating trade tensions between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, China is threatening to hold these minerals hostage as retaliation. The elements are linchpins of many high-tech products such as wind turbines, electric vehicles and nuclear reactors. And China’s share of global production was at more than 97 percent in 2010, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

But: According to The Post's David J. Lynch, the U.S. economy is more resilient to such a rare-earth ban than it appears. New mines in California, Australia and Myanmar have shrunk China's production share to 71 percent last year. And any embargo won't be foolproof, with rogue operations in China last year producing an estimated 60,000 tons of rare earths.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.). (Damian Dovarganes/AP)

— Democratic chair wants an explanation for the suppression of congressional testimony on climate: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) sent letters to the State Department and Office of the Director of National Intelligence demanding more information about the White House’s suppression of written testimony about “possibly catastrophic” consequences of climate change. The Post first reported last week that the White House blocked a State Department intelligence agency from submitting written testimony to Schiff’s committee about the national security threat from human-driven global warming. “

If these reports are accurate, I applaud your Bureau for standing by its analysts and the integrity of its analysts and the integrity of their work in the face of political pressure, but the Committee remains gravely concerned about the events surrounding [bureau senior analyst Rod Schoonover]’s withheld written testimony,” he wrote in the letter to State Assistant Secretary Ellen McCarthy, who oversees the State Department’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research.

Schiff’s demand: The chairman called for details about communications with the White House on any review process for the written testimony as well as testimony from McCarthy or other officials to explain the basis for Schoonover’s analysis.

He reportedly agreed to the interview because he thought it was with his hometown newspaper, the Glenwood Springs Post Independent. He spoke briefly about climate change and about national parks, mentioning that he recently saw structures in Acadia National Park that are “literally crumbling.” “You may go look at a campground and charcoal grills are falling down, the amenities don’t work, the water doesn’t turn on when you turn it on,” Bernhardt said, telling the publication he’s hoping to address park maintenance by raising entry fees and visitor costs.

— Adrift in the Arctic: This fall, scientists will launch the largest Arctic research expedition ever, to document how climate change is affecting the fastest-warming region on Earth, as The Post’s Sarah Kaplan reports from Utqiagvik, Alaska. “What the scientists discover during their year in the frozen north will help them forecast the future of the entire planet,” she writes. “Struggling on the sea ice off Alaska during their training this April, they get a taste of how tough the task will be. They are steeling themselves for what awaits at the pole: profound isolation and protracted darkness, laborious experiments, cold that can plunge to 45 degrees below zero. There are countless ways the Arctic might thwart and threaten them at every turn.”

By the numbers: It will take one year and $134 million and will be part of a 17-nation project. The Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate, a 387-foot research station, is scheduled to launch on Sept. 20 and will see a rotating set of 300 meteorologists, biologists, oceanographers and ice experts.

— A “new climate regime”: A study published this week in the journal Earth’s Future warned about a “new climate regime” with “extraordinary” heat waves, The Post’s Jason Samenow reports. He points to heat waves that killed hundreds and hospitalized thousands across the Northern Hemisphere last summer, a pattern that may be part of a new normal. “The study’s modeling analysis, conducted by researchers in Switzerland and the United Kingdom, found heat events like last summer’s do ‘not occur in historical simulations’ and ‘were unprecedented prior to 2010,’ ” he adds. “As the climate warms, the study projects that the area affected by heat waves like last summer’s will increase 16 percent for every 1.8 degrees (1 Celsius) of warming.”

"DOJ slams latest committee contempt vote, warns of retaliation",https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Stephen Dinan']",06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jun/11/doj-slams-latest-committee-contempt-vote/,"The Justice Department warned Tuesday that it could retaliate against the House Oversight Committee should the panel vote this week to pursue contempt of Congress proceedings against Attorney General William P. Barr, saying it would sour what cooperation there has been.

Assistant Attorney General Stephen E. Boyd said the department has turned over thousands of pages of documents to the Oversight Committee but Chairman Elijah Cummings‘ quick trigger finger on the contempt vote is ruining that.

“Should the committee take the unnecessary and counterproductive step of proceeding with a contempt vote, the department will be forced to reevaluate its current production efforts in ongoing matters,” Mr. Boyd wrote.

He also warned that Mr. Cummings‘ vote won’t end up getting the congressman what he wants.

If the committee does pursue contempt, President Trump will assert a protective executive privilege over the documents Mr. Cummings is trying to get. That would effectively shield them all, while government lawyers look them over, Mr. Boyd suggested.

Mr. Cummings, in a reply letter Tuesday, said Republicans were making demands and issuing threats without offering any accommodations or promises that they will turn over documents if the committee delays its action.

“The committee cannot accept these terms,” he said. “The committee has a responsibility under the Constitution to conduct rigorous oversight of the census, and we will not continue to delay our efforts due to your ongoing obstruction.”

Mr. Cummings suspects shenanigans behind the move to add the citizenship question to the 2020 census — a contention several federal judges have backed up with their findings in several court cases.

The legality of the citizenship question is now pending before the Supreme Court.

Republicans argue Mr. Cummings is trying to sway the justices by orchestrating the contempt vote.

Mr. Boyd said that when Congress demands documents from the administration there is supposed to be an accommodation, where both sides work through privileges and other issues that arise.

He said that didn’t happen in this case.

In particular, he said, Mr. Cummings refused to allow a Justice Department lawyer to attend a deposition of a top department official — leading Mr. Barr to order the official not to testify.

The department released a legal opinion last month justifying Mr. Barr’s stance, saying the Obama administration held the same position.
