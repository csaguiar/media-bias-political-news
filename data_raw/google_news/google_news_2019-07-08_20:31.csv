2020 Dems reverse course to oppose virtually all Trump judicial nominees,https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2020-dems-reverse-course-to-oppose-virtually-all-trump-judicial-nominees,"It may come as no shock that Democratic senators currently running for president have opposed nearly all of President Trump’s judicial nominees this year -- but newly reported voting data shows some of those same lawmakers backed a surprising number of the president's court picks before the election season began.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., for example, voted in favor of 46 percent of Trump’s nominees from 2017-2018, according to data compiled by Demand Justice. Yet the figures, obtained and reported by Politico, show that in 2019, that number shrank to zero.

BIDEN BUCKS DEMO 2020 FIELD ON COURT PACKING, DECRIMINALIZING BORDER CROSSINGS

Two other 2020 candidates, Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., also rejected every single one of Trump’s picks this year, when in previous years they each approved 47 percent.

""They’ve lost their minds,"" Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, told Politico. ""It’s just reflexive so I don’t think it’s any reflection on the nominees in particular. They’re just opposed to anything and everything the president is for.""

Even those who approved the majority of the president’s judicial nominees during the first two years of his term have reversed course. While Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., approved 64 percent of Trump’s picks in past years, this year saw just a 3 percent approval rate. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., went from 51 percent down to 6 percent. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., had approved almost half in the past, at 49 percent, and stands at 11 percent this year.

Gayle Trotter, spokesperson for the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, said this trend against approving Trump's nominees ""isn't going to play well"" for Democrats in 2020.

""American voters made their voices heard on this issue in 2016, they want independent judges who fairly apply the law and adhere to the Constitution,"" Trotter told Fox News. ""Trump has delivered those kinds of judges for the American people and it's only radical Democratic politicians who are standing in the way.""

A spokesperson for Warren, meanwhile, told Politico that the senator “holds every nominee to the high standard appropriate for a lifetime appointment to the federal judiciary,” and accused the GOP and the president of failing to do the same. The Warren campaign did not immediately respond to a Fox News request for additional comment.

A representative for Klobuchar acknowledged there has been a downward shift in “every single Democratic Senator’s support,” blaming it on a rule change enacted by Republicans who control the Senate.

In past years, it was common for potential judges to receive approval from both of their home state’s senators before their nomination moved forward. That changed during Trump's presidency. In 2018, then-Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, stopped requiring senators' approval, allowing Trump to get judges on the court who did not have the approval of their senators.

The Ninth Circuit, for instance, was known largely as a liberal jurisdiction until President Trump started placing conservative judges on the bench. Now, the number of conservatives is catching up to the number of liberals on the court, with Trump poised to take advantage of even more recent openings on the bench. The Ninth Circuit includes California, whose senators include Harris.

TRUMP EYES NEW CHANCE TO PUT MARK ON LONG-LIBERAL 9TH CIRCUIT

In January, Harris vowed to “oppose every nominee to an appellate court” until Trump institutes a more “fair process.”

Several Democrats have proposed countering Trump's judicial picks with their own measures. Candidates including Booker, Warren, Harris, and Gillibrand have signaled their openness to increasing the number of Supreme Court justices if they enter the White House.

Sanders has opposed this practice, known as court packing, but suggested rotating justices to other courts in order to provide ""new blood"" to the Supreme Court. Former Vice President Joe Biden similarly came out against court packing, warning that if Democrats take that approach, ""we’ll live to rue that day.""

New York gov signs law that would allow Congress to get Trump's state tax returns,https://www.cnn.com,"['Paul Leblanc', 'Lauren Fox', 'Elizabeth Joseph']",07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/08/politics/new-york-trump-state-tax-returns-congress/index.html,"Washington (CNN) New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Monday signed an amendment to New York law that would allow Congress to get hold of President Donald Trump's state tax returns while the legal battle for his federal returns rages on.

The law, which takes effect Monday, requires the state's tax commissioner to provide New York state tax returns to Congress upon request from the House Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Finance Committee, or the Joint Committee on Taxation and mandates the removal of any federal tax information that might appear on state returns.

Despite this, there are no immediate plans for House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal to request Trump's state tax returns as the law outlines, according to a Democratic aide with knowledge of the situation. Utilizing the New York law could complicate the battle the Democratic-led House Ways and Means Committee has already been waging in court to obtain six years of the President's personal and business federal tax returns.

Additionally, if the House Ways and Means Committee tried to obtain Trump's state taxes through the New York law, it would likely trigger a lengthy legal debate over its authority to do so. While the committee has jurisdiction over federal tax laws, state tax laws mostly fall to the House Judiciary Committee.

Should a congressional committee decide to utilize the law, Trump attorney Jay Sekulow told CNN Monday the administration would push back."
The census case is down to Donald Trump vs. John Roberts.,https://slate.com,['Dahlia Lithwick'],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/07/trump-roberts-supreme-court-citizenship-question-census.html,"President Donald Trump and Chief Justice John Roberts. Photo illustration by Slate. Photos by Mark Wilson/Getty Images and Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images.

In October, the Atlantic’s Adam Serwer coined what has become the defining phrase of the Trump presidency: “The cruelty is the point.” Those words have been cited to describe the growing national torpor around atrocities taking place at the Southern border, the president’s frightening embrace of autocratic murderers, the decline in public civility, and the rise of vicious tribalism. In so many ways, the cruelty is driving all of it. But there’s another factor at play here, one that’s proceeding on a parallel track. Along with the coarsening and “othering” that mark Donald Trump’s every move, there’s also a compulsion to transform that which was once serious and dignified into small, silly tragicomedy.

Witness what Trump has made of the Supreme Court. The court is an august institution, one that’s drunk, to be sure, on its share of self-congratulatory mythology, but also capable of inspiring awe and reverence for the law and the Constitution and the virtues of logic and civility. Yet within a week of suffering his first major loss at the high court, Trump has turned two centuries of elevated legal thought and studied institutional understatement into a constitutional reality show.

In spite of the Supreme Court’s 5–4 decision to prevent a citizenship question from appearing on the 2020 census, and despite the assertions of his own commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, as well as formal legal promises from his own Department of Justice, Trump has decided he wants to proceed with the question anyhow. With that move, the president has turned the Trump administration’s embarrassing flirtation with deception and incompetence into a standoff between two men. It’s now down to the president vs. the chief justice in a cage match of democratic will. To put it another way: Will John Roberts allow Donald Trump to do again what he did in the travel ban case, laundering a terrible idea so it’s just clean enough to take at face value?

In some ways, Roberts brought this upon himself with his split-the-baby opinion, finding both that Ross had constitutional and statutory authority to add the citizenship question but also that, er, no, all the lying about it would not do. As the court’s lone swing voter, Roberts gave himself sole authority to determine if and when the taint of Ross’ lying could be cleansed. Some observers believed that stain could never be removed, no matter how hard Trump’s cronies scrubbed, and that the administration would stand down, admit defeat, and move on to other priorities. Other smart people, among them Joshua Matz and Slate contributor Rick Hasen, argued that the president could still cure the defects of his first attempt, making a new argument that would pass muster. Finally, into the chasm between those two camps lies credible speculation, like that of Linda Greenhouse, that Roberts may have switched sides at the last minute, as he did in the first Affordable Care Act case. Perhaps the chief had a “dark night of the soul” and sided against the transparent (and racially motivated) lying by the commerce secretary. If that was so, the only lingering question would be whether the swing justice could swing back in time to get the question printed on the 2020 census.

Last week, Mark Joseph Stern and I summed up the chief justice’s decision as a vote for the appearance of gravitas and reason in the midst of an Abbott and Costello effort by Ross and GOP loyalists to rig future elections. “At moments of greatest political turmoil,” we wrote, “when the court is in the crosshairs because governmental bad behavior or Trumpian bungling puts it there, Roberts will take public sentiment into account and modulate the uproar.” We both believed that this would be the last word on the census case, as, apparently, did the Department of Commerce and the Department of Justice, which represented to Judge George J. Hazel that the census had gone to the printers without a citizenship question.

But Wednesday afternoon, in one of the most humiliating performances ever by government lawyers before a federal judge, Trump’s attorneys admitted that they had absolutely no idea why the president had reopened the case via tweet—“The News Reports about the Department of Commerce dropping its quest to put the Citizenship Question on the Census is incorrect or, to state it differently, FAKE!” Trump wrote—or what the plan was. “The tweet this morning was the first I had heard of the president’s position on this issue, just like the plaintiffs and Your Honor,” DOJ special counsel Joshua Gardner told Hazel in a rushed telephone conference. Gardner implored Hazel not to tag him as dishonest, saying, “What I told the Court yesterday was absolutely my best understanding of the state of affairs and, apparently, also the Commerce Department’s state of affairs.”

The more telling exchanges in that phone conference came from the plaintiffs, representing communities that remain panic-stricken at the prospect of immigration raids. In an interview last week, Trump said, “I think it’s very important to find out if somebody is a citizen as opposed to an illegal”—a seeming indication that the real rationale for the citizenship question was to take further action against undocumented immigrants. He has since confirmed that this is his real goal—a goal explicitly disavowed in the census arguments. That boast led attorneys to ask the judge to prohibit Trump from terrorizing immigrant communities. Denise Hulett of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund put it this way in Wednesday’s teleconference:

The President’s tweet has some of the same effects that the addition of the question would in the first place and some of the same effects on the 18-month battle that was just waged over the citizenship question. It leaves the immigrant communities to believe that the Government is still after information that could endanger them. If you add that to the interview that the President did, sharing that his reason for wanting the citizenship question on the form was so that the Government could distinguish between citizens and illegal aliens and how nonsensical that is, it has the effect of leading the public to believe that the Census is not only after that information but is willing to violate some of the provinces of protection that our plaintiff organizations have been trying to reassure communities about.

What Hulett was saying is what everyone now knows: In some respects, the damage is already done. Whether or not the citizenship question ultimately appears on the census, Trump has managed to intimidate immigrants out of participating in democracy.

And as Hulett noted Wednesday afternoon, immigrants take the president’s tweets seriously and understand that their purpose is to threaten them. Threats of new raids exacerbate their concerns. Hazel’s response was inevitable: “I assume, although maybe I’m wrong about this, that the parties aren’t suggesting I can enjoin the President of the United States from tweeting things.”

When the case comes back to the high court, it rests with Roberts alone to put a definitive stop to the practice of using the census to terrorize noncitizens. It would mean refusing to accept the next fake pretext as a defensible one. It would require Roberts to put to rest the “presumption of regularity.” Even DOJ lawyers have abandoned the pretense that the president is magisterial and learned and should be treated as such in the courts. Now they simply scramble around in his wake, emptying his dirty ashtrays and pretending that stirring up fear and trauma while mobilizing a base isn’t his main goal. Hazel can do nothing to stop that, as he acknowledged. Roberts still can.

Roberts could, at minimum, put an end to this presidential temper tantrum, by slamming the door definitively on efforts to work around the court’s ruling. Whether he wants to do that remains anybody’s guess. And that it has come to this is just sad. The mixed signaling from Roberts’ opinion around whether the administration can still cure the pretextual reasoning surely emboldened the president.

That Trump is now reportedly considering putting the citizenship question back onto the census by way of an executive order is a natural reaction to Roberts’ compromise resolution. It’s a shockingly aggressive move that seems doomed to fail, but do read it for what it really is: Trump is threatening the chief justice, claiming for himself absolute authority to overrule the court. The Washington Post is telling us that Trump’s advisers don’t want him to back down, so his government lawyers spent the Fourth of July building better pretexts.

And so now it seems Trump will have his season finale smackdown with the chief, the man he has never forgiven for his vote in the Obamacare cases. And Roberts, who probably believed he had settled this issue last week, must now decide, again, whether it’s worth his while to let the circus clown tear down the institution he prizes above all things. It’s lose-lose for the chief justice, win-win for the president, and a boon for ratings all around."

Despite fielding an unprecedented number of would-be candidates, Democrats have so far failed to find a standard-bearer likely to unify their party. As the recent debates showed, the party has moved left, and further left still, leaving the majority of Americans behind as they try to placate Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez and other noisy progressives.

BOOKER OUTLINES PLAN TO 'VIRTUALLY ELIMINATE IMMIGRANT DETENTION' THROUGH EXECUTIVE ORDER

At the same time, the better-than-expected June jobs report confirms the economy remains strong, dampening ceaseless speculation (and left-wing hope) about a pending recession. Meanwhile, relentless hounding of the president by his political foes has had zero impact on his popularity among Republicans. If anything, the unimaginable vitriol has further hardened his support.

Maybe the intelligentsia is not so intelligent after all.

The liberal media is working feverishly to undermine the president, critical of his every move. They tell us that his venturing into North Korea to shake hands with Kim Jong Un delivered a “propaganda win” to the Korean dictator. To whom? To the oppressed citizens of that miserable country who have been told their noble leader’s father was so pure that he never needed to defecate? Or that he scored 11 holes-in-one in his first round of golf? We’re worried about feeding that absurd propaganda machine?

Most Americans likely saw Trump’s move as characteristically gutsy and unconventional, but also a gesture that might someday bear fruit. Moreover, many saw it as a refreshing departure from the uber-cautious foreign policy of the Obama years.

Democrats and their media pals were also churlish about the president’s Fourth of July celebration in Washington. The New York Times described it as a “made-for-television production starring America’s military weaponry” and Democrats said parading tanks in the nation’s capital was the hallmark of a tyrant. Please don’t tell President Emmanuel Macron; it was the Bastille Day parade in democratic France, complete with military hardware, that inspired Trump’s celebration.

It says something that the press was rhapsodic about the Pride Parade in New York but could not find anything good to say about a parade celebrating our nation’s military.

Here’s the bitter truth for Democrats: the unending slamming of the president is not working. It was announced last week that President Trump and the Republican National Committee have raised $105 million for his reelection bid, far surpassing the amounts raised by any predecessor or by any Democrat hoping to unseat him.

Democrats and their media pals were also churlish about the president’s Fourth of July celebration in Washington. It says something that the press was rhapsodic about the Pride Parade in New York but could not find anything good to say about a parade celebrating our nation’s military.

Not only was Trump’s overall fundraising impressive, he received 725,000 individual contributions which averaged $48. That kind of online small-donor haul is unprecedented for a Republican politician. The RNC attracted “a larger share of donations under $200 than the Democratic National Committee,” reported the New York Times. As the Times noted, Trump will have far more money to boost his run than he did in 2016.

Gallup tells us that only 32 percent of the country is satisfied with “the way things are going in the United States at this time.” That is hardly cause for celebration, but at the same point during President Obama’s tenure, only 16 percent of the nation thought we were on the right track.

Meanwhile, President Trump’s personal polling has gradually improved. A recent Washington Post-ABC poll put the president’s approval rating at 47 percent, with 50 percent disapproving. Among registered voters that survey showed the president beating a Democrat candidate identified as a socialist 49 percent to 43 percent. Notably, 66 percent of respondents in that poll self-identified as Democrats or Independents. Trust me, any Democrat now running will be branded a socialist by Mr. Trump.

And why not? The Democrat candidates showed their “free-for-all” stripes during the first round of debates. Every single candidate on the stage for the second night’s forum raised their hand in support of giving free health care to people in the country illegally, a slap in the face to millions of Americans struggling to pay for their own health care.

That show of hands should not have surprised anyone. Democrats eager to bludgeon the Trump White House over its treatment of people detained at the border (and hopeful of winning Hispanic voters) have adopted ever more idiotic positions on immigration. Though only a few years ago Democrats favored controlled borders but lenient immigration guidelines, now Julian Castro, Elizabeth Warren and others want to repeal Section 1325 of Title 8 of the U.S. Code, the law that outlaws entering the country illegally. They want that action to no longer be a federal crime, but rather a civil offense, like parking in front of a fire hydrant. That is not where American voters are.

Several candidates said in the debates they wanted to abolish private health insurance, a shocker to those 140 million people who have such insurance. The private health insurance industry earns revenues of hundreds of billions of dollars and employs 600,000 Americans; Medicare-for-all amounts to a federal takeover of the means of production, which meets the definition of socialism.

Meanwhile, Democrats in Congress will soon continue their investigations into every aspect of President Trump’s finances, pushing to get hold of his tax returns in order to find…what exactly? That he has done something wrong that the IRS has failed to uncover? No, simply to embarrass him. The hints of impeachment and theatrical do-over of the Mueller probe will continue.

Maybe it’s the perspective gained from taking a much-needed week away from the political scrum, but to this observer the Democrats look increasingly small, while President Trump looks big. While the president is attempting to reset our trade relations with China, trying to reach some understanding with nuclear-armed North Korea, searching for a means to rein in Iran and to solve our dysfunctional immigration policies, Democrats needle and prod and pick, carping at the White House and at each other.

If Trump is reelected, Democrats will have only themselves to blame.

Mike Pompeo unveils panel to examine 'unalienable rights',https://www.politico.com,['Caitlin Oprysko'],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/08/pompeo-panel-unalienable-rights-1400023,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announces the formation of the Commission on Unalienable Rights during a news conference at the Department of State on Monday. | Mark Wilson/Getty Images Foreign Policy Mike Pompeo unveils panel to examine 'unalienable rights'

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday unveiled a new Commission on Unalienable Rights, a panel he said is aimed at providing him with “an informed review of the role of human rights in American foreign policy.”

The panel will be headed up by Mary Ann Glendon, a Harvard law professor and former ambassador to the Vatican under George W. Bush. Glendon is also a social conservative who has been a prominent anti-abortion voice, which could lend credence to the concerns among human rights activists that the commission is a ploy to undercut LGBTQ and women’s rights under the guise of religious liberty.

Story Continued Below

In remarks at the State Department on Monday, Pompeo noted that “words like ‘rights’ can be used by good or evil,” decrying how some have “hijacked” human rights rhetoric to be used for “dubious or malignant purposes.”

Glendon, in brief comments, echoed that, telling reporters that ""basic human rights are misunderstood by many, manipulated by many, and ignored by the world’s worst human rights violators.""

“Every once in a while we need to step back, and reflect seriously on where we are, where we’ve been and whether we’re headed in the right direction,” Pompeo said. He hailed former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt’s 1948 Declaration on Universal Human Rights as one of the foundational documents for the commission’s work, but noted that the panel would serve as advisers as opposed to policymakers.

While Pompeo was vague in laying out what exactly the panel will do, emphasizing its focus on “principles” over “policy,” he praised its members as those he hoped would facilitate ""one of the most profound reexaminations of the unalienable rights in the world since the 1948 universal declaration.""

The commission will be made up of 10 members who represent a range of religious backgrounds. Many are religious scholars, with at least one other joining Glendon in having been appointed to represent the Vatican on social issues in the past. One, Hamza Yusuf, is one of the founders of the first Muslim liberal arts college in America. Another, Christopher Tollefsen, specializes in moral philosophy, natural law ethics, practical ethics and bioethics.

Pompeo indicated that the panel could also be used in part to rein in overzealous invocations of human rights, suggesting the group “revisit the most basic of questions: What does it mean to say or claim that something is in fact a human right?”

“How do we know — or how do we determine — whether that claim ... is it true and therefore ought it to be honored? How can there be human rights rights we possess, not as privileges we are granted or even earn, but simply by virtue of our humanity belong to us?” he asked. “Is it in fact true, as our Declaration of Independence asserts, that as human beings we — all of us, every member of our human family — are endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights?”

In an op-ed published Monday morning in the Wall Street Journal, the secretary expressed hope that the group would “reorient” institutions like the UN “back to their original missions.”

“Many have embraced and even accelerated the proliferation of rights claims—and all but abandoned serious efforts to protect fundamental freedoms,” he wrote, complaining that “human-rights advocacy has lost its bearings and become more of an industry than a moral compass.”

International groups were split over the group Monday. In a statement cheering Pompeo's formation of the commission, Family Research Council President Tony Perkins said that the panel would be useful in light of governments like Cuba, China and Iran who the group said ""have wormed their way onto 'human rights commissions' in their search for international legitimacy.""

""Other special interest groups have sought to expand the definition of a 'human right' to include virtually anything. If everything is a human right then the term begins to have little meaning,"" he said.

In addition, Perkins added, the commission would further promote religious liberty abroad, which he hailed as the ""foundation for all other human rights.""

Amnesty International, meanwhile, accused Pompeo of using the panel to politicize human rights and pointed to the Trump administration’s rollback of rights for LGBTQ citizens.

""If this administration truly wanted to support people's rights, it would use the global framework that's already in place. Instead, it wants to undermine rights for individuals, as well as the responsibilities of governments,"" said Joanne Lin, the group’s national director of advocacy and government affairs. ""This approach only encourages other countries to adopt a disregard for basic human rights standards and risks weakening international, as well as regional frameworks, placing the rights of millions of people around the world in jeopardy.""

And at least one religious group said it was viewing the commission’s formations with skepticism. Rori Kramer, director of government affairs for the American Jewish World Service, criticized Pompeo for employing what she called a “narrow view of religion as a means to undermine the ecumenical belief of respecting the dignity of every person.”

Kramer argued that Pompeo “clearly illustrated” the panel “will be used to question the very notion that basic human rights are inherent in all individuals.”

A pair of congressional Democrats also ripped the commission.

House Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel said in a statement Monday that the new panel amounted to an end-run around established structures within the department, and touted an amendment in a House spending bill passed last month that would block funding for ""this bizarre effort.""

He claimed that the group Pompeo had selected would ""give preference to discriminatory ideologies that would narrow protections for women, including on reproductive rights; for members of the LGBTQI community; and for other minority groups,"" and he hit the secretary for providing little information regarding plans for the commission.

And Sen. Bob Menendez, the top ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, called Pompeo's claims that human rights had been manipulated ""absurd"" and asserted the new commission would only weaken human rights.

""President Trump’s personal affection for gross human rights violators has stained America’s moral fabric,"" he said, pointing to the president's praise for leaders such as North Korea's Kim Jong Un and the Philippines' Rodrigo Duterte. ""No Trump Administration commission can erase that.""

Obama-era DHS secretary hits 2020 Dem candidates for 'extreme' and 'unworkable' immigration ideas,https://www.foxnews.com,"['David Montanaro', 'David Montanaro Is An Editor With Fox News.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/obama-era-dhs-secretary-hits-2020-dem-candidates-for-extreme-and-unworkable-immigration-ideas,"Jeh Johnson, who served as former President Barack Obama's Homeland Security secretary, called out Democratic presidential candidates for embracing ""extreme"" policies on immigration, like rejecting the deportation of those here illegally and decriminalizing illegal border crossings.

""We cannot, as some Democratic candidates for president now propose, publicly embrace a policy not to deport those who enter or remain in this country illegally unless they commit a crime. This is tantamount to a public declaration (repeated and amplified by smugglers in Central America) that our borders are effectively open to all; this will increase the recent levels of monthly apprehensions at our southern border -- about or more than 100,000 -- by multiples,"" Johnson wrote in a Washington Post column.

""For the same reason, we cannot formally decriminalize unauthorized entry into this country, though first-time illegal border crossers are, in fact, rarely prosecuted for that misdemeanor (except for last year's disastrous ""zero-tolerance"" policy).""

TLAIB TO PELOSI: 'FOCUS' ON MCCONNELL INSTEAD OF BASHING PROGRESSIVES

Johnson, who served under Obama from 2013 to 2017, wrote that Americans deserve ""straight talk"" on the issue of illegal immigration, touting the previous administration's handling of the problem. He said the Obama administration ramped up assistance to Central American countries and prioritized the deportation of felons.

Johnson defended House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., against far-left critics who claimed she was defeated by Republicans after the House passed a more moderate bill to deal with the influx of migrants at the southern border.

""Give her a break. Those who govern in a democracy know that progress requires compromise, and the speaker made the obvious calculation that it was more important to deliver prompt help to those facing inhumane conditions on the border than it was to delay and hold out for everything House Democrats wanted,"" he wrote, pointing to an overall ""alarming trend"" on both sides of the aisle.

CONGRESSIONAL HISPANIC CAUCUS BLASTS BORDER FUNDING BILL AS 'BETRAYAL' OF AMERICAN VALUES

""To win support from a vocal and committed segment of a major party's base -- and simply for the sake of a good applause line -- candidates for office now espouse extreme policy proposals that are unworkable and have no hope of winning the broad support of Congress and the people they represent,"" he argued, adding those who put forth policies that have no chance of becoming law are ""doing a disservice to our democracy.""

""Here is a radical proposal: a presidential candidate who is willing to educate, enlighten and tell voters the hard truths. This trait has all but evaporated in U.S. politics, but it is the single best job qualification for those who aspire to lead. I'm a Democrat, and whoever among the current Democratic field of candidates demonstrates this profile in courage will earn my vote,"" he concluded.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez fired back Saturday night after Pelosi criticized her and other far-left freshmen congresswomen for voting against a $4.6 billion border bill that President Trump signed into law on Monday.

“All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world,” Pelosi said. “But they didn’t have any following. They’re four people and that’s how many votes they got.”

Ocasio-Cortez criticized the Democrats who decided to vote along with Republicans on the spending plan to address issues at the U.S.-Mexico border.

“I don’t believe it was a good idea for Dems to blindly trust the Trump admin when so many kids have died in their custody. It’s a huge mistake,” she wrote. “This admin also refuses to hand over docs to Congress on the whereabouts of families. People’s lives are getting bargained & for what?”"
DOJ abruptly replaces lawyers defending Trump census citizenship question,https://www.aol.com,"['Aol Staff', 'Nick Visser']",07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.aol.com/article/news/2019/07/08/doj-abruptly-replaces-lawyers-defending-trump-census-citizenship-question/23765795/,"The Justice Department abruptly announced Sunday it will replace the legal team that has represented the Trump administration in its efforts to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census.

“As will be reflected in filings tomorrow in the census-related cases, the Department of Justice is shifting these matters to a new team of Civil Division lawyers going forward,” DOJ spokesperson Kerri Kupec said in a statement. “Since these cases began, the lawyers representing the United States in these cases have given countless hours to defending the Commerce Department and have consistently demonstrated the highest professionalism, integrity, and skill inside and outside the courtroom.”

The department gave no reason for the switch, but the move is another dramatic shift in President Donald Trump’s effort to add the question to the census. The Washington Post on Sunday noted that a person familiar with the case said some of the department’s career attorneys were uncomfortable with the president’s insistence on the issue. The New York Times reported that no DOJ attorneys in the federal programs branch, which traditionally represents the government in court, will be on the census case as it advances in the courts.

“The Attorney General appreciates that service, thanks them for their work on these important matters, and is confident that the new team will carry on in the same exemplary fashion as the cases progress,” Kupec said.

Last week, government lawyers told a federal judge the White House would continue to move forward with its efforts to add the fraught citizenship question to the census, despite legal obstacles. Days earlier the Trump administration said it would drop the question after a Supreme Court decision temporarily barred the government from adding it.

The Census Bureau began printing forms for the tally after the decision, and had long noted that it needed a decision by June 30, the agency’s printing deadline.

But the administration reversed course a day later. Trump called reports he was abandoning the question “FAKE!” and said he was pressing ahead. Justice Department lawyers told a federal judge on Friday that they would continue argue the case, and Trump said he was mulling various strategies to get the question approved, including an executive order.

So important for our Country that the very simple and basic “Are you a Citizen of the United States?” question be allowed to be asked in the 2020 Census. Department of Commerce and the Department of Justice are working very hard on this, even on the 4th of July! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 4, 2019

“We’ll see what happens,” Trump told reporters on Friday. “We could also add an addition on. So we could start the printing now and maybe do an addendum after we get a positive decision. So we’re working on a lot of things including an executive order.”

Civil rights groups have vowed to fight the White House once again should it attempt to add the question. The ACLU has argued it is meant to intimidate people of color and immigrant communities and would result in a massive undercount of up to 6.5 million people.

The census, mandated by the Constitution to count everyone living in the U.S., is used to allocate federal resources and also to allot seats in the House of Representatives.

An Executive Order Can’t Fix Trump’s Census Problem,https://www.theatlantic.com,['Peter M. Shane'],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/executive-order-cant-fix-trumps-census-problem/593449/,"The third is that every statute that authorizes the executive branch to do something also puts limits on that power. Lawful executive action must respect those limits, what I call in my administrative-law classes an administrator’s “zone of discretion.” For example, the Census Act requires the secretary of commerce to submit, at least three years before the census date, a report containing the secretary’s “determination of the subjects proposed to be included in the census, and the types of information to be compiled.” The secretary must then submit, at least two years before the census date, a report containing the secretary’s “determination of the questions proposed to be included” in the census. Should the secretary of commerce decide just a year before the census date to ask each person his or her favorite Beatles song, the question would be impermissible because it was not reported to Congress in time.

Finally—and this is the speed bump over which the Commerce Department stumbled—under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, responsible officials must also, at the time a decision is made, offer a nonarbitrary, non-capricious explanation for choosing their strategy for carrying out their statutory authority. This requires at least that the proposed administrative action be a rational way of carrying out the mission Congress has assigned the executive, and that the rationale be clearly explained at the time of an agency decision. In the case of the citizenship question, the Department of Commerce failed to take this step, which is why a 2020 citizenship question is now on hold. Even if such a question could have been asked, in principle, consistent with the secretary’s zone of discretion, the failure of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to offer a non-pretextual rationale for the citizenship question tripped him up in the courts. As euphemistically summarized by Chief Justice John Roberts for a Supreme Court majority, the secretary offered a “contrived … explanation for agency action that is incongruent with what the record reveals about the agency’s priorities and decision making process.”

The executive branch now has an obvious logic problem: It must generate a non-pretextual agency explanation to justify an action to which it already committed itself without any such explanation. The Justice Department’s public flailing-about for a new rationale looks like the very definition of “arbitrary and capricious.” But whether or not such a rationale can now be found and belatedly attached to the census question, a presidential order cannot make the job easier.

For one thing, a presidential order cannot expand the secretary’s zone of legal discretion to determine the contents of the census. Just as important, an executive order cannot relieve the commerce secretary of his obligation to proceed based on a nonarbitrary rationale rooted in his statutory mission. “The president wants me to ask this question” would not be an adequate reason. Nothing in the statute empowers presidential whim."

Department of Education not National School Board,https://www.nationalreview.com,"['Yuval Levin', 'Madeleine Kearns', 'Brian T. Allen', 'Jonah Goldberg', 'Nate Hochman', 'Jack Fowler', 'Kyle Smith', 'Armond White', 'Alec Dent', 'Ramesh Ponnuru']",07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/the-department-of-education-is-not-a-national-school-board/,"(Jonathan Alcorn/Reuters)

Last week, Joe Biden joined the bandwagon of Democrats (started by Elizabeth Warren this year) promising to name a public-school teacher to be Secretary of Education if he wins the presidency. It’s an easy commitment to make in front of a teachers’ union audience, and it wouldn’t be all that odd to do it—several past presidents of both parties have named former public-school teachers to the job.

Advertisement

But the promise is another example of a thoroughly bipartisan misconception about the work of the federal education department. Even if they haven’t been former teachers, nearly every education secretary since the Department of Education was created in the Carter years has been someone with expertise or experience in K-12 education—whether as an educator, administrator, reformer, or policymaker. But the Department of Education actually has a lot more say over higher education than primary or secondary schooling, and its work has suffered from the lack of focus on higher ed over the years. If we must have a Department of Education, it could at least be run by someone who knows something about higher education.

The American system of primary and secondary schools is gloriously decentralized. There are about 130,000 K-12 schools in America, about three-quarters of which are public schools. The latter are governed by about 13,000 different school districts across the 50 states. These districts have enormous power over curriculum and staffing decisions, and the states have most of the remaining power over education policy.

The federal role in K-12 education is strongest in circumstances where racial or other discrimination triggers legally-mandated responses. Otherwise, the federal government uses some levers of conditional funding under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act—a Great Society law that has been updated every few years since. Recent updates include the No Child Left Behind Act and the Every Student Succeeds Act. These have given the federal government more leverage over time, but its power is still greatest at the margins. Federal dollars are about 8 percent of K-12 education funding, and the Department of Education doesn’t really shape primary and secondary education policy.

We should all be glad about that. And a teacher who wants to influence education policy would be better advised to run for school board or for the state legislature than to go to Washington.

But unfortunately, the federal Department of Education does play a critical role in setting the direction of American higher education. Here too, its power comes mostly from the leverage created by federal dollars, but that leverage is immense, especially because of the student-loan system. And it has meant that the federal government has played a central role in driving the tuition inflation that plagues higher ed and in creating all manner of policy trouble besides.

Price inflation in higher education has been massively exacerbated by the basic structure of federal policy in this area, which might be best described as simultaneously subsidizing demand and restricting supply.

The subsidization of demand is done through student aid, which has been too open-ended and has risen with tuition, thereby creating upward pressure on costs. This leverage over funds has also given the Department of Education lots of informal power to drive policy through nudges and “suggestions” in a variety of areas. The Obama administration’s notorious “Dear Colleague” letters are a prominent example.

The restriction of supply, meanwhile, has been a function of accreditation, which the incumbent players in American higher education have used to restrict new entrants and new uses of technology. Accreditation is technically a private process, run by a group of NGOs, but because it is the means by which schools become eligible for students with federal loans and grants, the Department of Education has enormous power over it, essentially accrediting the accreditors.

All of this gives the Secretary of Education a lot of opportunities to improve (or to worsen) higher-ed policy—both by working with Congress to change the law and by working directly to change the department’s policies. Higher-ed policy is badly in need of reforms, getting those right could make a huge difference, and the Secretary of Education would be a key figure in making that happen. The Trump administration has taken some useful steps in this direction, but there is lots more to be done.

So a president who wanted to do something useful in education policy would be wise to appoint an education secretary who knows something about higher education, rather than just one who will say nice things about primary and secondary schools."
'Extraordinarily challenging situation' in CBP stations: Acting DHS secretary,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/extraordinary-situation-cbp-stations-acting-dhs-secretary-kevin/story?id=64168359,"Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said he did not accept reports of unsanitary conditions and limited food and water at U.S. Border Patrol stations, calling the situation at the border ""extraordinarily challenging"" for the department, in an interview on ABC's ""This Week"" Sunday.

""We have no evidence that children went hungry,"" McAleenan told ""This Week"" Co-Anchor Martha Raddatz. ""Police station cells are not a good place for children, as I've said dozens of times.""

""We had an overflow situation with hundreds of children crossing every single day,"" he added.

McAleenan, who previously served as the head of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said the agency has taken protective measures including building temporary processing facilities and ramping up medical staff. He also said the agency even overspent on such measures, hoping Congress would later provide the supplemental funds.

President Donald Trump recently signed off on a new funding measure, primarily for migrant detention and child care. Trump has praised Border Patrol agents and said the poor conditions in facilities should deter people from trying to enter the U.S.

""If Illegal Immigrants are unhappy with the conditions in the quickly built or refitted detentions centers, just tell them not to come. All problems solved!"" Trump wrote on Twitter this week.

For months, McAleenan has raised alarms about the potential for disastrous conditions on the southern border while maintaining his agency has upheld government standards for housing detainees, despite evidence to the contrary. He said on Sunday that the food and water at one facility in Clint, Texas, that has faced scrutiny were ""adequate"" and that migrants in holding centers had access to showers and clean living quarters.

""I'm not denying that there are challenging situations at the border, I've been the one talking about it the most,"" McAleenan said.

He said Homeland Security has reduced the number of children in their custody from 2,500 at the beginning of June to 350 children as of Saturday. McAleenan said the new funding to shelters run by Health and Human Services allowed them to move minors through the system more quickly, connecting them with case workers who will find approved sponsors to care for them upon release.

His remarks on Sunday cap another tumultuous week for Homeland Security as the agency has grappled with government watchdog reports of overcrowded and dangerous conditions at Border Patrol stations in the southwest.

Acting DHS Sec. Kevin McAleenan responds to reports of unsanitary and overcrowded conditions at CBP holding facilities: ""It's an extraordinarily challenging situation... we've been talking about this, we've been asking for help."" https://t.co/v1IBAtvDAr pic.twitter.com/JnruuhIUbG — This Week (@ThisWeekABC) July 7, 2019

Conditions were so severe at facilities in the Rio Grande Valley that one CBP manager described it to federal investigators as a ""ticking time bomb"" in the report made public this past week.

Government oversight authorities found that hundreds of children had been held in CBP custody well beyond the legal limit of 72 hours and most of them did not have access to showers or a change of clothes."
Trump to give speech on 'America's environmental leadership',https://thehill.com,[],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/451968-trump-to-give-speech-on-americas-environmental-leadership,"President Trump Donald John TrumpThe ambassador's cables and the Tory election Trump to give speech on 'America's environmental leadership' NY governor signs bill allowing Congress to obtain Trump's state tax returns MORE is slated to give a speech Monday at the White House focusing on his administration's environmental achievements, an event that has drawn criticism from environmentalists who say the president has done more harm than good since taking office.

The White House said Trump is set to deliver remarks on ""America's environmental leadership” on Monday afternoon, surrounded by various administration officials, including Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Interior Department chiefs Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerTrump to give speech on 'America's environmental leadership' 2020 Democrats vow to get tough on lobbyists EPA plan to limit animal testing raises toxic chemical regulation concerns: report MORE and David Bernhardt, respectively.

Trump has long promoted his administration’s energy achievements, praising the comeback of “beautiful, clean coal” in his first State of the Union address and the advancement of the U.S. as the top natural gas producer in his second. But this will be his first speech devoted entirely to the environment.

The timing of the event comes as environmental issues, and climate change in particular, are rising in importance among Democratic voters heading into 2020. Polls have shown global warming is now a top voting issue, ranking alongside with health care and the economy.

A new Washington Post-ABC News poll found that Americans disapprove of Trump’s position on many major issues. The lowest-ranking issue in the poll was climate change, with just 29 percent of respondents saying they approved of Trump's position.

During his presidency, Trump has rolled back EPA regulations on methane, pollution from power plants and vehicle fuel standards. He has also proposed lifting a major Obama-era rule protecting water.

Trump has noted that greenhouse gas emissions dropped during his first year in office, according to a 2018 report from the EPA. Some experts have argued that the decrease is largely attributable to the market’s switch to natural gas and away from coal — a major source of greenhouse gas emissions.

A new environmental initiative from the Trump administration involves tackling ocean debris. Wheeler laid out the effort at a June meeting of environment ministers from the world’s 20 largest economies.

Critics have already cast doubt on any message Monday from the president, who has said he intends to pull the U.S. out of the landmark Paris climate accords from 2015.

“There was a time not long ago that we were continuing to make progress toward having the cleanest air and water on the planet but we have been slipping backwards since the Trump administration decided to place profits over people through their policy actions,” Mustafa Santiago Ali, a former top environmental justice official at EPA who resigned in 2017, said in a statement Monday."

"Mark Esper begins third week on the job, with time running out on his tenure as acting defense secretary",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/mark-esper-begins-third-week-on-the-job-with-time-running-out-on-his-tenure-as-acting-defense-secretary,"ESPER’S UNCERTAIN JULY: Acting Defense Secretary Mark Esper begins his third week on the job with a giant question mark hanging over his head. The Pentagon has not said how it plans to handle the conditions of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 , which requires that once nominated, Esper must step aside until confirmed and also that the position cannot be filled by an acting secretary past the end of the month.

While President Trump has announced his intent to nominate Esper as his replacement for Jim Mattis, who resigned in December, the Senate Armed Services Committee has not yet received his nomination paperwork. Once that happens, the provisions of the vacancies law kick in, along with the rules of the Senate, which require a seven-day wait once the nomination is submitted.

THE PROBLEM: Under the 1998 law, a person working as “an acting officer” may serve in the office “no longer than 210 days beginning on the date the vacancy occurs” or from the date that the person’s “nomination is pending in the Senate.” The clock began running on January 1, the date Mattis left office. Once Esper’s nomination is submitted, he must step aside and perform no duties that would presume his confirmation to the post. Patrick Shanahan did not have to do this for two reasons: He was never formally nominated, and under the law he could serve as acting because as deputy defense secretary he served in a “position of first assistant“ to the secretary.

THE FINESSE: Here’s how things could play out this month to get Esper in place while staying within the law: Esper’s nomination is submitted before the end of the month. He steps aside and the Navy secretary, who is next in line, fills in while the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman, Oklahoma Republican Jim Inhofe, engineers a quick hearing and vote. And by next month, the Pentagon has a confirmed leader for the first time this year. But that’s going to require some legislative gymnastics.

INHOFE’S OTHER BIG WORRY: There are only 20 legislative days left before the Senate is scheduled to take its August recess. And not only does Inhofe have to get the Esper nomination through, he’s among a group of lawmakers increasingly worried about the lack of progress reaching agreement on a bipartisan deal to raise the budget caps.

Inhofe is one of 15 signatories to a letter sent last week to acting Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, urging them to reach a deal that would avoid a stop-gap continuing resolution that would once again hamstring the Pentagon, just as it is recovering from years of spending limits.

“As the world continues to become more dangerous, the American people rightfully expect their representatives in Washington to put aside political differences and do their jobs. Simply put, our adversaries do not handcuff their militaries with funding gimmicks like continuing resolutions — nor should we,” the letter concludes.

FOUR-STAR SHOCKER: Vice Chief of Naval Operations Adm. William Moran will retire instead of taking over as the Navy’s top admiral Navy Secretary Richard Spencer announced last night, citing poor judgment regarding a professional relationship.

“Adm. Bill Moran recently brought to my attention that over the past two years he maintained a professional relationship with an individual who was held accountable and counseled for failing to meet the values and standards of the Naval profession,” Spencer said in a written statement reported by the Associated Press. “While I admire his faithful service and commitment to the Navy, this decision on his part to maintain that relationship has caused me to call his judgment into question. Therefore, today I accepted Adm. Moran’s request to retire.”

HAPPENING TODAY: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will deliver remarks to the media at 9:15 a.m. in the State Department briefing room. Streamed live at www.state.gov .

ALSO TODAY: The Pentagon will make full use of its River Entrance parade field today as it stages a full armed forces salute to honor the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani this afternoon. Acting Defense Secretary Esper will preside.

HAPPENING THIS WEEK: The summer of change that will see the turnover of five of the seven members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff begins this week when retiring Gen. Robert Neller steps down and hands over the reins to Gen. David Berger, who was just confirmed by the Senate Friday as 38th commandant of the Marine Corps. With the sudden resignation of Adm. William Moran, the current chief of naval operations, Adm. John Richardson is expected to remain in the top job past his planned September retirement.

Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein and National Guard Bureau Chief Gen. Joseph Lengyel both began their terms in 2016 and would normally serve until 2020.

ALSO THIS WEEK: Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley, President Trump’s choice to be his new chairman of the joint chiefs, gets his Senate confirmation hearing Thursday, and the House is set to consider the fiscal year 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, taking the week to work through more than 300 amendments as Republicans seek to restore $17 billion Democrats cut from the $750 billion topline, including funding for low-yield nukes and money for border barrier construction.

WHERE THINGS STAND: Daily on Defense was on vacation last week and will take another summer break the first week of August. So as we return from a long Fourth of July weekend, here’s a quick recap of where we stand in the world’s top hot spots.

KOREA: After President Trump’s historic impromptu third summit at the end of June with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un — where Trump became the first U.S. president to step foot on the north side of the DMZ — the work begins to show some tangible progress toward denuclearization.

Secretary of State Pompeo said after the meeting between Trump and Kim that teams from both countries would gather in another week or two in a place to be determined to “start exchanging ideas.”

“The president, by getting together with Chairman Kim,” Pompeo said, “broke through and was able to get us the opportunity to get back to the negotiating table, which I'm excited about.”

IRAN: While the potential for war with Iran was averted when Trump called off a strike on the country in the eleventh hour, tensions continue to simmer, with Iran declaring it will begin enriching uranium above the 3.67% limit agreed to in the 2015 nuclear deal. That level of enrichment is still below bomb grade.

In making the announcement, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said Iran was invoking a provision of the agreement that allows it to take “remedial steps” if any or all of the parties to the deal are not living up to the terms. Trump withdrew from the agreement last year.

“Today, Iran is taking its second round of remedial steps under Para 36 of the JCPOA. We reserve the right to continue to exercise legal remedies within JCPOA to protect our interests in the face of US #EconomicTerrorism,” Zarif said on Twitter . “All such steps are reversible only through E3 compliance.”

Speaking to reporters late yesterday in New Jersey, Trump issued a cryptic warning. “Iran better be careful because you enrich for one reason — and I won't tell you what the reason is, but it's no good. They better be careful,"" he said before boarding Air Force One.

“Iran’s latest expansion of its nuclear program will lead to further isolation and sanctions,” tweeted Pompeo yesterday. “Nations should restore the longstanding standard of no enrichment for Iran’s nuclear program.”

Britain, one of the countries still in the agreement, issued a statement through its foreign office saying that while Iran has broken the terms of the agreement, “the UK remains fully committed to the deal.” It called on Iran to “immediately stop and reverse all activities inconsistent with its obligations.”

AFGHANISTAN: While U.S. diplomats are touting “substantive progress” in peace talks with the Taliban, the group continues to carry out deadly attacks in Afghanistan targeting civilians, including children. For the second time in a week, a suicide bomber inflcited heavy casualties, this time on Ghazni province, where 12 people were killed and more than 170 wounded. Last week, an attack in Kabul killed 6 and wounded more than 100 others, including as many as 50 children.

While condemning both strikes, U.S. special representative Zalmay Khalilzad tweeted the horrific attacks show that “Peace has never been more urgent and is the only path to ending terror and violence.”

On Saturday he had tweeted , “The last 6 days of talks have been the most productive session to date. We made substantive progress on ALL 4 parts of a peace agreement: counter-terrorism assurances, troop withdrawal, participation in intra-Afghan dialogue & negotiations, and permanent & comprehensive ceasefire.”

The Taliban met yesterday for the first time with Afghan officials. The talks are set to resume today in Qatar.

TURKEY: President Trump continues to send mixed messages about Turkey’s refusal to give up its purchase of Russian S-400 air defense missiles, which the Pentagon insists is incompatible with operating and helping to build the U.S. F-35 and could compromise the Joint Strike Figher’s classified stealth technology.

“If Turkey procures the S-400, it will mean they will not receive the F-35. It's that simple,” said acting Defense Secretary Esper at NATO last month.

But at the G20 summit, President Trump lavished praise on Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and blamed President Obama for the problem. “The president was not allowed to buy the Patriot missiles,” said Trump at a joint appearance with Erdogan in Osaka, Japan. “So he buys the other missile, and then, all of a sudden, they say, ‘Well, you can now buy our missile.’ You can't do business that way. It's not good. It's not good.”

For the record, both the Obama and Trump administrations tried to sell Patriot missiles to Turkey, but the deals always fell apart over Turkey’s demands for technology transfers.

With Russia set to deliver the S-400 as soon as this week, the United States could impose sanctions against Turkey under a 2017 law that bars cooperation with U.S. adversaries. “We're looking at different solutions. It's a problem, there's no question about it. We're looking at different solutions,” Trump said in Japan.

The Department of Defense needs Mark Esper — and a few policy changes,https://thehill.com,[],07-07-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/451617-the-department-of-defense-needs-mark-esper-and-a-few-policy-changes,"Just over halfway through the Trump administration’s first term, the military is getting its third secretary of Defense in Mark Esper. Although the U.S. military is the finest fighting force in the world, even the best need consistent leadership. Fortunately, the Department of Defense (DOD) is receiving a great leader in Esper. He is superbly qualified, by experience and temperament — a family man, combat veteran infantry officer, West Point graduate, defense industry and policy expert, and an intellectual with high-level Pentagon civilian leadership experience.

Esper understands the importance of civilian leadership and how to bring sustainable change in policy, strategy and modernization for the military. However, he does face significant challenges to defend, deter and defeat, if necessary, enemies of the United States — and some of those challenges are at home.

The U.S. focus on counterterrorism not only shifted resources away from modernization of military force planning, structure and technology, it enabled other nation states to challenge, if not close, the competitive edge of the U.S. military. The overemphasis of strategy and resources on Afghanistan and Iraq, President Obama’s withdrawal from Iraq (precipitated by an unnecessary invasion of Iraq), and a botched Libya plan enabled America’s adversaries to recognize the changes in the world order. In addition, America’s adversaries took advantage of the divisive state of U.S. politics. Bottom line, America was being outflanked by its competitors.

Chinese alternatives to American values of democracy, rule of law, human rights and a free-market economy are creating a new economic cold war that will face off the United States and its partners and allies against those of China. Through strategic diplomacy, China has extended its influence into Africa and Latin America, while using the People’s Liberation Army as a capitalist tool to strengthen Chinese influence. China’s “One Belt, One Road” initiative presents even deeper regional influence across the Middle East and into Europe.

Vladimir Putin Vladimir Vladimirovich PutinThe Department of Defense needs Mark Esper — and a few policy changes Trump's coarseness, Democrats' shrillness do US foreign policy no favors Biden: There will be 'no NATO' if Trump is reelected MORE, meanwhile, aims to return Russia to its legacy where governments must consider Russian perspectives or actions in any region. Russian influence continues to gain in Eastern Europe, where Putin sees NATO as his biggest threat to regional influence. Putin has inserted Russian diplomacy and military power in the Middle East, through Syria and Iran, in order to have a seat at the table. And, surprisingly, Russia returned to the table with the Taliban to counter U.S. influence in this region as well. Most concerning is that Russia and China increasingly are allying themselves diplomatically.

The Middle East could be spiraling toward regional war. Iran, with Russian support, presents the single greatest threat to any region’s stability because of its revolutionary rhetoric, desire for nuclear weapons, hatred of Israel and the historic Shia-Sunni divide. The violence and destruction caused by ISIS, the United States’s haphazard withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement, an unprecedented number of refugees, and belligerent rhetoric and actions, particularly involving the Strait of Hormuz, have created a powder keg.

So, what should the new secretary of Defense do?

First, American society needs robust dialogue on what it expects its all-volunteer force (AVF) to do and how big the military should be to protect the United States. The AVF is more professional and experienced in its purpose, but it is not completely positive. A large AVF is costly to taxpayers. Its personnel costs possibly crowded out necessary long-term defense spending on weapons, infrastructure and technology advances. It struggles to compete in a highly competitive labor market, and has created a warrior caste among Americans.

The United States should not take the position that it’s in a state of perpetual conflict, which has been expressed by military and political leaders. This perspective results in overuse of the military as an instrument of government power and stresses the AVF to points of concern for American society.

Second, the U.S. must get out of Afghanistan now. We should have left after destroying most of al Qaeda following 9/11. No one can predict with any certainty of intelligence that another terrorist attack will emanate from Afghanistan; there are plenty of ungoverned spaces and financiers in the world that can make that happen. We should instead put more resources and effort into developing an alliance with India and reinforcing the Indo-Pacific strategy.

Third, modernization and acquisition changes to policy and process must occur faster, while taking acceptable risk in current readiness. DOD must hedge its bets and focus on threats to the survival of the U.S. Constitution and its values, and not every emerging character of conflict in the world. Right now, the U.S. military is doing too much at one time. The United States must invest in high-end technological capabilities such as cyber offense and defense, advanced aircraft, hypersonic weapons, directed energy and 5G telephony to counter future threats. DOD must shed its propensity to make incremental changes if it is going to transform for the future.

Fourth, the U.S. must reinforce European states and NATO to confront emerging threats. The biggest threat emanates mainly from Russian aggression, evidenced by its actions in Crimea and Ukraine, disinformation operations through digital media, and its increased foreign military activity in places such as the Black Sea. NATO, however, faces other threats such as uncontrolled migration, cyber threats and attacks, and Chinese strategic competition.

Fifth, the Indo-Pacific region must remain a strategic priority in order to maintain U.S. regional balance of power because of China’s assertive posture and overall global trade. American isolationist policies are hampering the development and maintenance of U.S. alliances and partnerships in response to China’s rise. U.S. presence and interaction with India, Japan, South Korea, Australia and other Southeast Asia countries will hedge against China’s economic and military rise and reconstruct the regional order.

As secretary of Defense, Esper clearly will face a difficult set of circumstances for the next few years. He is a great choice — the right leader for the job. His partnership, however, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Michael (Mike) Richard PompeoKobach to run for Senate in Kansas The Hill's Morning Report - Democrats assail border conditions as Congress returns to work The Department of Defense needs Mark Esper — and a few policy changes MORE, his West Point classmate, must remain a priority. If Pompeo keeps the State Department engaged and in the lead, he will give Esper the best chance to transform and rightsize a more technologically proficient, high-intensity fighting force that is utilized more appropriately in protecting the United States.

The department cannot continue to have temporary leadership when it has the blood and treasure of American fathers and mothers deployed in combat zones. A Senate-confirmed secretary must be present to make the critical decisions presented to our armed forces daily. Congress should step up now and immediately confirm Esper.

"Treasury yields tick lower as traders gear up for inflation data, Powell testimony",https://www.marketwatch.com,['Sunny Oh'],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/treasury-yields-trade-lower-as-stocks-slide-2019-07-08,"Treasury yields fell on Monday as investors searching for clues on the outlook for interest-rate cuts looked ahead to June’s consumer prices data and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s testimony on the economic outlook before lawmakers later this week.

What are Treasurys doing?

The 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.59% fell 1.4 basis points to 2.030%, after staging its biggest daily climb in around seven months, while the 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, -0.26% slipped by 2.9 basis points to 2.520%. The 2-year note rate TMUBMUSD02Y, +1.76% was up 0.5 basis point to 1.875%, its highest level in around a month. Debt prices move in the opposite direction of yields.

What’s driving Treasurys?

Investors will get a handle on key inflation data later on Thursday, with analysts viewing the June consumer price report as one of the last key economic indicators the Fed will monitor before it heads into its meeting on July 31. The U.S. central bank is still expected to carry out a quarter-percentage- point rate cut this month.

Beginning Wednesday, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will also deliver his semiannual monetary policy report to Congress and the Senate. His remarks could offer further guidance on the future course of interest rates.

Global equity markets were on the backfoot in the wake of a stronger-than-expected jobs report, which showed the U.S. economy had created 224,000 new jobs. The surprising show of resilience from the labor market led traders to wind down bets on two quarter-percentage-point rate cuts at July’s Fed meeting.

Asian equity indexes ended sharply lower, stoking demand for haven assets like U.S. government paper. The Shanghai Composite SHCOMP, -2.58% fell 2.6%, while Tokyo’s Nikkei NIK, -0.98% shed 0.9%. The Dow DJIA, -0.43% and the S&P SPX, -0.48% were on track to record losses, but both equity benchmarks still remained within 1% from their all-time closing highs.

What’s driving Treasurys?

“The markets are likely to further walk back rate cut expectations after the upcoming semiannual monetary policy report scheduled to be delivered by Chairman Powell this week. Although the Monetary Policy Report already delivered to Congress clearly states that the Fed will do what is necessary to ensure a sustained expansion, the Chairman can assure Congress that the economy currently looks healthy,” said Steven Ricchiuto, chief U.S. economist for Mizuho.

“A lot of what we expect from CPI is already priced in. The [inflation report] is not going to change the Fed’s decision especially when the market is pricing in low inflation expectations on TIPs break-even rates,” said Leslie Falconio, senior strategist with UBS Global Wealth Management’s Chief Investment Office, referring to inflation expectations as indicated by Treasury inflation-protected securities."
"The Trade Struggles To Move On From June 30 USDA Report, Analyst says",https://www.agriculture.com,[],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.agriculture.com/markets/analysis/the-trade-struggles-to-move-on-from-june-30-usda-report-analyst-saysf,"The Trump administration has coined the terminology fake news when it comes to some reporting of events and articles regarding the administration.

One has to wonder if the Acreage Report issued on June 30 by the National Agricultural Statistics Service was nothing more than fake news as well.

With extraordinary weather circumstances prohibiting planting progress, the expectation for accurate report data was heightened, and yet the USDA knowingly released the June 30 Acreage Report expecting to resurvey producers in July.

It was not until well after the report was released did they indicate that a resurvey, if necessary, would occur in July.



If necessary?

On June 2, 33% of the corn crop had yet to be planted (latest crop planting ever). Heavy rains continued to pound parts of the Midwest. The survey asked farmers if they intend to plant. Having their back up against the wall in early June, they would likely say yes. Prices were rallying, and they would plant if possible. Common sense should have prevailed.

The USDA could have delayed the survey. Or, at a minimum, issued a disclaimer prior to the release of the report, stating a resurvey would occur due to lack of accurate data. This would have been the responsible and correct approach, providing the marketplace with a more intentional plan to provide full transparency.

Instead, they let the market respond to incredibly negative news, which sent prices limit lower. On March 31, farmers said they intended to plant 92.8 million acres of corn. The June 30 report indicated 91.7 million, or a decline of 1.1 million acres.

It is estimated, potentially, that Illinois alone could have close to 1 million acres of prevent plant. Concerns in Indiana, Ohio, the Dakotas, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Missouri suggest a much, much larger number of acres in jeopardy of not being planted, perhaps 5 to 7 million.



The USDA knew they had less than realistic information. They released it, only to then backtrack. The agriculture community deserves a better process of providing timely and accurate information than was exhibited last Friday. What is the point of releasing a “fake” report?



Regardless of their intentions, this is another example of unexpected price moves. Prices move on facts, rumors, and “fake” news. No one knows for sure where prices will go. Prior to any report, we encourage customers to plan for the unexpected. Positioning yourselves for all scenarios is time well spent.

"As Europe orders recall, EPA into Mercedes emissions drags on",https://www.detroitnews.com,"['Anna M. Phillips', 'Los Angeles Times', 'Published P.M. Et July']",07-07-2019,2019,7,https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/foreign/2019/07/07/epa-investigation-mercedes-emissions-drags-on/39657613/,"Three years after the Environmental Protection Agency began investigating alleged diesel emission cheating in Mercedes-Benz cars, vehicle owners and environmentalists say the Trump administration appears to be allowing the inquiry to stall.

Daimler, the German parent company for Mercedes, is among several automakers that have come under scrutiny since 2015 after Volkswagen admitted to equipping some of its diesel-powered cars with illegal software designed to hide excess emissions.

In 2016, federal and state regulators launched an investigation into whether Mercedes had used a similar scheme, enabling cars to pass emissions tests that they would have otherwise failed. German regulators also launched an inquiry.

In the intervening years, German regulators have found evidence of cheating by Daimler and hit the company with fines and forced recalls.

However, in the United States there have been no repercussions as the investigation crosses the three-year mark.

“Three years seems unusual,” said John German, a former official at the EPA and a senior fellow at the International Council on Clean Transportation, the environmental advocacy group that commissioned the study that uncovered Volkswagen’s cheating.

From start to finish, the government’s investigation into VW took about a year and a half, German said.

In April, consumer advocacy and environmental groups sent a letter to Congress asking that the investigation be expedited.

“It is past time for greater urgency and action from regulators and Congress on the allegations against Mercedes,” the advocates wrote. “Owners and lessees of Mercedes diesel vehicles have been left without answers or recourse while the illegally polluting vehicles remain on U.S. roads.”

American regulators’ inquiry into Daimler began in 2016 when the Department of Justice asked the company to conduct an internal investigation into its diesel exhaust emissions. Since then, the automaker has stopped selling diesel-powered passenger cars in the U.S.

“To me, that suggests that they had a problem and they’re trying to limit their exposure to that problem,” German said.

EPA officials declined to comment on the investigation, citing its ongoing investigation.

The Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment.

A spokesman for Daimler said the company continues to cooperate with American regulators but would not discuss the investigation.

Though Daimler has denied wrongdoing, the company has recalled 3 million diesel-fueled vehicles in Europe. In June, German regulators ordered the company to recall 60,000 more and said they were widening their inquiry.

The German luxury brand is currently being sued in the U.S. by people who purchased Mercedes diesel cars. In a class-action lawsuit, lawyers representing Mercedes diesel owners said the cars were marketed as “the world’s cleanest and most advanced diesel.” But engineers hired by the plaintiffs found that they “emit far more pollution on the road than in the emission certification testing environment.”

Trump taxes: Cuomo signs law to allow Congress to get president's New York returns,https://www.democratandchronicle.com,"['Joseph Spector', 'Published A.M. Et July']",07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/politics/albany/2019/07/08/trump-taxes-new-york-law-allows-congress-get-presidents-returns-cuomo/1672212001/,"CLOSE Assemblyman David Buchwald, D-White Plains, sponsored the bill that will allow congressional committees to request the president's state tax returns. He discussed the bill May 21, 2019 in the USA TODAY Network's Albany Bureau Joseph Spector, Albany Bureau Chief

ALBANY – President Donald Trump's New York tax returns will now be available to key congressional committees if they ask for them.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Monday signed a bill into law that lets three congressional committees request copies of Trump’s state tax returns amid an ongoing effort by Democrats to review the president's filings.

New York was in a unique position to pass a state law that would give Congress access to Trump's state returns because he and his businesses have been based in the state.

""Tax secrecy is paramount — the exception being for bona fide investigative and law enforcement purposes,"" Cuomo said in a statement.

""By amending the law enforcement exception in New York State tax code to include Congressional tax-related committees, this bill gives Congress the ability to fulfill its Constitutional responsibilities, strengthen our democratic system and ensure that no one is above the law.""

The bill passed the Democrat-led Legislature in May and amends state tax law so the heads of the House Ways & Means Committee, the Senate Finance Committee or the Joint Committee on Taxation could request the tax returns of any New York elected officials and top-level appointees and their business entities.

That includes Trump, whose administration is likely to sue to block any requests for his state taxes.

What happens now

It is unclear whether Congress will use the state law to get at Trump's taxes, and Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal, D-Massachusetts, suggested in May he was disinclined to turn to New York's law.

There was no immediate comment from Neal's office Monday.

Last week, the House Ways and Means Committee filed a lawsuit to get Trump's federal tax returns in what will be a legal fight between Congress and the executive branch.

The Trump administration has maintained that it is not required to give Congress the tax returns, and the Republican president has said he could not make the taxes public, as had been the practice of presidential candidates and elected officials, because he is under audit.

What New York's law does

CLOSE Assemblyman David Buchwald, D-White Plains, and Sen. Brad Hoylman, D-Manhattan, have legislation in New York that would make the state tax department release President Donald Trump's taxes. They spoke during a news conference on Monday, April 8, 2019, at the state Capitol. Joseph Spector, Albany Bureau Chief

New York's law seeks to limit the ability for Trump to sue, requiring the state Department of Taxation and Finance to redact any information that would violate state or federal law or would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.

Also, a congressional request needs to be accompanied by certification that the tax returns have been requested for a specified and legitimate legislative purpose.

“Our Republic has endured for over 200 years thanks to the system of checks and balances provided in our Constitution,"" said Assemblyman David Buchwald, D-White Plains, who sponsored the bill with Sen. Brad Hoylman, D-Manhattan.

""Consistent with this tradition, New York state now stands ready to assist Congress as it challenges the Trump Administration’s refusal to provide his tax records.""

Trump criticized Cuomo in a series of tweets July 1, accusing him of using Attorney General Letitia James as a ""bludgeoning tool"" by targeting Trump's businesses and foundation with investigations and lawsuits.

Trump knocks New York

It is very hard and expensive to live in New York. Governor Andrew Cuomo uses his Attorney General as a bludgeoning tool for his own purposes. They sue on everything, always in search of a crime. I even got sued on a Foundation which took Zero rent & expenses & gave away... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 1, 2019

Trump has often lashed out at the state's high taxes and Democratic leadership on Twitter, his favored social-media platform.

""Now Cuomo’s A.G. is harassing all of my New York businesses in search of anything at all they can find to make me look as bad as possible,"" Trump tweeted.

""So, on top of ridiculously high taxes, my children and companies are spending a fortune on lawyers. No wonder people and businesses are fleeing New York in record numbers!""

State GOP Chairman Nick Langworthy ripped Cuomo signing the bill Monday, calling the law “nothing more than presidential harassment.”

""Today Andrew Cuomo and Albany Democrats are using it to go after President Trump, but tomorrow it could be any New Yorker,"" Langworthy said in a statement. ""It will never stand up in the courts and they will once again be exposed for wasting precious taxpayer resources on their never-ending partisan witch hunt.”

The state Legislature also passed another bill targeting Trump in May.

It would allow New York to prosecute Trump associates even if they are pardoned by the president, called the “double jeopardy” bill. But Cuomo has yet to sign the measure.

US Treasury yields fall as investors look ahead to Powell testimony,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/08/bond-market-us-treasury-yields-fall-after-strong-jobs-report.html,"U.S. government debt yields fell on Monday as investors looked ahead to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's testimony on Capitol Hill later in the week.

The leader of the U.S. central bank is scheduled to speak before the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday and the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.02%, while the yield on the short-term 2-year Treasury note rate inched higher to 1.868%. Bond yields move inversely to prices.

Wall Street will scrutinize Powell's comments on the state of the American economy as well as those describing the current course of Fed policy. Though the central bank left rates untouched in June, many expect the Fed to cut rates later this month in light of weaker global growth projections.

However, some strong data remains, including last week's jobs report, which showed strong hiring in the month of June. The economy added 224,000 jobs in June. That was way above an expected 165,000 increase.

The solid report tempered expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its next policy meeting later this month. The Fed said at its last meeting that it would ""act as appropriate"" to maintain the current U.S. economic expansion, which is the longest in history.

In terms of data, consumer credit figures are due at 3 p.m. ET."
House panel chair asks watchdog for probe of Homeland Security leaders,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",07-06-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-congress/house-panel-chair-asks-watchdog-for-probe-of-homeland-security-leaders-idUSKCN1U102B,"FILE PHOTO - Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-MS) listens to testimony from Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen during a House Homeland Security Committee hearing on “The Way Forward on Border Security” on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., March 6, 2019.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chairman of a U.S. House panel asked an internal watchdog on Friday to investigate whether top officials at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the U.S. border service knew about a Facebook group where agents posted racist and misogynistic comments.

“Such vile and threatening behavior from agents of the United States government is entirely unacceptable” and “should be grounds for immediate dismissal,” Representative Bennie Thompson, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said in a letter to the DHS’s acting inspector general.

Noting that the issue was already being probed by the office of professional responsibility of the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) service, Thompson asked the inspector general to open a probe into what DHS and CBP leadership knew about the groups and what action they had taken to address it.

Thompson said it had been reported that recently named CBP Commissioner Mark Morgan “knew about the group as early as 2016, when he was chief of the Border Patrol.”

“If accurate, this report calls into question Mr. Morgan’s fitness to hold any office in the United States government,” Thompson said.

He also asked the acting inspector general to investigate whether Acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan knew about the Facebook groups. McAleenan has ordered a probe into the social media posts. He called them “disturbing & inexcusable” in a tweet on Wednesday.

The U.S. border service came under fire over the issue on Monday, when the non-profit news site ProPublica reported that offensive content had been posted on a private Facebook group for current and former CPB officers.

Posts included jokes about the deaths of migrants and sexually explicit comments referring to U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the news outlet said. Reuters did not independently confirm the report.

The report emerged as Ocasio-Cortez and other lawmakers visited a border patrol station in Texas and criticized conditions at the site. Ocasio-Cortez said migrants held at the station had been told to drink water out of toilets and were subjected to psychological abuse."

Small Businesses Win Defense Department Contracts,https://businessjournaldaily.com,[],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://businessjournaldaily.com/small-businesses-win-defense-department-contracts/,"YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio — Jerry Kirila, founder and president of Kirila Fire Training Inc., glances upon a list of 82 destinations printed on the rear panels of one of the company’s red mobile units, about the size of a large charter bus.

Among places listed are Lackland Air Force Base, Texas; March Air Force Base, Calif.; Tyndall Air Force Base, Fla.; McGuire Air Force Base, N.J.; Camp Butler, Japan; Ramstein Air Base, Germany; and the Youngstown Air Reserve Station in Vienna. A host of other locations follow, from Saipan to Turkey.

“There are tons of more places,” Kirila says. “We just ran out of room.”

Most of the business at Kirila Fire Training – about 70% – is done with the U.S. Department of Defense, Kirila says. Indeed, the company was founded 12 years ago based on doing business with the military. The Hartford Township company designs, manufactures, installs and maintains fire-training systems used at defense installations throughout the world as well as civilian sites such as airports.

“We’re now a global operation, and we became that because of the DOD,” Kirila says.

Kirila Fire Training Inc. represents a sector of the regional economy that has developed a distinct relationship with the defense industry, which translates into millions of dollars worth of business every year.

Manufacturers, contractors and distributors across the region are vital links in a supply chain that keeps the armed forces prepared and equipped with the resources necessary to defend the country.

While weapons systems and aircraft command most of the attention, the government must also rely on those contractors that manufacture and supply bolts, hoses, small components, construction services and everyday items that collectively allow the defense industry to operate effectively.

During fiscal 2018, companies in Mahoning, Trumbull and Columbiana counties secured $44.9 million worth of business with the Department of Defense, according to USASpending.gov. Thus far in fiscal 2019, these counties had $10.7 million worth of defense work on their books, according to the site.

In western Pennsylvania, companies in Lawrence County registered $1.6 million in DOD business during fiscal 2018 and stood at $150,580 through fiscal 2019. Meanwhile, companies in Mercer County saw $3.2 million worth of business with the Defense Department and secured $149,157 through fiscal 2019.

A sizeable chunk of defense contracts awarded to Trumbull County companies has gone to Kirila, which specializes in training military personnel on how to respond to fire emergencies on aircraft and vehicles. The company manufactures and fabricates mock aircraft, towers and vehicles and equips them with a patented ignition system that can spark blazes inside and outside the craft.

A mock aircraft made at Kirila’s fab shop awaits completion. The unit is slated to be transported to an air base where ground crew receive firefighting training.

During a morning in late spring at the company complex in Harford Township, workers were putting the final touches on one mock aircraft, while the skeleton of another was under construction in an adjacent building. These structures, along with the company’s ignition systems, are primarily shipped to U.S. Air Force bases all over the country, where flight and ground crews receive training on how to combat fires.

Kirila mobile units serve as a part office, part living quarters for those employees who travel across the country to install these systems, he says.

“We just did a large project at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida for the fire and research lab there,” Kirila says. He estimates there are just three other companies in the country that have the capabilities Kirila commands. “We’re pretty busy,” he says.

Trumbull County companies secured $20.3 million in business from DOD in fiscal 2018 and have posted $481,720 worth of business thus far in 2019.

“We’ve been awarded more than 85 projects from the federal government since 2009, and more than half of those projects were with the Department of Defense,” says Dawn Ochman, president of Dawn Inc., a design, construction and renovation business in Warren.

“These contracts are the lifeblood of our business, even more so when the economy is not doing well and very few dollars were being spent in commercial construction,” she says. “In the past 10 years, about 95% of our sales were with the government.”

More recently, Dawn Inc. was awarded a $3 million contract to perform renovation work at the Pittsburgh Air Reserve Station, according to USASpending.gov.

Ochman says securing work for DOD is challenging at first, especially for a small business. Once a company proves itself and maintains a solid track record with the government, subsequent business comes more easily.

“Customers including the DOD want to see strong past performance not just in construction, but in government contracting,” Ochman says. “Once you have a few successful projects under your belt, you become a much bigger player in this arena.”

Doing business with the Department of Defense is much different than dealing with the private sector, Ochman elaborates.

“We’ve spent as long as two years planning for a proposal submission to the government,” she says. “If awarded, we then have the opportunity to bid on work for the customer for another 60 months. This is not typical in commercial construction.”

Manufacturers and service providers across Mahoning County also have realized a steady business with DOD. In fiscal 2018, companies in Mahoning County did $11.2 million worth of business with the Department of Defense and have secured $4.5 million in contracts through fiscal 2019.

The scope of these companies is diverse.

Corcon Inc., an industrial-painting company based in Coitsville Township, is in the midst of a multi-year contract valued at $6.8 million, while Valley Food Systems Inc., Youngstown, repeatedly wins new business with the DOD through the company’s A-rations program, which supplies packaged meals to the National Guard.

Other companies, such as Salem-Republic Rubber Inc. in Sebring, manufacture items specifically designed for defense applications.

“We’ve been working with the military over the last seven years, and it’s really kicked off over the last three,” says James Dunchuck, vice president of sales and marketing at Salem-Republic. “We positioned ourselves with some of the things we did in 2015 and 2016 to open up some of these opportunities,” he says.

Salem-Republic manufactures industrial hoses and accessories used as support equipment for commercial and military aviation, Dunchuck says. About three years ago, the company refocused its attention on engineering and sales directed toward winning more business with the government.

The company has attracted the attention of the DOD because of a particular hose known as an air start duct, Dunchuck says. These hoses are used by ground crews to supply fixed-wing aircraft with pressurized air that helps kick-start the turbines of the plane.

“We are one of two manufacturers of that product worldwide,” he says. The duct system also comes with hose couplings and scuffers – spiral coverings that slide over the duct hose to prevent abrasive wear since they are repeatedly used on flight decks and tarmacs.

Contracts with the DOD can range between several thousand dollars to longer-term deals of $1 million and $1.5 million that could stretch over three years, Dunchuck says.

Salem-Republic Rubber Inc. employs about 70.

“The future for us is refining our approach in ground-support equipment,” Dunchuck says.

Meanwhile, the company continues to work on improving its internal operations and strives to become more efficient as it increases market share. “We’re a qualified underdog in this arena,” he observes.

Other local companies provide services to the DOD to save that agency money. For example, the government often chooses to contract with companies that are capable of refurbishing heavy-duty equipment instead of buying new vehicles or other machines.

“We’re working on a couple of different projects,” says Ken Timmings, manager at KTSDI in North Lima. The company is most active in the DOD’s service-life extension program, or SLEP. “They have an aging fleet of vehicles and there are two cost scenarios – that is to purchase new or to rebuild under SLEP,” he says.

That’s where KTSDI comes in. The company can take a vehicle the military uses and take it down to the bare bones, rebuild that vehicle and place it into service in like-new condition.

“There are different SLEPs going on all the time,” Timmings says. ”It’s a common method to look at their fleets.”

Recently, the DOD put out a request for proposal to recondition rough-terrain container handlers, Timmings says.

“We’re involved in the powertrain components and electronic steering for that,” he says, noting the company has worked with other contractors on similar programs. “A lot of work is done on-site; but they also send components to us and we send them back refurbished.”

Companies such as KTSDI are able to recondition parts or vehicles for 60 to 90 cents on the dollar when compared to new purchases, he notes. “It’s a fraction of the cost,” he says.

Most of the work KTSDI does with defense involves new-vehicle technology. “We’ve done work with all the branches of the military and traveled to locations from Alaska to Guam,” Timmings says.

Still, even work with the DOD or other government agencies isn’t always a sure thing, Timmings says. “It’s either feast or famine,” he says. “It comes in very little at a time or it comes in a lot.”

"After nearly two years, State Dept. responds to inquiry over alleged alcohol poisonings of US tourists",https://www.cnn.com,"['Michelle Kosinski', 'Zachary Cohen']",07-03-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/03/politics/state-department-tainted-alcohol-mexico/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Nearly two years after receiving an inquiry from Senate Homeland Security Committee chairman Ron Johnson, the State Department is finally revealing details about its investigation into multiple deaths and illnesses that occurred shortly after Americans drank alcohol at Mexican resorts , CNN has learned.

The response, obtained by CNN, said that two bars were ultimately shut down by Mexican authorities after the State Department pressured them to inspect a number of establishments.

It was sent to Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, last month by the State Department's Office of Inspector General. Johnson first wrote to enquire about the cases involving allegations of tainted alcohol in October 2017.

The timing of the OIG's response coincides with a more recent string of mysterious tourist deaths in the Dominican Republic

In several of those cases, families have alleged that the victims became ill just after consuming alcohol, leading the FBI to look into whether tainted alcohol might be a factor there as well.

While there is no indication of a link between the incidents that occurred in Mexico and the more recent cases in the Dominican Republic, the response to Johnson's 2017 letter highlights several concerns related to the US government's handling of inquires involving American tourists abroad.

Johnson sent his letter to the State Department just months after the death of a 20-year-old woman from Wisconsin named Abbey Conner in January 2017.

She and her brother Austin lost consciousness soon after consuming alcohol at the pool bar in the Iberostar Paraiso del Mar on the first day of their family's vacation. Abbey was found face-down in the shallow end of the pool, nearly drowned, and died days later after being airlifted to a hospital in Florida.

""According to Ms. Connor's family, and other victims who have since come forward, the consumption of allegedly tainted alcohol at Mexican resorts has led to violence, physical abuse and even death,"" Johnson's letter to the State Department states. ""I respectfully ask the Office of the Inspector General to examine how the Department monitors, records and reports overseas incidents involving physical abuse or death after the consumption of potentially tainted alcohol.""

'Formal report would not be appropriate'

Despite prompting a wide-ranging probe into the issue, which included reviewing every complaint made to the State Department about possible bootleg alcohol, interviewing the people involved and significant coordination with the Mexican government, the Inspector General ultimately concluded that a ""formal report would not be appropriate.""

The response explains, ""OIG faced several challenges in completing this review, including the fact that victims often did not report incidents of unregulated alcohol to the department, which significantly limited the number of cases on which OIG could base any generalizable findings,"" it states.

""In addition, OIG's review was complicated by the fact that the guidance for consular personnel who face these types of situations is general and sometimes advisory, mainly because of the complex and variable nature of the incidents themselves.""

However, the lengthy response does detail the inner workings of how this inquiry was handled as a result of pressure on the State Department, and details some of the actions that were taken as a result of the review.

Ultimately, the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs did provide OIG with a list of 15 complaints that it has received since 2017 related to the consumption of unregulated alcohol by Americans in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo, the most visited by tourists from the US.

Two bars shut down

The State Department pressured the Mexican government to inspect 30 bars, restaurants and hotels. Two bars -- including one that served Abbey and Austin Conner -- have been shut down as a result. Raids were conducted by Mexican authorities that did end up finding ""a significant amount of alcohol of 'undetermined origin'"" and led to the identification of one supplier of questionably-sourced alcohol.

Ten thousand gallons of this alcohol was seized -- although according to the OIG, none tested positive for any dangerous substances.

And the State Department's work led to the Mexican government opening an office staffed with bilingual attorneys to help American tourists file police reports.

The response makes no mention, however, of multiple incidents reported in various media outlets that Mexican officials had, in other raids, seized hundreds of gallons of alcohol allegedly tainted with methanol, a toxic form of alcohol that is used in fuel, antifreeze, windshield wiper fluid and solvents. It can cause blindness and death.

Those findings are included in the Conner family's wrongful death lawsuit against Iberostar, filed last year.

The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, which has reported extensively on the Mexican cases, reports that it has heard from more than 200 people who believe they encountered tainted alcohol in Mexico, and the paper cites a 2017 Mexican government-spearheaded study that found that as much as 36% of all alcohol consumed throughout Mexico is produced illegally and unregulated.

The OIG's response did detail some of the difficulties American families of victims faced in getting help from the State Department while in Mexico, which some families described as ""insensitive,"" ""bureaucratic,"" or virtually nonexistent. At times families were told by State officials that they could not help them navigate the Mexican law enforcement or healthcare process.

The family of one woman who died was told the State Department couldn't help them at all submitting a police report when the Mexican government refused to let them file one.

In one case, a man had to wait until the next day for assistance filing a police report, despite reporting he was drugged and sexually assaulted after drinking tainted alcohol.

Yet despite recording the summaries of various reported cases, OIG did not express an opinion as to whether extensive handling of alleged cases of tainted alcohol in Mexico falls under the State Department's area of responsibility.

""OIG cannot draw definitive conclusions about any individual consular officer's compliance with Department policies in these cases,"" their response to Johnson's letter says, since State Department guidance on this issue remains vague.

An official with the inspector general's office told CNN their investigation is now closed.

""We were really limited by our jurisdiction, in what we could look at,"" the official said. ""We mostly had to focus on the actions of the State Department. And it did put a lot of pressure on the Mexican government to do thorough inspections.""

The official said the Mexican government was receptive to the US's urgings to do something about‎ the problem, but added, ""Mexico doesn't want to lose tourist dollars. It's a huge source of revenue.""

Gary Davidson, an attorney for the family of Abbey Conner, continues to seek answers and compensation for the family's loss. ""There is basically homemade liquor down there, circulating in the community of hotels -- and a lot of the hotels are buying it,"" he told CNN."
EPA works to gets the lead out at N.J. site | Editorial,https://www.nj.com,"['South Jersey', 'Egoldberg Southjerseymedia.Com', 'South Jersey Times Editorial Board']",07-07-2019,2019,7,https://www.nj.com/opinion/2019/07/epa-works-to-gets-the-lead-out-at-nj-site-editorial.html,"As President Donald Trump pursues downright scary policies at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, it’s a relief to see localized toxic site cleanups moving forward without disruption.

The same agency that whose policies suggest polluting, coal-belching electricity plants are the clean energy of the future, is on a roll, rolling out plans to root out neighborhood nasties on the Superfund list.

There has been notable recent site activity in EPA’s Region 2, which includes New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The latest example was last week’s announcement of an ambitious $72.2 million effort to clean up a West Deptford Township property that stockpiled old lead-acid vehicle battery casings and extracted the salable, but often hazardous, chemicals and heavy metals inside.

If you purchased a replacement car battery some time ago and the attractive price had an asterisk stating “with trade,” you surely didn’t think that your old casing would end up at a rudimentary, environmentally insecure place like Matteo & Sons on Crown Point Road, near U.S. Route 130.

Feds hatch $72M plan to clean up N.J. Superfund site tainted by cancer-causing chemicals The EPA has announced a plan to remediate the site of a former battery recycling facility in West Deptford.

Across a sprawling 82.5 acres, the state Department of Environmental Protection says, Matteo & Sons began an unlicensed landfill in 1961, with a “lead sweating” operation from 1968 through 1984. But, it wasn’t just lead that started popping up along with the buried battery carcasses. There are polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), suspected of causing cancer, and who knows what else leaching out of cars and trucks scraps. The location is not far from West Deptford High School and dozens of neighborhood homes.

While smaller enforcement actions have taken place since 2006, it wasn’t until 2016 that the entire Matteo & Sons site went on the national Superfund list. Given this program’s history of cleanups that literally took decades, it’s reasonable for a comprehensive remediation plan to be issued three years later. And, EPA doesn’t seem to be skimping. It will dig up 92,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil and crushed casings, take it offsite for disposal, and replace it with clean fill or fresh asphalt. The agency also proposes monitoring effectiveness of the finished cleanup every five years.

Refreshingly, there’s no monkeying around with half-baked proposals to “encapsulate” the soil, or attempts to render the pollutants inert on-site with some kind of unproved alchemy that makes guinea pigs of nearby children, students and residents. The population deserves nothing less than a full cleanup, especially with the severe impact that lead poisoning can have on youngsters’ brains and nervous systems.

The schedule calls for starting the cleanup later this year, if the plan gets a final OK after a public comment period ending Aug. 2. An informational meeting is set for 6:30 p.m. July 17 in the RiverWinds Community Center in West Deptford.

The Trump administration deserves praise for advancing the West Deptford site work. At the same time, with Superfund sites, hindsight is often 20-20. Could 1970s and 1980s township officials have prevented future environmental damage if they knew what was going on at Matteo’s?

The irony with respect to the president’s broader national policies is inescapable. Trump signs on to robust cleanup programs for past hazards, but assumes Earth-unfriendly actions today have no effect on tomorrow. Keep using coal, because people haven’t ceased breathing yet. Call global warming a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese, since Americans in large numbers are not falling down in the street from heat stroke. If such logic was flawed in 1979, it certainly is flawed now.

Open the scrapbook Dorene Sherman has and you'll get a glimpse into a storied career. Page after page is filled with all sorts of photos. Pictures of Hollywood stars, presidents and photos of Sherman with everyone from former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to the first Russian generals ever to visit the United States following the Cold War.""Time goes by so quickly,"" Sherman said as she flipped through the pages of her scrapbook. It's filled with photos dating back to the late 1960s. ""I was asking my granddaughter this morning to tell me if she remembers some of the things that happened during my career. She said, 'Grandma, I was 7 years old when you retired,'"" Sherman said jokingly. Sherman never expected she'd meet some of the most notable people of the 20th century.""Bob Hope. I met him,"" she said. ""I met Rock Hudson, too."" And she has the photos to prove it. You'll find her scrapbook filled with photos showing Sherman alongside people ranging from author Tom Clancy and actor Bob Newhart to four star generals and commander in chiefs at Strategic Air Command.""They were all very wonderful people,"" Sherman said. And she has stories about almost all of them.""President Carter, when we met him at his airplane, he shook his hand and put his arm around me, and in his Southern accent said, 'Oh, gee, you sure are pretty,'"" Sherman recalled. Sherman met every U.S. president from Richard Nixon to Bill Clinton. She still has a signed name tag from Nixon.""I have jelly beans from Air Force One. Ronald Reagan always had jelly beans,"" she said.Sherman started as a receptionist at Offutt Air Force base in 1960. It wasn't long after that she was promoted, eventually becoming secretary to the commander in chief of Strategic Air Command. It was a front row seat during the height of the Cold War.""I heard lots of things,"" she said. ""There was a lot going on back then and it was all happening right there at SAC."" Sherman would also become deputy director of protocol. In that role, she'd arrange itineraries and serve as an escort for all VIP guests. ""I'd take them around the base and wherever they needed or wanted to go,"" she said.In that role, she became close to World War II hero Jimmy Doolittle. Doolittle made monthly trips to Omaha, Sherman said, when he served on the board of directors at Mutual of Omaha. ""He was such a nice man,"" Sherman said. ""I really liked him."" Flipping through her scrapbook, you'll come across personal messages from President George H.W. Bush and see photos of Sherman with his wife Barbara.""She was a real nice lady. They both were,"" Sherman said.You'll also see messages written by Four Star General and former United States Secretary of State Colin Powell. There are photos with Condoleeza Rice, Dick Cheney and the chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.""I've been on Air Force One a few times. I also had the chance to fly to places all over the world because of my job,"" Sherman said.In the early 1980s, Sherman recalled a telephone conversation. She took the call not knowing show was on the other line.""He said, 'Is there anyway we could refuel our airplane at Offutt? Because we're going back to England,' and it was the plane of Queen Elizabeth,"" Sherman recalled.And she has the photos from when the plane landed and Queen Elizabeth made a stop in Nebraska. It's the only time she'd ever been in the state.""You look through the book and you're kind of, like, 'wow',"" Austin Yates, Sherman's grandson said.Yates was there for the visit of Queen Elizabeth. ""My grandma tells the story of how the queen walked up and said that I was a beautiful baby,"" Yates said.Yates is now a father himself and takes pride showing his sons the people his grandmother met. The scrapbook now serves as a storybook for Sherman's family.""Lots of memories,"" Sherman said. ""Memories, memories, memories. I got real lucky."" Despite the impressive job, Sherman said the thing she is most proud of is her family. She has two children, eight grand children and 19 great grandchildren. Sherman retired in 1999. She is active in the Omaha metro as a volunteer.

How much responsibility should FedEx and other carriers bear for customers making illegal shipments?

The Memphis logistics giant's lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Commerce over export restrictions brings that question, a familiar one among those in the export business, to the forefront.

In June, FedEx filed a lawsuit seeking to stop the Department of Commerce from enforcing certain regulations against it. Specifically, the “Entity List” that’s part of Export Administration Regulations (EAR) restricts U.S. firms from doing business with listed companies. FedEx says that places “an impossible burden” on common carriers like itself.

THE LAWSUIT: FedEx sues over Department of Commerce export rules after Huawei shipping botches

FedEx said the regulations, which have received heightened attention after Chinese tech company Huawei's listing, “unreasonably hold common carriers strictly liable for shipments that may violate the EAR without requiring evidence that the carriers had any knowledge of any violations.”

The case will draw “a lot of interest” due to the parties affected, said Bruce Leeds, Senior of Counsel for Braumiller Law Group PLLC, which specializes in export and import compliance issues. FedEx's regulatory gripes center on the challenge of policing prohibited items being shipped through the carrier, he said.

Oftentimes shippers expect transportation companies like FedEx to figure out if their shipment is an export violation instead of figuring it out themselves, Leeds said, even if they are legally responsible. But when the carrier handles millions of packages daily, that's not an easy task, he added.

“DHL and UPS are going to have the same issue: The volume of what they process every day is difficult to control,” he said.

Still, getting the Department of Commerce to concede and relax enforcement of the entity list that includes supposed national security threats will be an uphill battle, said Jon Yormick, an international business and trade attorney at Phillips Lytle LLP.

“It may prove very difficult, I think, for FedEx to get the relief that it’s seeking,” Yormick said.

CEO Smith, Commerce head spar over regulations

The party ultimately responsible for making sure the item is legally exported is the ""exporter of record,"" typically the seller of the product being shipped, Yormick said. FedEx is arguing the way regulations are currently structured, the carrier is on the hook for export violations just as much as the party exporting the item is, he added.

“FedEx’s point is, ‘We can’t police all our customers,’” Yormick said. “…They point out the only way they can play it safe is by rejecting shipments.”

In a Fox News interview shortly after FedEx filed the lawsuit, CEO Fred Smith emphasized the burden FedEx takes on with export regulations and trying to make sure the contents of all its packages comply with them.

“If we make an error on any one of them without a trial, without any due process, we can be fined $250,000 per piece,” Smith said on Fox News.

In 2017, FedEx paid a $500,000 penalty plus interest after being charged with 53 violations from the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security, according to the company's lawsuit.

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross countered Smith’s claims in his own Fox News interview the following day. He said Smith is “misinterpreting” the regulations and FedEx just needs to not knowingly carry goods in violation of the regulations or conspire to avoid them.

FedEx has the mechanisms to comply with the regulations and has done so “pretty well” in the past, he added.

“We're not asking Fred (Smith) or anyone else to be a policeman, we're just asking them not to conspire with people to avoid the things,” Ross said on Fox News. “So we look forward to dealing with that matter in the litigation. I think it's unfortunate that he has misinterpreted the rules. The courts will not misinterpret.”

However, Yormick said most EAR violations are “strict liability violations,” which means even an unknowing violation is one that faces penalties. Most EAR penalty settlements, such as FedEx's, fall into the strict liability category, he added.

Tracking illegal shipments a task for many

FedEx says it would have to figure out the origin and technological makeup of all the items in the shipments it handles in order to keep track of every EAR-related violation. The company handles some 15 million packages a day.

The EAR's entity list prevents a U.S. company from exporting to anyone listed directly or indirectly without obtaining an export license. Leeds said it applies even for innocuous shipments and there aren’t many obstacles to the Department of Commerce placing an entity on the list as long as there’s justification for it, like national security concerns.

The U.S. has that very concern about Huawei and has, for now, placed it on the entity list. FedEx mishandled Huawei packages on at least two occasions since it was blacklisted, and China is investigating FedEx on the matter. Smith maintains the issue goes back many years and is separate from the Huawei situation.

The Bureau of Industry and Security often relies on common carriers finding shippers that fail to follow the list because its enforcement arm (the Office of Export Enforcement) “doesn’t have the resources to go out and find” all the items in violation, Leeds said.

The government does have tools available to help companies meet compliance, but it remains a burden for smaller, resource-bare companies shipping through FedEx to stay up-to-date, Yormick said.

“It’s a bit like playing Monopoly,” he said of exporting. “If you’ve never played Monopoly before, there’s a lot of rules to the game. You want to make sure someone explains the rules to you or you read and understand them, otherwise you shouldn’t be playing.”

The Justice Department in Washington in May 2013. (J. David Ake/AP)

Contributing columnist

Pity the poor Justice Department lawyer who draws the short straw these days.

On Wednesday, only 24 hours after assuring a federal district judge that the government would not try to add to the 2020 Census the citizenship question the Supreme Court had blocked, the department suddenly reversed ground.

That left it to a sheepish and bewildered career Justice Department lawyer, Joshua Gardner, to tell Judge George M. Hazel of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland that he was backing away from firm representations he had made to the court on behalf of the federal government just a day earlier.

The sole provocation for this humiliating situation: a tweet from President Trump on Wednesday morning asserting “we are absolutely moving forward” on the citizenship question,” notwithstanding the Supreme Court’s decision.

You read that right: a tweet. Nothing more.

Gardner had no choice but to inform the court, “The tweet this morning was the first I had heard of the president’s position on this issue. . . . As you can imagine, I am doing my absolute best to figure out what’s going on.""

And, in short order, Gardner found himself backpedaling and doing his best to defend his own credibility, pleading to the court that, “I’ve been with the United States Department of Justice for 16 years through multiple administrations, and I’ve always endeavored to be as candid as possible with the court.""

Translation: I’m a career employee and not a Trump toady; I recognize that the department looks lawless and untrustworthy right now, but please try not to hold it too much against us going forward.

Career Justice Department lawyers are used to working in anonymity and with the winds of their credibility and that of the department as a whole at their backs. This is very far from the way Gardner would like to have seen his name in the national news.

Likewise for Sarah Fabian, the career lawyer forced to the front lines to draw the fire of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit — and public humiliation — for defending the proposition that denying immigrants soap and toothbrushes complies with the statutory mandate of “sanitary” detention facilities.

The fault here — beyond the obvious erratic lurching of the president and his l’etat-c’est-moi disregard of the rule of law — rests with Justice Department leadership.

Administrations change positions. That is understood and legitimate. But they do it with care, circumspection and due regard for the need to respect the law as objective and continuous, and for their duty of candor to the courts.

So the true eyebrow-raising feature of the department’s abrupt U-turn on the census is its absence of deliberation. The assistant attorney general for the civil division, Jody Hunt, who joined the conference before the court, conceded that the tweet was the sole impetus for the reversal.

That demonstrates an undue, if not ridiculous, solicitude for the whims of the mad king. The indication that Trump wanted to find a way around the ruling of the Supreme Court should have been (at most) a trigger for a reasoned process involving department leadership — in particular, the solicitor general, the client (in this case, the Commerce Department) and, perhaps, the White House counsel.

And voices within those discussions needed to be ready push back against political caprice, or measure it against the government’s longer-term responsibility to safeguard its credibility with the court and display fidelity to the rule of law. That is ultimately a service to the president, as well as to the department and the courts.

Yes, time is very short, but there is no indication of any such process having taken place here. Trump tweets; the department disposes.

The backwards somersault was all the more ill-considered given the severe credibility problems that the department and administration have created in this very case. The Supreme Court’s decision took the very unusual step of essentially rejecting as pretextual the proffered reason for including the citizenship question. Even before that, Hazel had taken the unusual step of reopening the case based on new evidence suggesting that the true reason for the question was to increase the political power of Republicans and non-Hispanic whites.

Finally, the solicitor general had made repeated representations to the Supreme Court that June 30 was a drop-dead date after which the census question could not be added. Now that the administration seems to believe otherwise, it leaves him with egg on his face.

The department seems relatively indifferent to the institutional cost of defending the imperial presidency, including the potential erosion in public confidence that the government is constrained by law. But this latest episode is a new indication that the federal courts at least are taking notice. The 9th Circuit on Wednesday handed the administration its latest setback, rejecting its request to stay a District Court ruling blocking the diversion of military funds to pay for Trump’s border wall.

If the department continues to jump at the president’s every hiccup — candor and consistency be damned — it may find that the courts are more likely to deny it the traditional benefit of the doubt and reject its litigating positions. That is more than an embarrassment for the front-line lawyers; it is a body blow to the department’s institutional interests and, potentially, the public’s confidence in a government of laws, not of men.

Department of Labor reports trucking employment on the rise,https://www.ccjdigital.com,['Commercial Carrier Journal'],07-08-2019,2019,7,https://www.ccjdigital.com/new-figures-from-labor-department-show-trucking-employment-upswing-in-recent-months/,"CCJ‘s Indicators rounds up the latest reports on trucking business indicators on rates, freight, equipment, the economy and more.

New data released by the Department of Labor on Friday presents a rosier picture of trucking employment through the first half of 2019 than originally indicated by earlier, preliminary data. Instead of a lackluster 400 jobs added since January — compared to the nearly 50,000 between December 2017 and December 2018 — the DOL’s upwardly revised numbers indicate the for-hire trucking industry added 7,300 jobs on a seasonally adjusted basis in 2019’s second quarter and 11,700 jobs since the beginning of the year.

According to the DOL’s monthly Employment Situation Report, the second-quarter upswing was capped by a 4,300-job uptick in June. The U.S. economy as a whole added 224,000 jobs in June, and the unemployment rate climbed a tenth of a percent to 3.7 percent.

Employment in the for-hire trucking industry totaled 1.519 million in June — a gain of 36,800 jobs from the same month last year.

The transportation and warehousing sector as a whole in June added 23,900 jobs, according to the DOL, while major freight producing sectors like manufacturing and construction added 17,000 jobs and 21,000 jobs, respectively."
It's time to break up the Department of Homeland Security,https://www.cnn.com,['David Perry'],07-04-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/04/opinions/department-of-homeland-security-needs-dismantling-perry/index.html,"David M. Perry is a journalist and historian. He's the senior academic adviser to the history department at the University of Minnesota. Follow him on Twitter . The views expressed here are those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) Every day, it seems, we get another story about the horrible conditions in the US Customs and Border Protection detention facilities or Border Patrol officers behaving badly . This current crisis at the border and in the various immigration agencies is not just a byproduct of Trump and his advisers' virulent nativism, but a manifestation of the flaws built into the Department of Homeland Security. The DHS was never going to work. It's time to break it up.

The department was thrown together during George W. Bush's administration, forged in fear in the aftermath of 9/11. Today, it's a hodgepodge of diverse agencies -- including the TSA, FEMA, ICE, and many more -- often with conflicting missions, all of which have been subordinated beneath Trump's anti-immigrant agenda

I remember remarking to a friend in 2002, when the Homeland Security Act created the new department with broad bipartisan support, that ""Homeland Security"" sounded like something out of a dystopian novel. A year after 9/11, American politicians were afraid of another attack, they were being misled toward war in Iraq, compromising civil liberties in exchange for projecting a feeling of security, and making lots of mistakes, usually with wide margins of support from their constituencies.

As we head toward the 2020 election, and as horrific conditions in prison-like facilities run by the immigration agencies of DHS are headline news , it's long past time to take a sober look at the post-9/11 moment and find ways to fix some of those mistakes.

This week, as the Congressional Democrats were touring a Texas border facility run by Customs and Border Protection, ProPublica broke a story that described a secret Facebook group of some 9,500 current and former Border Patrol agents. Here, members ""joked about the deaths of migrants, discussed throwing burritos at Latino members of Congress visiting a detention facility in Texas on Monday and posted a vulgar illustration depicting Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez engaged in oral sex with a detained migrant."" The US Customs and Border Protection Agency has called the posts ""completely inappropriate"" and promised to investigate its officers

Examining these abuses shines a light on the folly of slamming immigration enforcement agencies (such as ICE and CPB) into a single department with agencies in charge of emergency management (FEMA), transportation (TSA), and energy (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency), all bound together by a counterterrorism mission statement.

As security expert Bruce Schneier often says , in the aftermath of terrorism, politicians feel desperate, rationalizing: ""Something must be done. This is something. Therefore, we must do it."" That's the kind of thinking that created the Department of Homeland Security.

Immigration police from throughout the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement division of DHS, which includes ICE and CPB, seem to feel free to act with impunity , knowing they can resist oversight by citing the counterterrorism mission of DHS. Any budgetary limit on one agency opens up the other components to plundering, such as when DHS transferred nearly $10 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to ICE, the funds at least partially used for immigration detention and deportation, in the midst of the 2018 hurricane season.

I'm far from the first to call for breaking up DHS and returning its components to other departments where they belong, back to pre-existing agencies like Transportation, Justice, and Energy. In 2006, not long after FEMA failed New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina, Yale sociologist Charles Perrow offered some ""dreary conclusions"" in Homeland Security Affairs, writing that DHS is not particularly adept at fulfilling its core mission of streamlining intelligence sharing among federal agencies while diverting funds from supporting first responders in the wake of natural disasters.

In 2011, David Rittgers, a legal policy analyst for the libertarian Cato Institute, made his case that ""the Department of Homeland Security should be abolished and its components reorganized into more practical groupings."" In 2012, Tulane scholar Kevin Gotham linked the 2002 Homeland Security Bill to an accelerated process of privatization of disaster relief at least partially responsible for the failures during Hurricane Katrina.

Former DHS counterterrorism official Matt Mayer, later a scholar of homeland security, wrote in 2015 , ""after twelve years of mediocre-to-poor operations and countless scandals ... the core functions overseen by DHS can be managed more effectively elsewhere, especially where territorial battles undermine operational efficacy.""

None of these authors are radicals. They are just looking at the mission of DHS, assessing its successes, condemning its many failures, and concluding that the agency can't be fixed.

DHS was a bipartisan mistake. It's made it harder for FEMA to respond to national disasters. It's enabled a culture of impunity and aggression among our immigration officers. It has a history emerging from a specific historical context and time. I believe that as the decades pass, historians like me will look back in sadness at the years after 9/11, when national unity was squandered in persuading Americans to abandon their civil liberties, plunging the nation into endless war, and laying the groundwork for our new regime of concentration camps (as some genocide scholars characterize them ) on the American border.

"Lots of DoD Small Launchers, But What Will They Launch?",https://breakingdefense.com,"['Theresa Hitchens', 'Leonardo Drs', 'Paul Mcleary', 'Breaking Defense']",,,,https://breakingdefense.com/2019/07/lots-of-dod-small-launchers-but-what-will-they-launch/,"WASHINGTON: Small satellite launcher projects are all the rage at DoD, but there aren’t many actual small satellites for them to launch. While there are numerous experimental satellites being designed and flown, there is no officially funded program aimed at designing, building and using smallsats for DoD missions.

“I think there’s been a long chicken and egg problem between small launch and small satellites” says Steve Nixon, president of the aptly-named SmallSat Alliance. “The traditional way is to attack them at the same time: do a little bit of both consecutively. We would like to see the national security side move out more aggressively, because there is lot of agreement about the value of small satellites.”

Indeed, part of the mission of the SmallSat Alliance, formed last year, is to help DoD figure out how it can “go beyond just experiments and begin to use small satellites for true operations.”

A DoD official admitted this week that right now it would be impossible to name a “program of record” for small satellites within the military services.

Part of the problem is that Air Force leadership has sent mixed signals on the level of interest in small satellites. The Air Force accounts for about 90 percent of DoD space spending.

Former Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson waxed decidedly noncommittal in a speech at the annual Space Symposium in April. Wilson said that an internal Pentagon study on future space architectures found that “exquisite satellites” (that is, large, expensive, and highly capable) are still a key DoD focus. (That study has not been released publicly.)

Air Force Space Command Vice Commander Lt. Gen. David Thompson, however, told a New America conference here in May that the Air Force will “definitely be using” large constellations of small satellites.

“The external and internal communication regarding [DoD] smallsat strategy is not consistent and not clear,” Carissa Christensen, CEO of Bryce Space and Technologies, said somewhat wryly in a Tuesday interview.

Experiments Everywhere

At the same time, practically every space-related body within DoD seems to be experimenting with small satellites based in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) — or in Pentagonese, “proliferated LEO.”

One of the flagship programs underway is the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency’s (DARPA) Blackjack program, designed to test small satellite constellations based on a Lego-like model of standardized bus designs with switchable payloads. While the Air Force has been planning to transition technology proven successful from Blackjack — called CASINO for Commercially Augmented Space Inter Networked Operations — to its own LEO-based constellation of smallsats, funding for that is uncertain.

The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) at Wright Patterson AFB long has developed smallsat-based experiments, such as the Demonstration and Science Experiments (DSX) spacecraft studying the affects of the Van Allen radiation belts on spacecraft components. The DSX was launched last week on SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy, along with 24 other small satellites under Air Force Space and Missile System Center’s (SMC) Space Test Program-2 mission.

The DoD Space Test Program (STP) has been around for decades, working to orbit Army, Navy and Air Force space experiments that are chosen by the DoD Space Experiments Review Board (SERB), chaired by the head of Air Force acquisition, Will Roper. SMC manages the STP program.

The Army, which has long been interested in the promise of small satellites for its tactical needs, has its own programs as well. The most recent effort is the Gunsmoke-L program started last year with a two-year (plus an option for a third), $8.3 million contract with Dynetics, based in Huntsville, Ala., to develop, test, integrate and demonstrate two “tactical space support vehicles.” The Army has built a series of the classified Gunsmoke satellites, dating back to at least 2017.

Further, my colleague Vivienne Machi last week broke the news that the Army is developing its first “tactical space layer” strategy that could include satellites in LEO for communications; position, navigation, and timing (PNT) and battle management command and control (BMC2) missions.

The Navy, in November 2018, launched its ICE-Cap (Integrated Communications Extension Capability) nansosatellite to demonstrate the ability of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites to expand the coverage of its Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) narrow-band communications satellite network to the polar regions.

But none of these test projects are slated to transition to formal programs, with formal budgets, and formal military missions.

Proliferating Launch Initiatives

Meanwhile, there is enormous industry buzz in the small launch vehicle market, including about the potential for DoD contracts.

Christensen said one of the reasons small launch vehicle vendors around the world are increasingly looking at governments as potential customers is that the commercial market is simply not going to be able to support all of them. Based on market history and future trends, she explained, not all the thousands of smallsats being proposed (or even already licensed) will actually be deployed; even some of the companies that manage to orbit some smallsats will fail; and once a company actually manages to become economically viable, the size of its satellites is likely to grow.

But rather than being concerned about the disconnect between DoD’s eagerness to on-ramp commercial launch capability and the lack of real DoD smallsat programs, Christensen believes DoD is doing the right thing by moving out to try to harness the capability for responsive launch. (Responsive launch, the ability to launch practically on demand, has been a Holy Grail for the Pentagon for more than a decade. See Operationally Responsive Space.)

“I really feel like this slight disconnect of market dynamics is creating a really good opportunity to take advantage of emergent systems and determine if they have applicability to future military of IC [Intelligence Community] needs, for much cheaper than starting from scratch and building internal DoD programs.”

There are at least three significant DoD programs seeking to validate smaller launchers for future military use.

STP is partnering with the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) on the Rapid Agile Launch Initiative (RALI). RALI is designed to leverage DIU’s expertise in open sourcing by rapidly awarding DoD launch service agreements with non-traditional, venture-class companies.

Last week, the truly non-traditional startup SpinLaunch announced it has become the latest winner of a DIU contract under that initiative. The contract (for an unspecified amount) is to prototype SpinLaunch’s ground-based, kinetic energy launch system that functions as a kind of centrifugal force catapult to heave a small rocket carrying a satellite out of the atmosphere.

A SpinLaunch fact sheet explains that the launch system uses “existing technology and components from oil/gas/mining and wind turbine industries to construct an innovative mass acceleration system, which achieves very high launch speeds without the need for enormous power generation or massive infrastructure. After ascending above the atmosphere, a relatively small, low-cost onboard rocket will be used to “provide the final required velocity for orbital insertion.”

The RALI program’s first launch was in May, when New Zealand startup Rocket Lab successfully lofted three small experimental satellites into LEO. It included the Army’s Harbinger, a commercial small satellite built by York Space Systems in Denver, to “demonstrate the ability of an experimental commercial system to meet DoD space capability requirements.”

DARPA’s Launch Challenge in April awarded $400,000 to each of three companies chosen to demonstrate “flexible and responsive” launch of small payloads. Tucson-based Vector Launch, Virgin Orbit, and a “stealth” startup now are competing for prizes up to $10 million for proving they can successfully launch twice in a row — from any launch facility chosen by DARPA — within a short timeframe. As a next step, the competitors early next year will be asked to launch a payload to LEO within two weeks from one of eight predetermined sites — after receiving notice of the launch site only a few weeks prior, and exact details on the payload and intended orbit just days before. One of the goals is to demonstrate that DoD can contract backup launches if one of its few fixed launch facilities is put out of commission by either an accident or an attack.

Todd Master, the program manager for the DARPA Launch Challenge, told me that DARPA is busy with preparatory work in the run up to the actual launch-off planned for early next year. This includes, he says, working with the Federal Aviation Authority to ensure that the commercial licensing process is smooth, given the “challenges” the project presents to the FAA’s normal launch licensing process. “They’ve been a great partner,” he said, adding that DARPA sees the Launch Challenge as “hopefully laying the ground work for streamlined licensing processes that could work in the future” to help DoD acquire commercial space launch capabilities.

And yet another new Air Force small launch effort, called the Rapid Space Launch Initiative (RSLI), was kicked off in late May by SMC’s Rocket Systems Launch Program based at Kirtland AFB in New Mexico. The RSLI request for proposals says that the Air Force is “investigating the possible procurement of a capability to rapidly launch and deploy space payloads critical to national security in an ultra-responsive manner. The objective is 24 hours from “call up” notification to on-orbit capability.”

That project seeks to demonstrate rapid space launch capabilities to LEO “on a small scale,” with “the intended payload” an “Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle Secondary Payload Adapter (ESPA) class space vehicle or smaller with a mass up to 220kg.” The RFI, however, notes that “demonstrated solutions that can scale to orbits and payloads of national security value are also of great interest. The program intends to hold an industry day in El Segundo, Calif., July 29-30."

Michael Morell: A DOJ-led review of CIA intelligence will weaken the intelligence community,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Michael Morell', 'Contributing Columnist Covering Intelligence', 'National Security.', 'Contributing Columnist', 'A Post Contributing Columnist', 'Was Deputy Director Of Cia To', 'Twice Its Acting Director During That Period.']",07-05-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trump-and-barr-are-crossing-another-line/2019/07/05/3c90944a-9d08-11e9-b27f-ed2942f73d70_story.html,"Contributing columnist

Michael Morell was the deputy director of the CIA from 2010 to 2013 and twice its acting director. He is a contributing columnist for The Post.

From his very first day in office, President Trump has had a strange and, at times, strained relationship with the U.S. intelligence community. The president and his political aides have often challenged the honesty and integrity of the community, damaging morale, undercutting its mission and making the already difficult challenge of uncovering threats to our nation even harder.

But, by putting the CIA’s analytic judgment (that one of Russia’s objectives in interfering in the 2016 election was to help then-candidate Trump) into the crosshairs of the Justice Department, as reported by several news organizations , the president and Attorney General William P. Barr are crossing another line.

I see no problem with a Justice Department review of whether the CIA and other intelligence agencies lived up to their legal and regulatory responsibilities as to how they handled any information related to U.S. persons — U.S. citizens and U.S. nationals. There are strict rules in this regard — the most important promulgated by multiple attorneys general over time — and, in our divisive political environment, it would be beneficial to our democracy for the country to know whether the rules were followed or not.

Nor am I arguing that CIA analytic judgments should be beyond review, but that has already happened in this case. Both the Senate and the House intelligence committees have done reviews of the analysis, with the bipartisan Senate committee calling the overall analysis a “sound intelligence product.” The partisan House committee split on the question of the specific judgment about Russian President Vladi­mir Putin’s intent to help Trump.

What I am arguing is that the Justice Department has no standing to review the CIA’s analytic judgment. The whole idea is inappropriate and dangerous. It is certainly unprecedented, and there are good reasons it has never been done before.

I have great respect for John H. Durham , the U.S. attorney for the District of Connecticut tapped by Barr to do the review. But, while Durham is familiar with the CIA from previous investigations, he and his team have no experience with, or knowledge of, the process of intelligence analysis itself. He and his team could well impose a hard-to-meet law enforcement standard on the analysts’ conclusions. That would create a burden of proof that might be right in a court of law but would be risky and unwise in the assessment of intelligence for real-time decision-making.

A similarly dangerous consequence of a Justice Department review of analysis is the chilling effect it may have on analysts and analysis. Out of prudence, any analyst asked to submit to an interview with Durham’s investigators will want to have a personal lawyer nearby — likely a first for many, if not all, of the analysts. This will all be watched closely inside the intelligence community: The prospect that Justice Department prosecutors could ask questions about how an analyst came to a specific conclusion — along with the thought that there may be legal consequences for having done so — could lead analysts to withhold their judgments or even decide that this profession is not for them. We lose as a nation with either outcome.

If the shoe were on the other foot — if a senior intelligence community official were asked to review decisions made by the FBI and career prosecutors — how do we think the attorney general, or career prosecutors, would react? With loud protests, no doubt.

There seems to be an erroneous belief among some that if the analysts had not come to the conclusion that Putin was trying to help Trump, there would not have been an FBI counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign. This belief is misplaced; there was likely never a link between a judgment by the intelligence community analysts and a decision by the FBI on whether to open a counterintelligence case. The two were most likely completely separate. And, further, it seems that the analytic judgment about Russian intent came after the opening of the counterintelligence investigation. If so, it could not have been a predicate for the investigation.

A Justice-led review of the quality of intelligence analysis represents yet another weakening of the intelligence community as an institution. The country could be paying for these kinds of decisions for years to come."
Acting DHS chief launches probe into 'disturbing & inexcusable' Border Patrol social media posts,https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mcaleenan-launches-probe-into-disturbing-inexcusable-border-patrol-social-media-posts,"Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said Wednesday that he has launched an “immediate investigation” into what he called “disturbing & inexcusable” social media posts from Border Patrol agents that purportedly included graphic and vulgar jokes about Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.

“Reporting this week highlighted disturbing & inexcusable social media activity that allegedly includes active Border Patrol personnel,” McAleenan said in a statement on Twitter. “These statements are completely unacceptable, especially if made by those sworn to uphold the @DHSgov mission, our values & standards of conduct.”

OCASIO-CORTEZ ACCUSES BORDER OFFICERS OF 'VIOLENT CULTURE' AFTER REPORT ON GRAPHIC FACEBOOK POSTS

“I have directed an immediate investigation, and as the @USBPChief has made clear, any employee found to have compromised the public’s trust in our law enforcement mission will be held accountable. They do not represent the men and women of the Border Patrol or @DHSgov.”

The website ProPublica posted a story Monday headlined “Inside the Secret Border Patrol Facebook Group Where Agents Joke About Migrant Deaths and Post Sexist Memes.” In addition to showing indifference toward the deaths of migrants, members made vulgar jokes about Ocasio-Cortez and other members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus ahead of their visit a Border Patrol facility in Texas on Monday, the story said.

In one post reported by ProPublica, a group member referenced the visits by Democrats and encouraged an officer to throw a “burrito at these b-----s.” Other posts included a vile, fake photo illustration of Ocasio-Cortez engaged in oral sex with President Trump.

Ocasio-Cortez blasted what she described as a “violent culture” within Border Patrol.

“They’re threatening violence on members of Congress,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. “How do you think they’re treating caged children+families?”

Matthew Klein, the assistant commissioner of the CBP’s Office of Professional Responsibility, said the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general opened its own investigation on Monday.

""Today, U.S. Customs and Border Protection was made aware of disturbing social media activity hosted on a private Facebook group that may include a number of CBP employees,"" Klein said. ""CBP immediately informed DHS Office of the Inspector General and initiated an investigation.""

U.S. reviews export requests to Huawei with 'highest scrutiny': Commerce Department,https://www.reuters.com,"['Alexandra Alper', 'Min Read']",07-03-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-huawei-tech-commerce-idUSKCN1TY2HA,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government said on Wednesday it was reviewing license requests from U.S. companies seeking to export products to China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd “under the highest national security scrutiny” since the company is still blacklisted.

In an email to Reuters, the Commerce Department said that as it reviewed applications, it was applying the “presumption of denial” standard associated with Entity Listed companies, meaning applications are unlikely to be approved.

President Donald Trump surprised markets on Saturday with an announcement that U.S. companies would be allowed to sell products to Huawei [HWT.UL], which was placed on the so-called Entity List in May over national security concerns.

U.S. chipmakers, which had been seeking a carve-out for exports of less sensitive technology to the world’s top telecoms technology maker, welcomed the news.

But four days after Trump’s announcement on the sidelines of the G20 in Japan, industry and government officials were uncertain what the new policy will be.

“It seems like nobody has made up their mind as to what the policy is and, as a result, nothing’s changing,” said Douglas Jacobson, an international trade lawyer.

“There’s even less change than we anticipated if we’re still applying the presumption of denial,” Jacobson added, noting that he’s advising clients not to even apply for a license because it’s not worth their time and money under that review policy.

In an email to enforcement staff on Monday, seen by Reuters, John Sonderman, deputy director of the Office of Export Enforcement in the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, sought to clarify how agents should approach license requests by firms seeking approval to sell to Huawei.

All such applications should be considered on merit, he wrote, citing regulations that include the “presumption of denial” licensing policy.

The Commerce Department spokesman said on Wednesday that the department intends to notify companies of decisions on export license applications once the review is complete.

White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said earlier this week that the government would allow “lower tech” chip sales that do not impact national security, echoing similar comments from National Economic Council Chairman Larry Kudlow.

The United States has accused Huawei of stealing American intellectual property and violating Iran sanctions.

It has launched a lobbying effort to convince U.S. allies to keep Huawei out of next-generation 5G telecommunications infrastructure, citing concerns the company could spy on customers. Huawei has denied the allegations."

Justice Department watchdog to investigate decision to cancel FBI headquarters plan,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"[""Jonathan O'Connell"", 'Reporter Covering Economic Development With A Focus On Commercial Real Estate', 'The Trump Organization']",07-03-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/justice-department-watchdog-to-investigate-decision-to-cancel-fbi-headquarters-plan/2019/07/03/76971d76-9d85-11e9-9ed4-c9089972ad5a_story.html,"The Justice Department’s inspector general will investigate the FBI’s role in dropping plans a decade in the making to move its headquarters to the Washington suburbs, he told Congress in a letter Tuesday.

The inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, told House committee leaders that he is initiating a review of actions at the DOJ and FBI that led to the canceling of the plans in favor of building a smaller replacement for the J. Edgar Hoover Building downtown and dispersing other FBI staff elsewhere.

The review could produce new revelations about the Trump administration’s stunning reversal of bipartisan plans for the development of a new, highly secure campus that would have gotten the bureau out of the fast-deteriorating Hoover building.

Democratic leaders of two committees, Elijah E. Cummings (Md.) and Gerald E. Connolly (Va.) of the Oversight Committee and Peter A. DeFazio (Ore.) and Dina Titus (Nev.) of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, have pressed Horowitz to investigate. They redoubled their efforts after the head of the General Services Administration was found by her agency’s inspector general to have made potentially misleading comments to Congress about the White House’s involvement in the decision-making.

Democrats allege that Trump used the decision to put his own financial interests ahead of the needs of the FBI and taxpayers, which administration officials deny. The GSA is the landlord to Trump’s D.C. hotel, located just down the street from the Hoover building, and redeveloping the Hoover site could introduce a new hotel competitor. Trump also told The Washington Post before running for office that he was considering bidding for the FBI project as well.

Under Trump, the FBI and GSA have both resisted responding to document requests made by Democrats on the Hill, though in a statement GSA officials said the agency “has produced more than 90,000 pages in response to respective Congressional Committee requests on FBI and the Old Post Office building since 2017.”

In a statement, the House committee leaders said: “For months, our Committees have investigated the Administration’s sudden change of heart on a federal property across the street from the President’s namesake hotel, but because the FBI has withheld key decision-making documents from Congress, we have been left with many unanswered questions.”

In April testimony to Congress, FBI Director Christopher A. Wray defended the decision to keep the headquarters in downtown Washington and reaffirmed it as his preference. “It is absolutely the FBI’s view, the FBI’s choice, the FBI’s preference to build a new building . . . at our current location,” he said.

For a decade before Trump’s election, the FBI had been working with the GSA and Congress on the suburban headquarters plan. Citing security concerns with staying downtown and the lack of large development sites nearby, the FBI and GSA pursued large plots of land near the Capital Beltway and suburban Metro stations, ultimately narrowing its search to sites in Greenbelt and Landover in Maryland and Springfield, Va.

But six months into the Trump administration, the FBI and GSA ditched those plans and then last year announced they preferred to keep a smaller downtown headquarters and move 2,300 headquarters staff members out of the Washington area altogether — to Alabama, Idaho and West Virginia.

GSA chief Emily Murphy testified that Wray — not Trump or a White House official — asked that the FBI remain downtown if possible, downplaying any White House role in the decision-making.

The FBI backed her assertion, but the inspector general found that Murphy’s testimony was incomplete and possibly misleading about the White House’s involvement, including an Oval Office meeting with Trump about the project that she omitted. Murphy denied misleading Congress, maintaining that the decision about where to put the FBI was made before that meeting.

The GSA maintains that the government could see cost savings under the new plan, but federal real estate experts have said the government’s expectations of cost savings weren’t likely to come true based on unrealistic expectations on the administration’s part about how little its plan will cost. The GSA inspector general found that the Trump administration plan could cost hundreds of millions of dollars more and accommodate 2,300 fewer employees.

Correction: This story has been updated to correctly characterize the GSA inspector general’s findings about Emily Murphy’s testimony. The IG found that her comments may have been misleading but did not conclude that she actively misled Congress."

USDA offers a helping hand to dairy farmers,https://hoards.com,[],,,,https://hoards.com/article-25850-usda-offers-a-helping-hand-to-dairy-farmers.html,"Dairy farming invokes a nostalgic image in America among many folks in my generation: Lots of farms were diversified and had a handful of dairy cows to supply the family’s milk and feed the hogs, but those times have changed. Anyone even partially connected to the dairy industry knows it has been economically challenging for our nation’s dairy farmers. In fact, the dairy industry is now in its fifth consecutive year of low prices, which — at least in part — prompted more than 2,700 dairy farms to go out of business in 2018 alone.

While the economy is certainly booming, and the stock market is reflective of that, agricultural markets tend to work in reverse. Input costs such as fuel, seed, and fertilizer are all higher when the national Gross Domestic Product or GDP is growing and result in less take-home pay for our farmers.

Sign-ups are underway

To help relieve some of the stress and remove some of the unpredictability of dairy farming, the 2018 Farm Bill, a major priority for both Congress and President Trump, included a new program to help farmers manage the inherent risk. Sign-up for USDA’s Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) program began June 17 — coincidentally in the middle of National Dairy Month. The DMC program offers protection to dairy farmers when the difference between the All-Milk price and the average feed cost, known as the margin, falls below a certain dollar amount selected by the farmer. It could be likened to insurance for milk revenue and feed cost.

Reduced coverage costs

This new DMC program has lower premiums and higher levels of assistance than predecessor safety net programs, providing coverage retroactive to January 1, 2019, with payments following soon after enrollment. At the time of sign-up, which runs through September 20, dairy farmers can choose coverage levels from $4 up to $9.50 per hundredweight of milk.

For a $9 coverage level, for example, payments would be triggered for January, February, March, and April, when the margins for each month fell below that amount.

To help dairy farmers determine the best amount of coverage to purchase, the Department offers a decision tool, found through www.farmers.gov, to help evaluate various scenarios using different coverage levels.

Receive a discount

Additional flexibilities have been included by USDA. Producers who lock-in coverage for five years earn a 25 percent discount on their premiums. We are also providing reimbursement or credit options for farmers who participated and paid premiums into the predecessor safety net program, Margin Protection Program for Dairy (MPP-Dairy). And we have built in feed prices that better reflect what dairy producers are using across the country, such as premium alfalfa hay.

Looking long term

Of course, USDA’s support for the dairy industry goes beyond this safety-net program. Under the leadership of President Trump and my direct boss, Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue, we’re working to address systemic trade imbalances that have hurt the agricultural sector. President Trump is responding to trade damage from unjustified tariff retaliation and trade disruption by committing up to $16 billion in support for farmer programs, including purchasing commodities, like milk, for food banks and school lunches.

A new NAFTA

The best way to help reverse the downward trend in milk prices is to open new markets. The Department is investing hundreds of millions in foreign market promotion and development across the world, but even better would be the passage of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) by Congress. This new agreement will eliminate Canada’s unfair “Class 6” and “Class 7” milk pricing schemes, in which Canada has used low-priced products to undercut U.S. dairy sales in Canada and other international markets. The deal will also crack open additional access for U.S. dairy into Canada, including products like fluid milk, cream, butter, skim milk, and cheese.

The dairy industry is an important part of the past and the present of American agriculture. Many of the country’s 37,000 dairy farms are family-owned, and more than 3 million jobs are supported, with $38 billion in direct wages for workers, by the U.S. dairy industry. It’s worth protecting.

With a more robust safety net, USDA is making sure America’s dairy farmers can continue to flourish.

Under Secretary Northey oversees USDA’s Farm Production and Conservation mission area, including the Farm Service Agency, which administers the new Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) program. He is a fourth-generation farmer from Iowa and previously spent more than 10 years serving as the Iowa Secretary of Agriculture.
