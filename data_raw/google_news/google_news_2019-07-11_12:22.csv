Trump moves into damage control mode (just like every other politician),https://www.foxnews.com,"['Howard Kurtz', 'Howard Kurtz Is A Fox News Analyst', 'The Host Of']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-moves-into-damage-control-mode-just-like-every-other-politician,"When the British ambassador to Washington was caught disparaging President Trump in cables back to London, everyone knew what happened next would be rather undiplomatic.

The president Twitter-taunted “wacky” Kim Darroch, and said he’d refuse to deal with him, even though his job was to give candid advice, and he never intended the harsh assessments of Trump to become public. Sir Kim quickly resigned, saying it had become impossible for him to do his job.

But there was this telling line from the president: “I don’t know the Ambassador but have been told he is a pompous fool.”

Well, Trump did know Theresa May’s envoy, and had dealt with him in a number of meetings. It’s rather obvious that he was distancing himself from someone who was now trashing him.

The distancing thing is one arrow in the damage-control backpack, one that nearly every politician uses at one time or another. When a campaign donor turns out to be a crook. When a top aide writes a derogatory book. Or, as in the case of Jeffrey Epstein, when an old friend turns out to be a pedophile.

The distancers have been breaking speed records with Epstein, who has been charged with sex trafficking after a sweetheart deal approved by Labor Secretary Alex Acosta back in 2008 all but let him off the hook for having sex with young girls.

Trump told reporters he had a “falling out” with Epstein and hasn’t spoken to him in 15 years. (The New York Times reported that a business associate was to bring 28 young women to Mar-a-Lago for a “calendar girl” competition, and was surprised that the only attendees were to be Trump and Epstein.)

Bill Clinton rushed out a statement that he had flown on Epstein’s private jet only four times, and visited him only on a couple of other occasions.

In the Beltway culture, distancing is a fine and much-practiced art.

The Washington Post says the Trump maneuver has become something of an insider joke among his advisers. With the Darroch dustup, “the rejoinder fit a familiar pattern for Trump, who is quick to minimize ties with people who criticize him or who find themselves facing an onslaught of negative attention that reflects poorly on the president.

“Among those who have gotten the ‘I barely know the guy’ treatment: Former acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker, conservative commentator Ann Coulter, former lawyer Michael Cohen, fired FBI director James B. Comey, former senior White House aide Stephen K. Bannon, former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, former State Department official Brett McGurk, longtime adviser Roger Stone, former White House aide Cliff Sims, former campaign aide George Papadopoulos and even the rapper Lil Jon, who starred on Trump’s reality TV show ‘Celebrity Apprentice.’”

That’s fair game. When Steve Bannon, who was Trump’s campaign chairman in the final stretch and White House senior adviser, left the fold, his ex-boss said: “Steve was rarely in a one-on-one meeting with me and only pretends to have had influence to fool a few people with no access and no clue, whom he helped write phony books.”

So the maneuver is executed not just with people who get mired in scandal but with those who suddenly turn on Trump. Remember Omarosa?

There are endless variations on the distancing act when an aide or confidant must be cut loose. I had no idea. Deeply disappointed. Just one of many advisers. If I had known I would have taken immediate action. I am demanding a full investigation.

"ICE deportation raids set to begin Sunday after Trump delay, report says",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Edmund Demarche', 'Edmund Demarche Is A News Editor For Foxnews.Com. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ice-deportation-raids-to-start-sunday-report,"Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are preparing to conduct raids beginning Sunday to arrest thousands of illegal immigrants across the U.S. just weeks after President Trump announced that he was delaying the operation.

The ICE agents will target at least 2,000 immigrants whose deportations have already been ordered, a New York Times report said, citing one former and two current Department of Homeland Security officials.

Asked for comment, an ICE spokesman would not offer specific details, citing ""law-enforcement sensitivities and the safety and security of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel.""

""As always, ICE prioritizes the arrest and removal of unlawfully present aliens who pose a threat to national security, public safety and border security. ... However, all of those in violation of the immigration laws may be subject to immigration arrest, detention and – if found removable by final order – removal from the United States,"" the spokesman said.

BORDER APPREHENSIONS DECLINE 28 PERCENT FOLLOWING US-MEXICO PARTNERSHIP, DHS SAYS

Ken Cuccinelli, acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, told reporters Wednesday that the raids are “going to happen.” He did not elaborate.

The Times report said the raids will include ""collateral"" deportations, which means illegal immigrants at the scene of the raid who are not the target of the raid could be detained.

The June operation was expected to target 2,000 families in as many as 10 cities, including Chicago, Baltimore, New York, Houston, Los Angeles and Miami. Last month, President Trump announced on Twitter that he wants ICE agents to start the process of “removing the millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the U.S.”

But Trump later delayed the sweeps, saying he would give lawmakers two weeks to work out solutions for securing the U.S.-Mexico border. The decision came after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi contacted Trump, requesting that he call off the raids.

But three administration officials told the Associated Press that scrapping the operation was not just about politics.

They said ICE leaders had expressed serious concerns that officers’ safety would be in jeopardy because too many details about the raids had been made public."
Donald Trump earns place in history with how America treats migrant children,https://www.usatoday.com,"['The Editorial Board', 'Usa Today', 'Published P.M. Et July']",07-10-2019,2019,7,https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/07/10/donald-trump-earns-history-treats-migrant-kids-editorials-debates/1682791001/,"CLOSE

At a detention center, kids have gone hungry and without beds. They've seen outbreaks of scabies, shingles and chickenpox. For those watching, this is what a national disgrace looks like: Our view

On a subject as fraught as immigration, there's plenty of room for disagreement about border security, workplace enforcement, paths to citizenship and other policies. But when the topic is the well-being of kids crammed into federal immigration centers on the southern border, there ought to be no room for debate.

For young children, toddlers and infants guilty only of being carried or led into the United States, it's unconscionable for federal officials to banish them for days or weeks to squalor.

At the facility in Clint, Texas, according to a report by The New York Times and the El Paso Times (which is part of the USA TODAY Network), children have gone hungry and without hygiene, beds, adults to care for them. They've been buffeted by outbreaks of scabies, shingles and chickenpox.

Adult migrants, many fleeing Central American violence for asylum in the USA, are crammed for days or weeks in holding cells designed for a fraction of their number. The stench in standing-room-only conditions with temperatures in the 80s is a mix of unwashed bodies, untreated diarrhea and urine. That's according to the Department of Homeland Security's own internal watchdog, known as an inspector general.

For those watching, this is what a national disgrace looks like.

And how has President Donald Trump responded? With his characteristic deflection and denial. (""We're doing a fantastic job under the circumstances."") Border officials concede it's a crisis, albeit exaggerated by monitors and media, and they're simply overwhelmed by a 124% increase in migrants over the previous year.

HOMELAND SECURITY: We've done all we could with limited resources

Maybe so, but border officers warned superiors for months that detention conditions were crashing — to no avail. Only when the inhumanity was exposed in photographs, news accounts and rushed inspector general reports did officials suddenly begin finding alternative housing for about 2,000 confined children.

Some of Trump's tough-guy policies for staunching the flow of migrants have only made matters worse. When he ""meters"" lawful asylum seeking at ports of entry down to a trickle, desperate migrants find other ways to enter the country. When he starts threatening deportation of U.S. residents willing to sponsor child migrants, sponsorship declines and children languish in holding cells. And when he cancels or limits programs that allow for release of migrants into the community wearing ankle bracelets or under successful community supervision programs, they're consigned to fetid, standing-room only cells.

Trump declared an end to his family separation policy last year, falsely claiming it began under President Barack Obama. But strangely, inspectors still find young children held without parents, raising the question of whether another new Trump policy, of using flawed evidence of gang affiliation to separate families, is making matters worse. After a decade of not a single death, at least seven migrant children have died under federal care since December.

Thankfully, the number of children in custody has eased of late. Housing for adults has expanded with the use of tents, and $4.6 billion in congressional funding will provide further relief.

Going forward, Congress could help safeguard children by:

►Creating a multiagency, pilot program to compassionately process children and families.

►Allowing lawmakers to visit sites without advance notice.

►Establishing medical care standards for children and adults in custody.

►Providing best-practices training for border officers.

For now, there's lasting damage — to the children. Many already traumatized by violence they fled in their home countries risk severe mental health consequences after being separated from parents and subjected to squalor in U.S. immigration centers.

""Most kids will have lasting scars from what they have seen or are enduring,"" Harvard Medical School psychiatrist and bioethicist Wes Boyd, who has studied asylum seekers, told Axios.

Trump covets a place in history. With his administration's cruelty toward Central American migrants, he might well have earned it.

Ted Cruz tells Trump administration to 'follow the damn law' on foreign arms sales,https://www.cnn.com,"['Zachary Cohen', 'Jennifer Hansler']",07-10-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/10/politics/senate-frustration-trump-administration-arms-sale-emergency/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz had a simple message for the Trump administration during Wednesday's hearing on foreign arms sales: ""Follow the damn law.""

Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have been critical of the administration's decision to declare an emergency earlier this year in order to expedite billions of dollars in arms sales to various countries -- including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates -- but Cruz's particularly blunt warning about efforts to bypass Congress stands out due to his reputation as a polarizing figure on Capitol Hill.

Cruz said he supports the administration's underlying reason for selling arms to regional partners. He voted against a joint resolution disapproving of the proposed sales in late June. However, on Wednesday he issued a scathing rebuke of how the situation was handled while grilling Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs R. Clarke Cooper during the Senate Foreign Relations hearing.

""I voted with the administration on the substance because of the threat of Iran but I'll tell you from my end, if the administration does it again and there is not a live and exigent emergency, you will not have my vote and I predict you will not have the vote of a number of other Republicans as well. The simpler process is follow the damn law and respect it,"" Cruz said.

""The process that the State Department followed for these weapons sales, not to point too fine a point on it, was crap,"" he added. ""Under the law, under the Arms Export Control Act, the administration needs congressional approval and has a 30-day notification period. And for whatever reason, the administration in what seems to me a not fully baked decision process, decided to circumvent the law, decided to circumvent the constitutional responsibility of Congress and act unilaterally.""

Broken Promises: Teachers Sue U.S. Over Student Loans That Weren't Forgiven,https://www.npr.org,['Chris Arnold'],07-11-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/2019/07/11/739860400/broken-promises-teachers-sue-u-s-over-student-loans-that-werent-forgiven,"Broken Promises: Teachers Sue U.S. Over Student Loans That Weren't Forgiven

Debbie Baker thought she qualified for a federal program that helps teachers such as her, as well as nurses, police officers, librarians and others. The Department of Education program forgives their federal student loans if they make their payments for 10 years and work in public service.

For 10 years, Baker, who was a public school teacher in Tulsa, Okla., checked in with loan servicing companies and was told she was on track.

""I said, 'I'm qualifying for public service loan forgiveness,' and they said, 'OK, great,' "" she says.

But it turns out that her $76,000 in student loans didn't get forgiven. Baker was finally told she was in the wrong type of loan. If she'd known that at the beginning, she could have switched loans and ended up qualifying. But she says nobody ever told her.

""When this hit ... I didn't know whether to cry, throw up, get mad,"" she says. ""I honestly did not think the federal government would do this to someone.""

Now, Baker is a plaintiff in a lawsuit being brought by one of the biggest teachers unions in the country against the Department of Education. The suit alleges the loan forgiveness program for millions of public service workers is in such a shambles that it violates federal law and the Constitution.

The American Federation of Teachers is planning to file the lawsuit Thursday in federal court. In a draft of the complaint obtained by NPR, the union is asking the court to order the department to fix the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program so that it meets legal standards. It's also asking the department to come up with an appeals process for people who believe they have been treated unfairly.

Congress created the program more than a decade ago to encourage public service. So, if you make loan payments for 10 years and you work in a qualifying job for the government or a nonprofit, the program promises to forgive the remainder of your federal student loan debt.

That promise sounded really good to a lot of people. More than 1 million have filed official paperwork to take part in the program. But there's a problem.

""The promise is broken, virtually all the time,"" says Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers. ""This is a debacle.""

Plenty of consumer watchdogs agree.

""The Department of Education just cannot seem to get this right,"" says Christopher Peterson, a law professor at the University of Utah and a former top attorney at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. ""They keep making mistakes and are not appropriately administering this program that Congress has created.""

By the department's last count, only 1% of the people who think they've made their 10 years of payments and apply for loan forgiveness are getting approved.

If you took all the people getting rejected and got them together in one place, Peterson says, you'd have ""football stadiums full of nurses, firefighters, teachers, law enforcement officers that are seeking to have their debts forgiven.""

He says they've made ""all of these payments under the impression that they were on track, and now they're being turned away in droves.""

As happened with Debbie Baker, if a student loan borrower is in the wrong type of loan, or the wrong type of repayment plan, they can't qualify for loan forgiveness. The teachers union lawsuit alleges that the Department of Education ""knows of — but completely disregards — repeated misrepresentations made by Title IV servicers to borrowers who are attempting to qualify ... resulting in unwarranted denials of loan forgiveness.""

In other words, people like Baker aren't given the right information or advice, and many end up in the wrong types of loans or repayment plans and get unfairly disqualified. Government reports and investigations have found similar problems with borrowers getting bad information.

The lawsuit also alleges that loan servicers are having trouble keeping track of the number of qualifying payments people make — even when they are in the correct loan and payment plan and manage to do everything right.

Weingarten says the program is hurting the very people it's supposed to help. ""It is so broken, it is so unfair that it violates our basic United States Constitution requirement of due process,"" she says.

Another problem with borrowers getting rejected after many years of thinking they were on track is that many make life decisions based on the expectation of loan forgiveness.

Janelle Menzel is a high school math teacher in Brainerd, Minn. She says people would ask her: ""You have a degree in math, why are you teaching?"" She says they would tell her she could make ""so much more money in the private sector.""

Menzel says she loves teaching. And she thought she was going to get her student loans forgiven, so financially she decided it made sense. ""Oh yeah, definitely. That was a factor in it,"" she says.

But just like Baker, Menzel says that after 10 years of making payments, she was told by her loan servicer that she was in the wrong type of federal loan and couldn't qualify.

If a call center worker had told her that 10 years before, she easily could have switched into the right kind of loan. But she says nobody ever told her. And so that never happened.

She remembers after contacting her loan servicer repeatedly, trying to find a way to appeal, a call center worker told her, ""Look, you just need to give up.""

""And I remember sitting at the table watching my kids running around and playing and just thinking, man, I am stuck with this now,"" Menzel says. Thoughts of ""the freedom that would come with being released of the student loan debt kind of came crashing in in that moment,"" she adds.

Congress passed a partial fix, called Temporary Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness, that was designed to help at least some borrowers. But the teachers union lawsuit alleges the Department of Education ""has mismanaged [that program] as well."" As of March 2019, only 3.6% of applications for that new program have been approved.

The Department of Education has not yet commented on the lawsuit.

Navient, one of the nation's largest loan servicer companies, is not commenting on the lawsuit. But the company said in a statement to NPR, ""We understand the frustration borrowers face in navigating a complex federal loan program, which is why we consistently advocate for policy reforms to simplify the system.""

The Department of Education recently implemented a dramatic fix to a different program, TEACH Grants, that's now returning grant money to thousands of people who had grants taken away unfairly.

NPR is looking for people who have had problems qualifying for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Share your story in the form below, or here:"

Opinion writer

President Trump’s labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, is under intense pressure to resign over his past role in a soft plea deal for financier Jeffrey Epstein, now that Epstein has been indicted on child sex trafficking charges. It’s not clear whether Acosta will survive, but Trump does seem to be trying to keep him on board, to see if it’s possible to weather the resulting political storm.

In this context, it’s fitting that a new account has emerged of Trump’s own biggest brush with political death over his own sexual misconduct: the controversy over the “Access Hollywood” tape, in which Trump boasted of repeatedly committing sexual assault with impunity.

The new account of that affair — which shows that to a greater degree than previously known, leading Republicans privately thought Trump had disqualified himself, only to abruptly fall in line behind him — is deeply revealing as to Trump’s grasp of today’s GOP, and more broadly is depressingly symbolic of today’s culture of elite impunity.

Acosta has defended his handling of the Epstein case as U.S. attorney in Florida — in which Epstein ended up doing a scant 13 months for sex crimes — arguing it was the best prosecutors could do. But calls for his resignation are mounting. The Miami Herald, which revealed many questionable details about the case, just excoriated Acosta for failing to show “an ounce of sympathy for the vulnerable girls Epstein sexually exploited.”

Trump says he feels “very badly” for Acosta. Two senior officials tell the New York Times that support for Acosta could quickly disappear if more emerges, and CNN reports that Acosta’s fate may turn on what Trump thinks of the “media coverage” of the controversy.

All of this basically means Trump is trying to see whether he can keep Acosta on. Which brings us to the new revelations about the “Access Hollywood” tape.

Politico Magazine has published an excerpt from a forthcoming book about Trump and the GOP by journalist Tim Alberta. In it, Alberta reports the following:

After the tape became public, scores of top Republican lawmakers, donors and activists — far more than did so publicly — privately urged then-Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus to push Trump out and replace him with Vice President Pence at the top of the ticket. This included then-House Speaker Paul Ryan.

Pence hunkered down and prayed with his wife, Karen, who furiously warned him that she would no longer appear in public if Pence remained Trump’s running mate. Pence hinted to advisers that he might have to stop campaigning with Trump.

But the key revelation is what happened next. At the next debate with Hillary Clinton, Trump ferociously attacked back, blasting Bill Clinton’s history with women and even threatening to unleash law enforcement on Hillary Clinton, saying that with him as president, Clinton would “be in jail.”

Alberta recounts what then transpired:

Within 48 hours the bleeding had stopped: Republicans ceased their calls for his withdrawal, Pence dutifully returned to the stump and his campaign went on as though nothing had happened.

With this, Trump displayed a remarkable, if perhaps instinctual, grasp of how to survive in today’s GOP. While he did issue a video apology, what really rescued Trump was going ferociously on the attack, which crucially included threatening to put the real enemy in prison.

Timothy L. O’Brien, who wrote a biography of Trump, told me this gut instinct on Trump’s part goes back to his earliest days, and is a function of his worldview, which O’Brien described as “eat or be eaten.”

“Trump’s view that life has only winners and losers comes directly from his father,” O’Brien said. “Fred Trump came through the rough-and-tumble of early- to mid-20th century real estate industry and clubhouse Democratic politics in New York. It was a ruthless, eat-or-be-eaten world.”

“Fred channeled that into Donald with full force,” O’Brien continued, adding that Donald Trump “came out of the gates with this predatory worldview, wedded to the substantial amount of money that his father gave him.” That inherited fortune, of course, was enhanced and protected by massive and extensive father-and-son tax fraud.

Speaking of predators, Epstein, who clawed his way into jet-setting global elites from very humble New York beginnings, just as Fred Trump did, stands accused of an extraordinary array of crimes, including creating a network of girls for him to abuse at will, some of them potentially being under age.

As Michelle Goldberg argues, Epstein’s light sentence the first time, combined with the fact that the architect of that sentence remains as labor secretary, exposes a culture in which “the very rich” often enjoy “impunity for the most loathsome of crimes.”

That culture of impunity, of course, involves both major parties and many industries outside of politics. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has signaled that Democrats will not take investigative action against Acosta, a baffling and inexplicable decision.

Still, Democrats have of late been more aggressive in policing sexual misconduct in their ranks than Republicans have been. And Pelosi — and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer — have called on Acosta to resign, something we’re not hearing from many Republicans.

In all kinds of ways, of course, Trump himself demonstrates how deeply the culture of impunity has penetrated the GOP. We’ve seen bottomless self-dealing and a refusal to show minimal transparency on his business holdings; extensive and potentially criminal efforts to derail the Russia investigation; the refusal to hold the Saudis accountable for the dismembering of Jamal Khashoggi; maximal resistance to any and all congressional oversight; the turning loose of Attorney General William P. Barr on his political critics; Acosta’s potential survival; and so much more — much of it with nary a peep from Republicans.

What Trump seems to have developed here is a kind of full-saturation, totally unabashed flaunting of impunity as something to be worn as a badge of honor. In retrospect, that remarkable closing of ranks behind Trump despite the lewd video foreshadowed much of what we’re seeing now.

Former State Department employee sentenced to 40 months for taking gifts from Chinese intelligence,https://www.cnn.com,['David Shortell'],07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/09/politics/state-department-chinese-spies-sentenced/index.html,"Washington (CNN) A former State Department employee was sentenced to more than three years in prison Tuesday after she pleaded guilty in April to trading sensitive information with Chinese intelligence officers in exchange for lavish gifts.

Candace Claiborne, who had worked for the State Department in countries across the globe since 1999, will also face three years of supervised release and a fine of $40,000, according to the US Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia.

""The targeting of U.S. security clearance holders by Chinese intelligence services is a constant threat we face, and today's sentencing shows that those who betray the trust of the American people will be held accountable for their actions,"" said John P. Selleck, the acting assistant director of the FBI's Washington field office.

Claiborne was charged in 2017 with taking gifts -- including electronics, vacations and a fully-furnished apartment, as well tuition payments to a Chinese fashion school for a family member -- from two Chinese officials. She was also charged with lying about her interactions with the officials on clearance forms and in interviews with government background investigators.

According to plea documents, Claiborne met with the intelligence officials monthly while on a posting in China and on multiple occasions handed over manila envelopes stuffed with printed cables, white papers and other non-public documents about the movements and discussions of US diplomats.

Susana Martinez said Wednesday on ""Outnumbered"" that getting rid of the Department of Homeland Security - as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez recently suggested - is ""pure insanity"" and would put the country at risk.

""Homeland Security was created in order to keep America safe, it was created after 9/11. I just think Ocasio-Cortez is into the shock and awe. She wants to make a statement and be ahead of everything,"" said Martinez, who served as the state's Republican governor from 2011 to 2019.

Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., made her remarks during a Friday appearance on the New Yorker Radio with host David Remnick, bringing up the fact that Immigration and Customs Enforcement is under DHS.

“Would you get rid of the Department of Homeland Security, too?” Remnick asked.

“I think so. I think we need to undo a lot of the egregious, umm, a lot of the egregious mistakes that the Bush administration did,"" said Ocasio-Cortez, who has championed the elimination of ICE.

Martinez said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is trying to balance the party and keep the focus away from Ocasio-Cortez's ""far left"" ideas before the 2020 presidential election.

Panelist Charlie Hurt said it was ""amazing"" that Pelosi, D-Calif., used to be on the far left of the Democratic Party, and is now seeming like the ""center of her party.""

""Joe Biden used to be the center of the party. Now he's on the right-wing fringe of his party and it's not healthy for the Democrats,"" said Hurt, joking that Ocasio-Cortez and other liberal freshmen members should call themselves ""the committee to re-elect Donald Trump"" because their policy ideas could hurt Democrats in 2020."
Justice Department trying to quash Mueller team testimony,https://www.reuters.com,"['David Morgan', 'Min Read']",07-11-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia/u-s-justice-department-trying-to-quash-mueller-team-testimony-report-idUSKCN1U51JJ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department is trying to prevent two former members of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team from testifying behind closed doors in Congress next week, when Mueller will testify before lawmakers, according to people familiar with the matter.

The department is opposing testimony by Aaron Zebley and James Quarles before the Democratic-led Judiciary and Intelligence committees in the House of Representatives, two sources said.

The men were expected to testify on July 17, the same day that Mueller is due as a witness before the two panels.

Democrats said they still expect Zebley and Quarles to appear, arguing that the Justice Department has no authority over the behavior of former employees. But a third source told Reuters that the former Mueller team members were still negotiating with the committees.

“We expect them to appear,” Representative Zoe Lofgren, a Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee, told reporters. “We’ve got two hours with the Judiciary and Mr. Mueller, and two hours for the Intel committee with Mr. Mueller, and then some time afterwards with his staff.”

Justice Department officials had no immediate comment and Zebley and Quarles could not be reached for comment.

The episode is the latest example of Trump administration efforts to stymie congressional investigations by directing current and former officials not to cooperate with investigators who are seeking evidence of corruption, obstruction of justice and abuse of power in the Trump presidency.

Democrats plan to attack the administration’s blocking tactics this month with a federal lawsuit. In preparation for court action, the committee on Wednesday told the White House in a letter that it rejected immunity claims that prompted one former Trump aide to refuse to answer more than 200 questions.

The panel gave White House officials until July 17 to produce a revised list of objections.

House Judiciary Committee Democrats, who are poised to expand their probe of Trump, his family and associates with a slew of new subpoenas, say Mueller’s testimony will focus public attention on some of the more disturbing findings of his two-year investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

In a 448-page report, Mueller said the Trump campaign had numerous contacts with Moscow, though the investigation did not find sufficient evidence to show conspiracy.

He did not conclude that Trump obstructed justice by trying to impede the Russia probe, but also did not exonerate the president of doing so.

The House Judiciary Committee is also investigating alleged hush payments during the 2016 campaign to two women who claimed to have affairs with Trump, including porn star Stormy Daniels.

“The Dems Witch Hunt continues!” Trump said in a tweet on Wednesday. He has regularly denounced the Mueller investigation while also claiming that the probe found “no collusion” with Russia and “no obstruction.”

Judiciary Committee Democrats privately met on Wednesday to discuss details of conducting the Mueller hearing and his aides’ testimony. Lawmakers emerging from the session said arrangement were still in flux.

Mueller, in his first public comments since starting his investigation, said on May 29 that Justice Department policies meant the probe was never going to end with criminal charges against Trump, and indicated it was up to Congress to decide whether he should be impeached.

“If we had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so,” Mueller said."
State Dept. Intelligence Analyst Quits to Protest Blocked House Testimony,https://www.nytimes.com,['Coral Davenport'],07-10-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/climate/rod-schoonover-resigns.html,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.

WASHINGTON — A State Department intelligence analyst has resigned in protest after the White House blocked his discussion of climate science in Congressional testimony, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Rod Schoonover, an analyst with the State Department’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research, testified last month before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence on the effects of climate change on national security. But, in a highly unusual move, the White House refused to approve Dr. Schoonover’s written testimony for entry into the permanent Congressional record.

The reasoning, according to a June 4 email reviewed by The New York Times, was that the science cited in Dr. Schoonover’s testimony did not correspond with White House views. Ultimately, Dr. Schoonover did deliver the oral testimony before the committee, but his accompanying written statement was not included in the official record of the hearing.

Dr. Schoonover did not respond to text message requesting comment. A policy expert familiar with his case confirmed that his resignation came as a direct result of the episode. His last day is expected to be Friday."
DOE may have mistakenly shipped dangerous nuclear materials to Nevada,https://www.reviewjournal.com,"['Las Vegas Review-Journal', 'The Associated Press']",07-10-2019,2019,7,https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/nevada/doe-may-have-mistakenly-shipped-dangerous-nuclear-materials-to-nevada-1707928/,"The U.S. Department of Energy may have mistakenly shipped “reactive” nuclear material that was incorrectly labeled into Nevada.

The U.S. Department of Energy may have mistakenly shipped “reactive” nuclear material that was incorrectly labeled as low-level radioactive waste into Nevada in dozens of shipments over the past six years.

The shipments started in 2013 and stopped in December 2018. They were supposed to send only low-level radioactive waste from the department’s Y-12 facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, to the Nevada National Security Site, roughly 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas, for secure disposal.

But on July 3, the Energy Department informed Nevada officials, that reactive material — which might be unstable under normal conditions and may have violent reactions when combined with other substances — may have been included in those shipments.

Gov. Steve Sisolak, as well as Nevada Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen, sent Energy Secretary Rick Perry a letter two days later spelling out their concerns. They also expressed frustration over the latest error, which comes on the heels of the department’s decision last year to ship a half-metric ton of weapons grade plutonium to the security site and not disclose it until months after the fact.

‘Egregious acts’

“These egregious acts — whether acts of negligence or indicative of something else — are unconscionable and have potentially put the health and safety of Nevadans and our environment at unacceptable risk,” the letter said.

A Department of Energy spokesperson said there were nine shipments during that time frame that included 32 total containers of waste. Earlier in the day state officials had said that they were originally told there were 32 total shipments, and that the revised numbers released by the Energy Department were “significantly different than the info provided during DOE’s briefing to Governor Sisolak.”

The Energy Department confirmed Wednesday that shipments sent to the security site were not in compliance with its waste acceptance criteria, but said they posed no safety or health risk.

“The components that were shipped pose no risk to the safety and health of the general public or workers at the facility at NNSS. The Department’s National Nuclear Security Administration has launched an internal investigation to determine how this went undetected for a six-year period,” the department said in a statement.

The DOE also said that planned future shipments from the Tennessee facility have been “temporarily suspended,” and that Perry has directed staff to initiate a department-wide assessment of all shipping policies and procedures.

Nevada’s congressional delegation condemned both the Energy Department and Perry Wednesday for the errors, with Rep. Dina Titus calling the shipments “a new low.”

“The level of incompetence at the Department of Energy is only matched by its dishonesty,” Titus said in a statement.

Rep. Steven Horsford went so far as to call for Perry to resign from his post.

“Secretary Perry has repeatedly disrespected the people of Nevada and eroded the public trust in his ability to abide by established rules for waste disposal. His failure to disclose these actions amount to their lying to a federal judge, our Nevada congressional delegation and our state’s governor repeatedly about his agency’s activities in our state. Secretary Perry must resign immediately,” Horsford said in a statement.

Cortez Masto and Rosen, in a joint statement, said they would work to hold the government accountable for the shipments.

“Yet again, the DOE has violated its mission, broken Nevadans’ trust and failed to follow its own compliance procedures,” the statement reads. “We intend to immediately determine whether the mixed waste shipped to Nevada poses a hazard to the health and safety of Nevadans and will take every action necessary to hold the DOE accountable.”

And Rep. Susie Lee weighed in as well. “The continued carelessness with our safety is exactly the concern of every Nevadan who is told that we should welcome the storage of nuclear waste in our own backyard,” she said. “It’s clear that the Department of Energy does not take Americans’ health, safety, or security into consideration before making decisions. On behalf of every Nevadan, I am demanding answers from the DOE about how this could possibly happen and demanding the swift removal of this material from our state.”

Top officials briefed

On Tuesday, the governor and members of his senior staff met with top federal officials, including National Nuclear Security Administration Administrator Lisa Gordon-Hagerty, for a pair of in-person briefings at the Energy Department’s North Las Vegas offices. One briefing was unclassified, while a subsequent classified meeting followed that only Sisolak and top Nevada Department of Environmental Protection officials were privy to.

Sisolak learned of the error in a phone call with Deputy Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette, who told the governor that the shipments had been incorrectly labeled and “may contain a reactive material,” according to the letter sent last week.

“Such waste has never been approved for disposal at the NNSS,” the letter said.

The security site has operated as a permanent disposal location for what the federal government classifies as low-level nuclear waste, which can include rags, clothing, construction debris, filters and other equipment contaminated through exposure to radioactive material.

The governor’s office said that the Energy Department has not yet confirmed that the shipments contained any reactive materials, which Sisolak’s office said “would trigger additional safety concerns and run afoul of existing state permits and federal statutes governing the waste disposal mission at NNSS.”

The site also takes in some “mixed low-level” waste, which contains both low-level waste and hazardous waste materials — things like garbage, sludge and other discarded solid waste materials — so long as the reactive material has been neutralized. The NNSS does not accept mixed waste with any sludge, liquids or pressurized vessels, according to the DOE spokesperson.

The spokesperson said that the canisters shipped from Tennessee contained what the department refers to as “squibs,” — small, pressurized devices designed to remotely cut wires — which violates the NNSS’ waste acceptance agreement.

Intended for separate facility

Because it includes hazardous material, the mixed-waste is supposed to be handled separately at a dedicated facility at the security site where it is processed. The mixed-level waste is buried in lined trenches as a precaution, whereas low-level waste is buried in unlined trenches.

But the shipments sent between 2013 and 2018 were not properly categorized, which means the the federal government does not know which were low-level waste and which possibly contained dangerous hazardous materials.

Beyond violating the site’s own waste acceptance criteria agreement, not knowing the type of waste that is being stored at the security site could be dangerous for the site’s estimated 3,000 employees as well as the surrounding ecosystem. Materials are classified as hazardous because they are “known to be harmful to human health and the environment when not managed properly, regardless of their concentrations,” according to the Environmental Protection Agency’s website.

Mining company rejects EPA order for Superfund cleanup work,https://www.denverpost.com,['The Associated Press'],07-10-2019,2019,7,https://www.denverpost.com/2019/07/10/epa-bonita-peak-superfund/,"DURANGO — A mining company says it won’t carry out cleanup work ordered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as part of a Superfund project in southwest Colorado.

The Durango Herald reported Wednesday that Sunnyside Gold Corp. sent the EPA a letter saying the company isn’t responsible for pollution flowing from inactive mines in the area.

The EPA wants Sunnyside to help pay for some of the initial investigations into the Bonita Peak Superfund cleanup, citing the company’s previous mining activity there.

The EPA says it will review Sunnyside’s letter before deciding its next step.

The Bonita Peak Superfund project includes the Gold King Mine, source of a 2015 spill that polluted rivers in Colorado, New Mexico and Utah. An EPA-led contractor inadvertently triggered the spill while excavating at the mine entrance.

Rep. Nunes on Christopher Steele's grilling by DOJ investigators: A lot of the dossier 'was just made up',https://www.foxnews.com,"['David Montanaro', 'David Montanaro Is An Editor With Fox News.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/devin-nunes-christopher-steele-dossier-fbi-questioning,"Rep. Devin Nunes, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said Tuesday he believes the public will soon see that much of the Trump-Russia dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele was ""made up.""

According to a New York Times report, FBI officials questioned one of Steele's sources and ""came to suspect that the man might have added his own interpretations to reports from his own sources that he passed on to Mr. Steele, calling into question the reliability of the information.""

Steele was interviewed as part of Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz's probe of how the FBI used the unverified dossier, including its role in obtaining a surveillance warrant against then-Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

AOC PUSHES BACK AT PELOSI, SAYS HOUSE SPEAKER'S BELITTLING OF PROGRESSIVES 'PUZZLING'

Reacting on ""Fox News @ Night,"" Nunes, R-Calif., said Steele refused to talk to the House Intelligence Committee while he served as chairman in 2017 and 2018.

""This is a man who made up this entire document. As you're starting to see it's unraveling, his sources are not real or if they are real they're second and third hand. So a lot of this is just made up out of whole cloth,"" said Nunes.

Shannon Bream then asked Nunes about a Politico report which suggested Steele's 16-hour grilling led to ""new and important information"" and could therefore ""dampen expectations among the president's allies who’ve claimed that Steele’s sensational dossier was used improperly by the bureau to 'spy' on the campaign.""

Nunes scoffed at that notion, saying either Steele had credible sources or he did not.

""The fact remains that they used that garbage that was paid for by a political campaign before a court,"" said Nunes, adding that there is information that is ""equally as bad or worse"" that has not been made public about Steele's work."
"Kim Jong-un believes Trump is ""different,"" State Dept's intelligence arm assesses",https://www.cbsnews.com,['Olivia Gazis'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kim-jong-un-believes-trump-is-different-state-depts-intelligence-arm-assesses/,"It's likely that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un continues to adhere to a deep-seated belief that the United States is seeking regime change in North Korea, but he is less convinced Washington will take military action and believes President Donald Trump is ""different,"" according to Ellen McCarthy, Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR).

""I can't say whether or not [Kim] likes or dislikes [President Trump], we don't know that,"" McCarthy said. ""But we definitely [have] assessed that he does look at the president and thinks this one is different.""

As head of INR – the oldest all-source U.S. intelligence agency, and among the smallest, within the 17-member community – McCarthy leads a cadre of about 250 analysts at the State Department who provide assessments to the secretary of state, relevant policymakers and the president.

North Korea is an area where it's ""particularly hard"" to arrive at a fulsome intelligence assessment, McCarthy said. ""We're really relying on media analysis and other intelligence to get a sense of – in terms of Kim Jong-un – how he thinks of us.""

But she added, ""I would say that, based on our understanding of the media and things that he has said, he really does think that the U.S. is looking for regime change, and that he does not believe we'll take military action, and that – I think he thinks – we cheat on agreements, and that we're not necessarily to be trusted in that regard.""

In an interview with Intelligence Matters host and CBS News senior national security contributor Michael Morell, McCarthy, who assumed her current post in January after more than two decades spent in a variety of roles in the intelligence community and private sector, said the ""different relationship"" Kim and Trump have forged may have lessened Kim's suspicions about certain U.S. objectives.

""I think in general, when you look at all these world leaders, they all think that [regime change is] what we want, and frankly that has been a goal in many of our previous operations,"" McCarthy said. ""I don't know if that is as heavy on [Kim's] mind as it was in the past,"" she said.

Trump and Kim's most recent face-to-face meeting took place late last month in the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas, roughly 30 hours after president Trump first tweeted an offer to ""say Hello"" to Kim. Once they shared a handshake, and to Kim's apparent glee, Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to, in about 20 paces, cross into North Korean territory.

While the three-hour visit generated worldwide headlines and wall-to-wall television coverage, it was unclear whether Trump's meeting yielded any more substantive progress in the nuclear talks, which have been stalled since the failed February summit in Hanoi.

And despite the consistently warm rhetoric exchanged by the two leaders, U.S. intelligence assessments about Kim's willingness to give up his nuclear weapons program remain unchanged. The 2019 Worldwide Threat Assessment said the intelligence community ""continues to assess that [North Korea] is unlikely to give up all of its WMD stockpiles, delivery systems, and production capabilities.""

""My sense is that that's still very much where our analysts lie,"" McCarthy said.

""But if all the intelligence is suggesting that this is what the intelligence says, we will give it to the policymaker,"" she continued. ""If they don't agree, they get to do that.""

""[A]n analyst is not losing a moment of sleep because of it, because it's our job to feed them the intelligence,"" McCarthy told Morell. ""It's their job to develop the policy.""

Homeland Security: We've done all we could with limited resources for migrant children,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Karen Tandy', 'Jayson Ahern', 'Robert C. Bonner', 'James R. Jones', 'Opinion Contributors', 'Published P.M. Et July']",07-10-2019,2019,7,https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/07/10/migrant-children-homeland-security-done-all-reasonably-could-editorials-debates/1699263001/,"CLOSE

To fix this immigration problem requires immediate changes to our laws, not just funding: Opposing view

Since last fall, the Department of Homeland Security has consistently stated that Border Patrol’s temporary holding spaces were not designed nor ever intended to detain the record numbers of migrants illegally crossing the border, including tens of thousands of unaccompanied children and families every month.

During multiple border trips, our panel consistently observed alarming conditions at holding facilities despite Border Patrol’s valiant efforts to feed, clothe and improve medical care for migrants, many of whom arrived diseased or ill from the perilous journey.

With dangerous, illegal border crossings continuously rising, in April our bipartisan panel of the Homeland Security Advisory Council issued its public report urging emergency funding and legislative fixes to address this surge and the nation’s broken immigration system.

Our recommendations included establishing temporary regional centers near the southwest border and another in Guatemala with sufficient living space, judges, security and medical support to humanely care for families and children and timely process their claims. Today, our panel still awaits congressional action on our emergency recommendations from April 16.

The numbers are staggering. This fiscal year, more than 266,000 children illegally crossed our border primarily from Central America, exceeding the past two fiscal years combined.

OUR VIEW: Trump earns place in history with how America treats migrant children

A report by the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General about crowded border holding facilities. (Photo: Andrew Harnik/AP)

Because of an outdated legal framework, there are few options for unaccompanied children from Central America. Under current law, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is prevented from keeping children together with close relatives who aren’t their parent or legal guardian. Only Congress can change that. Legally, these children cannot be repatriated back home nor can they simply be released into the interior of the USA. They must be transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for placement with a sponsor.

This year’s backlogs in transferring children ages 12 and under from Border Patrol custody to HHS did not exist last year. But, as the numbers of families and children illegally crossing the border repeatedly spiked to historic levels, it exceeded the fixed space and beds of HHS. That’s why, in April, federal agencies that had exhausted their budgets for housing children requested emergency funding to avoid this very crisis of children held at inadequate Border Patrol facilities.

Unfortunately, Congress didn’t pass emergency funding until June 27, almost two months later.

Based on our review, Homeland Security has done all it reasonably could with limited resources to care for children who should have been transferred from Border Patrol to HHS custody within 72 hours, and ideally for tender aged children within 24 hours. The Border Patrol did not cause this crisis; our broken immigration system did.

To fix this problem requires immediate changes to our laws, not just funding. With passage of the supplemental funding, Congress has demonstrated that it has the capacity to change the law if members have the will.

US Suspends Low-Level Radioactive Waste Shipments to Nevada,https://time.com,['Scott Sonner'],,,,https://time.com/5624166/nevada-radioactive-waste-shipments-rick-perry/,"(RENO, Nev.) — A Nevada congressman called for U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry’s resignation Wednesday after the department acknowledged multiple shipments of low-level radioactive waste to a site north of Las Vegas may have been mislabeled and out of compliance with safety regulations for years.

The department had announced earlier that shipments of the waste from Tennessee to Nevada have been suspended while it investigates whether the materials were “potentially mischaracterized” as the wrong category of low-level waste. Low-level waste can include equipment or worker’s clothing contaminated by exposure to radiation, while mixed low-level waste can include toxic metals.

Deputy Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette also has ordered a department-wide assessment of its “procedures and practices for packaging and shipping all radioactive waste types,” according to a memo.

Department spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes said none of the materials shipped to Nevada as early as 2013 from the Y-12 facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, posed any health or safety threats to workers or the public.

But she acknowledged the shipments slated for disposal at the Nevada National Security Site were not in compliance with the site’s acceptance criteria.

The department’s National Nuclear Security Administration has launched an internal investigation “to determine how this went undetected for a six-year period,” Hynes said in a statement on Wednesday.

The low-level waste material is unrelated to weapons-grade plutonium that the department secretly shipped to the same Nevada site last year from South Carolina and is currently at the center of a legal battle with the state of Nevada in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

But Rep. Steven Horsford, D-Nevada, said in calling for Perry to “resign immediately” that the new disclosure is further evidence that Nevada has been covertly “coerced” into illegally receiving nuclear materials “through negligence or outright trickery.”

Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak and other members of Nevada’s congressional delegation stopped short of demanding Perry resign but were equally critical of his department’s handling of the waste.

“The level of incompetence at the Department of Energy is only matched by its dishonesty,” Rep. Dina Titus, D-Nevada, said.

Sisolak said Brouillette telephoned him on July 3 to inform him that the department “has been shipping incorrectly labeled low-level waste” from Tennessee to Nevada.

Sisolak also released a letter he and Democratic Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen sent to Perry on July 5 expressing their concerns and demanding more details.

The Democratic governor said he was more fully briefed on the situation during both classified and unclassified meetings in Las Vegas on Tuesday with senior department officials, including Lisa Gordon-Hagerty, head of DOE’s National Nuclear Security Administration.

Sisolak said he originally was told the waste shipped out of compliance with the department’s criteria governing low-level waste disposal at the Nevada site included 32 total shipments that began in 2013 and ended last December. But his office clarified there were six shipments that included a total of 32 canisters.

Sisolak said the department hasn’t determined yet whether the material labeled as low-level waste may have included mixed low-level waste, which is regulated more stringently under state and federal guidelines and requires treatment prior to disposal.

For example, Sisolak said the Energy Department entered into a settlement agreement with the state in May after DOE was cited for accepting low-level radioactive waste at the Nevada site that was subsequently found to be contaminated with chromium at a toxicity level higher than is allowed by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act — “thereby rendering it a mixed, low-level radioactive waste.”

Hynes said Wednesday the department leadership first was notified on July 3 that certain shipments of waste managed by a contractor at the Y-12 facility failed to comply with the Nevada site’s criteria, and may have been “mischaracterized” as low-level waste.

“The components that were shipped have been disposed of in a safe and secure manner at the NNSS, and as a precaution, planned future shipments of components from Y-12 have been temporarily suspended,” she said.

Trump previously said he knew Epstein for 15 years and suggested he was well-acquainted with the financier.

""He's a lot of fun to be with,"" Trump said to New York Magazine in 2002. ""It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.""

Trump has since distanced himself from Epstein, who faces sex-trafficking charges from the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, where he faces a maximum sentence of 45 years in prison. The charging document alleges Epstein ""sexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girls at his homes in Manhattan, New York, and Palm Beach, Florida, among other locations.""

On Monday, Epstein appeared in court and pleaded not guilty.

White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said Trump has not had contact with Epstein ""in years and years and years.""

""And he, like everyone else, sees these charges, the description of these charges against Epstein, as completely unconscionable and obviously criminal,"" Conway added. ""Disgusting, really.""

Trump on Tuesday said Epstein was unavoidable as a prominent figure in the Palm Beach community: ""I was not a fan of his, that I can tell you.""

Pressure mounts against EPA's new FOIA rule,https://thehill.com,[],07-10-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/452425-pressure-mounts-on-epa-to-withdraw-new-foia-rule,"A Democratic lawmaker along with a group of nearly 40 media publications are raising concerns over a new Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) public information rule that could allow political officials more leeway to withhold requested documents.

In a letter sent Tuesday evening, Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.) asked EPA chief Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerOvernight Energy: Trump doesn't mention climate change in speech touting environmental policies | Green groups fight EPA's new FOIA rule | Trump emissions rollback hit with legal challenge Trump touts environmental policies, but says nothing of climate change Environmental groups fight EPA's new FOIA rule MORE to review and revise the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) rule, which she argues shrouds the process in secrecy and failed to go through the typical public comment period.

“Government transparency is central to our democracy. At a time when climate change threatens our communities, public access to the government’s work to address this crisis is essential,” Porter wrote. ADVERTISEMENT

“The rule, as published by EPA, will make the public process for accessing information more opaque. It is particularly concerning that the EPA chose to write this rule without public input.”

The Hill was first to report on the finalized rule change, submitted to the public record at the end of June without public comment.

“Before choosing to substantially and formally change the FOIA process at EPA, members of the public should be afforded the opportunity to weigh in with the agency regarding this proposal,” Porter wrote.

The agency has argued it did not need to put the rule through a public comment period, pointing to several procedural exemptions.

“It is routine for agencies to update their FOIA regulations to reflect self-executing statutory provisions,"" a senior EPA FOIA official told The Hill.

According to the new language in the EPA’s FOIA rule, the administrator and other officials would be allowed to review all materials that fit a FOIA request criteria, known as responsive documents, and then decide “whether to release or withhold a record or a portion of a record on the basis of responsiveness or under one or more exemptions under the FOIA, and to issue ‘no records’ responses.”

Lawyers outside the agency who specialize in FOIA requests say the “no records” response could lead to a situation where records seekers are being told there are no documents meeting their search criteria, even if they were found by EPA staffers who handle the requests, with those documents ultimately withheld by political appointees.

The EPA has denied the characterization of the language, arguing the specification in the rule simply states officials have the right to tell requesters there were no records responsive to them. The EPA also denied that the number of political officials allowed to view FOIA requests prior to release was expanded under the latest rule, arguing they had the same powers in the previous version.

Also Tuesday, the Society for Environmental Journalists along the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and 37 other news media organizations sent a letter to the EPA asking it to suspend the implementation of the FOIA rule in order to allow a public comment period.

“The News Media Coalition is deeply concerned about the Proposed Rule, which contains provisions that undermine the Act, are impermissible under clear, binding D.C. Circuit precedent, and would diminish journalists’ ability to gather and report information to the public about the actions of the EPA and its personnel,” the group wrote.

News organizations that signed the letter include The Associated Press, Politico, Gannett, McClatchy, The New York Times and The New Yorker.

The latest Society for Environmental Journalists letter comes after the nonprofit previously raised flags over the rule at the end of June, a letter which the EPA later derided as containing “numerous inaccuracies.""

The group separately responded to EPA Tuesday, writing, “As we said in our initial letter, we believe this new rule will make journalists’ jobs even more difficult, and by extension, it 'will impede the public’s access to environmental information and its right to know how tax dollars are spent.'”

The news organizations urged EPA to suspend the rule and open it to public comment period for no fewer than 60 days.

EPA denied the accusations in both letters.

""After many years of delay, EPA’s FOIA regulations are now in line with the Congressionally mandated changes to the statute and EPA has no plans to withdraw the finalized rule. This rule will enhance transparency and efficiency of responses to FOIA requests. Allegations made that the rule is changing the political appointees role in FOIA are false and irresponsible,"" EPA spokesman Michael Abboud said.

Several lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have also expressed concern over what appears to be a growing trend of FOIA secrecy at government agencies.

The Interior Department has also been criticized for proposing a FOIA rule in December that would allow political officials mentioned in FOIA requests the ability to view the responsive records prior to release, in a move dubbed an “awareness review.”

Senators from both parties unhappy with the new Trump administration rules say they may craft legislation to fix it. Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Ed Markey Edward (Ed) John MarkeyKatherine Clark quietly eyes leadership ascent Environmental groups fight EPA's new FOIA rule UN official: US can't ignore that climate change will force 120 million people into poverty MORE (D-Mass.) are separately considering bills to address the FOIA changes at both agencies.

""In a self-governed society, the people ought to know what their government is up to,” said Grassley in a late June speech on the Senate floor.

“The public’s work ought to be public. So, I’m working on legislation to address these developments and promote access to government records.”"
Senators and State Department at Each Other’s Throats,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Betsy Woodruff', 'Political Reporter']",07-10-2019,2019,7,https://www.thedailybeast.com/senators-and-state-department-at-each-others-throats,"On Friday, June 28, an email with an odd subject line hit the inboxes of the Senate’s top national security staffers.

“RE: Gabriel—does this look good to you?” it read.

Beneath the cryptic subject line was an invitation from the State Department asking Senate Foreign Relations Committee (SFRC) staff to join a question-and-answer conference call with a top official working on Iran policy.

The call, on the following Monday, did not go well. Staff had been eager—and impatient—to hear how the administration would handle Iran’s decision to amp up its uranium enrichment. But after reading a bland statement full of already public information, Matt McInnis, a political appointee who works on Iran policy, said a technical difficulty meant he couldn’t take questions. The whole call lasted less than 10 minutes, according to multiple people on it.

“It was insulting,” said one staffer on the call. “It was such a box-checking exercise for them.” Another staffer described feelings of amusement mixed with horror.

For participants, the blunders were a microcosm of the metastasizing tensions between SFRC and the State Department. The committee is supposed to oversee the department. But five Hill staffers familiar with its work told The Daily Beast it has struggled under the leadership of Chairman Jim Risch, an Idaho Republican and Trump ally who wasn’t distinguished for broad foreign policy chops when he ascended to the post. Before Risch took the gavel, Sen. Bob Corker—who retired last year—ran the committee. While Corker was a traditional Republican who almost always voted with President Trump, he used the post to lambaste the administration’s frequently perplexing foreign policy choices. He even called the White House “an adult day care center.”

Under Risch, things are different. The conservative from Idaho has taken a much more deferential approach and is loath to publicly criticize the administration. He has yet to schedule open hearings on the war in Libya, the violent unrest in Sudan, and the free trade deal between the U.S. and Mexico.

Multiple staff blamed Risch’s non-combative approach for the committee’s struggles to get briefings and testimony from the department. And they point to debacles like the Iran conference call as evidence of the department’s disregard for the committee.

Risch’s defenders, meanwhile, say he engages in effective behind-the-scenes advocacy to the president and that until a few months ago, there were hardly any Senate-confirmed senior State Department officials who could testify. They also credit Risch with securing a long-awaited classified briefing from Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad, though Democrats say they’re still frustrated Khalilzad hasn’t testified publicly.

The committee still has trouble getting answers. To this day, according to two staffers, the department has yet to provide the committee with a copy of the U.S./Mexico agreement on tariffs that Trump himself waved around in front of news cameras on June 11. Committee staff have sent weekly emails to the State Department—for months now—asking for details on the administration’s decision to cut aid to Central American countries and have yet to get substantive answers to their questions, per one aide.

“ It is like pulling teeth to get information from this administration. ” — Senate aide

“It is like pulling teeth to get information from this administration,” another aide said.

“We get very much a head-pat acknowledgement,” said a third staffer. “Kind of, ‘There, there, Congress, we’ll tell you the bare minimum and that’s that.”

Suzanne Wrasse, the communications director for Risch on the committee, said the chairman effectively advocates for SFRC.

“The chairman is a pragmatic lawmaker with a long history of working ‘behind the scenes’ to get results, not to make political points,” she said. “He is in regular contact with the president and his senior advisers, and has used his stature to deliver results for the committee on a bipartisan basis.”

Risch has also touted his warm relationship with Trump.

“He has treated me with nothing but respect and listened carefully to what I had to say, and sometimes I was able to move him,” the senator said in a February Roll Call interview. “Sometimes a little bit, sometimes more than a little bit. Sometimes not at all.”

One tense moment came when the administration decided to use an emergency declaration to green-light billions of dollars in arms sales to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Jordan.

Traditionally, the State Department consults with SFRC on arms sales—but not this time. And it wasn’t for lack of talking; in the days leading up to the declaration, there was communication on the Iran situation between senior Trump administration officials and the Senate. Sec. Mike Pompeo and Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, held a members-only briefing for senators just two days before the arms announcement. But the topic of an emergency declaration didn’t come up in that briefing, according to people familiar with it. Instead, SFRC staff found out about the arms deals the day the administration announced them, on May 24.

That day, State set up another conference call for congressional staff to explain their move. Clarke Cooper, the assistant secretary for political-military affairs, was on the call. At one point, a staffer pushed Cooper on why the department hadn’t worked with Congress on the move, given its oversight responsibility.

“That’s a matter of semantics,” Cooper replied, according to a source who was on the call—which then exploded. To some listeners, Cooper’s comment sounded like a glib write-off of Congress’s constitutional duty to hold the executive branch accountable.

Reached for comment on this incident, a State Department spokesperson pointed to congressional testimony Cooper gave several weeks later, where he said the department “value[s] deeply this Committee’s and Congress’ role more broadly in the review of the arms transfer process.”

The frustrations are percolating as Trump faces some of his thorniest foreign policy dilemmas yet. Just weeks ago, the president said he nearly green-lit a strike on Iranian targets that could have killed scores of people. Instead, the president deferred to the non-interventionists in his orbit—including Fox News host Tucker Carlson. But as crises materialize like it’s Whack-A-Mole, staff working with the committee responsible for overseeing American diplomacy say it’s in the dark. And they have to wonder: How could this administration handle negotiations with the Iranians if they can barely run a conference call about them?"

A CBP spokesperson told NBC News on Tuesday that the agency's Office of Inspector General (OIG) was aware of the allegation and would investigate the matter.

""U.S. Customs and Border Protection treats those in our custody with dignity and respect and provides multiple avenues to report any allegations of misconduct,"" the spokesperson said.

""The allegations do not align with common practice at our facilities and will be fully investigated. It’s important to note that the allegation of sexual assault is already under investigation by the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General,"" they added.

NBC News on Tuesday reported the girl's allegations as well as other claims of mistreatment from dozens of immigrant children being held. The girl, who remained unidentified due to her age, told government case workers that she was stripped down to her underwear and groped while other children and agents were present, and that the offending agent made remarks to other officers in English and laughed during the assault, according to incident reports obtained by NBC.

""Minor reports officer asked her to lift her shirt up to bra line and then he put his hands inside her bra and touched her breast,"" read an incident report obtained by the network. ""Minor reported she felt embarrassed as the office[r] was speaking in English to other officers and laughing.""

23 states now oppose EPA fuel economy freeze,https://www.greencarreports.com,"['Eric C. Evarts', 'Eric C. Evarts - Contributor', 'Bengt Halvorson - Senior Editor']",,,,https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1123951_23-states-now-oppose-epa-fuel-economy-freeze,"The number of states that oppose President Trump's efforts to freeze emissions and fuel economy standards is growing.

In June last year, 16 states and Washington, DC, sued the federal government over the proposal before it was even released.

On Tuesday, governors of 23 states plus Puerto Rico released a joint statement urging the Trump administration to reconsider its proposal to freeze the standards through 2026.

“Strong vehicle standards protect our communities from unnecessary air pollution and fuel costs, and they address the largest source of carbon pollution in the United States,” they said in the letter.

The proposal announced last August by the EPA and NHTSA, called the Safe, Affordable, Fuel-Efficient Vehicles Rule, is a signature part of President Trump's efforts to reverse Obama administration programs to combat climate change.

EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler

Current emissions regulations require cars and trucks to meet steadily rising fuel-economy standards through 2025. The proposed SAFER rule would freeze those increases at 2020 levels through 2025. After a public comment period on the new proposal ended last October, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler told Reuters on Monday that he expects to release a modified final rule later this summer.

Originally, California was joined in the lawsuit by Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington state, as well as DC. Most, though not all of those states follow California's clean air standards, which are tighter than the EPA's. Under a 1970 extension of the Clean Air Act, California is the only state allowed to set tighter standards than the federal government, because its clean air standards predate the EPA. Other states can choose to follow either federal or California standards (including an electric-vehicle mandate), but cannot set their own.

The latest letter adds support from both Democratic and Republican governors of some key electoral swing states, such as Colorado, Nevada, North Carolina, and Wisconsin, plus New Mexico and Montana. Together the governors, who are all part of the U.S. Climate Alliance, represent 52 percent of the U.S. population and 57 percent of the economy.

Automakers, who originally asked President Trump to revisit current Obama-era standards, have also implored the Trump administration not to freeze the standards. They've asked the administration to find a compromise with California to produce a single set of national standards that incorporate annual increases, though smaller ones than those passed under the Obama administration. On Tuesday, the Auto Alliance, a lobbying group representing most major automakers, issued a statement urging states and the federal government to ""find a middle ground that raises standards year over year while aligning with market demand.”

Instead, it looks likely that the question will face a protracted court battle resulting in years of uncertainty over emissions and fuel economy standards—as well as, perhaps, long-term requirements for electric cars."

Mueller III, is joining a law firm in New York. (Courtesy of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher/Dave Cross)

Zainab Ahmad, a member of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s prosecution team who worked the probe of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, is leaving the Justice Department for a job at a private law firm, she said Wednesday.

Ahmad, a veteran New York prosecutor of complex terrorism cases, said in an interview that she is joining Gibson Dunn & Crutcher to work on international legal matters.

“It just felt like the right moment, in terms of wanting a new challenge,” she said.

Like many of her former Mueller team colleagues who have remained tight-lipped about their work for him, Ahmad declined to discuss her time in the two-year pressure cooker of the special counsel’s office.

“I think that Bob Mueller is an amazing public servant and he assembled a great team who worked incredibly hard, with the highest level of integrity,” she said. “That is something that I hope the American public knows.”

Mueller is scheduled to testify next week to Congress about his investigation — a much-anticipated public hearing that Democrats hope will refocus public attention on President Trump’s conduct.

[Mueller to testify to Congress about his investigation]

Ahmad said she had no particular hope or expectation for Mueller’s testimony, and declined to comment when asked if she had any interest in testifying about the investigation.

Ahmad brought to the special counsel experience negotiating with foreign governments to gather evidence and interview witnesses. And she looks to do similar work in private practice.

She said some of her “greatest thrills” as a prosecutor came in securing witnesses or arranging the extradition of foreign terrorist suspects to the United States.

“I really enjoy navigating the divide between countries and cultures and languages and backgrounds, and I hope to do a lot of international work,” she said.

In addition to the probe of Flynn, which led to his guilty plea for lying to the FBI, Ahmad worked on a prolonged subpoena fight with a still-unidentified company controlled by a foreign government. That battle went to the Supreme Court, and in January a judge imposed a $50,000-a-day fine on the firm for not complying with Mueller’s subpoena. Those penalties stopped the following month, when the company turned over nearly 1,000 pages of documents.

Ahmad declined to comment on the case.

She said she would be open to someday going back to work at the Justice Department but had no specific goal to do so.

Ahmad said she’s still adjusting to life after the Justice Department, and after working for Mueller, whose office was so secure it was designated a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF. That meant that when prosecutors showed up for work, they had to check their cellphones at the door. Before joining Mueller’s team, Ahmad spent much of her time as a terrorism prosecutor in the Eastern District of New York inside similarly secure workspaces.

“I have gotten so used to not having my cellphone with me, that now I find it overwhelming to have it with me and be expected to respond to things in a timely manner,” she said. “I miss having the ‘SCIF excuse’ for poor communication.”"

(Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images)

A federal appeals court on Wednesday handed President Donald Trump a major victory, dismissing a lawsuit that argued he violated the emoluments clause of the Constitution.

A three-judge panel with the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, ruled that the attorneys general of D.C. and Maryland did not have standing to sue the president.

The lawsuit was filed last year alleging that the earnings Trump receives from his hotel in the District violates the emoluments provision of the Constitution. The clause forbids the president from accepting gifts or money from foreign entities. It also allows the president to receive a salary while in the White House but forbids the commander in chief from earning outside financial profits.

The lawsuit claims that Trump repeatedly violates the provision because of the leases, purchases and ownership of Trump properties by foreign government-owned entities, as well as hotel, restaurant and use of venues by foreign governments and diplomats.

Trump tweeted following the decision that he ""won a big part of the Deep State and Democrat induced Witch Hunt.""

""Word just out that I won a big part of the Deep State and Democrat induced Witch Hunt,"" Trump tweeted. ""Unanimous decision in my favor from The United States Court of Appeals For The Fourth Circuit on the ridiculous Emoluments Case.

Forty-seven days later, none of the weapons have been transferred to either country, according to a top State Department official, drawing outrage from Republicans and Democrats in the Senate who said it undermines the administration's argument that there was an emergency.

""How would sales that will not be delivered for many, many, months immediately respond to an emergency?"" asked Sen. Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ""I urge you to take another look at the definition of 'emergency' and re-think your approach to engaging Congress.""

Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images, FILE

Menendez was one of several lawmakers who grilled R. Clarke Cooper, the Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs, on Wednesday. Cooper defended the administration's decision to use the emergency clause as necessary because of the imminent Iranian threat and the need to support the two American partners, even after the Senate passed resolutions of disapproval against every one of the sales -- 22 in total.

While the emergency approval has allowed training and servicing missions to continue uninterrupted, according to Cooper, none of the military hardware had been transferred yet. Menendez added that only three out of eight sales of weapons or equipment had been formally submitted in a U.S. government contract -- something Cooper said he could not confirm.

It wasn't just Democrats who laid into Cooper though. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said he voted against the resolutions of disapproval because he agrees with the administration that the U.S. should arm its partner Saudi Arabia against Iranian aggression.

But ""the process that the State Department followed for these weapons sales ... was crap,"" he said, criticizing the decision to ""circumvent the law and act unilaterally. ... It was foolishness.""

Cruz warned that if the administration made a similar move again, they would lose his and other Republicans' support -- although Pompeo has already made clear that this was a one-time move.

""The simpler process is follow the damn law and respect it,"" Cruz added.

Immediately after, Democrat Chris Coons congratulated Cooper for ""managing to achieve a rare moment of bipartisanship on this committee. I can tell you, it's not often that my colleague from Texas and I agree completely on a matter,"" eliciting laughs.

Cooper deflected several questions about the Saudis and Emiratis' troubled histories with U.S. arms, especially their air war against Iran-supported Houthi rebels in neighboring Yemen. In one exchange, he refused to acknowledge data that civilian casualties from the two countries' airstrikes in Yemen had doubled in the last year, which an exasperated Sen. Chris Murphy called ""maddening.""

Instead, Cooper defended the administration's record on pressing the Saudis and Emiratis on human rights in their societies while working with them on security challenges in the region: ""We can do both,"" he said.

But Congress has been increasingly concerned with President Trump's relationship, particularly with the Saudis, and the aggressive behavior of the kingdom's young Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto leader. In particular, lawmakers have said business as usual must end after the murder and dismemberment of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in the country's consulate in Istanbul. Instead, Trump and top aides like Pompeo have doubled down on the Saudi relationship and dismissed Congress's concerns.

""The hearing we're having today is just the very tip of the iceberg about what Congress needs to do to exercise oversight about why there is such a departure from the ordinary course of business on matters of such national security sensitivity with respect to Saudi Arabia,"" said Democrat Tim Kaine, noting the emergency arms sales, the transfer of nuclear technology to the Saudis, and refusal to make a determination on Prince Mohammed's role in Khashoggi's killing, among others."

The expectations for the monthly July Supply and Demand report are not as clear as they normally are this year. For instance, we could see changes in this report that we normally would not see in a July report. The main one: any adjustment to acres from the late June Planted Acreage report.

Typically, the USDA takes the acres from the late-June report and uses the exact numbers for the monthly July report. The last time it made any major adjustment to this process was in 1993. It is no secret that 1993 and 2019 have many similarities. This is why it would not surprise me to see some adjustments to acres in the report tomorrow (Thursday).

Keep a close eye on the cash corn market. Cash basis levels are reaching or have already hit record-tight levels in many areas. This is a great sign for the bulls. The life of a bull market is often longer when it is being led by a strong cash market.

"Border apprehensions decline 28 percent following US-Mexico partnership, DHS says",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Deputy Commissioner For U.S. Customs', 'Border Protection Robert Perez', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/border-apprehensions-decline-dramatically-following-us-mexico-partnership,"The Department of Homeland Security announced Tuesday that apprehensions at the southwest border plummeted in June after the Mexican government agreed early in the month -- under the threat of punishing U.S. tariffs -- to dramatically step up its own immigration enforcement efforts.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data showed a 28 percent drop in apprehensions from May, when 144,278 individuals were detained. Although some analysts blamed the ""summer heat"" for part of the new decline, the Trump administration noted in a statement that the decline in apprehensions ""outpaces last year’s decline by 11 percent"" in the same period.

The numbers refer to would-be immigrants caught trying to illegally cross the border, and not migrants who approach ports of entry.

The reduction in apprehensions ""accounts for decreases across all demographics, including unaccompanied minors, family units and single adults, as well as decreases in migrants from all Northern Triangle countries, particularly those coming from Guatemala,"" DHS said in a statement.

""Decreasing apprehension numbers will provide greater opportunities for the DHS to address capacity challenges for those in custody and speed the movement of unaccompanied children into Health and Human Services (HHS) care,"" the statement continued.

Law enforcement and administration officials said President Trump's hard push for the deal with Mexico had made all the difference. Deputy Commissioner for U.S. Customs and Border Protection Robert Perez told Fox News' ""America's Newsroom"" on Tuesday that morale among law enforcement at the border had increased.

BORDER PATROL DECLARES 'FULL-BLOWN EMERGENCY,' AS FORMER DHS OFFICIAL SAYS 'DESPERATION' HAS SET IN

""I think it's a combination of a few things,"" Perez said. ""I think it certainly is an unprecedented agreement that we've made with Mexico, that the president was able to secure about a month ago. We are definitely seeing and are encouraged by the steps Mexico has taken.""

Some Republicans, however, were not pleaded with Mexico's efforts. Texas GOP Rep. Dan Crenshaw wrote on Twitter that it was ""unacceptable"" to see the fourth straight month of more than 100,000 border arrests, even though he praised the decrease in monthly apprehensions as a ""good"" sign.

""The President was right to demand more from Mexico,"" Crenshaw wrote. ""Now some actions from Congress would be nice.""

Earlier in June, Mexico committed to deploy thousands of National Guard troops throughout Mexico, including at its northern and southern land borders, as well as to increase actions to dismantle human trafficking operations and take extra steps to coordinate with the American government to share information and ""better protect and secure our common border,"" according to a statement from the State Department.

Trump had taken a tough position toward Mexico just prior to that breakthrough, tweeting, ""If we are unable to make the deal, Mexico will begin paying Tariffs at the 5% [sic] level ...!""

""On June 10th, the United States will impose a 5% [sic] Tariff on all goods coming into our Country from Mexico, until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico, and into our Country, STOP,"" Trump warned on May 30. ""The Tariff will gradually increase until the Illegal Immigration problem is remedied, ... ..at which time the Tariffs will be removed. Details from the White House to follow.""

Shortly after Trump's threat but before the deal was reached, Mexico's financial intelligence agency announced it had frozen the bank accounts of 26 people who it claimed to ""have presumably participated in migrant smuggling and the organization of illegal migrant caravans.""

MEXICO USING X-RAY TECHNOLOGY TO CRACK DOWN ON ILLEGAL MIGRANTS

The agency said it had detected money transfers from central Mexico to six Mexican border cities presumably related to the caravans.

And some 200 Mexican military police, immigration agents and federal police blocked the advance of about 1,000 Central American migrants who were walking north along a highway in the southern part of the country.

""We are definitely seeing and are encouragd by the steps Mexico has taken."" — Deputy Commissioner for U.S. Customs and Border Protection Robert Perez

The group of migrants, including many women and children, set out early from Ciudad Hidalgo at the Mexico-Guatemala border and was headed for Tapachula, the principal city in the region. State and local police accompanied the caravan. The officials blocked the highway near the community of Metapa, about 11 miles from Tapachula.

And this week, it emerged that while the Mexican National Guard deploys to places like Tapachula on the country's southern border and makes changes to its asylum protocol, agents with the country's National Migration Institute (INM) are using a giant X-ray to find migrants being smuggled into the country in trucks.

Mexican officials said they caught more than 200 migrants hidden in trucks the last two days, using X-rays to see the people hidden inside.

The Mexican security ministry also said it found 228 migrants in a routine search of a soft drink transportation truck in one of its southern states on Monday.

EPA's new public records rule lets Trump administration pollute in private,https://thehill.com,[],07-10-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/452417-epas-new-public-records-rule-lets-trump-administration-pollute-in,"If it weren’t for the public records law, scandal-plagued Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott PruittAcosta on shaky ground as GOP support wavers 'I alone can fix it,' Trump said, but has he?

Spending records and other public documents released to conservation groups under the Freedom of Information Act revealed a litany of Pruitt scandals ― from his $43,000 private phone booth to his unethical attempt to leverage his position to land his wife a job at Chick-fil-A. These revelations ultimately forced him to resign.

But Americans’ access to such crucial information is now at risk. Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerOvernight Energy: Trump doesn't mention climate change in speech touting environmental policies | Green groups fight EPA's new FOIA rule | Trump emissions rollback hit with legal challenge Trump touts environmental policies, but says nothing of climate change Environmental groups fight EPA's new FOIA rule MORE, the new EPA administrator, has signed a new rule allowing him and other political appointees to review requests for public documents and decide which ones to release.

This is a great deal for Wheeler and the fossil-fuel industry, but a dangerous development for public health, wildlife and the environment. Maybe that’s why, in a dazzling display of hubris that almost matches his predecessor, Wheeler ignored the required public comment period before quietly signing the rule last month.

This week the Center for Biological Diversity joined 16 other conservation and public-interest groups to urge Wheeler ― a former oil-industry lobbyist ― to delay the rule at least until the public has a chance to weigh in.

Wheeler’s EPA mischaracterizes these significant changes as minor and claims any public discussion about this is “contrary to the public interest.” Those claims are false and ridiculous.

Previous administrations have taken pains to separate political appointees from the process of determining which of the public’s records should be released to the public. But the Trump administration has taken government secrecy to a whole new level.

Injecting politics into the public records process defeats the law’s key purpose. It gives this pollution-friendly administration a powerful new way to hide the damage it’s doing to our air, water and wildlife by unprecedented rollbacks of environmental protections.

ADVERTISEMENT

Wheeler’s new public records rule also creates an entirely new reason for the EPA to hide federal documents ― “responsiveness.”

This contradicts longstanding Department of Justice interpretations of the law. And it conflicts with previous court rulings that forbid federal agencies from redacting or withholding public records or portions of public records they deem “non-responsive.”

Even worse, this new blanket exemption from the public records law will make it nearly impossible for people to challenge EPA’s decisions to keep documents secret. If the EPA says there are no records because a political appointee has determined, illegally, that the documents are “not responsive” to the public records request, then the requestor won’t know that the records even exist.

That makes a mockery of the Freedom of Information Act.

As if that weren’t enough, Wheeler’s new rule will funnel all public records requests to EPA’s Washington, D.C., headquarters, which is already bogged down with an ever-growing backlog.

No longer will regional FOIA staff ― those who are most familiar with the issues ― make decisions about what to release and what to redact. That crucial task is now entrusted to the office with most of EPA’s political appointees.

This comes despite an internal audit that showed hundreds of career EPA FOIA staffers opposed efforts to centralize the work in D.C. And it contradicts EPA’s claim that this new rule is an effort to improve efficiency and transparency. In fact, it will have the opposite effect.

Regional EPA staff recently blew the whistle on a Minnesota pollution regulator who was trying to stifle EPA’s concerns about the proposed PolyMet open-pit copper mine. Wheeler’s new rule would take dedicated career employees like these out of the loop.

Let’s be clear. This new EPA rule is aimed at hiding policies that foul our air and water, harm endangered wildlife and benefit polluting industries.

The changes to EPA’s public records rule are similar to those approved by the Interior Department earlier this year. As with the Interior rule, the intention is obfuscation and secrecy, not efficiency or transparency.

The public records law may have led to Pruitt’s downfall, but the law is about much more than that.

When our federal agencies undermine the public records law, they hijack democracy and jeopardize public health and the environment. The Trump administration is already working overtime to give powerful polluters everything they want. If Trump’s EPA is able to operate in the shadows, beyond the reach of public scrutiny, the damage could be inconceivable.

Eds: Updates with Rep. Horsford calling for Energy Secretary Perry's resignation; with BC-US--Nuclear Waste-Nevada

RENO, Nev. (AP) - The Latest on shipments of low-level radioactive waste to Nevada that may have been mislabeled and out of regulatory compliance (all times local):

3 p.m.

A Nevada congressman is calling for Energy Secretary Rick Perry's resignation after the department acknowledged low-level radioactive waste that was shipped to a site north of Las Vegas may have been mislabeled and out of compliance with safety regulations for years.

Democratic Rep. Steven Horsford said Wednesday that Perry has disrespected the people of Nevada and eroded public trust in his ability to abide by rules established for nuclear waste disposal.

The material is unrelated to weapons-grade plutonium that the department secretly shipped to the same site last year and is currently at the center of a legal battle with the state of Nevada in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

But Horsford says it's further evidence that Nevada has been covertly coerced into illegally storing nuclear materials. He says Perry must resign immediately.

___

2:45 p.m.

The U.S. Energy Department has suspended shipments of low-level radioactive waste from Tennessee to Nevada while it investigates whether the materials were being mislabeled and shipped out of compliance with state or federal regulations for several years.

Department spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes said in a statement Wednesday that none of the materials shipped as early as 2013 from the Y-12 facility in Tennessee posed any health or safety threats to workers or the general public.

But she said the shipments slated for disposal at the Nevada National Security Site north of Las Vegas were not in compliance with the site's acceptance criteria and were ""potentially mischaracterized"" as the wrong category of low-level waste for years.

She says the department's National Nuclear Security Administration has launched an internal investigation ""to determine how this went undetected"" for up to six years.

Governor Steve Sisolak is demanding answers after his office says the U.S. Department of Energy shipped unauthorized low-level radioactive waste to Nevada from Tennessee.

According to the governor's office, Governor Sisolak was contacted July 3, 2019 by Deputy Secretary Daniel Brouilette from the U.S. Department of Energy who informed the Governor that the DOE has been shipping to and disposing of unapproved low-level radioactive waste from DOE’s Y-12 facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee at the Nevada National Security Site. The governor's office says the classified low-level waste from the Y-12 facility violated the NNSS Waste Acceptance Criteria which establishes the protocols for what type of low-level waste is suitable for disposal at the Site.

The governor, along with US Senators Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen, sent a letter to Secretary Rick Perry regarding the shipments.

In a statement released Wednesday, July 10, the governor said:

“I was beyond disappointed to learn of problems related to shipments of low-level radioactive waste from the DOE’s Y-12 facility to Nevada. My office worked diligently with our state agencies and federal delegation to immediately compile questions and demand answers in a letter issued to Secretary Perry. Additionally, we were able to receive an in-person briefing at DOE’s Las Vegas office yesterday with updates on the situation by senior level officials from the DOE and NNSS to ensure any information communicated to Nevadans is as accurate as possible. While we appreciate the courtesy of the in-person briefing, we will continue to do everything in the state’s power to hold them accountable, ensure there is a plan to fix this problem and prevent it from occurring again, and above all else, protect the health and safety of Nevadans. There shouldn’t be a single person who attended yesterday’s briefing who didn’t receive that message loud and clear.”

Governor Sisolak's office says the unapproved low-level waste from the Y-12 facility in Tennessee began in 2013 and included 32 total shipments. The last shipment of which arrived at NNSS in December 2018.

"Sean Hannity on FISA abuse inquiry developments: Comey, Yates, McCabe, and Rosenstein 'should be very worried'",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-10-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/sean-hannity-on-fisa-abuse-inquiry-developments-comey-yates-mccabe-and-rosenstein-should-be-very-worried,"Fox News host Sean Hannity reacted to new developments about the Justice Department inspector general's investigation into alleged abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act by listing several former officials he believes are in trouble.

Opening his show Tuesday, Hannity said the inquiry, which appears to have been extended in the 11th hour, ""is going to get very interesting.""

""A crucial development in the IG's investigation into FISA abuse,"" Hannity said in his monologue. ""That would be [former FBI Director] James Comey, [former Deputy Attorney General] Sally Yates, [former FBI Deputy Director] Andrew McCabe, and, yeah, even [former Deputy Attorney General] Rod Rosenstein should be very worried tonight.""

Two major stories explaining why DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigation has been delayed broke on Tuesday. One came from reports that Horowitz's team conducted a two-day interview with British ex-spy Christopher Steele, who authored the unsubstantiated and salacious dossier attacking President Trump, and the investigators found Steele's information credible enough to warrant extending their investigation.

The second development was the revelation of a letter Horowitz sent to Congress last month that said the DOJ watchdog has “received and reviewed over one million records” and has “conducted over 100 interviews, including current and former DOJ and FBI personnel” during its inquiry. Horowitz also said his team has “made substantial progress towards completing the review"" and that he would provide another update about the timeline for the release of the final report “in the coming weeks.”

On his show, Hannity named possible targets of the DOJ inspector general's inquiry, the approvers and signers of the four FISA warrant applications and renewals from October 2016 through June 2017, against onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. The applications relied heavily on the unverified dossier compiled by Steele, who was hired by Fusion GPS. The opposition research firm was hired by Marc Elias of the Perkins Coie law firm at the behest of the Clinton presidential campaign.

Looking ahead to next week's public hearing with former special counsel Robert Mueller, Hannity said a ""great question"" for lawmakers to ask is whether Mueller's team relied on the dossier.

There has been building anticipation, especially among Trump allies, for the release of Horowitz's report, as they believe there was an underhanded effort by DOJ and FBI officials to undermine the president. This eagerness is due in part to Attorney General William Barr predicting earlier this year that Horowitz's probe would wrap up in May or June.

Hannity himself has repeatedly cited sources over the past couple months to say the IG investigation was over and was ""extraordinarily damning.""

Democrats have dismissed the GOP's excitement about Horowitz's inquiry and Steele's role in it as ""whataboutism"" run amok.

The latest developments come a week after House Judiciary Committee member John Ratcliffe of Texas said that he had met with Horowitz in late June and the inspector general had said his investigation had concluded. They also follow a Fox News report that said at least one key witness who is not part of the DOJ or FBI came forward only after Barr tasked U.S. Attorney John Durham of Connecticut to lead a review of the origins of the Russia investigation. It now appears Steele was the subject of this ""breakthrough.""

The DOJ's review of the early stages of the Russia investigation is not a criminal inquiry, but should Durham find criminal activity, he can take prosecutorial action."
"Commerce secretary confirms U.S. firms can sell to Huawei, with conditions",https://www.fiercewireless.com,['Monica Alleven'],,,,https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/commerce-secretary-confirms-u-s-sales-allowed-to-huawei-conditions,"U.S. Department of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Tuesday said the U.S. would grant licenses to U.S. companies that sell technology to Huawei Technologies if the sales don’t put national security at risk.

His comments provided a little more clarity after President Trump’s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit, where Trump made the surprise announcement that U.S. companies could sell their equipment to Huawei where there’s “no great national security problem with it.”

“To implement the President’s G-20 Summit directive two weeks ago, Commerce will issue licenses where there is no threat to U.S. national security,” Ross reiterated at the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) annual conference on export controls and security. “Within those confines we will try to make sure that we don’t just transfer revenue from the U.S. to foreign firms. Huawei itself remains on the Entity List, and the announcement does not change the scope of items requiring licenses from the Commerce Department, nor the presumption of denial.”

Separately, at a CNBC event on Tuesday, Larry Kudlow, director of the White House National Economic Council, said with respect to the private markets, the U.S. had “opened the door—relaxed a bit, the licensing requirements from the Commerce Department” where there are no national security consequences.

"Trump intervention delaying EPA biofuel waiver action, sources say",https://www.reuters.com,"['Humeyra Pamuk', 'Min Read']",07-10-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biofuels-ethanol/trump-intervention-delaying-epa-biofuel-waiver-action-sources-say-idUSKCN1U52BP,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s request for a review of the administration’s expanded use of biofuel waivers for oil refiners is holding up its decisions on 2018 applications, according to three sources familiar with the matter, two of whom said Trump may soon host a meeting on the issue.

Trump had ordered (here) members of his Cabinet to review the controversial waiver program, which exempts small refiners in financial turmoil from their obligation to blend ethanol into gasoline, last month after hearing from farmers angry about the issue during his recent Midwest tour.

Since Trump took office, the Environmental Protection Agency has more than quadrupled the number of waivers it has granted to refiners, saving the oil industry hundreds of millions of dollars, but enraging another key constituency - corn growers - who claim the move threatens ethanol demand.

Since Trump’s request for a review, the EPA has been scrambling to come up with a solution to move forward with 40 pending applications for the waivers, called Small Refinery Exemptions or SREs, covering 2018.

“The SRE decision is being held up because the President wants to have this conversation,” one of the sources familiar with the issue said.

Two sources said the White House could host a meeting next week on the issue that would include Trump, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler, and senators from both oil and farm states.

There was no final decision yet on whether a meeting would be held, or when, they said.

All three of the sources said that the 2018 SRE decisions were nearly finalized before Trump became involved.

The White House declined to comment.

The EPA responded to a request for comment by saying it was implementing biofuel policy in accordance with the law.

“We will work with the White House, DOE, USDA, members of Congress and other stakeholders to ensure the proper administration of the (Renewable Fuel Standard),” EPA spokesman Michael Abboud said in an emailed statement.

The Department of Energy provided the EPA its scoring results for the 40 outstanding 2018 applications in late April, sources told Reuters. EPA is required to decide on applications no later than 90 days after receiving them.

Some refiners say they filed their applications far earlier than April, and say the EPA is already late.

POLITICAL TIGHTROPE

The Renewable Fuel Standard, a more than decade-old regulation that is aimed at helping farmers and reducing U.S. dependence on oil, has been a big point of contention between the rivaling oil and corn industries, leaving Trump struggling to find a balance between the two important constituencies as he eyes a bid for re-election next year.

The regulation requires refiners to blend increasing volumes of ethanol and other biofuels into their fuel each year or purchase credits from those that do. But it also allows refining facilities of less than 75,000 barrels per day to request waivers if they can prove that complying with the law would cause them disproportionate financial hardship.

Small refineries owned by giants like Exxon Mobil and Chevron Corp, along with a facility owned by billionaire investor Carl Icahn have secured waivers from Trump’s EPA, according to Reuters reporting.

Trump’s request that Cabinet members, including Agriculture Secretary Perdue, help hash out a fix to the waiver program has become a source of concern for lawmakers representing oil refining states. Perdue has often publicly criticized the EPA’s administration of the waiver program, siding with farmers.

Last week, Republican senators representing oil states wrote to Trump asking him to keep Perdue away from any decision-making process over the petitions. Louisiana Senator John Kennedy also wrote to Perdue saying he will block confirmation of agency nominations until Perdue “stops interfering.”"

Last week, Joe Biden joined the bandwagon of Democrats (started by Elizabeth Warren this year) promising to name a public-school teacher to be Secretary of Education if he wins the presidency. It’s an easy commitment to make in front of a teachers’ union audience, and it wouldn’t be all that odd to do it—several past presidents of both parties have named former public-school teachers to the job.

But the promise is another example of a thoroughly bipartisan misconception about the work of the federal education department. Even if they haven’t been former teachers, nearly every education secretary since the Department of Education was created in the Carter years has been someone with expertise or experience in K-12 education—whether as an educator, administrator, reformer, or policymaker. But the Department of Education actually has a lot more say over higher education than primary or secondary schooling, and its work has suffered from the lack of focus on higher ed over the years. If we must have a Department of Education, it could at least be run by someone who knows something about higher education.

The American system of primary and secondary schools is gloriously decentralized. There are about 130,000 K-12 schools in America, about three-quarters of which are public schools. The latter are governed by about 13,000 different school districts across the 50 states. These districts have enormous power over curriculum and staffing decisions, and the states have most of the remaining power over education policy.

The federal role in K-12 education is strongest in circumstances where racial or other discrimination triggers legally-mandated responses. Otherwise, the federal government uses some levers of conditional funding under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act—a Great Society law that has been updated every few years since. Recent updates include the No Child Left Behind Act and the Every Student Succeeds Act. These have given the federal government more leverage over time, but its power is still greatest at the margins. Federal dollars are about 8 percent of K-12 education funding, and the Department of Education doesn’t really shape primary and secondary education policy.

We should all be glad about that. And a teacher who wants to influence education policy would be better advised to run for school board or for the state legislature than to go to Washington.

But unfortunately, the federal Department of Education does play a critical role in setting the direction of American higher education. Here too, its power comes mostly from the leverage created by federal dollars, but that leverage is immense, especially because of the student-loan system. And it has meant that the federal government has played a central role in driving the tuition inflation that plagues higher ed and in creating all manner of policy trouble besides.

Price inflation in higher education has been massively exacerbated by the basic structure of federal policy in this area, which might be best described as simultaneously subsidizing demand and restricting supply.

The subsidization of demand is done through student aid, which has been too open-ended and has risen with tuition, thereby creating upward pressure on costs. This leverage over funds has also given the Department of Education lots of informal power to drive policy through nudges and “suggestions” in a variety of areas. The Obama administration’s notorious “Dear Colleague” letters are a prominent example.

The restriction of supply, meanwhile, has been a function of accreditation, which the incumbent players in American higher education have used to restrict new entrants and new uses of technology. Accreditation is technically a private process, run by a group of NGOs, but because it is the means by which schools become eligible for students with federal loans and grants, the Department of Education has enormous power over it, essentially accrediting the accreditors.

All of this gives the Secretary of Education a lot of opportunities to improve (or to worsen) higher-ed policy—both by working with Congress to change the law and by working directly to change the department’s policies. Higher-ed policy is badly in need of reforms, getting those right could make a huge difference, and the Secretary of Education would be a key figure in making that happen. The Trump administration has taken some useful steps in this direction, but there is lots more to be done.

So a president who wanted to do something useful in education policy would be wise to appoint an education secretary who knows something about higher education, rather than just one who will say nice things about primary and secondary schools."

KC police investigate death of veteran outside VA hospital,https://www.kansascity.com,[],,,,https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/crime/article232443717.html,"Director of Kansas City VA Hospital has history of cover-ups from her previous job at Florida VA hospital Kathleen Fogarty, director of the Kansas City VA Hospital, has withheld information of a Veterans Affairs Police altercation with patient Dale Farhner, who died two days later. Up Next × SHARE COPY LINK Kathleen Fogarty, director of the Kansas City VA Hospital, has withheld information of a Veterans Affairs Police altercation with patient Dale Farhner, who died two days later.

The Kansas City Police Department is investigating the death of a veteran who had a fatal brain hemorrhage after a confrontation with Veterans Affairs Police last year.

Department spokesman Jacob Becchina said the case of Dale Farhner has been assigned to Sgt. Richard Sharp, a longtime homicide detective.

“The results of our investigation will ultimately be compiled and forwarded on to the prosecutor’s office for their decision as to what if any applicable charges may apply,” Becchina said. “There is little info that can be released at this point, as it is now an open death investigation on our end.”

The VA has said the incident has already been investigated by federal law enforcement, and its officers have been cleared of wrongdoing.

But Becchina said that “a little less than a month ago” the Jackson County medical examiner forwarded the results of Farhner’s autopsy to Kansas City police to investigate.

The medical examiner has declined to release the results of Farhner’s autopsy, citing open investigations first by the VA and now by police.

Farhner, of Kingston, Missouri, was driving himself to the emergency room at the Kansas City VA Medical Center in May 2018 because of an infection from a hernia surgery he’d had there. A VA Police officer stopped him because he was going the wrong way in the parking lot. An argument ensued, and one or two officers took Farhner to the ground, according to a suit filed by his family.

He was semi-conscious when he got to the emergency room and was transferred to the University of Kansas Hospital, where he died two days later at age 66.

The Star began looking into Farhner’s death after receiving an anonymous tip about it shortly after.

An open records request revealed that the VA had nearly 20 pages of documents, plus audio and video recordings related to the incident in the parking lot. But the agency has rebuffed repeated requests for the information, saying the matter was still under investigation and that making it public “would likely negatively impact a frank discussion on matters of policy between subordinates and supervisors.”

The VA has also refused to provide information about Farhner’s death to members of Congress and Farhner’s family, who filed their wrongful death suit in May 2019 after they got no response to an administrative complaint.

The leader of a Kansas City Vietnam veterans group has said the agency’s silence smacks of a cover-up, and Kansas City VA Medical Center director Kathleen Fogarty has been accused of cover-ups at her previous job leading the Tampa, Florida, VA hospital.

Kansas City VA hospital spokesman Vernon Stewart denied last month there was any attempt to obscure what happened, saying that federal law enforcement had “fully investigated this matter and determined that VA acted appropriately in its interaction with the veteran.”

“VA will cooperate fully with any additional official investigations,” Stewart said.

That now means cooperating with Sharp, the KC Metropolitan Crime Commission’s 2018 Officer of the Year. Sharp’s duties include coordinating Metro Squad investigations of murders in small towns near Kansas City.

“He has some paperwork from the VA and he is waiting on some more, and he’s also going to check with our federal partners to gather any investigative material they may have compiled on this prior,” Becchina said. “This may be a process that takes some time, as any death associated with police contact would, in order to get everything right.”

A report published in December by the VA’s Office of Inspector General found that the agency’s 4,000-plus police officers operate without effective management or oversight, leading to a system lacking accountability.

In an article published Monday, the news website The Intercept said it had reviewed the VA Police’s performance over the last 10 years and “identified dozens of credible allegations that VA cops in every corner of the United States have neglected standard police procedures, violated patients’ constitutional rights, or broken the law.” It briefly mentioned the Farhner case.

Anyone with information on the case is asked to contact the Kansas City Police Department homicide unit at 816-234-5043. To remain anonymous, call the TIPS Hotline at 816-474-8477."
House passes legislation to remove gendered references to presidents in a US law,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Nicholas Wu', 'Published P.M. Et July']",07-10-2019,2019,7,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/07/10/house-passes-law-removing-gendered-references-president/1696975001/,"WASHINGTON – On Wednesday, the House of Representatives passed legislation to remove gendered references to presidents in a U.S. law.

The bill, H.R. 677, the ""21st Century President Act,"" would amend part of an existing U.S. law making it a crime to threaten the president or the president's family. This law currently defines the spouse as female and the president as male, and states that the president's spouse is ""the wife of a former President during his lifetime, the widow of a former President until her death or remarriage.""

The new legislation would change that section to be ""the spouse of a former President during a former President’s lifetime, the surviving spouse of a former President until the surviving spouse’s death or remarriage.""

Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wisc., who introduced the legislation, noted that it would help clear the way for a female or gay president to be elected. Pocan, who is the co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, is openly gay.

""The current field of presidential candidates looks more like American society than ever before. We are closer than ever to the possibility that a woman or an LGBT person could hold the country's highest office,"" said Pocan on the House floor. ""Currently federal law does not reflect the reality we could have a female or a gay president as soon as 2021.""

Rep. Doug Collins R-Ga., took the floor to implore the House to vote for the bill.

""I think the bill is a good bill that does exactly what it needs to do and then clarifies for the future and would encourage everyone to vote yes,"" said Collins.

The bill passed by a simple voice vote, with no members of Congress objecting.

The 2020 Democratic field currently features six women running for president: Sens. Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Elizabeth Warren, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, and Marianne Williamson. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg could be the first openly gay president.

It is unclear what future the bill has in the Republican-controlled Senate, or if President Donald Trump would sign the legislation.

Obama-era DHS secretary hits 2020 Dem candidates for 'extreme' and 'unworkable' immigration ideas,https://www.foxnews.com,"['David Montanaro', 'David Montanaro Is An Editor With Fox News.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/obama-era-dhs-secretary-hits-2020-dem-candidates-for-extreme-and-unworkable-immigration-ideas,"Jeh Johnson, who served as former President Barack Obama's Homeland Security secretary, called out Democratic presidential candidates for embracing ""extreme"" policies on immigration, like rejecting the deportation of those here illegally and decriminalizing illegal border crossings.

""We cannot, as some Democratic candidates for president now propose, publicly embrace a policy not to deport those who enter or remain in this country illegally unless they commit a crime. This is tantamount to a public declaration (repeated and amplified by smugglers in Central America) that our borders are effectively open to all; this will increase the recent levels of monthly apprehensions at our southern border -- about or more than 100,000 -- by multiples,"" Johnson wrote in a Washington Post column.

""For the same reason, we cannot formally decriminalize unauthorized entry into this country, though first-time illegal border crossers are, in fact, rarely prosecuted for that misdemeanor (except for last year's disastrous ""zero-tolerance"" policy).""

TLAIB TO PELOSI: 'FOCUS' ON MCCONNELL INSTEAD OF BASHING PROGRESSIVES

Johnson, who served under Obama from 2013 to 2017, wrote that Americans deserve ""straight talk"" on the issue of illegal immigration, touting the previous administration's handling of the problem. He said the Obama administration ramped up assistance to Central American countries and prioritized the deportation of felons.

Johnson defended House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., against far-left critics who claimed she was defeated by Republicans after the House passed a more moderate bill to deal with the influx of migrants at the southern border.

""Give her a break. Those who govern in a democracy know that progress requires compromise, and the speaker made the obvious calculation that it was more important to deliver prompt help to those facing inhumane conditions on the border than it was to delay and hold out for everything House Democrats wanted,"" he wrote, pointing to an overall ""alarming trend"" on both sides of the aisle.

""To win support from a vocal and committed segment of a major party's base -- and simply for the sake of a good applause line -- candidates for office now espouse extreme policy proposals that are unworkable and have no hope of winning the broad support of Congress and the people they represent,"" he argued, adding those who put forth policies that have no chance of becoming law are ""doing a disservice to our democracy.""

""Here is a radical proposal: a presidential candidate who is willing to educate, enlighten and tell voters the hard truths. This trait has all but evaporated in U.S. politics, but it is the single best job qualification for those who aspire to lead. I'm a Democrat, and whoever among the current Democratic field of candidates demonstrates this profile in courage will earn my vote,"" he concluded.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez fired back Saturday night after Pelosi criticized her and other far-left freshmen congresswomen for voting against a $4.6 billion border bill that President Trump signed into law on Monday.

“All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world,” Pelosi said. “But they didn’t have any following. They’re four people and that’s how many votes they got.”

Ocasio-Cortez criticized the Democrats who decided to vote along with Republicans on the spending plan to address issues at the U.S.-Mexico border.

“I don’t believe it was a good idea for Dems to blindly trust the Trump admin when so many kids have died in their custody. It’s a huge mistake,” she wrote. “This admin also refuses to hand over docs to Congress on the whereabouts of families. People’s lives are getting bargained & for what?”"
