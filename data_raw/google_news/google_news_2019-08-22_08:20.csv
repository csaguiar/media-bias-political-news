Trump's contradictions hit a fever pitch,https://www.cnn.com,['Analysis Stephen Collinson'],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/22/politics/donald-trump-economy-guns-republicans-foreign-policy/index.html,"Another exhausting day of the indefatigable commander in chief's compulsive seizing of the spotlight showed how what once would have been considered outrageous has become Washington routine.

And in a half hour encounter with the press he lashed out at his favorite target, his predecessor Barack Obama, who has now been in retirement for two-and-half years, more than 20 times -- an outburst of vitriol impressive even for Trump.

Taken together with a barrage of tweets, Trump's day reflected the sheer oddness of his approach to the presidency and his apparent insecurities nearly three years after being elected.

He could have spoken about historically low unemployment and the election promises he has kept to his loyal supporters on conservative judicial nominations, or sought to ease the summer's mood of fear and discord he has done much to foment.

Or if he had nothing to say, he could have said nothing at all.

Instead, his bullying, erratic performance suggested a state of mind that is unsettled -- and it may be no coincidence that it follows days of talk about the possibility of a recession that could eject him from office and ebbing poll numbers.

Inconsistency on guns and the economy

Trump's careening rhetoric also revealed another characteristic of his presidency -- a lack of policy coherence and consistency from one day to the next on the nation's top political issues.

It's impossible to truly judge where exactly the President stands, for instance, on gun control or the economy after his torrent of words on Wednesday.

His careening back and forth with reporters Wednesday, which weighed in at a whopping 6,000 words when transcribed, helps explain why his White House rarely focuses long enough to get big things done.

At the end, Trump left far more fog about his intentions than had previously existed.

After saying Tuesday that he was looking at tax cuts to stimulate the economy -- even though it didn't need them, as it was in great shape -- he ruled out such an approach. Or maybe he didn't.

""I'm not looking at a tax cut now,"" Trump said, adding, ""I'm not looking at doing indexing and I haven't been seriously looking at it. But certainly it's an option if I wanted it.""

But the day before, the President said he ""would love to do something on capital gains.""

He was similarly opaque on guns -- amid signs he's backsliding on a pledge for action following mass shootings in Texas and Ohio that killed 31 people.

A day after multiple media organizations reported, citing sources close to the President, that he had told National Rifle Association boss Wayne LaPierre that increased gun background checks were off the table, he injected more confusion.

""I have an appetite for background checks. We're going to ... be doing background checks,"" Trump said, then floated an unspecific proposal for ""closing loopholes"" on the backgrounds of gun buyers.

Yet he added credibility to reports suggesting the opposite by adopting the NRA's language that action on gun control would endanger the Second Amendment.

""We can't let that slope go so easy that we're talking about background checks, then all of a sudden we're talking about -- 'Let's take everybody's gun away, ' "" Trump warned.

When a reporter accusing him of peddling NRA talking points, Trump hit back. ""No, it's a Trump talking point.""

This all poses the question: Why is Trump being so unclear?

One explanation could be that the President simply lacks political courage. In the wave of grief after the shootings he wanted to be seen to be open to measures that polls show a majority of Americans strongly support.

But as the massacres faded from news channels, it seems that Trump is now wary of the political price he could incur by testing the pillars of his support to forge change.

Wednesday's performance did not suggest Trump will assume the leadership role that only a President can adopt and use his high popularity among GOP voters to offer cover to Republican senators, which everyone agrees will be needed to tighten background checks.

Can the White House handle an economic crisis?

JUST WATCHED Trump: Irrelevant if trade war hurts economy in short term Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump: Irrelevant if trade war hurts economy in short term 02:33

On the economy, Trump's lack of policy consistency will worry observers who fear that the current White House is ill- equipped to fight a major financial crisis should it come.

And his flip-flopping between boasting about the strength of the economy and then suggesting it needs to be stimulated suggests that the President is worried about what growing warning signs of a recession could hold in store for him -- but is not quite sure what, if anything, he can do about it.

The President's madcap day also reflected his deeply unorthodox view of the office that he holds. Unlike most presidents, Trump did not spend years climbing to the pinnacle of politics. So he has no burning policy issue that he must fulfill -- and is willing to risk his political capital to enact.

Instead, he spent decades whipping up publicity in any way possible through New York tabloids to slake his thirst for attention, good or bad.

With that in mind, Wednesday's spectacle makes sense.

As well as self-aggrandizement, Trump uses the presidency to indulge his prejudices and litigate his personal feuds, hence his incessant attacks on Obama.

He's also used his presidency as an endless appeal to his political base -- conducted though the right-wing media echo chamber.

""We've got a lot of people watching,"" Trump said at one point.

Distributing soundbites to fill the evening's conservative talks shows, Trump again said he was thinking about ending birthright citizenship despite contrary Supreme Court precedent. He raised the prospect of declaring the militant anti-racist left-wing groups known as antifa a terrorist organization.

He again attacked the group of minority Democratic lawmakers known as the ""Squad,"" who he is trying to make the face of their party ahead of 2020. When a reporter told him that his warning for Jews who vote for Democrats was anti-Semitic, he answered: ""It's only anti-Semitic in your head.""

And he pressed home his attack on his possible Democratic opponent next year.

""Joe Biden doesn't have it,"" he said.

Critics might argue that Trump's wild day on Wednesday plays into Biden's argument that he is unfit for office.

The reversals, brittle temper and incoherence on display at the White House might call into question whether the President has ""it"" either.

But one thing's for certain: Trump is not going to change."
"Jay Inslee, climate advocate who called Trump 'white nationalist,' drops out of 2020 presidential race",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jay-inslee-drops-out-of-2020-presidential-race,"Washington Gov. Jay Inslee announced Wednesday night he's ""withdrawing"" from the 2020 presidential race, as the Democrat said ""it's become clear"" he didn't have a shot at winning the primary.

The environmental activist had urged the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to host a debate centered exclusively on climate change -- only to fail to qualify to meet polling thresholds needed to attend the party's upcoming regularly scheduled debate, as well as a CNN town hall dedicated to global warming.

Inslee revealed his decision on MSNBC, saying it's become clear that he won't win. He has kept the option of running for a third term as governor open throughout his presidential campaign but didn't immediately say what his political plans were.

Inslee, 68, became the third Democrat to end his presidential bid after U.S. Rep. Eric Swalwell of California pulled out of the primary last month followed by former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper last week.

The governor’s announcement came hours after he released his six policy proposal on climate change. And it also came hours after he was scheduled to speak at a presidential forum hosted by the Iowa Federation of Labor. Inslee canceled his appearance Wednesday morning, blaming flight cancellations.

On Wednesday, Fox News repeatedly attempted to contact Inslee advisers ahead of his upcoming planned visit to New Hampshire on Thursday, but the campaign went silent and didn’t return calls or emails.

""[I]t became clear that we would not meet the DNC's polling threshold, thus we would not have been invited to the fall debates,"" Inslee said in a press release late Wednesday. ""As a result, I don't believe we can compete for the attention and exposure needed to have a reasonable shot at the nomination.

""As we turn to the future, I will have more to say about what comes next for me in the days ahead,"" Inslee continued. ""I can assure you that I will continue to lead, to demand bold action, and to do everything in my power to ensure the fight to defeat climate change stays at the top of the national agenda.""

INSLEE CALLS TRUMP A 'WHITE NATIONALIST' AT DEBATE

While Inslee had qualified for the first two presidential debates this summer, he struggled to gain traction in the crowded Democratic field and was falling short of the requirements needed to appear on two high-profile stages next month: the third DNC debate in Houston and a CNN town hall in New York focused on climate change.

He had recently hit one of the markers — 130,000 unique donors. But he had yet to reach 2 percent in any poll and would have needed to hit that level of support in four qualifying polls.

Other marginal candidates are in a similar position. Author and Internet favorite Marianne Williamson seemingly hasn't qualified in any polls, and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., apparently has only qualified in one so far, with time running out.

Inslee had sought to use the debates to boost his limited profile. At the July Democratic primary debate, Inslee declared to applause, “We can no longer allow a white nationalist to be in the White House.”

Asked by Fox News after the debate if he had prepared the 'white nationalist' line in advance, Inslee explained ""I thought about it driving over here this afternoon. And it’s true because the White House is such symbol of the United States, of our unity, of the fact that diversity is a strength, not a vice, the fact that we’re a nation of immigrants. But he’s really despoiled it.""

Inslee also targeted the GOP, arguing ""it is sad not only that he (Trump) has done that but worse that the Republican Party has enabled it. They’re complicit in his racism and his white nationalism because they will not speak against it.”

Meanwhile, prominent Democratic presidential contenders sounded notes of support for Inslee.

California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris tweeted late Wednesday that Inslee's ""voice will be missed in this primary,"" and that ""few leaders have done more to shine a light on the climate crisis.""

Inslee is a former congressman and served as Democratic Governors Association chairman in 2018, when the party flipped seven Republican-held gubernatorial seats. He kicked off his campaign in March in Seattle, standing in front of a blue-and-green campaign logo with an arc of the Earth, declaring climate change the nation's most pressing issue.

Inslee was a champion for the clean energy industry in Congress and wrote a book on the topic. And he's pushed for state policies to curb greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming.

On the day he announced his presidential bid, the state Senate passed a key piece of his legislative climate agenda, a measure that seeks to eliminate fossil fuels like natural gas and coal from the state's electricity supply by 2045.

The measure, later passed by the House and signed by Inslee in May, made Washington the fourth in the nation to establish a mandate to provide carbon-free electricity by a targeted date.

A few additional states have enacted legislation related to clean energy requirements since May, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

In a video released Tuesday on Twitter, Inslee thanked supporters for helping him pass the 130,000 individual donor mark.

""Together we have put the climate crisis front and center in the 2020 race,"" he said. ""And thanks to you, every candidate knows they have to have a robust plan to defeat the climate crisis.""

Inslee didn't say whether he planned to seek a third term as governor.

Governors in Washington state aren't subject to term limits, though most haven't served more than two terms. The last three-term governor in Washington was Republican Gov. Dan Evans, who served from 1965 until 1977.

While the filing deadline for the state's 2020 elections isn't until next May, three Democrats have already signaled they will run for governor if Inslee doesn't: Attorney General Bob Ferguson, Commissioner of Public Lands Hilary Franz and King County Executive Dow Constantine. The political dominos continue with Democratic candidates lining up to run for attorney general and lands commissioner if Ferguson and Franz end up not seeking reelection to their posts.

A few Republicans have already announced plans to run for governor, including Phil Fortunato, a state senator, and Loren Culp, the police chief of Republic, in eastern Washington. A Republican has not occupied the governor's office in more than three decades.

President Donald Trump claimed to laughter on Wednesday that he sought to give himself a Medal of Honor, but decided not to after being counseled against the move by aides.

The offhand remark from the president came during his address to the 75th annual national convention of American Veterans, a volunteer-led veterans service organization also known as AMVETS.

At the event in Louisville, Kentucky, Trump singled out for praise WWII veteran and Medal of Honor recipient Woody Williams.

“Thank you, Woody. You’re looking good, Woody. Woody’s looking good,” Trump said.

“That was a big day, Medal of Honor. Nothing like the Medal of Honor,” he continued. “I wanted one, but they told me I don't qualify, Woody. I said, 'Can I give it to myself anyway?' They said, 'I don't think that's a good idea.'”

Amid scattered chuckles, Trump concluded: “Great, great people. These are great, great men and women that get congressional Medal of Honor. Thank you, Woody.”

The president’s assessment that he should receive the nation’s highest award for acts of military valor followed his statement earlier Wednesday afternoon that he is “the chosen one” in relation to his administration’s trade conflict with China — a proclamation he turned to the sky to deliver.

Trump never served in the military and was granted five draft deferments — four for college and one for bone spurs in his heel."
Trump signs executive order cancelling student loan debt for disabled veterans,https://www.foxnews.com,"[""Andrew O'Reilly""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-signs-executive-order-cancelling-student-loan-debt-for-disabled-veterans,"President Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday that forgives all student loan debt for any permanently disabled U.S. military veterans.

The order, which Trump signed following a speech at the American Veterans National Convention in Louisville, Ky., also clears those eligible veterans from having to pay any federal income tax on the loans. Trump added that he is pressuring individual states to follow suit.

“The debt of these disabled veterans will be completely erased,” Trump said. “That’s hundreds of millions of dollars of student loans debt for our disabled veterans that will be completely erased.”

STUDENTS, FAMILIES STRUGGLE TO REPAY BILLIONS IN CRUSHING LOAN DEBTS

The memo Trump signed directs the government to develop an ""expedited"" process so veterans can have their federal student loan debt discharged ""with minimal burdens."" Currently, just half of the roughly 50,000 disabled veterans who are qualified to have their federal student loan debt forgiven have received the benefit because of a burdensome application process.

Under the current process, disabled veterans can have their debt forgiven under a loan forgiveness program, called Total and Permanent Disability Discharge, or TPD, as long as they have a VA service-connected disability rating of 100 percent. As of July, however, only about 20 percent of the eligible pool of veterans had taken advantage of the program due to the complicated nature of the application and other factors.

Trump’s announcement comes days after the administration hired a longtime student loan industry executive to be the federal government's top watchdog for the student loan market. Robert Cameron will serve as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's new student loan ombudsman, the bureau said Friday.

It's a job designed to protect student loan borrowers from poor practices in the student loan industry and one of the few positions explicitly named in the Dodd-Frank Act, the law passed after the 2008 financial crisis that created the bureau. It's considered the go-to office for borrowers who have complaints about their loans. Cameron most recently worked at the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency, better known as FedLoan Servicing, as its head of compliance and risk mitigation.

PHEAA has been cited for poor industry practices, most notably for how it has handled the troubled Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, a program designed to allow student loan borrowers who work in public service jobs to get part of their loan balances forgiven.

The executive order also comes as student loan forgiveness has become a major talking point among the 2020 Democratic presidential primary candidates, with contenders like Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts pushing plans to completely wipe out student loan debt nationwide.

Currently, Americans hold around $1.6 trillion in student loan debt.

"DHS moves to end limits on detention of migrant families, close 'loophole'",https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dhs-detention-migrant-families,"The Trump administration announced Wednesday it would move to scrap a major court agreement in order to allow for migrant families to be detained longer as their cases are being considered, instead of having to release them after 20 days.

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, in a press conference detailing the decision, claimed that the long-standing court order known as the Flores agreement has incentivized illegal immigration and represents a ""loophole"" in the immigration system.

That agreement prohibited children from being kept in detention for more than 20 days. As a result, officials were releasing entire families to keep them from being separated -- though last year, the administration did separate families as part of a ""zero tolerance"" program that eventually was stopped amid a bipartisan outcry.

BORDER PATROL NABS NEARLY 200 CENTRAL AMERICAN MIGRANTS NEAR NEW MEXICO PORT OF ENTRY

""Today, the government has issued a critical rule that will permit the Department of Homeland Security to appropriately hold families together and improve the integrity of the immigration system,” McAleenan said. “This rule allows the federal government to enforce immigration laws as passed by Congress and ensures that all children in U.S. government custody are treated with dignity, respect, and special concern for their particular vulnerability.”

The Flores ruling came about as a result of a 1980s case in which a girl named Jenny Flores, then 15, was detained with adults by U.S. authorities after she fled El Salvador. Beginning in 1997, the Flores settlement called for migrant children to be sent to care programs after 20 days, and be given access to medical treatment and visits with relatives. McAleenan said the new rule takes the place of Flores, while keeping many of its terms.

The new rule is slated to go into effect in 60 days, though the change is sure to face a new court challenge.

In July, at a House Oversight Committee hearing on Capitol Hill, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., accused McAleenan and other administration officials of seeking to scrap the Flores Settlement, with the alleged goal ""to keep kids longer"" in custody.

McAleenan pushed back against that characterization. He explained that he wanted to keep families together for the time necessary it takes for immigration proceedings to go through, and for the justice system to make a ruling on the case.

“We want to keep families together through an immigration proceeding that's fair and expeditious in an appropriate setting,” he said. “That can't be done in 20 days with due process.""

Democrats have slammed the detentions as “inhumane."" When the new rule was announced, the ACLU called it ""another cruel attack on children,"" by allowing them to be held for longer than previously allowed.

""The government should NOT be jailing kids, and certainly shouldn’t be seeking to put more kids in jail for longer,"" they said.

Democratic presidential candidate Julián Castro vowed to end all detention if he wins the presidency.

""Separating migrant children from their parents is appalling—but indefinitely detaining families isn’t a better alternative,"" he tweeted after McAleenan's announcement.

Republicans such as Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have claimed that the current system has resulted in children being used, repeatedly, by adults posing as family members to get into the U.S.

“This is a sick system, it’s rotten to its core,” Graham told Fox Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo in July, stating that 30 percent of those who cross into the U.S. with children are “fake families,” and that loopholes are used to let the same children come back over and over, bringing different adults with them.

McAleenan said approximately 6,000 migrants fraudulently presented themselves as families in the past fiscal year.

""No child should be a pawn in a scheme to manipulate our immigration system,"" he said.

In addition to putting an end to the 20-day limit, the plans announced Wednesday also set standards for detention facilities, which have been criticized by members of both parties for not having sufficient resources to keep people in proper living conditions.

""The new rule establishes a high national standard for care of children and families in custody,"" McAleenan said, noting that maintaining proper standards of care is a ""core"" element of the new rule.

Former VA pathologist charged in deaths of 3 veterans,https://www.cbsnews.com,[],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dr-robert-levy-former-va-pathologist-charged-in-deaths-of-3-veterans/,"Little Rock, Arkansas — A pathologist fired from an Arkansas veterans hospital after officials said he had been impaired while on duty was charged Tuesday with involuntary manslaughter in the deaths of three patients. Authorities say he misdiagnosed them and altered their records to try to conceal his mistakes.

A grand jury indictment unsealed Tuesday charged Dr. Robert Morris Levy in the patients' deaths and on multiple charges of fraud and making false statements for his alleged attempts to conceal his substance abuse and incorrect diagnoses.

""In doing so, he was allowed to stay employed with the Veterans Administration, thus earning a salary, benefits and possibly a bonus,"" Duane Kees, the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Arkansas, said at a news conference in Fayetteville, referring to the Department of Veterans Affairs by its former name.

Levy, 53, who worked at the Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks in Fayetteville, was paid an annual salary of $225,000, according to the indictment. He was fired from the hospital in April 2018.

In this Aug. 17, 2019, file photo provided by the Washington County, Arkansas Sheriff's Department, Robert Levy is pictured in a booking photo. Washington County Sheriff's Dept.

VA officials said in January that outside pathologists reviewed nearly 34,000 cases handled by Levy and found more than 3,000 errors or missed diagnoses dating back to 2005. Levy has acknowledged that he once showed up to work at the Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks drunk in 2016, but he denied that he had worked while impaired. He entered an in-patient treatment program following that incident and returned to work in October 2016 after agreeing to remain sober and submitting to random drug testing.

Levy, who was being held at the Washington County jail, pleaded not guilty at a hearing Tuesday. Kees said that as of Tuesday morning, Levy had not obtained counsel to represent him in the case.

In the deaths, Levy is accused of falsifying entries in his patients' records after making incorrect and misleading diagnoses. In one case, a patient died of prostate cancer after Levy determined that his biopsy showed he didn't have cancer, prosecutors allege.

Prosecutors say a second patient died of squamous cell carcinoma after Levy misdiagnosed the patient with another form of carcinoma. In a third case, the indictment says, a patient with small cell carcinoma was treated for a type of cancer he didn't have following an incorrect diagnosis by Levy, and died.

In two cases, he's accused of falsifying patients' medical records to state that a second pathologist agreed with his diagnosis.

Prosecutors say Levy received bonuses in 2016 and 2017 that were based in part on him reporting that his clinical errors were less than 5%. But, according the indictment, almost 10% of the diagnoses he made had clinical errors.

""These charges send a clear signal that anyone entrusted with the care of veterans will be held accountable for placing them at risk by working while impaired or through other misconduct,"" VA Inspector General Michael Missal said.

Levy ingested 2-methyl-2-butanol, a chemical that would intoxicate him but that standard drug and alcohol screenings don't test for, according to the indictment. Levy is accused of lying to hospital officials when he told them he wasn't under the influence of any intoxicants. Levy is charged with multiple counts of mail and wire fraud for his purchase of the chemical.

U.S. Attorney Kees said at a news conference Levy ""had the medical expertise, the knowledge, the skill set and the equipment to know exactly how much of this substance to take. He had the equipment to measure it out precisely, and he had the knowledge to know how to ingest it so it wouldn't be fatal.""

The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) said that ingesting between 18 and 27 grams of the chemical can produce signs of intoxication and cause unconsciousness after only 30 minutes, according to CBS Fort Smith, Arkansas, affiliate KFSM-TV. The NCBI also reportedly said that the effects can persist until the next day, and can include daylong sleeping and weeks of recovery.

If convicted of all counts, Levy faces a sentence of up to 524 years in prison and $7.75 million in fines, Kees said."
Trump says his mileage rules make cars safer. His EPA was worried they will kill more people.,https://www.vox.com,['Aug'],08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.vox.com/2019/8/21/20826601/trump-auto-company-fuel-economy-california,"President Trump on Wednesday tweeted a defense of his administration’s weakening of fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks, citing safety benefits. It’s a change that automakers have already said they don’t want. And according to internal emails from the Environmental Protection Agency released in 2018, the rule change would increase highway fatalities.

In fact, four car companies — Volkswagen, BMW, Ford, and Honda — signed a surprise deal with the state of California earlier this summer to set stricter mileage rules for themselves than what the Trump administration proposed.

My proposal to the politically correct Automobile Companies would lower the average price of a car to consumers by more than $3000, while at the same time making the cars substantially safer. Engines would run smoother. Very little impact on the environment! Foolish executives! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 21, 2019

According to the New York Times, this sudden side deal with California so infuriated the White House that a senior official summoned leaders from Toyota, Fiat Chrysler, and General Motors in July to pressure them to support the administration’s policy.

But once the deal was announced, several other car companies said they were open to signing on as well. Mercedes-Benz is now preparing to join the California accord, the New York Times reported.

The California agreement would put car companies on course to average 51 miles per gallon across all their sales by 2026. This is weaker than the standard set under President Obama, but much stronger than Trump’s proposal.

The Obama rules restricted tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide from light-duty vehicles but gave companies several ways to comply. Meeting that target just by increasing fuel economy would have required car companies to average 54.5 miles per gallon across sales of cars, trucks, SUVs, and crossovers by 2025.

Some car companies thought this target was too aggressive, so when Trump came to office, these manufacturers petitioned to have the standard revised. But carmakers got way more than they bargained for: The Trump administration decided to freeze mileage standards after 2020, which would hold average fuel economy at just 37 miles per gallon.

The state of California, which has a waiver from federal rules to set its own fuel economy and emissions standards, said it wanted to uphold the Obama standard. In response, the EPA threatened to revoke California’s waiver.

That put California and the federal government on a collision course, with car manufacturers in the middle. California is the largest market for new cars in the United States, so it’s impossible for carmakers to ignore. Another 12 states and the District of Columbia have also adopted California’s vehicle emissions standards.

So auto companies were faced with the prospect of having two very different standards to meet across the country, or having to wait for the dust to settle from what was sure to be a long, messy legal fight.

To justify the rollback, the Trump administration has cited safety as its main concern. The reasoning is that new cars are safer than old cars, but forcing carmakers to meet tougher efficiency rules makes new cars more expensive. That means people end up driving their older, less safe cars for longer, according to the EPA’s published analysis.

The EPA publicly said the Trump rule change would save 1,000 lives per year, but an internal email from staffers obtained by the Associated Press showed that they expected the revision to actually increase highway deaths by 17 per year, undermining the EPA’s bizarre rationale.

Increasing fuel economy is an important tool for limiting air pollution and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The transportation sector is now the largest source of carbon dioxide in the United States. Cars and trucks account for about 20 percent of all US carbon emissions.

So why is the Trump administration so insistent on relaxing a regulation beyond what the auto industry wants? Because oil producers want cars and trucks to use more fuel. As the New York Times reported in December, oil companies see higher fuel efficiency standards as a threat:

The industry had reason to urge the rollback of higher fuel efficiency standards proposed by former President Barack Obama. A quarter of the world’s oil is used to power cars, and less-thirsty vehicles mean lower gasoline sales. In recent months, Marathon Petroleum also teamed up with the American Legislative Exchange Council, a secretive policy group financed by corporations as well as the Koch network, to draft legislation for states supporting the industry’s position. Its proposed resolution, dated Sept. 18, describes current fuel-efficiency rules as “a relic of a disproven narrative of resource scarcity” and says “unelected bureaucrats” shouldn’t dictate the cars Americans drive.

But as the recent California deal shows, car companies would prefer to have stable regulations, even if it means a tougher standard for themselves."
Migrant Families Would Face Indefinite Detention Under New Trump Rule,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Michael D. Shear', 'Zolan Kanno-Youngs']",08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/21/us/politics/flores-migrant-family-detention.html,"“This is yet another cruel attack on children, who the Trump administration has targeted again and again with its anti-immigrant policies,” said Madhuri Grewal, the federal immigration policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union. “The government should not be jailing kids, and certainly shouldn’t be seeking to put more kids in jail for longer. Congress must not fund this.”

The administration first proposed the rule last fall, allowing the public to comment on the potential regulation. It is scheduled to be published Friday in the Federal Register and would take effect 60 days later, though administration officials concede that the expected court challenge will probably delay that happening.

Withdrawing from the consent decree has been a personal objective for Stephen Miller, the architect of Mr. Trump’s immigration policy. The New York Times reported in April that Mr. Miller berated the former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Ronald D. Vitiello, for not finishing the rule more quickly. Mr. Vitiello later had his nomination withdrawn by Mr. Trump, who said he was not tough enough for the job.

[The Flores agreement protected migrant children for decades.]

If the new rule goes into effect, the administration would be free to send families who are caught crossing the border illegally to a family residential center to be held for as long as it takes for their immigration cases to be decided.

Mr. McAleenan said families would be detained until they were either released after being awarded asylum or deported to their home countries. Some families might be awarded parole to leave the facilities while the courts decide their fate, he said.

Almost 475,000 members of families have crossed the southwestern border in the past 10 months, Mr. McAleenan said, a number he said was three times the previous record for a full year. He said the number of apprehensions of families crossing illegally was up 469 percent from the previous year."
Trump attacks Ford Motor for not backing fuel economy rollback,https://www.cnbc.com,[],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/22/trump-attacks-ford-motor-for-not-backing-fuel-economy-rollback.html,"Jim Hackett of Ford Motor speaks at an event during the 2018 North American International Auto Show (NAIAS) in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., on Jan. 14, 2018.

U.S. President Donald Trump stepped up a series of attacks on automakers on Wednesday for not backing his administration's plan to roll back Obama-era fuel efficiency rules, singling out Ford Motor in particular for backing a deal with California for stricter fuel economy standards.

Ford is one of four automakers, along with Honda Motor, BMW AG and Volkswagen AG , that reached a voluntary agreement with California on fuel efficiency rules, defying Trump and his administration's effort to strip the state of the right to fight climate change by setting its own standards.

The rules under the California plan are looser than the Obama-era regulations but stricter than what the Trump has proposed.

Trump said company founder Henry Ford would be ""very disappointed if he saw his modern-day descendants wanting to build a much more expensive car, that is far less safe and doesn't work as well, because execs don't want to fight California regulators.""

Ford said in a statement that it is focused on acting to protect the environment while also protecting the affordability of vehicles. ""This agreement with California provides regulatory stability while reducing CO2 more than complying with two different standards,"" it said.

There is no evidence that existing fuel economy rules would degrade vehicle performance. And environmentalists and many states challenge Trump's assertion that his administration's proposed rule would boost vehicle safety or dramatically reduce the price of vehicles — and argue that consumers will save more in reduced fuel costs under the Obama rules.

California Attorney General Xavier Becerra responded to Trump's attacks on automakers saying it would result in an additional 540 million metric tons of greenhouse gases and other harms. ""This doesn't look like a better alternative to us,"" he said.

The White House has urged other automakers not to back the California agreement, while Democrats have been calling and writing automakers urging them to sign on with California.

The Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday ridiculed the voluntary framework, which it said ""so far has been nothing more than a press release.""

""My proposal to the politically correct Automobile Companies would lower the average price of a car to consumers by more than $3000, while at the same time making the cars substantially safer. Engines would run smoother. Very little impact on the environment! Foolish executives!"" Trump tweeted earlier.

Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, representing General Motors, Toyota Motor, Ford, Volkswagen and others, said the companies ""look forward to seeing a final rule soon. We support increases to standards that optimize all the priorities, including affordability so more Americans can buy a new car, plus preserving jobs and safety at the same time.""

GM has not backed the voluntary agreement, arguing that it does not properly credit the company's electric vehicles.

Even so, Trump tweeted that the founders of Ford and GM ""are 'rolling over' at the weakness of current car company executives"" over the fuel rules, adding: ""Crazy!""

GM did not immediately comment.

Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said Trump's tweet was completely untrue. ""Trump's rollback is unraveling from every corner,"" he said.

All major automakers are on record saying they oppose the administration's ""preferred option"" announced in August 2018, which would freeze fuel economy requirements at 2020 levels through 2026.

Trump's tweet misstated some aspects of the administration's proposal, expected to be finalized sometime after late September. The proposal said that by the 2030 model year, the average price increase of a new vehicle would be reduced by $1,850 and consumers would pay $490 less for financing, insurance and taxes. There is nothing in the administration's proposed revisions that would result in engines running more smoothly.

The Trump plan's preferred alternative would hike U.S. oil consumption by about 500,000 barrels per day in the 2030s while reducing automakers' collective regulatory costs by more than $300 billion. It would bar California from requiring automakers to sell a rising number of electric vehicles or setting state emissions rules.

The administration says the increased fuel use would hike the average global temperature by 3/1000th of one degree Celsius by 2100, but would save thousands of lives over the next 30 years — in part because consumers would more quickly buy safer, cheaper vehicles. Environmentalists and many states reject that analysis.

The Obama-era rules adopted in 2012 called for a fleet wide fuel efficiency average of 46.7 miles per gallon by 2025, with average annual increases of about 5%, compared with 37 mpg by 2026 under the Trump administration's preferred option.

But on a trip on Tuesday to New York, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with Ronald S.

He then met with a conservative group, the Committee to Unleash Prosperity, which routinely hosts events with prospective candidates. That meeting included Steve Forbes, the chairman of Forbes Media; the economist Arthur B. Laffer; and John A. Catsimatidis, a former New York City mayoral candidate.

Mr. Pompeo’s itinerary gave only more credence to the regular talk in Washington that Mr. Pompeo was seriously weighing a run for Senate from Kansas, a step favored by Republicans worried about holding the seat next year but one that would leave a hole in the top ranks of President Trump’s national security team.

People close to Mr. Pompeo declined to comment on his intentions, saying only that he was “focused” on his role as secretary of state."
"Please stop washing your poultry, USDA warns in new study",https://www.kgun9.com,[],08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.kgun9.com/news/national/please-stop-washing-your-poultry-usda-warns-in-new-study,"When it comes to chicken cleanliness, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has a recommendation: stop washing your poultry.

A study from the USDA shows that people are putting themselves at risk of illness when they rinse or wash raw poultry, the agency said in a press release Monday.

The study conducted by the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service was done in partnership with North Carolina State University and examined how home cooks handle raw meat. It also examined how the handling of raw meat can affect the cleanliness of other food nearby.

Here's how it worked: 300 participants prepared chicken and salad in test kitchens. Some of the participants were shown social media messages warning against washing poultry before they prepared their food while another group was not shown the messages.

""The food safety messages in the emails effectively encouraged participants not to wash raw chicken thighs before cooking,"" the study states, with 93 percent of participants heeding the warning they were shown.

Of the control group participants — who were not shown the social media warnings on poultry washing — 61 percent washed their poultry before cooking it.

Among the people who reported washing their poultry when cooking at home, 30 percent said they did it to remove blood and slime while 19 percent said they did it because that's how a family member does it.

It may not seem like a big deal to rinse chicken but it affects the cleanliness of nearby food, the study showed. Among the group of people who washed their poultry, nearly 30 percent of their lettuce used for salads was contaminated with chicken bacteria. This figure was only 20 percent among the people who didn't wash their chicken.

The culprit? Cross-contamination from washing poultry.

""Even when consumers think they are effectively cleaning after washing poultry, this study shows that bacteria can easily spread to other surfaces and foods, "" said Mindy Brashears, the USDA’s Deputy Under Secretary for Food Safety. ""The best practice is not to wash poultry.”

The USDA recommends the following steps to help prevent illness when preparing poultry or meat in the home:

Veteran's widow speaks out after former VA doctor charged in 3 deaths,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Omar Villafranca'],08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/veterans-affairs-pathologist-charged-robert-levy-involuntary-manslaughter-widow-speaks-out-today-2019-08-21/,"Fayetteville, Arkansas — The indictment of a former doctor at a VA hospital in Arkansas is sending shock waves through the nation's largest health care system. Dr. Robert Morris Levy, 53, is accused of involuntary manslaughter in the deaths of three patients — and he could be responsible for the deaths of at least a dozen others.

Kathy McCoy's husband, Michael, died late last year. He was a proud grandfather of 10 and a retired Army sergeant. In 2014, he went to an Arkansas VA complaining of pain in his leg.

""He was in constant pain. It got to where at the end he couldn't walk … he would crawl a lot,"" McCoy told CBS News. ""They kept saying it was arthritis.""

She said it ended up being a blood clot in the leg.

McCoy's case is one of thousands under review after VA pathologist Robert Levy was accused of manslaughter in the deaths of at least three veterans by misdiagnosis or falsifying their diagnoses.

""We looked at the most serious cases and the cases that were the most prosecutable and those are the three cases that we feel confident that we can take into court and get a conviction,"" Duane Kees, the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Arkansas, said.

Levy was chief pathologist at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center of the Ozarks for more than a decade, but he was fired last year after he was accused of working while drunk.

The federal indictment accuses him of practicing while intoxicated by drinking a potent form of alcohol called 2-methyl-2-butanol — or 2M2B — a form of alcohol that can't be detected in a common drug and alcohol test.

Levy can be seen in police bodycam footage said to be from a 2018 DUI stop. It was released by a law firm representing some of his alleged victims.

An 18-month VA investigation into more than 30,000 cases under Levy's supervision found 3,029 showed errors or misdiagnoses, and concluded they may have led to at least 15 deaths, some from cancer.

McCoy explained that her husband felt like he trusted a system that ultimately failed him.



""I think there, at the end, he knew they had failed him,"" she said.

McCoy is buried here at the Fort Smith National Cemetery. But his family wonders if a proper diagnosis could have saved his life. In a statement, Levy said he's innocent and will defend himself vigorously.

If convicted of all counts, Levy faces a sentence of up to 524 years in prison and $7.75 million in fines, Kees said."
"As big cuts in foreign aid loom, State Department again endures resignations, turmoil",https://www.latimes.com,"['Staff Writer', 'Tracy Wilkinson', 'Tracy Wilkinson Covers Foreign Affairs The Los Angeles Times', 'Washington', 'D.C.']",08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2019-08-21/state-department-resignations-cuts,"Saying he could no longer be “complicit” in the Trump administration, Chuck Park, an eight-year State Department veteran most recently posted to a U.S. consulate in Mexico, last week became the latest American diplomat to publicly and pointedly call it quits.

“Over three tours abroad, I worked to spread what I believed were American values: freedom, fairness and tolerance,” Park wrote in an essay. “But more and more I found myself in a defensive stance, struggling to explain to foreign peoples the blatant contradictions at home.”

The ranks of the United States’ foreign policy establishment are being roiled once again by resignations, reports of partisan intimidation and looming massive cuts in foreign aid that critics in Congress and elsewhere contend weaken American diplomacy worldwide.

When Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo took over the State Department 16 months ago, there was a surge in optimism that a dispirited corps would be reinvigorated after a tumultuous year of budget cuts and bungled management under former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson.

But morale is sinking amid signs that American foreign policy is now being dictated unchecked by a shoot-from-the-hip president and executed by a secretary of State with the political savvy to actually implement those controversial policies.

That includes efforts to essentially revamp the United States’ asylum programs, proceed with arms sales to Saudi Arabia despite bipartisan congressional opposition following the gruesome murder of a U.S.-based journalist in a Saudi consulate, and overturning of decades of U.S. policy in the Middle East by moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to the disputed city of Jerusalem and recognizing Israeli sovereignty over Golan Heights.

In parts of the world and international venues where American influence was once king, the United States has lost influence or is not present, critics say. Pompeo has declined to get involved in a delicate dispute between Japan and South Korea, two key Asian allies whose cooperation is central to regional stability and negotiations with nuclear-armed North Korea.

Pompeo will not attend this week’s Group of 7 meeting of the world’s top advanced democracies, leaving it to Trump –- who last year stormed away from the summit and refused to sign a final document, the first time that has happened. A communique this week from Western democracies offering support to the Hong Kong protesters facing off with China was signed by major world powers, but not the United States.

And in the coming days, the White House is expected to maneuver around legal hurdles to attempt to slash as much as $4 billion in U.S. foreign aid that supports critical programs around the world, including peace-keeping missions, and development, educational and human rights projects.

“We are not in a good place for dealing with the next super-crisis overseas, nor ongoing great power competition,” said Barbara Leaf, a retired 34-year veteran of the foreign service whose last post was as ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, on Twitter. In an interview, she added, “We have lost decades of expertise vital to our national interests ... and we are stepping back a degree from the international engagement of the last 75 years that shaped” the world order.

For many diplomats like Park, the unconventional Trump approach has triggered an intense debate about whether to stay and promote good diplomacy, or leave an administration that violates their values. In social chat rooms and private conversations, they discuss what one diplomat called the “morality” of their work.

One of State’s most senior officials, the assistant secretary in charge of the Western Hemisphere, Kimberly Breier, abruptly resigned this month after reportedly clashing with White House advisor Stephen Miller over his aggressive immigration policies. Several people said they expected additional departures in the coming weeks.

Another diplomat told The Times this week he was quitting in part because Pompeo’s State Department seemed to have little use for input from its experienced foreign service officers. “We are serving a secretary of State who largely agrees with the president” instead of offering alternative viewpoints, said the diplomat, who is based in Latin America and requested anonymity because his resignation is pending. State’s “is a largely empowering voice,” he added.

Trump and Pompeo defend their policies, arguing the United States can no longer be the world’s police force or its benefactor. They say they are promoting a doctrine of “America first” that puts top priority on the prosperity and security of U.S. citizens.

But critics warn that could lead to U.S. isolation. “What we’re seeing, I think, is the institutionalization of America alone,” said Heather Conley, who heads the Europe program at the nonpartisan Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Other countries are trying to figure out who takes up the new mantle and [whether] can they hold on … until the U.S. returns to that leadership role, if it will.”

Speaking this week to the United Nations Security Council in New York, Pompeo defended the administration’s conduct of foreign policy, saying it was “reviving” America’s leadership role by joining multilateral efforts that are “meaningful,” “effective” and “reflect the values of freedom-loving societies,” such as the battle against Islamic State terrorism.

But in State Department ranks, there are frustrations on other fronts as well. A new report by the Inspector General’s office documents cases of Trump loyalists appointed to senior positions inside the department who went on to demand fealty to the administration and often berated and abused those they believed fell short.

The report recounted cases of “harassment” of career employees “premised on claims that they were ‘disloyal’ based on their perceived political views.”

Focusing on the State Department’s internal divisions over the United Nations and other multilateral organizations, investigators described a “negative and vindictive” environment in which one political appointee, senior advisor Mari Stull, punished and dressed down those she believed undermined Trump. She removed one senior official from the office and drove away dozens more, according to the report. She reportedly scrubbed officers’ social media, blacklisted those she deemed insufficiently loyal to Trump and labeled them “traitors,” it concluded.

Stull, who left the administration earlier this year, was formerly a food-industry lobbyist who came to the State Department from a wine blog she produced under the name Vino Vixen. She told those who complained that their objections were “pointless,” the report said, because “the Trump administration ‘has my back.’”

The inspector’s report also cited her boss, assistant secretary Kevin Moley, for failing to respond to complaints and granting her an “unprecedented level of independence,” according to an internal memo. He denied to investigators “the behavior attributed to me,” and remains in office.

A second inspector general report is underway on other alleged abuses, including the firing of a diplomat of Iranian descent, according to people familiar with the probe.

In cutting foreign aid, it remains unclear which programs will be targeted and how much money will be lost. To slash the money, the White House is attempting a workaround by submitting the proposed cuts late in the fiscal year so that Congress will not have time to act. The “rescission” package, as it is known, freezes foreign-aid money that Congress already approved for a 45-day review period. The fiscal year ends in Sept. 30, meaning the money will almost certainly go unspent and be returned to the U.S. Treasury.

The administration argues the action will help reduce the budget deficit. Agencies likely to be affected denied this, noting the money is a tiny fraction of the overall government budget.

Gayle Smith, former administrator of U.S. AID and president of the One Campaign, a global group that fights poverty and preventable disease, said the rescission move was “as ineffective as it is shameful.” It will “undermine U.S. leadership around the world,” she said, “subvert Congress’ spending authority ... and chip away at really powerful relationships” with private sectors, universities, civil societies and other non-governmental entities in scores of countries.

Trump this week said he was willing to listen to members of Congress but that he planned to go ahead with cuts. He argued that taking money away from countries or groups, citing Pakistan and the Palestinians, makes them more pliable in negotiations, though history has showed otherwise.

Opposition in Congress has come from both sides of the aisle. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) said the maneuver is illegal. Even Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said taking money from critical State Department programs “only undermines our national security interests and emboldens our adversaries.”

"President Trump decision to end DACA was lawful, Justice Department says",https://www.foxnews.com,['Danielle Wallace'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/president-trump-decision-to-end-daca-was-lawful-justice-department-supreme-court,"The Justice Department submitted a legal brief to the Supreme Court Monday that stated President Trump acted lawfully when he decided to end the Obama-era immigration program known as DACA in September of 2017, according to a new report.

The Department of Homeland Security, “correctly, and at a minimum reasonably, concluded that DACA is unlawful,” Justice Department lawyers wrote in a brief submitted to the Supreme Court late Monday.

SUPREME COURT TO DECIDE WHETHER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CAN END DACA PROGRAM

The Supreme Court will begin to hear arguments in November. A ruling is expected in the presidential election year, putting the high court at the center of one of the most politically charged issues of debates. A decision in favor of Trump would allow for the president to deport more than one million young adults residing in the U.S. under DACA protection, the New York Times reported.

Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, was created under an executive order in 2012. The program gives some illegal immigrants -- known as ""Dreamers"" -- who were brought to the United States as children-- the opportunity to receive a renewable two-year reprieve from deportation and become eligible for a work permit.

In 2017, the Trump administration announced its plan to phase out the program, but federal courts have ruled that the phase-out could not apply retroactively and that the program should be restarted.

The White House fought back on those decisions, saying the president has broad authority over immigration enforcement policy. Federal appeals courts around the country have rejected efforts by the federal government to move ahead with phasing out the Obama-era program.

DACA proponents have also argued that Trump’s planned termination of the program violates federal law requiring adequate notice-and-comment periods before certain federal rules are changed, as well as other constitutional equal protection and due process guarantees.

A decision from the Supreme Court to end DACA could galvanize young Americans to ensure Trump does not see another four years in the White House, the Times report stated. On the other hand, if the Court chooses to continue the Obama-era program, conservatives could argue Trump needs another four years to fulfill his campaign promises on immigration.

USDA cuts buyout packages for employees who won't relocate,https://www.cnn.com,['Sam Fossum'],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/20/politics/usda-buyouts-kansas-city/index.html,"(CNN) The US Department of Agriculture is shrinking payments offered to employees who applied for buyouts rather than relocate to the greater Kansas City area, according to a document obtained by CNN.

The one-time payouts are being reduced from $25,000 to $10,000 because so many workers applied, according to the document.

The American Federation of Government Employees, which represents workers at the affected agencies, says employees of the two research-related agencies that are being moved out of the the Washington area are ""extremely upset.""

A USDA spokesperson told CNN that the department said the change was made in order to offer payments to all eligible employees, rather than offer only the higher amount on a first-come, first-served basis. Workers still have the option to refuse the reduced payment if they decide to relocate, the spokesperson added.

The change comes after a union-compiled survey released last month showed an overwhelming number of the reassigned employees will likely choose to leave rather than relocate -- losses that could drain institutional knowledge and talent at two units that fund agricultural research across the nation and produce crucial reports, including data on agricultural markets and estimates of US and international agricultural productivity.

Instagram Hoax Fools Department of Energy Head Rick Perry,https://futurism.com,[],,,,https://futurism.com/rick-perry-instagram-hoax,"A hoax meme is currently spreading across Instagram — and Rick Perry, the head of the United States Department of Energy, just fell for it.

The image is nothing more than a huge paragraph of text warning users that Instagram is changing its privacy policy “tomorrow,” and if they don’t repost it, Instagram will have “permission” to use everything they’ve shared on the platform.

“Feel free to repost!! #nothanksinstagram,” Perry wrote alongside the image, which has since been deleted from his Instagram page but still up on his Twitter account at the time of writing.

If we saw the post on our not-so-internet-savvy parents’ Instagram feed, we’d probably roll our eyes and scroll on — but the idea that the person responsible for the United States’ nuclear arsenal fell for the hoax is downright terrifying.

The post is clearly fake for countless reasons, some of which are obvious — part of the word “now” is missing, for example, and some words are only partially bolded.

Others are a bit less conspicuous, such as the reference to the Rome Statute.

The average person might not know that that’s an agreement that established the International Criminal Court, an entity — which, as The Next Web pointed out, the United States isn’t even a member of — tasked with investigating such atrocities as genocide and crimes against humanity.

Think they would care about a social network “stealing” photos of your newborn nephew or your barista’s stellar latte art?

Oh, and that’s the other thing: Instagram doesn’t need to “steal” those photos.

Take a look at the platform’s Terms of Use, and you’ll find that, when you post anything on the site, you “grant to [Instagram] a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings).”

So, to recap, Perry not only couldn’t tell that something was off about the hoax just by looking at it, he also apparently doesn’t know what the Rome Statute is or how social media works in general.

Again, this man is in charge of the U.S.’s nuclear arsenal — and a person with so much power really shouldn’t be this easily fooled.

Trump speech at Shell worksite raises a question: Should bosses mix business and politics?,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Charisse Jones', 'Published P.M.

Buzz60, Buzz60

Is it OK for the boss to make employees mix business with politics?

Some workers and their bosses might be asking that question after employees at a Royal Dutch Shell construction site in Pennsylvania were told that while they didn't have to show up to hear President Donald Trump speak last week, not attending could result in their not being paid .

The scenario was legal, some experts say, though not without controversy.

Trump’s speech took place at a construction site where Shell is building a petrochemical plant.

Employees were given two options: to not go to work that day, which would mean an excused absence, or to come to work and get paid, says Shell spokesman Ray Fisher. Training sessions for employees were held in the morning, from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m., but after that, the site was closed,

“As with most hourly positions, they would not be paid for the hours they did not work,’’ Fisher said in an email. “As a result, they would not be eligible for the maximum overtime available that week.’’

The two choices were given to workers because “it was assumed some would not want to attend,’’ Fisher said, adding that the same options are offered to employees “regardless of who the guest speaker is.’’

But the situation raised the ire of one union leader, whose organization was not involved in the event.

“In a democracy, people should have the right to their own political views, but Trump and Shell embarked on a slippery ethical slope by making a paycheck conditional on attending a glorified campaign rally,'' Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers union, said in an email.

Shell wasn't worried that it would look like it was compelling or coercing workers to attend what could be viewed as a political event, Fisher said.

“This was treated as a training day with a guest speaker who happened to be the president,’’ he said. “We do these several times a year with various speakers. The morning session included safety training and other activities. For those who chose to attend, our guidance was to show respect for the speaker as we would for any guest speaker.’’

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

Some took to Twitter to voice their criticism.

""Companies, be advised: if you encourage your employees and/or contractors to attend the political rallies of a man who separates children from their families, you will be placed on the #GrabYourWallet boycott list,'' Shannon Coulter, who launched the GrayYourWallet campaign, said on Twitter Monday.

But some supported the event.

""The plant was closed the day the President went there,'' read one tweet in response to the threatened Shell boycott. ""Employees could attend, use PTO for the day or take without pay. Very generous on part of the employer. Trump 2020!!!!""

Constant intimidation! The plant was closed the day the President went there. Employees could attend, use PTO for the day or take without pay. Very generous on part of the employer. Trump 2020!!!! — Anna shatkin (@AScardiology) August 20, 2019

And this boycott isn't the kind people forget about 24 hrs later. — Shannon Coulter (@shannoncoulter) August 19, 2019

USA TODAY asked legal and workplace experts for their take on the event.

Is it legal to tie a worker's compensation to showing up at a political event?

""No laws were broken by this type of arrangement,'' says Jay Hornack, an attorney and professor at University of Pittsburgh's law school. ""If an employer is requiring an employee to report to work and perform certain services, or sit and listen to someone speak... then there’s no restriction on employers saying 'This is what we're going to pay the employee to do during this time.' ''

Employees can be required to attend an event like Trump's speech in Pennsylvania because, ""It is, in fact, legal for employers to hold rallies of the kind that Shell held for President Trump, and to require their employees to attend and that’s a result of the Citizens United Supreme Court decision, as well as the decision of the Federal Election Commission not to take further action in some earlier cases of employer coercion,'' says Alexander Hertel-Fernandez, assistant professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University and author of “Politics at Work’’

The high court lifted limits on independent spending by corporations and unions in 2010's Citizens United case.

Is it ethical for employers to ask their employees to participate in such an event?

""Ethically it’s a much more difficult question,'' says Hornack. ""Arguably this situation is one where they ... took away or limited free choice on the part of the workers. That they felt like they really had no choice, because of the money, than to go to the event.''

Hertel-Fernandez agreed. “I think it’s unethical because employers have a really special type of leverage over workers that’s not like the leverage that, say, a political party or a grassroots organization ... might have over you,'' he says, ""That’s because employers are ultimately responsible for cutting the checks that form your wages and your health benefits and pension benefits. And that means employees have a hard time saying no.''

Why are employers doing this?

“In the vast majority of cases, companies do think that by helping the business or the sector that they’re in, they’re ultimately helping their employees as well,'' Hertel-Fernandez says. ""Just like companies have political action committees and lobbyists, so too is it becoming increasingly standard for companies to think about their employees when they’re making these pushes around elections and legislative debates.’’

It can have an impact on lawmakers. ""It's quite compelling for a corporate lobbyist to come in and say 'Hey, I've got 2,000 employees employed in your district who really care about this issue and who are going to vote in the next election.' That’s more compelling than if the corporate lobbyist is just saying we think that this policy should change.''

Is Citizens United the major force behind this shift?

""It actually predates Citizens United,'' Hertel-Fernandez says. ""At the turn of the century, it was quite common for employers to be very involved in their employees political lives, sometimes in pretty egregious ways like giving them ballots to use... or even after the spread of secret ballots, marching employees down to the polling booth to make sure that they voted for the right candidate.’’

Employers began to back away from their workers' political lives in the 1950's, but since the 1990's, Hertel-Fernandez says that trend has reversed.

Still, his research has found that ""rallies like the one that Shell held are the exception ... when it comes to employer political involvement in the workplace,'' he says. ""More common are requests that employees weigh in on legislation that’s pending in Congress or state legislatures. But they still do happen and I think they are a vivid demonstration of the control that employers can exert over their workforce if they’re so inclined. ‘’

Lindsey Graham: Horowitz will offer Senate 'chilling testimony' on FISA abuse,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/lindsey-graham-horowitz-will-offer-senate-chilling-testimony-on-fisa-abuse,"Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham confirmed Wednesday that Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz will testify in front of the committee.

The South Carolina Republican predicted Horowitz will give “chilling testimony” in front of the committee about his highly anticipated report on potential abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act once the report is public.

Graham confirmed the widely expected hearing on the “Wake Up Carolina!” radio show with Ken Ard earlier this morning. Graham said he’d call for Horowitz to explain his report to the American public in an open session, though he did not specify exactly when it might happen.

“He will come to the committee to testify — the chairman — and we’ll make sure he gets all the time he needs to tell the country what happened,” Graham said. “He will be in public. We want to do all of it that we can in the open. We don’t want to have a classified session unless we have to.”



Beginning in October 2016 through June 2017, the FBI and DOJ obtained four FISA warrants and renewals against Trump campaign associate Carter Page. The 412 pages of redacted FISA documents released in 2018 show the DOJ and FBI made extensive use of the dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele, which he put together in 2016 at the behest of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS. The Clinton campaign hired the firm through Marc Elias of the Perkins Coie law firm, and the campaign was briefed about Steele's findings throughout the race.

Steele’s funding from Democrats was never revealed to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.

And newly released FBI interview notes with top DOJ official Bruce Ohr shed light on his role as a conduit between Steele and the FBI in 2016 and 2017, even after the bureau says it cut Steele off as a source for leaking to the media. Ohr told the FBI that Steele was desperate Trump not win and suggested some of Steele's information may have stemmed from ""Russian conspiracy theories."" Ohr's wife, Nellie, worked at Fusion GPS, and Bruce Ohr passed her research along to the FBI too.

Graham said Horowitz would explain “the good, the bad, and the ugly” of his investigation's findings and said the DOJ watchdog’s testimony would be “ugly and damning,” particularly with respect to the unverified. The senator specifically pointed to what he viewed as Steele’s flawed dossier targeting Trump, likely improper surveillance of Page, and the creation of an allegedly false “narrative” about former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos working with the Russians as examples of what Horowitz’s testimony would expose.

Graham also said once Horowitz finishes his report, it will be sent to the Justice Department for a review for any classified information.

“Here’s my goal, Ken — to take this report and make sure this never happens again,” Graham said. “Do we need to change the FISA warrant application? Do we need rules that we don’t have today to open up a counterintelligence investigation into a political campaign? Do we need to restructure the Department of Justice? These are the things that Congress will look at.”

Graham also said he’d spoken with Horowitz a couple days ago, and in explaining why the release of the report had been repeatedly delayed (Barr predicted earlier this year it would come out in May or June), Graham said every time Horowitz comes close to finishing “he finds something else.”

The report is now expected to be released in September or October."
Pompeo announces 'countdown' clock as Iran weapons embargo ends in 2020,https://www.cnn.com,"['Joshua Berlinger', 'Kylie Atwood', 'Jennifer Hansler']",08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/20/middleeast/iran-united-states-intl-hnk/index.html,"(CNN) United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has warned against ending an arms embargo on Iran, likening every day until the deal's October 2020 expiration as a ""#CountdownToTerror.""

The push to extend the ban on weapons sales to Tehran comes amid increasing efforts by Washington to restrict Iran's oil exports. Since the decision by US President Donald Trump in 2018 to abandon the Iran nuclear deal , Washington has attempted to use what it calls ""maximum pressure"" to change Iran's behavior and limit its nuclear ambitions.

""Time is drawing short to continue this activity of restricting Iran's capacity to foment its terror regime. The international community will have plenty of time to see how long it has until Iran is unshackled to create new turmoil, and figure out what it must do to prevent this from happening,"" Pompeo said Tuesday, during an address at the United Nations.

Also on Tuesday, the State Department released what Pompeo termed a ""#CountdownToTerror clock"" tracking the time until the arms embargo and a travel ban on Qasem Soleimani expire next year. Soleimani commands Iran's Quds force , which is responsible for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' overseas activities.

The arms embargo covers all weapons sales and ""related material"" to Iran. It was put in place by the UN and is set to be lifted five years after the adoption of the nuclear deal.

The @UN arms embargo on #Iran and the travel ban on Qasem Soleimani expire in October 2020. Our #CountdownToTerror clock is tracking how long until Iran is unleashed to create new global turmoil. We must not let his happen. https://t.co/4UtnMREgah

Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Pompeo warned the international community against helping ships that are believed to be carrying illicit crude oil from Iran in breach of US sanctions.

Pompeo's comments followed reports that an Iranian tanker called the Bonita Queen was headed to Syria to deliver crude oil.

""We've made clear anyone who touches it, anyone who supports it, anyone who allows a ship to dock, is at risk of receiving sanctions from the United States of America. So if that ship again heads to Syria, we'll take every action we can consistent with those sanctions to prevent them,"" Pompeo said.

A source at the company Tanker Tracker, which tracks top oil exports based on satellite technology, said that the Bonita Queen was sailing toward Syria carrying about 600,000 barrels of oil. The source said Syria illegally receives about 3 million barrels of crude oil a month shipped from abroad.

The Bonita Queen does not fly the Iranian flag, but it is managed by the same company as a tanker now called the Adrian Darya 1, formerly known as the Grace 1.

The Adrian Darya 1 was impounded last month by the UK in Gibraltar on suspicion that it was attempting to carry oil to Syria, in breach of European Union sanctions. The ship was released Sunday , shortly after the United States issued a warrant for its seizure Friday in what appeared to be a last-ditch attempt to stop the tanker.

Iran has maintained that it is not seeking a confrontation and the US actions are tantamount to bullying.

""Iran is not interested in confrontation. We were not the ones who walked away from a carefully negotiated agreement, an agreement that was not exactly what we wanted and certainly not exactly what the US wanted, or Europeans wanted or for that matter not exactly what China and Russia wanted,"" Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Tuesday, referring to the nuclear deal."
New York sues EPA over GE's Hudson River PCB cleanup,https://www.reuters.com,"['Jonathan Stempel', 'Min Read']",08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-new-york-epa/new-york-sues-epa-over-ges-hudson-river-pcb-cleanup-idUSKCN1VB1YM,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday, accusing the agency of prematurely allowing General Electric Co to stop clearing the Hudson River of PCB contamination before the cleanup was finished.

Citing the state’s compelling interest in protecting the public and the environment from contaminants, New York officials are seeking to void GE’s “certificate of completion” from the EPA on April 11, which excused the company from further dredging unless further studies showed more was needed.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Attorney General Letitia James, both Democrats, accused Republican President Donald Trump’s administration of siding with “big polluters” by accepting PCB levels that constitute a known health risk and leave Hudson River fish “too toxic” to eat.

“Since the EPA has failed to hold GE accountable for restoring the river, New York is taking action to demand a full and complete remediation,” Cuomo said in a statement.

The EPA did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but has said its decisionmaking was not politically driven.

GE had spent an estimated $1.7 billion to clean up the river over eight years, including six years of dredging, under a 2006 consent decree.

Mark Behan, a GE spokesman, said the EPA found that the Boston-based company had met its cleanup obligations, and that New York’s own data showed that 99% of sampled locations in the upper Hudson met state cleanup standards.

“Environmental conditions in the Hudson will continue to improve and GE will continue to cooperate,” he added.

New York filed its lawsuit in the federal court in Albany, the state’s capital, seeking to void GE’s completion certificate and block its reissuance until the cleanup is done right.

PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, were used in electrical equipment, carbonless copy paper and other products before a 1979 U.S. manufacturing ban, and are considered possible human carcinogens.

Two since-closed GE capacitor manufacturing plants north of Albany dumped roughly 650 tons of PCBs into the river between 1947 and 1977.

About 200 miles of the river were polluted, stretching as far south as Battery Park in Manhattan, though most pollution occurred in a 40-mile (64-km) zone near the plants.

State officials said about 54 tons of PCBs remain in the upper Hudson, roughly 13 tons more than the EPA expected when it found dredging necessary, and that PCB levels in fish remain three times higher than the agency’s goal."
"Alaskan Joe Balash, a Trump administration leader on ANWR drilling, is leaving the Interior Department",https://www.adn.com,[],08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2019/08/21/alaskan-joe-balash-a-trump-administration-leader-on-anwr-drilling-is-leaving-the-interior-department/,"Joe Balash, an Alaskan with a key role in efforts to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, is leaving his post as an assistant secretary at the Interior Department.

Balash said he will resign Aug. 30 as Interior’s assistant secretary for Land and Minerals Management, according to a resignation letter dated Tuesday and addressed to President Donald Trump.

Balash said in a text early Wednesday that an “opportunity” has come along that he can’t ignore.

He had little else to share about the reason for his departure.

“I’ll have more to say about my next adventure once I have fully separated from the department,"" he said. ""I’m leaving on good terms — it’s all positive.”

Balash has moved aggressively to have the federal government host its first lease sale in ANWR’s coastal plain by the end of this year, setting the stage for drilling there after Congress approved it in 2017.

The Bureau of Land Management, an agency Balash oversees, expects to release a final environmental review early next month that recommends a preferred leasing plan for the ANWR coastal plain. The Interior Department could issue a final decision 30 days after that, opening the door for the lease sale, said Lesli Ellis-Wouters, a BLM spokesperson.

Balash, who oversees oil, gas and mining activities on federal lands, said his absence will not hurt the government’s efforts to permit oil and gas activity in the coastal plain of the 19-million-acre refuge.

“The work is mostly done,” he said by text. “I put together a great team (to) do the work -- and they will remain.”

Alaska’s congressional delegation has often highlighted Balash’s role as critical to the state’s efforts to responsibly develop its natural resources. Sen. Dan Sullivan, to whom Balash was chief of staff until he joined Interior, has said Balash’s role in the Trump administration, alongside other Alaskans, is good for the state’s economic prospects.

Sullivan on Wednesday said Balash worked tirelessly at Interior “to promote the goal of American energy dominance, and understood that Alaska was key to that goal,” Sullivan said. ""In doing so, he has helped set Alaska up for success for years to come. I wish him all the best in his future endeavors.”

Sen. Lisa Murkowski praised Balash for his work on ANWR leasing and for making more federal land eligible for conveyance to the state and Alaska Native corporations, following through on longstanding commitments in federal law.

“Alaska is in a better place because of his leadership and we thank him for his many years of public service,” Murkowski said, adding that the state’s strong ties with Interior will continue.

Balash’s departure will be a “real loss for Alaska,” the Alaska Support Industry Alliance said Wednesday. “Balash was working hard to advance opportunities for drilling in ANWR,” said the trade group, a supporter of resource development.

But Balash has angered conservation groups. And House Democrats are investigating the administration’s rapid push for drilling in ANWR amid questions that Balash may have been involved in suppressing scientists’ concerns about the environmental impacts of drilling, following an investigation by Politico.

Balash said by text on Wednesday that politics has not superseded science as the federal government moves toward a lease sale in the refuge. If that were the case, the administration would have allowed a seismic survey in the refuge last winter, despite concerns from scientists about potential impacts to polar bears from ground-vibrating trucks used to study rock formations.

“If politics was trumping on science on ANWR, we would have permitted the seismic last year,” he said. “We did not.”

Lena Moffitt, with the Sierra Club, said in a statement Wednesday that Balash has ""spearheaded efforts to suppress science, ignore indigenous rights, and sell off the Arctic refuge for drilling at all costs.”

Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said in a Tweet on Tuesday that he and Trump thank Balash for his “exemplary service to the American people.”

Assistant Secretary Joe Balash announced today his plans to move on from @Interior and I stand with @POTUS in thanking him for his exemplary service to the American people. — Secretary David Bernhardt (@SecBernhardt) August 20, 2019

Balash said in his resignation letter that implementing Trump’s executive orders to promote energy independence and economic growth has a been a “career highlight.”

Balash said his accomplishments include guiding the first-ever joint-agency federal decision to advance development at Donlin gold mine in Southwest Alaska, preparing the environmental documents for the lease sale in ANWR, and approving the first-ever oil production facility in federal waters outside Alaska, Hilcorp’s Liberty project.

Balash’s announcement came the day before the New York Times published the results of an investigation raising doubts about the Trump administration’s promise of a windfall for the federal government if drilling takes place in ANWR.

The article does not say that Balash, named to his post in July 2017 by Trump, was involved in those efforts to put a promising spin on the value of drilling there.

Drilling in the refuge over the next decade may produce as little as $45 million, the newspaper said, a figure based on the value of past state and federal lease sales on the North Slope since 1999.

That’s much lower than the $1.8 billion the White House touted in spring 2017 -- before Balash was named to his post -- or the $900 million currently estimated by the Congressional Budget Office.

The article says Interior officials in 2017 removed references to disappointing test wells drilled near the refuge from a final plan to update the refuge’s oil reserves.

Balash said he’s “never seen” any of the drilling results from wells near the refuge."
Justice Dept. tells Supreme Court decision to end DACA was lawful,https://www.cnn.com,"['Ariane De Vogue', 'Cnn Supreme Court Reporter']",08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/20/politics/justice-department-deferred-action-for-childhood-arrivals-supreme-court/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Justice Department told the Supreme Court late Monday night that the Trump administration acted lawfully when it decided in 2017 to wind down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program , which protects undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children from deportation.

""At best, DACA is legally questionable,"" Solicitor General Noel Francisco argued in legal briefs. ""At worst, it is illegal.""

Francisco stressed that the executive branch was within its authority to phase out the Obama-era program and that the lower courts ""erred"" in ""second-guessing"" the Department of Homeland Security's ""entirely rational judgment to stop facilitating ongoing violations of federal law on a massive scale.""

As things stand, two nationwide preliminary injunctions issued by lower courts have forced DHS to continue to allow renewals in the program for nearly two years.

The legal brief comes as the Supreme Court will hear arguments in the case on November 12. The program has become a focal point in the debate over Trump's proposed US-Mexico border wall and efforts to crack down on immigration. A decision siding with the administration could strip protections for nearly 700,000 so-called Dreamers in a case that will come down in the heat of the next election.

Back in 2017, the Trump administration announced it was going to phase out DACA, which it said had been created ""without proper statutory authority.""

The move was immediately challenged in court by the University of California, a handful of states and DACA recipients who argued that the phase-out violated the Administrative Procedure Act, a federal law that governs how agencies can establish regulations.

Courts agreed and issued nationwide injunctions that allowed renewals in the program to continue.

""We conclude,"" wrote a panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, that the rescission of DACA ""is arbitrary, capricious or otherwise not in accordance with law.""

The Trump administration appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, and last June, the justices agreed to hear the appeal for the upcoming term.

At issue before the Supreme Court is not the legality of the program but how the administration decided to wind it down.

In the new briefs, Francisco argues that the decision to terminate the program was reasonable because the Department of Homeland Security had ""serious doubts"" about its legality. He said the decision was ""more than justified by DHS's serious doubts about the lawfulness of the policy and the litigation risks in maintaining it.""

Supporters of the program urged the court to reject the administration's arguments."
Treasury Plan for Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac near complete,https://www.foxbusiness.com,"['Charles Gasparino', 'Lydia Moynihan']",,,,https://www.foxbusiness.com/financials/treasury-plan-for-fannie-and-freddie-nearly-complete-said-to-be-issued-after-labor,"The Treasury Department is putting the final touches on its plan to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a potential major step in the Trump Administration’s effort to release the mortgage giants from more than a decade of government control, the FOX Business Network has learned.

Continue Reading Below

The Treasury Department is expected to have its reform plan in place and ready for public release sometime by September or October, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. Treasury has submitted a draft reform plan to the White House that includes suggestions to end the government control of the mortgage companies, known as Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs), sources say. The White House is expected to provide input as soon as this week, these people add.

Once the White House has signed off on Treasury’s plan, it could kick into high gear the long-awaited and promised reform effort by the Trump Administration to release both mortgage entities from government control. Also, the plan would also feature a recapitalization of both companies which would likely include the end of the government extracting all of the GSEs profits, and possibly a public stock offering to bolster Fannie and Freddie’s balance sheets.

The exact details of the Treasury’s plan are unclear, as is the timing of any proposal to release the companies from the government’s grip given the tricky politics involved in any reform effort. Both Fannie (in 1938) and Freddie (in 1970) were created by acts of Congress and regulated by the federal government to promote homeownership, even as they operated as private companies with publicly traded stocks. The GSEs were placed under federal conservatorship in 2008 during the financial crisis.

Both entities are considered lynchpins of the economically important housing market in that they allow banks to issue 30-year mortgages to homeowners. Without Fannie and Freddie buying those mortgages and repackaging them into bonds, banks would be hard-pressed to make long-term mortgage loans to many working-class Americans.

Meanwhile, Trump Administration officials are said to be mindful that any radical change to the GSEs could shake the housing market during an election year, and negatively impact economic growth. The Treasury reform plan is expected to address those concerns by not calling for an immediate radical overhaul of the companies.

But the plan is expected to reflect the administration’s thinking that the GSE’s need to become more independent from the federal government and that U.S. taxpayers need to be protected from the type of risk-taking that led to the government takeover. The Treasury plan is expected to suggest that the GSEs need to reduce their “footprint” in the housing market, according to these sources. At the moment, Fannie and Freddie control nearly $5 trillion of the nation’s mortgage business.

A Treasury spokesman didn’t respond to an email for comment. A spokeswoman for the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), which is in charge of carrying out the White House plans to reform Fannie and Freddie, declined comment.

On Wednesday, shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac spiked sharply following the FOX Business report on the progress Treasury is making in producing its report. Investors had been selling shares of Fannie and Freddie in recent weeks following news reports that any reform effort may be delayed until the end of the year or even indefinitely.

Investors will pay close attention to the Treasury’s proposal to “recap and release” the companies from government control. A recapitalization of the company’s balance sheet could be positive news to shareholders who have held the stock since the government takeover. Since then both companies have traded as low-value stocks—well below $5 per share -- as the government maintained control of the outfits and siphoned its profits.

Mark Calabria, who was appointed to run FHFA in April, has publicly stated his desire to recapitalize the companies, first by ending the government’s taking of Fannie and Freddie profits (known as the net-worth sweep) and then eventually through a public offering of new stock. Calabria has also said he wants an explicit federal guarantee of Fannie and Freddie’s activities, but that might take an act of Congress, delaying reform even further.

While the Treasury report is expected to discuss recapitalization of the companies it is not expected to address the possibility of a stock issuance, these people say. Under the Treasury’s proposal, it’s unclear how shareholders would fare. A public offering could dilute common shareholders, meaning the value of their shares could fall from their current penny stock levels, but an end to the net-worth sweep might bolster shares.

Those investors holding preferred stock, which offers more protection from dilution, may benefit from any recapitalization.

The Treasury Plan – and a separate plan to be issued by the Department of Housing and Urban Development – may be light on specifics on exactly when these changes will take place, but at least on paper, both will provide the first tangible steps in the reforming GSE’s and their giant share of the housing market.

"Mike Pompeo, the Secretary of Trump",https://www.newyorker.com,"['Susan B. Glasser', 'Andrew Marantz', 'Andy Borowitz', 'Wendi Aarons', 'Kj Dell Antonia', 'Douglas Preston', 'Helen Rosner', 'Adam Entous', 'Dexter Filkins']",08-26-2019,2019,8,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/08/26/mike-pompeo-the-secretary-of-trump,"In the winter of 2016, Donald Trump was roaring through the primaries, and Mike Pompeo was determined to stop him. Pompeo, a little-known congressman from Wichita, helped persuade Marco Rubio to make a late stand in Kansas. Like many Republicans in Congress, Pompeo believed that Rubio had the national-security knowledge and the judgment to be President, and Trump did not. Urged on by Pompeo, Rubio’s team pulled money out of other states to gamble on winning the Kansas caucus. It was one of the few remaining contests in which Rubio still hoped to beat Trump, who, he said, was a “con artist” about to “take over the Republican Party.” On March 5th, Trump and Senator Ted Cruz, of Texas, arrived in Wichita for the caucus. Rubio left his closing argument to Pompeo, who told the crowd at the Century II arena, “I’m going to speak to you from the heart about what I believe is the best path forward for America.” An Army veteran who finished first in his class at West Point, Pompeo cited Trump’s boast that if he ordered a soldier to commit a war crime the soldier would “go do it.” As the audience booed, Pompeo warned that Trump—like Barack Obama—would be “an authoritarian President who ignored our Constitution.” American soldiers “don’t swear an allegiance to President Trump or any other President,” Pompeo declared. “They take an oath to defend our Constitution, as Kansans, as conservatives, as Republicans, as Americans. Marco Rubio will never demean our soldiers by saying that he will order them to do things that are inconsistent with our Constitution.” Listening backstage, Trump demanded to know the identity of the congressman trashing him. A few minutes later, Pompeo concluded, “It’s time to turn down the lights on the circus.” Pompeo’s stinging rebuke of Trump got barely a mention in the local press, and Rubio finished third in Kansas. “We got smoked,” a former top Rubio campaign aide told me. Days later, Rubio’s campaign was over. In May, Trump secured the delegates needed for the nomination, and Pompeo reluctantly joined the rest of Kansas’s congressional delegation in endorsing him. Still, Pompeo had told the Topeka Capital-Journal, in April, that Trump was “not a conservative believer,” and, a few weeks later, he said, on CNN, “A lot of his policies don’t comport with my vision for how I represent Kansas.” At that point, Pompeo had never met Trump. Like many Republicans who called Trump a “kook,” a “cancer,” and a threat to democracy before ultimately supporting him, Pompeo disagreed with much of Trump’s platform. He took issue in particular with Trump’s “America First” skepticism about the United States’ role in the world. Pompeo was a conservative internationalist who had been shaped by his Cold War-era military service, and he remained a believer in American power as the guarantor of global stability. Yet, after Trump won the Presidency, Pompeo sought a post in his Administration and did not hesitate to serve as his C.I.A. director. In 2018, after Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, by tweet, Pompeo happily replaced him as America’s top diplomat. Pompeo, an evangelical Christian who keeps an open Bible on his desk, now says it’s possible that God raised up Trump as a modern Queen Esther, the Biblical figure who convinced the King of Persia to spare the Jewish people. He defines his own job as serving the President, whatever the President asks of him. “A Secretary of State has to know what the President wants,” he said, at a recent appearance in Washington. “To the extent you get out of synch with that leader, then you’re just out shooting the breeze.” No matter what Trump has said or done, Pompeo has stood by him. As a former senior White House official told me, “There will never be any daylight publicly between him and Trump.” The former official said that, in private, too, Pompeo is “among the most sycophantic and obsequious people around Trump.” Even more bluntly, a former American ambassador told me, “He’s like a heat-seeking missile for Trump’s ass.” Pompeo’s transformation reflects the larger story of how the Republican Party went from disdaining Trump to embracing him with barely a murmur of dissent. This account of how Pompeo became the last survivor of the President’s original national-security team and his most influential adviser on international affairs is based on dozens of interviews in recent months with current and former Administration officials, U.S. and foreign diplomats, and friends and colleagues of Pompeo’s; the Secretary did not answer repeated requests for comment. Thirty-one months into the Administration, the relationship between Trump and Pompeo, born in derision and remade in flattery, has proved to be surprisingly durable. Trump often gushes about Pompeo, even as he has berated his hawkish national-security adviser, John Bolton, for taking similar positions. “I argue with everyone,” Trump told a reporter. “Except Pompeo.”

Fifty-five, burly, and barrel-chested, Pompeo lives with his second wife, Susan, and their golden retriever, Sherman, in a rented house on the grounds of a military base across the street from the State Department. A film buff and an AC/DC fan, he seems modest and approachable in settings where he’s comfortable. When challenged, especially about the President, he gets testy and red in the face. He favors baggy gray suits and close-cropped gray hair. Trump, who often talks about whether someone “looks the part,” has made a point of calling out Pompeo’s unglamorous presence. At a recent appearance in South Korea, he summoned Pompeo to the stage with his daughter Ivanka, referring to them as “beauty and the beast.” Pompeo’s background bears little resemblance to that of recent Secretaries of State, all of whom came to the job after long careers in public life and with extensive international experience. Pompeo, in contrast, has had a “meteoric rise,” as his friend Steve Scalise, the House Republican Whip, told me. A little more than a decade ago, he was unknown not only in Washington but also in his adopted home state, where he had just lost his first campaign, placing third in a three-way race to become chairman of the Kansas Republican Party. Trump often touts Pompeo’s credentials as a top student at West Point and at Harvard Law School, but in six years as a member of Congress he never chaired a subcommittee or faced a genuinely competitive election, and he served just over a year at the C.I.A. He spent much of his career running a struggling Wichita aviation company. Pompeo’s disclosure forms reveal that he is the poorest member of Trump’s Cabinet, listing family assets worth roughly, in 2018, between two hundred thousand and seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Watch “The Backstory”: Susan B. Glasser reports on how Mike Pompeo reinvented himself and went from an obscure congressman to Trump's most influential adviser on international affairs. Born in 1963, Pompeo was one of three children in a working-class family in Southern California. His father, Wayne, was a Navy radioman in the Korean War. His mother, Dorothy Mercer, was one of ten children of small-town Kansas pool-hall owners. In conservative Orange County, Wayne was a passionate liberal, according to two sources who heard this from the future Secretary. Pompeo does not speak publicly about his political disagreements with his father, but they began early on: he has said that, as a teen-ager, he read Ayn Rand’s “The Fountainhead,” and became a staunch conservative. The valedictorian of his public high school, he was nominated for West Point by his congressman, Bob Dornan, a fiery hard-right favorite of the defense industry. “That should give you a good idea of where I am coming from politically if ‘B-1 Bob’ chose me for West Point,” Pompeo told the conservative magazine Human Events, in 2011. Pompeo thrived at West Point, where he majored in engineering management. “Man, it’s hard to be No. 1,” a classmate told me. “It’s not just being the smartest person. It’s being the person who shines your shoes the best and also has the most athletic skills.” After marrying his college sweetheart, Leslie Libert, the weekend he graduated, Pompeo took a prestigious posting as a tank commander in the U.S. Army’s 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment, which patrolled the border between East and West in Germany. Five years later, with the end of the Cold War, the border was gone and Pompeo left the military, having risen to the rank of captain. He went to Harvard Law School, where he was an editor of the Law Review, then moved to Washington, D.C., and joined the blue-chip firm Williams & Connolly. In the late nineties, however, Pompeo radically changed his life. He quit the law firm after two years and divorced his wife. (He kept the dog, Byron; she got the cat, Keats.) He moved to Kansas, his late mother’s home state, where, in early 1997, he and “three of my best friends in the whole world” from West Point, as he put it recently, started a company, Thayer Aerospace. Their aim was to acquire firms that manufactured specialized machinery for aviation companies clustered in Wichita, a city known as “the air capital of the world.” Pompeo became Thayer’s C.E.O. While buying one of the companies for the new firm, he met Susan Justice Mostrous, a former Wichita State University homecoming queen. As the vice-president of a local bank, she was sitting on the other side of the negotiating table. “It’s true,” Pompeo told an interviewer, jokingly. “She took my money twice.” In 2000, he and Susan married and he adopted her son from her second marriage. Pompeo became a deacon of Wichita’s Eastminster Church, an evangelical congregation that eventually quit the mainstream Presbyterian Church because of its support for gay clergy. Over time, Pompeo got to know some of the city’s wealthiest benefactors, including David Murfin, one of the largest independent oil producers in Kansas, and Charles and David Koch, the billionaire Republican donors and skeptics of environmental regulation, whose company is headquartered in Wichita. In 1998, the Kochs’ venture-capital fund made a key early investment in Thayer. Within a few years, Pompeo was a trustee of the Flint Hills Center for Public Policy, which also has ties to the Kochs, and he was an early recruit for the Kochs’ national political organization, Americans for Prosperity. In 2010, amid the Tea Party backlash to President Obama, Pompeo made another career switch, running for an open Congress seat in the state’s Fourth District. The establishment climber from California had become a heartland evangelical. Pompeo ran a nasty race against the Democrat, an Indian-American state legislator named Raj Goyle, who, unlike Pompeo, had grown up in Wichita. Pompeo’s campaign tweeted praise for an article calling Goyle a “turban topper,” and a supporter bought billboards urging residents to “Vote American—Vote Pompeo.” In the heavily Republican district in a heavily Republican year, he won easily. “Pompeo’s singular ability is in navigating power,” Goyle told me. “On that I give him massive respect, the way he mapped Wichita power, the way he mapped D.C. power, the way he mapped Trump.”

The narrative of Pompeo’s transformation has been rewritten over the years, or never told at all. Most notably, the Kochs were far more significant backers of his business than he has publicly acknowledged. In 2011, the Washington Post reported that, according to Pompeo and his aides, the investment by the Kochs’ venture-capital fund “amounted to less than 2 percent” of Thayer’s total. Their statement was highly misleading. Corporate documents for 2003 filed with the Kansas secretary of state but not previously reported show that the Kochs’ fund had a nearly twenty-per-cent interest in Thayer. The Kochs were also involved in the firm’s management. Both the president and the chief financial officer of the Kochs’ venture fund sat, at various times, on Thayer’s board of directors, and in 2000 the fund helped secure loans of up to four million dollars for the firm to buy property. The Kochs’ extensive involvement was not a secret: their fund announced on its Web site that it was part of Thayer’s “equity sponsor group,” adding that it had given Pompeo’s firm wide-ranging support, including “acquisition capital, strategic input at the board level, and guidance in environmental risk issues.” The environmental risk turned out to be significant. Air Capitol Plating, an aircraft-parts processing company that Thayer took over in 1999, had for years been the subject of environmental complaints because of its use of the toxic chemical trichloroethylene, or TCE, dangerous traces of which had leaked into the local groundwater. In 2000, Thayer entered into a legal consent order with Kansas authorities, in which it admitted to the pollution and agreed to clean it up. To address the problem, Thayer had brought in another Koch-backed firm, Cherokee, which specialized in “risk management services” for firms “that face environmental challenges.” A new entity, Cherokee Thayer, assumed liability for the cleanup, although it appears that little if any cleanup was carried out. Instead, the company and the authorities spent years arguing over the extent of the contamination and what to do about it. Meanwhile, the firm continued to pollute, failed to file required reports in 2003, 2004, and 2005, and was fined more than a hundred thousand dollars by the Environmental Protection Agency. In 2005, the state found high levels of TCE in nearby residential wells, resulting in a “threat to human health,” and the E.P.A. named it a High Priority Violator. According to the State of Kansas, this month, twenty years after Thayer purchased A.C.P., a permeable barrier will finally be installed to insure that no additional TCE flows from the site into the water supply. In speeches, Pompeo often describes Thayer as a “small” company and himself as a “small businessman.” He has reminisced about Thayer as “a small, dirty, smelly, beautiful machine shop.” In fact, by 2000, according to a press release that year, the Kochs and other wealthy backers had invested ninety million dollars in the firm. Despite that funding, Thayer struggled financially when Pompeo ran it—another aspect of his past that Pompeo has publicly sought to revise. During his first run for Congress, in 2010, one of his Republican-primary rivals, a local millionaire named Wink Hartman, claimed that Pompeo was “forced out” of Thayer after having mismanaged the company into financial trouble, the Wichita Eagle reported. Pompeo denied the accusation, saying that he left Thayer on “excellent terms,” while acknowledging some difficulties, which he blamed on a downturn in the aviation industry after the 9/11 attacks. But the company’s problems began before 9/11 and continued well beyond. In 1999, the Thayer subsidiary Air Capitol Plating started going downhill. According to testimony from Randy Birchfield, a West Point classmate whom Pompeo recruited to run A.C.P., business had slowed and there were layoffs, cutbacks in bonuses and health-care benefits, and rumors of imminent bankruptcy. “Clearly, the trend lines were moving in a direction that wasn’t comforting for anyone,” Birchfield said, in a deposition in a lawsuit between Thayer and A.C.P.’s former owners. The firm’s difficulties persisted. Thayer’s former human-resources manager, Kenneth Bollinger, said that he “directed the systematic layoff of nearly half the employees after 9/11.” A company balance sheet showed that, as of May, 2004, Thayer had just thirty-one thousand dollars in cash on hand and a negative “net worth” of almost thirty-three million dollars. In 2005 and 2006, venders sued Thayer for more than three hundred thousand dollars in unpaid bills. In both years, Thayer authorized new shares to be issued, which would raise needed capital but could also dilute the stakes of early shareholders such as the Kochs’ fund. By April of 2006, Pompeo was no longer leading the company. The firm’s post-Pompeo president lists on his résumé today the “successful turnaround” of Thayer, which was renamed Nex-Tech Aerospace and sold to the private-equity firm Highland Capital, in April, 2007, with the assistance of a company that advertised expertise in the “wind-down” of “overleveraged and underperforming companies.” The same month as the sale, the Wichita Business Journal reported that the new C.E.O. described his job as being to “rebuild a reputation damaged by an era of missed deliveries and slow supplier payments.” Pompeo personally held a ten-per-cent interest in the firm as of 2003, but his financial-disclosure forms and his modest net worth suggest that he did not make much money from selling it. Pompeo, however, soon landed with one of his Wichita contacts, David Murfin, the Kansas oil tycoon. Murfin named Pompeo president of Sentry International, an oil-services firm that manufactured parts in China and elsewhere and sold them in the U.S. One Sentry joint venture was with a subsidiary of the Chinese national oil firm Sinopec, although Pompeo later told the Senate that he had no business ties to foreign government-owned entities. Like the Kochs, Murfin was a major player in Kansas Republican politics. Kelly Arnold, at that time the Sedgwick County G.O.P. chairman, told me that Murfin was “a key person for anybody running for office.” In January, 2007, Pompeo ran for the chairmanship of the Kansas Republican Party, against Tim Huelskamp, a future congressman, and Kris Kobach, a firebrand who represented the Party’s anti-immigrant right wing. “Pompeo’s pitch to the Party was: I’m going to run this thing like a business,” Dan Rasure, who helped Pompeo in that race, told me. “To the rest of the world this may sound crazy, given how much Pompeo has catered to the ultra-conservatives once he became elected, but, in Kansas terms, Pompeo is just straight-up what would be considered a moderate.” Coming into the state G.O.P. convention, Pompeo believed that he “had the race sewn up,” Rasure said, but Kobach flipped a bloc of votes, and won. Rasure stayed in touch with Pompeo, and persuaded him to become the first investor in his new alternative-energy startup, Sunflower Wind, which planned to make wind turbines. Pompeo, who personally invested as much as a hundred thousand dollars, served on the board and was a key adviser to the young C.E.O., who considered his advice invaluable. “I would never bet against Pompeo,” Rasure told me. But the firm went bust after one of its turbine blades cracked, and everyone involved lost money. Pompeo had better luck in politics. By 2010, Wichita’s U.S. representative, Todd Tiahrt, had decided to run for the Senate. In the crowded Republican primary to succeed him, Pompeo was again backed by the city’s business élite. Murfin became his campaign co-chairman. Pompeo won the primary with thirty-nine per cent of the vote. “Let’s make a pact—if neither of us is married by thirty, we read an article about how many people are getting married later these days anyway.” Cartoon by Will McPhail Soon after arriving on Capitol Hill, in 2011, he was the subject of articles in both the Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post, in which he was portrayed, as one Kansas professor told the Post, as the new “congressman from Koch.” That Post article is where Pompeo and his aides misrepresented the Kochs’ investment in Thayer as an almost negligible two per cent. Pompeo would never again be directly challenged about Thayer. When he ran for reëlection in 2014, he aired a campaign ad touting his “remarkable success” leading the company. His positions evolved along with the story of his past. When Pompeo got to Congress, he argued that wind power was an expensive boondoggle and campaigned to end a production tax credit for wind technology, even though, not long before, he had personally invested in Sunflower Wind. By the time Pompeo joined the Trump Administration, he had written Sunflower out of his history, omitting from his Senate confirmation questionnaire his position as a member of its board.

In Washington, Pompeo found a way onto the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the critical panel for the business interests of his Kansas patrons. He appointed a former Koch lawyer as his chief of staff and acquired a reputation as a fierce defender of the Kochs. “Stop Harassing the Koch Brothers” was the title of an op-ed that he wrote in 2012, in which he dismissed attacks on them as “evidence of a truly Nixonian approach to politics.” Two years later, he called the Kochs “great men.” His loyalty was rewarded: according to the Center for Responsive Politics, in 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016 he received more campaign funds from the Kochs’ network than any other candidate in the country. But Pompeo hoped to make his mark in Congress on national security, and the Intelligence Committee was the panel that he most wanted to serve on. He got there in part by aiding the committee’s chairman, Mike Rogers, who sought Pompeo’s help in quelling an incipient rebellion by his fellow Tea Party members over the renewal of the wide-ranging surveillance authorized in the U.S.A. Patriot Act after 9/11. On the committee, Pompeo was regarded by his colleagues as smart and hardworking, “very bright, very politically shrewd,” as Adam Schiff, a Democrat, put it, “with a certain pugnacious quality to his persona.” Pompeo gained attention as one of the most partisan promoters of conspiracy theories about the killing of the U.S. Ambassador and three other Americans at a diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012. For years, Pompeo criticized Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s handling of the incident, and, when the select committee that was created to investigate it issued a bipartisan report clearing her, Pompeo and Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, were the only dissenters, arguing that Clinton knew Benghazi was a “terrorist attack” but, with the 2012 Presidential election only two months away, she covered it up. Pompeo confronted Clinton when she testified before the panel on October 22, 2015. He badgered her about why she had given her private e-mail address to her outside political adviser, Sidney Blumenthal, but not to the Ambassador to Libya. Their encounter was widely seen as a disaster for Pompeo, and he later told a local Republican club in Kansas that even his wife, Susan, had given him an F for his performance. “He was a Benghazi crazy,” a former senior intelligence official who dealt with Pompeo told me. Although his allegations were discredited, the investigation revealed that Clinton had deleted thirty thousand e-mails from a private server that she used while she was Secretary of State. Given that a subsequent F.B.I. investigation into Clinton’s e-mails hung over her 2016 campaign, the former official said of Pompeo, “at the end of the day, he succeeded beyond his wildest dreams.” Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran was another obsession. Pompeo befriended the Arkansas senator Tom Cotton, a younger fellow Harvard graduate and Army veteran, and they argued that not only would the deal fail to stop Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon; it was also an appeasement of the world’s worst sponsor of terrorism. In 2015, they travelled together to Vienna and then revealed what they said were “secret side deals” that the Obama team had agreed to with the Iranians. Pompeo’s pronouncements on Benghazi and on the Iran deal led to new media prominence on Fox News and other right-wing outlets, where he became one of the fiercest critics of Obama’s foreign policy. He trafficked in outlandish theories and engaged in slashing personal attacks. On “Meet the Press,” Pompeo called Clinton’s role in Benghazi “worse, in some ways, than Watergate.” But Pompeo grew restless in the House. In 2014, according to a Kansas Republican he consulted, Pompeo briefly considered challenging Kansas’s senior senator, Pat Roberts, in that year’s primary. In the spring of 2016, he publicly flirted with a challenge to the state’s other Republican senator, before dropping that, too.

By the 2016 Republican National Convention, Pompeo had, at least in public, changed his mind about Trump. “I am excited for a commander in chief who fearlessly puts America out in front,” he told the Wichita Eagle while in Cleveland as Trump accepted the nomination. He expressed even more excitement about Trump’s running mate, Mike Pence, whom Pompeo considered a “friend and mentor” from their time together in Congress. Pence, too, had strong ties to the Kochs, and Pompeo found a connection to Pence’s campaign in Marc Short, a veteran operative for the Kochs’ organization. Although the Kochs had opposed Trump in the Republican primaries, Short signed on as an adviser to Pence and is now his chief of staff. “Marc knows Mike well,” a Republican friend of Pompeo’s told me, and Short got Pompeo to help Pence with debate preparation that fall. When Trump won, Pence repaid the favor by recommending Pompeo. The weekend after the election, Pompeo called a Kansas Republican who had worked for Trump and told him that he hoped to become either C.I.A. director or Secretary of the Army. The two decided that he should work his ties to Pence and to a West Point classmate, David Urban, who had run Trump’s campaign in Pennsylvania. Urban was also hearing from Steve Bannon, Trump’s ultranationalist chief strategist, who called Urban to suggest that he urge “the old man” to name Pompeo to the C.I.A. post. Urban did so. On Wednesday, November 16th, Pompeo was summoned to Trump Tower for an interview with the President-elect. The men had never met, and still disagreed about key issues, such as Russia. Trump wanted to lift sanctions on Vladimir Putin’s regime, and disdained the U.S. intelligence community’s finding that Russia had intervened on his behalf in the election. “You’re wrong about Putin,” Trump told Pompeo, according to an account that Pompeo later offered to Republican insiders. “No,” Pompeo said. “You’re wrong.” Two days later, Trump announced that Pompeo was his nominee for the C.I.A. job. Trump seemed to know little about him, and Representative Devin Nunes, a member of Trump’s transition team, later said that he didn’t think Pompeo had even filled out a vetting questionnaire. After the announcement, Jeff Roe, Ted Cruz’s former campaign manager, called Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and reminded him of Trump’s fury at Pompeo’s Kansas caucus speech. As Tim Alberta recounts in his book, “American Carnage,” Kushner put the call on speaker, so that Trump could hear. “No! That was him? We’ve got to take it back,” the President-elect roared. “This is what I get for letting Pence pick everyone.” But the appointment stood. Two weeks later, Pompeo was hanging out with Trump in Urban’s box at the Army-Navy football game. Pompeo reminded other Republicans that he and Trump had a common enemy: Barack Obama. “He just made his political peace with reality—this is our President,” a former official in the George W. Bush Administration told me. Just months earlier, Pompeo had compared the “authoritarian” Obama to Trump, but Pompeo now saw joining Trump’s Cabinet as “an opportunity to kind of right the wrongs,” the former Bush official said. On January 23rd, Pompeo was confirmed, in a 66–32 vote. By then, he had deleted his entire congressional Twitter account, including a plea to the President-elect, days before Trump named him C.I.A. director, to “make the undemocratic practice of executive orders a thing of the past.” Trump, of course, did no such thing.

When Pompeo arrived at the C.I.A., he faced a political furor generated by the new President. Days before his swearing-in, Trump had compared the U.S. intelligence community to Nazi Germany for its handling of a secret dossier on Trump’s Russia ties. Then, at a welcoming ceremony in the lobby of C.I.A. headquarters, the President had attacked the agency again and made false claims about the size of the crowd at his Inauguration. Still, Pompeo managed to soothe the C.I.A. bureaucracy. He promised members of the Directorate of Operations that they would no longer be micromanaged, as they were under Obama. He vowed “to serve as an important bridge, if not a heat shield, not just from the White House but from any sort of political attacks,” Juan Zarate, a former U.S. official whom Pompeo asked to lead his transition to the C.I.A., told me. Pompeo also personally delivered the President’s Daily Brief to Trump, giving the C.I.A. valuable access to a skeptical President. “Mike got them in the room every day, and that is the most important thing the agency expects to have with its director,” the former senior intelligence official said. Pompeo used the sessions to establish a friendly relationship with the President, a contrast to Trump’s friction-filled dealings with other top national-security advisers. “He clicked with Mike early on, and Mike has had the benefit of that. Mike gets the President,” Christopher Ruddy, a friend of Trump’s, told me. Steve Scalise said that he remembers White House meetings in which “the President would look to Mike Pompeo before he even looked to Tillerson to get his assessment on different hot spots. That told me the President had incredible trust for Mike’s judgment, and it’s well founded.” Pompeo and his wife, who played an active role both in his office on the Hill and at the C.I.A., cultivated relationships not only with Trump but inside Trumpworld. One of these was with the Cabinet’s glitziest couple, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and his wife, Louise Linton. They made a seemingly odd foursome—the poorest member of Trump’s inner circle and one of its richest, an evangelical Kansan and an actress who got in trouble for vamping in opera-length black leather gloves at the U.S. Mint. Yet Linton recently told Los Angeles magazine that her favorite thing in Washington was dinner with the Pompeos. When the interviewer seemed incredulous, she replied, “But Pompeo is fun! He’s warm; he’s gregarious; he’s a great storyteller. He’s a lovely man. I love his wife, Susan.” Pompeo seemed to relish the C.I.A. job. He told a friend that, while flying around the world to meetings on a U.S. government plane, he would read the agency’s secret histories of wars in places like Afghanistan and Central America. Still, the former senior intelligence official said, “he wasn’t satisfied with being C.I.A. director. He wanted to be national-security adviser or Secretary of State.” “We didn’t know what to get the man who has everything. So we burned down your house first.” Cartoon by Liana Finck By the fall of 2017, Rex Tillerson was in trouble with the President. That summer, he had called Trump a “fucking moron,” and he often disagreed with Trump on policy decisions, such as withdrawing from the Paris climate accord and moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. When Trump demanded an immediate withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, Tillerson pushed for more time. Most other advisers agreed with Tillerson, but Pompeo, a former senior official told me, twice sat in the White House Situation Room and supported leaving the Iran deal, sidelining his agency’s concerns about doing so. The Iran deal was one subject on which Trump and Pompeo were closely aligned before 2016. Another former senior intelligence official told me that Pompeo gave “strong brushback” to experts on the Iran desk at the C.I.A. after they concluded that Iran was complying with the terms of the deal—a sore point, since Trump was claiming that Iran was not doing so. The first former senior intelligence official told me that Pompeo challenged the agency’s Iran analysts: “He would ask, ‘What evidence? Are the Iranians cheating?’ ” At the White House, Pompeo waged what the former senior official saw as a “concerted campaign” to replace Tillerson. The escalating internal fight over Iran played into it. “Pompeo was working it hard. He saw and heard from the President how much he was souring on Tillerson,” the former official told me. “He was making the case to Trump: You’ve got a whole lot of people around you who don’t agree with you. I’m your guy.” An important proponent of Pompeo was Jared Kushner, who repeatedly clashed with Tillerson after Trump assigned his son-in-law an expansive portfolio that included everything from China to Mexico to Mideast peace. At a Washington social event in late 2017, a guest commented to Kushner on Tillerson’s troubles with Trump. “The problem will be solved very quickly if I have my way,” Kushner responded. When another guest suggested that Pompeo, who was present, should get the job, Kushner replied, “Of course.” Several months later, in March, 2018, Tillerson was returning home from a trip to Africa when Trump fired him and announced Pompeo as his replacement. “We’re always on the same wavelength,” Trump said. “The relationship has been very good, and that’s what I need.”

In the spring of 2018, on his first day as Secretary of State, Pompeo invoked the bluster of the Second World War general George Patton, vowing that the U.S. would “get its swagger back.” The reference to such an undiplomatic figure was odd, unless you knew that Patton is Trump’s most admired general and that the hagiographic movie about Patton’s life is one of his favorites. Pompeo followed up with a social-media campaign that featured photos of himself and Patton, and a State Department logo with a new motto: the “Department of Swagger.” Diplomats quickly surmised, as a former senior department official put it, that Pompeo’s opening pitch was to a “constituency of one.” Managing Trump as Secretary of State, however, would prove harder for Pompeo than it had been. As C.I.A. director, Pompeo spent many hours with the President, and he could punt difficult questions by saying that it was not his role to offer policy advice. Now he would often be away travelling, while Bolton, the new national-security adviser and a veteran bureaucratic infighter, had daily Trump time. The State Department was also in disarray from Tillerson’s tenure. Waves of experienced Foreign Service officers quit or were forced out, as Tillerson insisted on an extensive reorganization plan, instituted a hiring freeze, and accepted crippling budget cuts. The White House also blocked State from hiring any of the hundred and forty-nine G.O.P. national-security officials who signed “Never Trump” letters during the campaign. With State in crisis, Pompeo reached out to some veteran diplomats who had quit or been pushed aside, promoted a career Foreign Service official to serve as the department’s No. 3, lifted Tillerson’s hiring freeze, and consulted all the living former Secretaries of State, including Hillary Clinton, who took his call even though he had savaged her over Benghazi. The gestures helped smooth his Senate confirmation. In the end, Pompeo received even more Democratic votes, seven, than Tillerson had. Pompeo used his standing with the President as a selling point for a department in need of White House clout and a semblance of stability. “The department appreciates the fact that they have a Secretary who the President trusts,” Fred Fleitz, who served as Bolton’s chief of staff at the National Security Council, told me. Democrats noticed, too. “Morale is better at the State Department. It’s still at a historic low watermark, but people feel better,” Chris Murphy, a Connecticut senator who has vehemently opposed Pompeo on issues such as U.S. military support for Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen, told me. “There are some silver linings to Pompeo’s time at State that even critics like me can’t ignore.” Yet Trump’s impulsive style created constant complications for Pompeo, as it did for other officials. Trump undercut Pompeo with his abrupt decision, last December, to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria (which led to the resignation of Defense Secretary James Mattis); his unilateral recognition of Israel’s post-1967 annexation of the Golan Heights (a day after Pompeo, who was in Israel at the time, publicly said that he knew of no such plans); and his spur-of-the-moment decision to cut U.S. foreign aid to Central America. On North Korea, Pompeo was “very skeptical,” according to a former senior U.S. official, that Trump’s talks with Kim Jong Un would produce a breakthrough on denuclearization—a problem, since Trump’s first assignment to Pompeo was to oversee those negotiations. Trump has made a practice of alarming longtime allies, musing aloud about cancelling the mutual-defense treaty with Japan, threatening to pull U.S. troops out of South Korea, deriding Europe’s largest powers as NATO deadbeats, and dismissing the European Union as a “foe.” All of this has made for tense Pompeo visits in normally friendly precincts. In Washington, though, Pompeo has managed to maintain Trump’s confidence while remaining on speaking terms with a foreign-policy establishment that is deeply unsettled by the President. “He’s in a sense become the real adult in the room,” Ian Bremmer, the founder of the geopolitical advisory firm the Eurasia Group, told me. “It is less the case than he would like, but vastly more the case than anyone else.” Pompeo’s Republican friend told me, “He’s not an enabler of Trump. He does a lot to try to manage him.” Others believe that Pompeo is merely posturing. He is a politician who knows his audience; he wants to give the impression that “he generally agrees but he’s working with this wild man,” another former senior State Department official, who has met with Pompeo privately, told me. “He always has this sheepish ‘I know,’ but won’t show his hand.” He suggests, without being specific, the former official added, that he’s got “his finger in the dike.” When it comes to personnel, Pompeo has sent the right signals to the G.O.P. establishment by hiring a few Republican opponents of the President. He tapped Elliott Abrams, who wrote an anti-Trump op-ed in 2016, to be his special envoy to Venezuela. (Trump blocked Tillerson’s attempt to hire Abrams.) He asked Jim Jeffrey, George W. Bush’s deputy national-security adviser, to serve as the special envoy for Syria, even though he signed a Never Trump letter. This spring, Pompeo appointed the Fox News contributor Morgan Ortagus to be his spokesperson, although she, like Pompeo, had publicly opposed Trump in 2016, prompting the conservative magazine The National Interest to observe that “Mike Pompeo’s house has become a hall of NeverTrump.” In each case, Pompeo carefully managed the President. “He’ll be meeting with Trump about something else and then, like, at the end of the meeting he’ll be, like, ‘Oh, by the way, I’m bringing on Jim Jeffrey,’ ‘Oh, by the way, I’m bringing on Elliott Abrams,’ ” the Republican close to Pompeo told me. Trump agreed to the moves, but only because the jobs did not require Senate confirmation. “It’s fairly clear he has a deal with the President where if there’s no confirmation hearing, where people can talk about the 2016 race, then he can hire whoever he wants,” a senior Administration official told me. Fifteen months after Pompeo took over the State Department, the question is not whether he has stayed in Trump’s good favor but to what ends Pompeo is using the relationship. He “agrees certain things the President has mandated don’t make any sense,” a third former senior department official told me. When Trump unilaterally cut two hundred and thirty million dollars that was meant to help stabilize parts of Syria where U.S. forces were present, Pompeo “went to the President several times to fix it. He just lost,” the former official said. He concluded that this typified Pompeo’s approach. “He will go at Trump to try to change his mind, but if he can’t he’ll go, ‘O.K., we’re doing what the President has said.’ ” Pompeo’s own ideological agenda is also becoming clearer, as indicated by recent controversies over orders to U.S. diplomatic missions not to fly the gay-pride flag; the creation of a new State Department commission stocked with conservatives to review human-rights policy based on “natural” rights; and comments by the Secretary that were skeptical of climate change at an international climate-change conference. In the end, Pompeo may be remembered as the most conservative, ideologically driven Secretary of State ever to serve. He is certainly no sentimentalist about the world, and, while he does not share Trump’s affinity for dictators like Putin and Kim Jong Un, he has remained notably silent on human-rights abuses in places such as North Korea. In Saudi Arabia, he smiled during a photo op with the Crown Prince soon after the gruesome killing of the dissident columnist Jamal Khashoggi, and angered many members of Congress, including some in his own Party, by appearing to dismiss concerns about it. Pompeo and his advisers had thought that the episode would be a repeat of China’s 1989 massacre of protesters in Tiananmen Square: a controversy that produced outrage in Congress but then passed. Instead, Pompeo was “struck and frustrated by how it hasn’t blown over,” the Republican friend told me. Pompeo is also more political than any other recent Secretary, with the exception, perhaps, of Hillary Clinton. In some ways, he’s approached the job like a future Presidential candidate, hosting Republican strategists such as Karl Rove and wealthy patrons such as the former Goldman Sachs C.E.O. Lloyd Blankfein at regular “Madison Dinners,” named for the fifth Secretary of State (and fourth President). The dinners are orchestrated by Pompeo’s wife, Susan, who travels frequently with him and whose unusual requests are now being investigated by congressional Democrats after a whistle-blower complained that the couple was inappropriately using government resources and treating Pompeo’s security detail as “UberEats with guns,” CNN reported. “Oh, yeah, Thrag spoiled the ending of this one at work today.” Cartoon by Pia Guerra and Ian Boothby At times, Pompeo’s concern for his political image can seem to shape policy decisions. Last September, he ordered the closure of the U.S. consulate in the Iraqi city of Basra, despite objections from some State Department officials. “He did not want Basra to be his Benghazi,” a former senior U.S. official who discussed the decision with Pompeo said. Another former senior U.S. official, with experience in Iraq, told me, “Absolutely, it was an overreaction. He wears Benghazi around his neck.”

In a recent speech at the Claremont Institute, in California, Pompeo outlined his version of the Trump doctrine, claiming that “realism” “restraint,” and “respect” guided the President’s approach to the world. It was his most ambitious explanation yet of the Administration’s foreign policy, asserting that renewed nationalism is necessary as the U.S. faces a new era of great-power competition with China and Russia. It sounded plausible, Republican, and entirely unlike the President. “The problem with the speech is that it doesn’t reflect Trump’s foreign policy,” said Brett McGurk, a former State Department official who oversaw the anti-Islamic State coalition, until he quit in protest over Trump’s decision to pull out of Syria. “It’s not based on realism. It’s not based on restraint. It’s based on declaring grand objectives, few of which the Administration is willing or able to meet.” This gets at a central challenge of Pompeo’s tenure: turning Trump’s tweets and “instincts” into a coherent foreign policy, as his policy-planning chief often put it. Pompeo insists on that goal, though doing so often involves essentially ignoring the President himself. On Syria, for example, Pompeo, Bolton, and other officials disagreed with Trump’s order to immediately withdraw U.S. forces, but they sought to manage him rather than confront him, as Mattis did, while enlisting other allies, such as the Israelis and members of Congress, to lobby Trump for a reversal. In public, Pompeo defended the decision, arguing, in defiance of the facts, that it constituted a continuation of Trump’s policy. Eventually, Trump agreed to keep some troops in Syria. The episode was one of many in which Pompeo has struggled to avoid coming into public conflict with the President. In recent months, Pompeo has repeatedly tangled with members of Congress and journalists who ask about the President’s policies and his inflammatory statements. Such questions, he has said, are “silly,” “bizarre,” “ticky-tack,” “insulting and ridiculous and frankly ludicrous.” Yet none of the people I spoke with thought Pompeo harbored any illusions about the President. In private, Pompeo’s gripes sometimes echo those expressed by fired predecessors, among them H. R. McMaster, Trump’s second national-security adviser. One of the former senior officials told me that he had heard identical complaints from Pompeo and McMaster: “ ‘We put together carefully crafted policies on things and the President blows it up with a tweet, and I have to go in and put Humpty Dumpty back together.’ ” Until now, Pompeo has derived his power by being better than anyone else at anticipating where Trump is going to end up and managing to get himself there. As Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, put it, Pompeo has cultivated a “special skill,” figuring out “how to get Trump moving in the direction he wants.” The risks of getting publicly out of synch with Trump, however, have gone up for Pompeo this summer, as tensions with Iran rise. The President, a self-styled grand global dealmaker, has said that his goal after withdrawing from the nuclear deal is to bring Iran back to the negotiating table for a better deal. Pompeo, an Iran hawk far longer than he has been a Trump supporter, has been driving the Administration’s hard-line “maximum pressure” strategy. The possibility of a real divide with Trump emerged in June, after Iran shot down a U.S. drone. Pompeo and his internal rival Bolton, a longtime advocate of Iranian “regime change,” initially backed a retaliatory military strike, and Trump agreed, only to reverse himself when planes were already in the air. Even before that incident, Fred Fleitz, Bolton’s former chief of staff at the N.S.C., had told me that Bolton and Pompeo are closely aligned on Iran, at least. “He and John are on the same sheet of music,” Fleitz said. Whatever their ideological convergence on Iran, relations between the two seem to have worsened in recent months, to the extent that the former White House official was told recently that they are “not even on speaking terms” and communicate largely through intermediaries. Pompeo, asked last month about his relationship with Bolton, noted, “There’s always tension among leaders of different organizations.” But for now it’s Bolton, not Pompeo, who appears to be the odd man out. In a sign of Pompeo’s ability to remain in Trump’s good graces, the President publicly bristled at Bolton, not him, after the aborted Iran strike. Then, with Pompeo by his side, Trump made an unprecedented, hastily arranged visit with Kim Jong Un to the North Korean side of the Demilitarized Zone, while Bolton went off on a previously scheduled trip to Mongolia."
Chicago Housing Authority’s CEO Eugene Jones abruptly resigns,https://chicago.curbed.com,['Aug'],08-21-2019,2019,8,https://chicago.curbed.com/2019/8/21/20827053/chicago-housing-authority-resign-ceo-eugene-jones,"On Tuesday, the Chicago Housing Authority’s CEO Eugene Jones announced his resignation. Jones was the longest-serving boss in more than a decade of the second largest public housing agency in the country. Many people view his departure as a surprise and the city will face a challenge in searching for replacement.

Jones joined CHA in 2015 as Chief Property Officer and two months later was named acting CEO. In January 2016 then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel made him the permanent CEO. Lightfoot had full confidence in Jones too. Before Chicago, he had 35 years in housing operations and a reputation for bringing mediocre programs in Toronto, Detroit, Indianapolis, and Kansas City up to high standards.

In a WBEZ interview Wednesday morning about the news, an activist and former Cabrini-Green resident said: “We just lost the Michael Jordan of housing.”

Jones put out a statement about his resignation which goes into effect September 27 and thanks the public and his supporters. It reads:

“Since my arrival at CHA four and a half years ago, I have been committed to meeting CHA’s goals of producing more housing and to supporting the city in its efforts to expand housing opportunities in every Chicago community.”

Highlights from Jones career include the development of three co-located housing and libraries, the establishment of a field office that connected with residents, millions set aside for Section 3 (a federal program that supplies jobs and contracts to public housing residents), and a landmark settlement this year in the Gautreaux case.

It’s unclear where Jones will go next, and he doesn’t explain his departure in the annoucement, but the housing expert was shortlisted for a top position in New York City’s Housing Authority back in March. That position has since been filled, but its clear that Jones is in high demand."
"China can live without the US, 'but I don’t think they will': USDA adviser",https://finance.yahoo.com,"['Chelsea Lombardo', 'Production Assistant']",08-21-2019,2019,8,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-can-live-without-the-us-but-i-dont-think-they-will-usda-adviser-105140319.html,"



On Tuesday, President Donald Trump told reporters that “someone had to take on China” regardless of ""whether it's good or bad short-term” for the U.S.

And so Trump has, as the trade war between the U.S. and China rages on. But Tom Kehoe, U.S. Department of Agriculture trade adviser and international trade expert, told Yahoo Finance’s On The Move that he is optimistic that there will be an end to the battle. “You’re going to see little pieces of this deal come together. I think the president is trying to tie it altogether in one big package,” he said, adding that he’s heard from insiders that Washington is working “feverishly” for a deal.

Can China live without the U.S.? “Yes, but I don’t think that they will,” Kehoe said, noting that soybeans is the biggest agricultural commodity that they buy from the U.S. “China needs us. I think we need them as a place — as our back-door manufacturing facility. I think you will see some sort of a deal. President Xi Jinpng's reputation is as probably as important, and maybe even more important to him as part of his legacy. Look, he doesn't have to face the crazy election cycle we're in the early part of here for the 2020 presidency. He's changed the rules, and he's really president for as long as he'd like to be.”

Meanwhile, when it comes to Huawei Kehoe said he doesn’t think the U.S. has all of its business with Huawei sorted out.

The U.S. Commerce Department is delaying a penalty on Huawei for 90 days, allowing U.S. companies to continue to work with the Chinese tech company, until November 19. This comes after President Donald Trump told reporters on Sunday that he does not want the United States to do business with Huawei, calling the company a “national security threat.”

“We have some rural carriers and rural networks that need the Huawei materials right now,” Kehoe said. “And I think the administration is giving a 90-day time lag there for them to try and find some replacements.”

“I think, the president's got his hands full with this one,” Kehoe said, referring to China in general. “There's a lot of chess pieces in play here.”

Tennessee man charged with threatening shooting at Planned Parenthood facility in D.C.,http://newschannel9.com,['The Associated Press'],,,,http://newschannel9.com/news/local/tennessee-man-charged-with-threatening-shooting-at-planned-parenthood,"Federal authorities say a Tennessee man has been arrested on charges that he made online threats of a shooting at a Planned Parenthood facility in the nation's capital.



The FBI and U.S. attorneys in Washington and Nashville said in a news release that 20-year-old Jacob Cooper made a court appearance Wednesday on a charge of unlawfully transmitting a threat to injure.

Authorities say Cooper, of Clarksville, made comments on the social media site iFunny that included a threat to ""shoot up"" a Planned Parenthood location in Washington, D.C.

Prosecutors say the Aug. 13 postings also included threats about killing federal agents with a bomb, a rifle, or the poison ricin.

Cooper's federal public defender said he had no immediate comment Wednesday afternoon because he had not yet reviewed the case."

Quig'],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.chicagobusiness.com/government/chicago-housing-authority-ceo-eugene-jones-stepping-down,"""From bringing new investment to communities and forming innovative partnerships that led to the development of three co-located housing and libraries, the development of new community assets like grocery stores and recreational facilities and the settlement earlier this year of the landmark Gautreaux case, I leave knowing that the CHA is well-positioned for the future and is prepared to meet the housing needs of its residents and the communities across our city,"" Jones said.

A spokesperson for Lightfoot said she accepted the resignation today. ""The mayor and the city thank Mr. Jones for his four years of leadership running one of the nation's largest public housing authorities. A search for his replacement will begin immediately,"" a spokesperson said in a release.

Administration sources say it was Jones’ decision alone to exit.

Mayor Rahm Emanuel tapped Jones to run the CHA four years ago—he left the Toronto Community Housing Corp. ""by mutual agreement,"" amid charges he violated hiring, firing and other rules. Jones previously helped run housing agencies in Detroit, Indianapolis and Kansas City.

Meghan Harte, the executive director of LISC who serves on the CHA board and helped Emanuel bring Jones to Chicago, said his exit is ""a loss for the agency, it's a loss for the residents.""

Harte said Jones had moved projects ""forward that’d been stalled for almost 10 years,"" like developments at Cabrini-Green, Stateway Gardens, Ickes Homes and Lathrop Homes.

""The other thing he’s done is really been innovative about wealth-building opportunities for resident-owned businesses. . . .He’s done a lot around innovation and obviously the marquee projects of figuring out mixed-use with libraries and housing across the city as a model for a new way to develop housing,"" Harte said. ""He brought a sense of urgency, 35 years of experience in housing . . . a great relationship with (Housing & Urban Development) in Washington DC to move things faster, and compassion for the residents.""

Julie Dworkin, the policy director of the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless, said she was ""disappointed to see him go.""

""We worked with him on a pilot project that allowed 50 people (to become CHA tenants) who had criminal backgrounds that otherwise would have been denied to access housing choice vouchers, based on a recommendation from a service provider saying they had really turned their life around. That pilot project is over. Now we want to expand that philosophy to have it be a more permanent policy there. There's still work that needs to be done at CHA,"" Dworkin said.

Jones' announcement follows that of CHA Board Chair John Hooker, who announced his resignation in July. ""My term is up, and my time is up,"" Hooker told board members. Vice Chair Craig Chico is serving in the interim."
"Trump's idiotic, immoral rhetorical attack on Denmark",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/trumps-idiotic-immoral-rhetorical-attack-on-denmark,"Denmark is a close American ally deserving of far better from President Trump. The American people, who expect their president will put U.S. interests before his own ego, also deserve better.

I say this in light of insults Trump directed at the Danish prime minister on Wednesday after she labeled his efforts to buy Greenland as ""absurd."" Trump's outburst follows his similarly petulant tweet on Tuesday that ""based on Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen’s comments, that she would have no interest in discussing the purchase of Greenland, I will be postponing our meeting scheduled in two weeks for another time.""

Trump might whine about Frederiksen's language, but considering the Danish political furor that Trump's Greenland flippancy produced, her response was understandable. He should have let it pass. Instead, Trump has wrecked a two-day September visit to Denmark for which, Frederiksen noted, ""preparations were well under way."" The logistical complexities of a presidential visit are huge.

Denmark's frustration is understandable, and Trump's disrespect to Denmark is both idiotic and immoral.

Idiotic, because Denmark is a committed and capable ally. The Danish military is well-trained and supported by increasingly advanced capabilities. Danish maneuver infantry, air strike, cyber, and anti-ship forces are especially impressive. They attest to a nation that intends to fight alongside keystone NATO forces if Russia ever attacks the alliance. The same cannot be said of many other European powers, including Belgium, Germany, and perhaps soon, Italy. But Trump's words will only spark Danish public anger and empower left-wing politicians who want to weaken our alliance. The stakes here are potentially great. What, for example, if Denmark now chucks the U.S. military out of Greenland? That would greatly reduce our ability to detect and defend against Chinese and Russian nuclear attacks.

Trump's words are also immoral.

Unlike many U.S. allies, Denmark has fought alongside us in both Afghanistan and Iraq. Seven Danes gave their lives in Iraq. In Afghanistan, 43 Danes died, and hundreds more were wounded. There, Denmark chose to operate in the restive Helmand Province, taking the fight to the enemy. We should thank Danes for giving their sons' and daughters' lives for our common cause.

The president swore an oath to uphold American interests. His gratuitously harsh words toward Denmark do the exact opposite."
"Washing raw poultry could make you and others sick, USDA says in study",https://fox59.com,[],08-21-2019,2019,8,https://fox59.com/2019/08/21/washing-raw-poultry-could-make-you-and-others-sick-usda-says-in-study/,"× Washing raw poultry could make you and others sick, USDA says in study

Should you wash chicken before you cook it?

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the answer is a resounding no.

The agency said people are putting themselves and others at risk when they wash or rinse raw poultry. The USDA conducted a study on the issue and found that bacteria can easily spread elsewhere.

“Even when consumers think they are effectively cleaning after washing poultry, this study shows that bacteria can easily spread to other surfaces and foods. The best practice is not to wash poultry,” said Dr. Mindy Brashears, the USDA’s deputy undersecretary for food safety.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that millions of Americans suffer from foodborne illnesses each year, resulting in about 128,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 deaths.

The USDA offered the following recommendations:

Significantly decrease your risk by preparing foods that will not be cooked, such as vegetables and salads, BEFORE handling and preparing raw meat and poultry.

Of the participants who washed their raw poultry, 60 percent had bacteria in their sink after washing or rinsing the poultry. Even more concerning is that 14 percent still had bacteria in their sinks after they attempted to clean the sink.

26 percent of participants that washed raw poultry transferred bacteria from that raw poultry to their ready to eat salad lettuce.

Thoroughly clean and sanitize ANY surface that has potentially touched or been contaminated from raw meat and poultry, or their juices.

Of the participants that did not wash their raw poultry, 31 percent still managed to get bacteria from the raw poultry onto their salad lettuce.

This high rate of cross-contamination was likely due to a lack of effective handwashing and contamination of the sink and utensils.

Clean sinks and countertops with hot soapy water and then apply a sanitizer.

Wash hands immediately after handling raw meat and poultry. Wet your hands with water, lather with soap and then scrub your hands for 20 seconds.

Destroy any illness causing bacteria by cooking meat and poultry to a safe internal temperature as measured by a food thermometer."
State AGs prepare antitrust investigation into tech firms,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/state-ags-prepare-antitrust-investigation-into-tech-firms,"The top law enforcement officers in several states are gearing up to launch an antitrust investigation of Silicon Valley’s biggest firms, according to multiple reports, adding to the scrutiny tech companies are already facing from federal regulators.

The investigation is expected to get off the ground as soon as next month and would follow a meeting representatives from states had with antitrust officials from the Justice Department last month.

A group of state attorneys general plan to soon issue civil investigative demands to the tech companies, and the investigation will examine whether Silicon Valley’s most powerful firms suppressed competition in the tech industry.

It’s unclear how many states are expected to participate and whether it will be a bipartisan group, but the Wall Street Journal reported as many as 20 attorneys general could join the effort.

After last month’s meeting at the Justice Department, the office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said a group of eight state attorneys general met with Attorney General William Barr to discuss “the real concerns consumers across the country have with big tech companies stifling competition on the internet.”

Paxton’s office said the states are “considering a range of possible antitrust actions against such companies.”

An investigation into big tech companies spearheaded by the states would run alongside investigations launched by the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission into anticompetitive behavior by leading internet companies.

The Justice Department said last month it had opened a sweeping antitrust review into “market-leading online platforms,” which is likely to include Amazon, Facebook, and Google. The Federal Trade Commission launched a technology task force in February designed to monitor competition in the tech sector and investigate any possible anticompetitive conduct.

The commission also opened an antitrust investigation into Facebook, the social media company acknowledged in financial filings last month.

The inquiries from the federal government come alongside continued efforts in Congress to examine the practices of some of the country’s biggest technology companies.

To address the growing dominance of Silicon Valley firms and whether they have shut smaller competitors out of the marketplace, 2020 Democratic presidential contender Elizabeth Warren called for breaking up the Facebook, Amazon, and Google, while Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has proposed antitrust action against big tech companies."

"U.S. farmers, lawmakers dial up pressure on Trump over biofuel policy",https://www.reuters.com,"['Humeyra Pamuk', 'Min Read']",08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biofuels-trump/u-s-farmers-lawmakers-dial-up-pressure-on-trump-over-biofuel-policy-idUSKCN1VB2EF,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The agriculture and biofuel industries and their U.S. congressional allies ramped up pressure on the Trump administration on Wednesday over the relief he has given oil refiners from rules requiring use of biofuels.

Long-suffering American farmers, a constituency President Donald Trump is counting on in his campaign for re-election in 2020, have seen prices for crops hit hard by his trade war with China. This month, farmers also complained that a government crop report did not reflect damage from historic flooding this spring.

Farmers have been infuriated at the administration’s decision to grant waivers exempting 31 oil refineries from rules requiring them to blend corn-based ethanol into gasoline.

National and state trade groups along with their political allies delivered letters to the White House over the past 48 hours detailing the damage the waivers have caused the biofuel industry.

Democratic presidential hopefuls have used the refinery issue as a cudgel, echoing farm groups who say Trump has betrayed them by siding with Big Oil. Alarmed, the Republican president ordered his cabinet to find ways to boost biofuel demand.

The Iowa Soybean Association’s letter to the White House said the refining exemptions were forcing biodiesel producers to shut plants and lay off workers. Soybeans are a feedstock for biodiesel, so growers have been hurt.

“It’s becoming more difficult to understand why your administration is choosing to support higher profits for oil companies instead of providing some stability for farmers,” said the letter, signed by Lindsay J. Greiner, president of the state’s soybean association.

Iowa, the largest U.S. producer of corn and ethanol, is a swing state won twice by Democrat Barack Obama. The state switched to the Republican candidate in 2016, in part because Trump promised to support ethanol.

Cindy Axne, a Democrat who represents Iowa’s third district, wrote to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, urging its independent watchdog to investigate the small refinery waivers granted between 2016 and 2018.

“What we’re seeing with this administration is a dogged approach to allow the biggest fossil fuel players an opportunity to put more money back in the pockets of their large shareholders and take that money out of the pockets of hardworking farmers right here in Iowa,” Axne said at a news conference.

Republican Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds, a Trump political ally, along with the state’s head of agriculture, said in a letter to the EPA that rural families have borne the brunt of the trade war and are now being pinched by the refinery waivers.

“Ethanol consumption fell for the first time in 20 years, commodity markets are depressed, and many biofuel plants, including several in Iowa, have already slowed or halted production,” the letter said.

‘MAKE IT RIGHT’

The battle between Big Oil and farmers over the U.S. biofuel policy has been a headache for Trump, who campaigned in 2016 as a champion for ethanol.

U.S. regulations require refiners to blend biofuels into the nation’s gasoline pool or buy credits to fund those refiners who can. Small refiners can get exemptions from the EPA if they prove compliance causes them hardship.

But Trump’s EPA expanded the waivers significantly, granting exemptions to refineries owned by the likes of Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and billionaire Carl Icahn. This saved refiners billions of dollars, but farmers complained that it has destroyed ethanol demand and forced plants to shut down or idle. Refiners maintain the waivers have not hurt overall demand for biofuels.

Biofuel producers and farmers say increasing the annual blending obligations for 2020, to be finalized in November, is the best solution, but oil refiners oppose that.

“The president will have an opportunity to make this right in the fall,” Gene Gebolys, chief executive of biodiesel producer World Energy. The company said last week it was closing plants in Mississippi, Georgia and Pennsylvania, and putting 100 workers on furlough.

“If he doesn’t, the voters will have an opportunity to make it right next fall. He’s made a promise throughout the Midwest and he’s broken the promise,” he said."

US State Department approves possible $8 billion fighter jet sale to Taiwan,https://www.cnbc.com,[],08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/21/us-state-department-approves-possible-8-billion-fighter-jet-sale-to-taiwan.html,"U.S. Air Force F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter jets, manufactured by Lockheed Martin Corp., taxi on the tarmac during the Max Thunder Air Exercise, a bilateral training exercise between the South Korean and U.S. Air Force, at a U.S. air base in Gunsan, South Korea, on Thursday, April 20, 2017.

The U.S. State Department has approved a possible $8 billion sale of F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency said on Tuesday in an official notification to Congress.

The potential deal is for 66 aircraft, 75 General Electric engines, as well as other systems, the agency said in a statement, adding it served the interests of the United States and would help Taiwan maintain a credible defense.

China has already denounced the widely discussed sale, one of the biggest yet by the United States to Taiwan, which Beijing considers a renegade province. It has warned of unspecified ""countermeasures.""

Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jim Risch, a Republican, has welcomed the proposed sale of the Lockheed Martin Corp F-16 jets.

""These fighters are critical to improving Taiwan's ability to defend its sovereign airspace, which is under increasing pressure from the People's Republic of China,"" he said in a recent statement.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News on Monday that President Donald Trump notified Congress of the sale last week.

Pompeo told Fox News the sale was ""consistent with past U.S. policy"" and that the United States was ""simply following through on the commitments we've made to all of the parties.""

In Taipei, President Tsai Ing-wen said the sale would help Taiwan build a new air force and boost its air defense capacity.

In a post on Facebook, Tsai said she was grateful for Washington's ""continuous support for Taiwan's national defense"".

""With strong self-defense capacity, Taiwan will certainly be more confident to ensure the cross-strait and regional peace and stability while facing security challenges,"" she said.

Taiwan unveiled its largest defense spending increase in more than a decade last week, amid rising military tensions with China."
"Commerce Department will extend Huawei reprieve, Ross says",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Felicia Sonmez', ""National Reporter On The Washington Post'S Breaking Political News Team""]",08-19-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/commerce-department-will-extend-huawei-reprieve-ross-says/2019/08/19/82a11436-c275-11e9-9986-1fb3e4397be4_story.html,"Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Monday that his department will grant another temporary reprieve to Huawei Technologies, delaying the implementation of a penalty on the Chinese tech giant for another 90 days.

Ross made the announcement during an appearance on Fox Business Network.

“It is another 90 days for the U.S. telecom companies,” Ross said. “Some of the rural companies are dependent on Huawei. So we’re giving them a little more time to wean themselves off. But no specific licenses are being granted for anything.”

The next deadline, he added, is roughly Nov. 19.

On Sunday, President Trump suggested that his administration was not likely to grant another reprieve to Huawei, citing national security concerns. “At this moment, it looks much more like we’re not going to do business,” Trump said, pushing back against reports of the expected reprieve.

Trump directed the Commerce Department in May to place Huawei on its “Entity List,” known to some as the “death penalty.” The move makes it difficult for Huawei to do business with any U.S. company. Days later, the Commerce Department announced a 90-day reprieve that allowed some sales to Huawei to continue temporarily, effective May 20.

Ross said Monday that the Commerce Department had also decided to add 46 more Huawei subsidiaries to the Entity List.

“We now have more than 100 subsidiaries on the Entity List,” he said, explaining that “adding more entities makes it more difficult for Huawei to get around the sanctions.”

The ban is one of three by the U.S. government targeting Huawei. Last year, Trump signed a defense-spending bill that barred the federal government and its contractors from doing business with Huawei and several other Chinese companies on national security grounds. A separate ban prohibits companies that do business with Huawei from providing services to the U.S. government.

Some U.S. tech companies have applied for licenses that would allow them to continue to sell to Huawei, arguing that the Commerce Department ban could harm their bottom lines and their ability to innovate."

Justice Dept. again sides with Trump over House in personal financial records fight,https://www.cnn.com,['Katelyn Polantz'],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/19/politics/justice-trump-financial-records/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Trump administration's Justice Department has again taken President Donald Trump's side in a fight between him -- as a private citizen -- and the US House of Representatives over subpoenas for his personal financial records.

The Justice Department argues the two banks shouldn't have to hand over the subpoenaed information and accuses lawmakers of not taking the correct steps to seek the documents.

This is the first time the Justice Department has spoken up in this subpoena fight. Its foray into the case comes as House Democrats' attempts heat up to get Trump's financial records and to consider formal impeachment proceedings of the President.

On Friday, the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals is scheduled to consider whether two banks, Deutsche Bank and Capital One, will have to turn over Trump's information to House committees. Judge Jon Newman, a Jimmy Carter appointee, and Judges Debra Ann Livingston and Peter Hall, both appointed by President George W. Bush, will hear the arguments.

In its legal brief Monday, the Justice Department broadly criticizes how the House authorized the subpoenas before taking a full House vote. They also allege that House Democrats are unfairly targeting the President.

Meet the man ready to battle Congress in support of Trump’s immigration strategy,https://qz.com,[],,,,https://qz.com/1667511/meet-tom-homan-trumps-immigration-hawk-up-for-top-role-at-dhs/,"Tom Homan officially retired after 34 years of government service last June, but it’s pretty hard to tell. He has been an upstate New York beat cop, a Border Patrol officer and, these days, he’s the acting head of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Homan, 57, is also now one of the most vocal defenders of US president Donald Trump’s controversial immigration policies as a Fox News talking head and fiery op-ed contributor. His unyielding support was on full display at a bruising Congressional hearing in July, when Democrats attacked the administration’s continuing policy of family separation.

“I am thankful that we have a president that not only talks the talk about securing our border, but he walks the walk,” Homan said at the hearing. “No president has done more to try to secure our border, especially in a time of crisis, than president Trump.” He cited Trump’s executive orders, emergency declaration, and an agreement with Mexico that many immigration experts said was underwhelming.

In return, Homan is perpetually floated as a top candidate for any big Department of Homeland Security (DHS) job that comes up, including most recently the big one: Secretary. Trump even named Homan his “immigration czar” during a rambling Fox & Friends phone interview in June. He neglected to tell Homan, who has not formally been offered the job.

The Trump White House has not served as a smart career move for people of Homan’s age and experience. Well-established experts often leave with a worse reputation than when they arrived. There was Gary Cohn, the former economic advisor, whose reason for leaving earned him his own scathing Onion article. Rex Tillerson’s many years in the oil industry may forever be overshadowed by his firing as secretary of state while on the toilet.

Nonetheless, Homan is eager to serve, he told Quartz in a recent interview. He said he expects the president to nominate someone soon to be the permanent secretary of DHS. He’s not sure if it will be him, but whoever it is, he said, “has to be ready for a fight” with Congress.

Homan says democrats want “open borders” and to make “illegal immigration legal.” So whoever Trump nominates will need to withstand the likely political backlash.

“If your feelings are easily hurt, it’s not a job for you,” he said. He noted the time that the former secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, was booed in a Mexican restaurant in Washington after the administration launched its family separation policy.

As far as potential nominees go, Homan makes sense for Trump. He epitomizes the all-or-nothing approach of the president’s anti-immigration effort.

The White House’s current demands, as Homan stated in his Congressional testimony, include rewriting some of the current foundations of US immigration policy. The president wants Congress to eliminate the “Flores Settlement,” for instance, which limits the amount of time the government can detain families and provides immigrant children human rights protections. He also wants to alter the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPRA), which forces US officials to carefully screen children from Central America before deporting them, and tighten the standards by which asylum-seekers can claim they face a “credible fear” at home.

Back in 2016, when Trump was running for president, Homan was reluctant to share his thoughts on the candidate’s immigration policies. “I can’t say what I think,” he said at the time. Now, however, he is open about his support. “I don’t agree with everything he’s ever said, but he’s the first president who has ever tried to secure this border,” Homan told Quartz.

Homan says he fully supports the president’s efforts to make asylum laws more strict, for example. About 90% of asylum seekers pass the initial “credible fear” test that allows them to remain in the US and go through the process of applying for protections. The percentage of those who are actually granted asylum, however, has plummeted under the Trump administration. The process can take years, and the Trump administration wants to hold people in detention until they appear in court, resulting in overcrowded and unsanitary detention centers.

Immigration activists say there’s no reason to detain asylum-seekers in this way, and that offering immigrants a more humane option than detention, like assigning a case worker who shepherds them through the system, is a cheaper and more effective option.

“I understand the [credible fear] threshold is low on purpose because we don’t want to send people back to persecution and death. I get that,” Homan said. But it is “ridiculously low.”

On the controversial topic of “removals”—deporting people who have lived in the US for years and may not have committed any crime—Homan similarly has a cut-and-dry take.

“Everyone is having a fit right now,” he said, referring to public reaction to ICE raids. But, he explained, ICE sent out notices to thousands of people informing them they had been ordered to leave the country. He said these people were told to “turn themselves in” so immigration agencies could work with them to get them home. “They refused to show up,” Homan said. “So ICE has to go out and find them.”

“If they don’t do that there is no integrity in the entire system. We might as well take everyone off the border and get rid of all the judges, because there are no consequences.”

Supporting policies that aren’t working

Homan’s apparent allegiance to the Trump administration’s current immigration policy is a problem for the simple reason that the policies are so far not effective, experts say.

The nature of US immigration changed long before Trump became president. In the last two decades, the number of single men coming from Mexico for economic opportunity plummeted. In the same period, more and more families began traveling from Central America to find protection from violence back home.

It was only when Trump entered office, however, that the crisis reached its current level of urgency.

“The administration has repeatedly stated that the Congress is to blame for this situation at the border. But the legal framework in place today is the same that was in place, three, five, and 10 years ago,” said John Cohen, a veteran law enforcement officer and former acting under-secretary at DHS.

The problems at the border are “a direct result of the approach and programs put in place by this administration as it relates to border security,” he added.

Those policies and programs range from diverting funds to build a wall to reducing aid to Central America. The Trump administration also began a “metering” program, which limits the number of people who can apply for asylum. It has forced some asylum-seekers to stay in Mexico during their application process, and is putting more border-crossers in detention facilities. Overworked courts means those migrants could be in detention for months or even years.

“Everything they have done to restrict immigration has been misguided,” Cohen said. Instead of targeting Congress, Trump should be frustrated with the people at the White House who have “sold him an approach to border security and immigration that simply won’t work,” he added.

So Cohen doesn’t see how appointing Homan as secretary would have any positive result.

“My concern is that Homan is a one-trick pony,” Cohen said. “His career has been in a very narrow area of law enforcement…He believes the number one focus of the department and state and federal law enforcement should be immigration enforcement, and that is not a view shared by the overwhelming number of people in law enforcement.”

The DHS has a number of other responsibilities beyond immigration, including emergency response, aviation security and cybersecurity.

Cohen and other former officials argue that DHS needs someone who can simply right the ship, filling the numerous vacancies left by an administration that has removed anyone not on board with its vision. This will become especially important as the department soon faces the potential emergencies of another hurricane season, and tries to balance Trump’s demands to clamp down on legal immigration with the reality of US law, it’s own budget, and its many other responsibilities to the country.

Fighting for Trump

Trump has said he likes a fighter, however. And Homan showcased that kind of pugnaciousness at the House Oversight Committee hearing in July. House Democrats grilled him about the hundreds of kids separated from their parents at the border and the “subhuman” treatment that they faced.

“Do you have no shame about the fact that it’s all done in the shadow of the American flag?” asked a distraught Gerry Connolly, the Virginia Democrat.

Homan became furious after Jesus Garcia, the Illinois Democrat, accused him of ignoring the mistreatment of immigrant children because they were a different race:

In tense exchange, Rep. Jesús García spars with acting ICE Dir. Thomas Homan over child separation: “Is it because these children don’t look like children that are around you?” “Your comments are disgusting!” Homan responds. “This is out of control.” https://t.co/iDdAVvNOKm pic.twitter.com/TJh4StH1UL — ABC News (@ABC) July 12, 2019

Later, Homan told Fox he was so upset, he considered assaulting Garcia. So it seems he might be exactly what Trump is looking for in a new DHS head."
