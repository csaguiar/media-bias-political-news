""Did you see this Klan rally he was having there?"" Maher joked at the start of the 500th episode of ""Real Time,"" which he has been hosting since 2003. He added that Trump supporters had a ""goldfish memory.""

Maher later congratulated himself for the influence he believes his show has had on America.

""We went on the air in 2003. Since then, weed has become increasingly legal, religion is on the decline, and less people are having children,"" he said. ""You're welcome, America.""

TRUMP FORMALLY KICKS-OFF 2020 RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN

Maher continued with jokes about Trump being a racist. For example, he told the audience that Hope Hicks -- Trump's former White House communications director -- had admitted during Capitol Hill testimony this week that she had told ""white lies"" to protect the president.

""That's Trump for you,"" Maher said. ""Even the lies have to be white.""

""That's Trump for you. Even the lies have to be white."" — Bill Maher

Later, Maher took issue that the media did not point out that members of the controversial Proud Boys group had attended the Orlando rally, adding that the group's members were ""accepted"" by Trump's base.

""Look at these guys,"" Maher said, referring to the Proud Boys. ""They're making that, that sign, that white supremacist sign, and they're welcomed as part of this base. OK, I didn't hear about that at all this week.""

One of Maher's guests, Dan Savage -- the syndicated columnist and LGBT activist -- asserted that the Republican Party was ""controlled by racists.""

At another point in the show, Maher defended Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Biden over his controversial comments about having worked with segregationist senators. Maher blasted the media for focusing on the matter and dismissed Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Cory Booker's call for an apology from Biden as ""nonsense.""

""I always imagined that... some real person who, like, sees this chattering going on among people who sit in places like this on the coasts and are always talking about some nonsense and they're like, 'What the f--- are you talking about?'"" Maher said.

Maher also addressed Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and her controversial comparison of border detention centers to ""concentration camps.""

He noted that if Democrats planned to defeat Trump in 2020 by running on the topics of ""concentration camps"" and reparations, he wasn't sure they could pull it off.

""I’m not saying you can’t do it,"" he added. ""But [it's] very hard to argue that this is helping."""
ICE raids: Acting Homeland Security secretary McAleenan appears wary of enforcing Trump's latest plan,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Aaron Blake', 'Senior Political Reporter', 'Writing For The Fix', 'June At Am']",06-22-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/06/22/trumps-acting-dhs-secretary-appears-wary-immigration-raids-that-says-lot/,"

When President Trump announced his travel ban a week into his presidency, it was up to the Department of Homeland Security to implement it immediately. The result was chaos at our nation’s airports.

When Trump’s Justice Department announced a “zero tolerance” policy on illegal immigration, it was again up to DHS to make it workable. The result was the controversial — and since rescinded — separation of families.

Now Trump is trying to quickly implement another controversial immigration plan, by launching Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids to quickly deport undocumented families, starting Sunday.

And the head of DHS appears understandably wary.

The Washington Post’s Nick Miroff, who has been breaking news like crazy when it comes to the situation on the U.S.-Mexico border, reported Friday that the raids would begin this weekend. The scale is large, with as many as 2,000 families targeted in 10 major U.S. cities.

But this time, Trump’s acting Homeland Security secretary is apparently conveying that he’s not onboard with the plan for the “family op.” Kevin McAleenan, who has crafted a solid bipartisan reputation since taking over for Kirstjen Nielsen, has advised against such a quick implementation.

Here are few key passages from Miroff’s latest story:

Acting DHS secretary Kevin McAleenan has been urging ICE, an agency within his department, to conduct a narrower, more targeted operation that would seek to detain a group of about 150 families that were provided with attorneys but dropped out of the legal process and absconded. McAleenan has warned that an indiscriminate operation to arrest migrants in their homes and at work sites risks separating children from their parents in cases where the children are at day care, summer camp or friend’s houses. He also has maintained that ICE should not devote major resources to carrying out a mass interior sweep while telling lawmakers it needs emergency funding to address the crisis at the U.S. border. ... The White House has been in direct communication with acting ICE director Mark Morgan and other ICE officials, circumventing McAleenan, three officials said. ... McAleenan has said that the crisis at the border — where more than 144,000 were taken into custody last month — remains the most urgent problem for DHS. Following Trump’s threats to slap tariffs on Mexico, McAleenan led negotiations with Mexican officials that resulted in commitments to dramatically toughen enforcement and begin work on a regional asylum overhaul that would allow the United States to send asylum seekers back to Central America. Officials say McAleenan does not oppose ICE interior enforcement against families with deportation orders, but he wants a more limited approach that averts a repeat of “zero tolerance.”

The message from McAleenan seems rather simple: This risks distracting from some very real progress that we’re making and also diverts resources to a less-pressing issue. It’s an entirely logical stance. The situation on the southern border, after all, has reached crisis levels, according to Trump and his administration. McAleenan has argued the recently struck deal to get Mexico to halt the flow of migrants to the border will be a far more effective way to get the border surge under control. This operation deals with a separate but related issue of undocumented immigrants already within the country’s interior.

The lessons of the travel ban and “zero tolerance” loom large. The former suffered from the haste of its implementation, while the latter suffered from a perceived lack of humanity. The new operation risks problems on both fronts.

It seeks to round up families who have already received deportation orders, which would seem like an easier political sell. Are Democrats and other Trump opponents really going to say the administration can’t deport people who are due for deportation?

But the speed of the operation’s implementation harks back to the travel ban, and the possibility of unhelpful images looms large. Children behind chain-link fences without their parents was one thing. What happens when ICE officials are recorded showing up to deport a family — or, as McAleenan reportedly warned, it results in families being separated yet again? The potential pitfalls of such a large and fast operation are numerous.

Like McAleenan, Nielsen was occasionally reported to have expressed reservations about some of Trump’s initiatives, including the family separation policy. Despite that, the program is likely to be prominent when it comes to history’s evaluation of her tenure. Even John Kelly, Nielsen’s predecessor as DHS secretary who went on to become White House chief of staff, has sought distance from some of Trump’s immigration policies.

McAleenan has stepped into the void and, by the accounts of even Democrats, has been a breath of fresh air. The fact that he apparently wants no part of this new approach seems telling."
Trump responds to accusation of '90s sexual assault,https://www.cnn.com,"['Veronica Stracqualursi', 'Caroline Kelly']",06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/21/politics/trump-new-york-magazine-assault-e-jean-carroll/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump on Friday responded to allegations of sexual assault after magazine advice columnist E. Jean Carroll alleged he had attacked her at a New York luxury department store in the late 1990s.

Carroll details the allegations in her forthcoming book, ""What Do We Need Men For? A Modest Proposal,"" excerpts of which were published earlier Friday in New York Magazine . While Carroll does not appear to name Trump in the printed excerpt of the first-person account, he is named in the headline, which reads: ""Hideous Men Donald Trump assaulted me in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room 23 years ago. But he's not alone on the list of awful men in my life.""

Trump denied the allegations in a statement Friday, saying he had ""never met this person."" He accused Carroll of sharing her account to raise book sales, comparing her to women who ""falsely accused"" Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his contentious confirmation hearings. The article published Friday includes a photo of Trump and Carroll talking in a group.

""Shame on those who make up false stories of assault to try to get publicity for themselves, or sell a book, or carry out a political agenda -- like Julie Swetnick who falsely accused Justice Brett Kavanaugh,"" Trump said. ""It's just as bad for people to believe it, particularly when there is zero evidence. Worse still for a dying publication to try to prop itself up by peddling fake news -- it's an epidemic.""

Carroll claims that she encountered Trump in the fall of 1995 or spring 1996 at the Bergdorf Goodman department store, where she says he attacked her in one of the dressing rooms.

"Trump's Pentagon pick is Army veteran, defense lobbyist",https://www.aol.com,"['Aol Staff', 'Eric Tucker']",06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.aol.com/article/news/2019/06/21/trumps-pentagon-pick-is-army-veteran-defense-lobbyist/23754346/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's pick for new defense secretary is an Army veteran who served in the first Iraq war and also has experience as a national security adviser on Capitol Hill as well as a defense industry lobbyist.

Trump announced Friday that he would nominate Mark Esper to lead the Pentagon. Trump had already named Esper, his current Army secretary, to lead the Defense Department on an acting basis, starting Sunday.

""I know Mark, and have no doubt he will do a fantastic job!"" the president tweeted Tuesday.

He later told reporters: ""He's very experienced. He's been around all of the things that we've been talking about for a very long period of time.""

Tuesday's move came after acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan withdrew from the job before his formal nomination had gone to the Senate, citing a ""painful"" family situation that would hurt his children and reopen ""wounds we have worked years to heal.""

Esper was sworn in as Army secretary in November 2017 following a seven-year stint as vice president for government relations at defense contractor Raytheon. That lobbyist background raised immediate alarms from Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which said that Raytheon had recently won multiple government contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

""While Esper may not have had sway over these types of deals as Secretary of the Army, as acting Secretary of Defense he will have potential influence over such deals,"" as well as a proposed merger between Raytheon and United Technologies Corp., CREW executive director Noah Bookbinder said in a statement.

Esper previously served a national security adviser for former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist.

He was policy director for the House Armed Services Committee and a professional staff member on the Senate Foreign Relations committee and also advised former Obama administration Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel when Hagel was in the Senate.

He's also served as a deputy assistant secretary of defense and was a war planner on the Army staff.

Esper spent more than a decade in the Army, including serving in the Persian Gulf War in 1990 and 1991 with the 101st Airborne Division. He has won the Bronze Star Medal and other awards.

""He has a great background. I know him and I think he'll do very well in the acting role,"" said Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., a close Trump ally who speaks frequently with the president.

It is not clear whether Esper's defense industry background might complicate any confirmation prospects.

Shanahan, for instance, came under scrutiny because of his prior career as a Boeing executive and persistent questions about possible conflicts of interest.

The Defense Department's Inspector General cleared Shanahan of any wrongdoing in connection with accusations he had shown favoritism toward Boeing during his time as deputy defense secretary, while disparaging Boeing competitors.

But even so, Bookbinder said Shanahan's past work at Boeing overshadowed his decisions at the Defense Department.

""His successor will likewise risk being tainted by his previous work for a major defense contractor,"" Bookbinder said.

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – Three Veterans Affairs health care professionals who reported patient care issues say the agency continues to try to silence them, jeopardizing veterans and undercutting a key Trump promise of whistleblower protection.

They work at different sites – in the Phoenix area, Baltimore, and Iowa City, Iowa – yet the VA response has been similar. All were stripped of assigned patient-care and oversight duties, and they suspect VA managers are retaliating against them for speaking out, and sidelining them to prevent them from discovering or disclosing any more problems with veteran health care.

In exclusive interviews with USA TODAY, their assertions contradict proclamations by agency leaders and President Donald Trump that VA employees who disclose wrongdoing at the agency are being celebrated and not scorned.

""The VA is two-faced: What it says it does and what it actually does are two entirely different things,"" said Katherine Mitchell, a physician who reported shortfalls in care at the Phoenix VA that earned her a federal ""Public Servant of the Year Award"" in 2014.

Mitchell is scheduled to testify at a congressional hearing Tuesday examining the treatment of whistleblowers at the VA. She will be joined by Iowa City CT technologist Jeffrey Dettbarn, who blew the whistle on mass-cancellations of diagnostic test orders, and Baltimore VA psychologist Minu Aghevli, who reported veterans had been removed improperly from wait lists for opioid-addiction treatment.

Mitchell said the retaliation against her and others who speak out sends a signal to other employees to keep their mouths shut and ""jeopardizes the health and safety of every veteran in the system.""

""Whistleblowers who are brave enough to report problems serve as a vital safety net for veterans,"" she said. ""If people can’t identify problems, veterans will suffer and die. That’s what it boils down to.""

Trump's accountability order

Trump signed an executive order creating a VA Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection and then a law making it permanent in 2017. Early reviews were promising – within several months, the office had delayed disciplinary actions against 70 VA employees who disclosed alleged wrongdoing.

But the VA inspector general has since launched a wide-ranging investigation of the office’s handling of whistleblower cases and reports of problems.

The Government Accountability Office issued a report last July that said the office allowed officials accused of wrongdoing or retaliation to be involved in investigations of the accusations – calling into question their independence and findings. And leadership at the office has turned over multiple times, causing confusion and disruption.

Exclusive: Inside Trump's new VA office, early moves to help whistleblowers draw praise

In response to inquiries from USA TODAY, VA spokesman Randall Noller issued a statement Wednesday saying the agency ""welcomes the inspector general’s oversight.""

""For the last several months, we’ve been cooperating closely with the IG on its assessment and encouraging the office to release its report as soon as possible,"" he said.

An assistant secretary who took over the office in January, Tamara Bonzanto, plans to use its findings as a ""roadmap"" for improving office operations, Noller said. In the meantime, she has been ""working on a number of key improvements.""

""These include providing timelier resolutions, more responsive recommendations and enhancing communications with whistleblowers,"" he said.

Noller declined to say what policies are in place to ensure the office doesn’t allow managers accused of wrongdoing or retaliation to be involved in investigating the accusations. Noller also declined to comment on assertions made by Aghevli, Dettbarn and Mitchell, citing federal privacy laws.

Whistleblower advocates say they haven’t seen much difference in recent years. Jacqueline Garrick, founder of non-profit peer-support group Whistleblowers of America, said more than 190 VA employees have contacted her since 2017, complaining about retaliation for speaking out about problems at the agency, most about how veterans are treated.

She said those who have gone to the Trump-created whistleblower protection office for help said the office's employees turned around and investigated them instead, launching ""counter accusations and further retaliation.""

She said Bonzanto told her in February she planned to ""reset"" the office’s operations. Still, Garrick said, ""I haven’t seen any real sign of that.""

She and other advocates also are slated to testify before Congress Tuesday at the hearing before the House VA Committee’s Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations examining whistleblower concerns.

Backlogs and lists

In Iowa City, Dettbarn noticed something was awry in 2017 when patients showed up to get CT scans but orders for the tests had been cancelled in the computer system.

He reported the problems to administrators, who later admitted they had been mass-cancelling diagnostic test orders as part of a national effort to clear out a backlog of out-dated or duplicate orders.

Weeks after Dettbarn reported his concerns that orders had been cancelled without contacting patients or a medical review to determine if veterans still needed the tests, he was removed from his job and then transferred to another position, pending an investigation – of him.

He said he has been spending all day every day making copies and doing other paperwork ever since, nearly two years later. Dettbarn went to the whistleblower protection office for help, but said he didn't hear back for months on end. ""As far as I know, I'm still under investigation,"" he said.

He wants to go back to caring for patients, and he worries about being away from the diagnostic clinic for so long.

""There's nobody there to watch out for the veterans,"" he said. ""They've got everybody else scared to say anything. Who's taking care of those patients?""

Investigation: Mass cancellations of diagnostic test orders at VA hospitals draw scrutiny

In Baltimore, Aghevli began reporting problems with wait lists five years ago, at the same time a national scandal unfolded about VA wait times following revelations that veterans died while they waited for care at the VA hospital in Phoenix.

Aghevli, coordinator of the opioid-addiction treatment program at the VA Maryland Health Care System, reported being pressured by supervisors to remove veterans from a wait list for treatment and schedule them in an ""imaginary clinic"" so the list would appear shorter.

""Suddenly our wait list went from being well over 100 to being minimal, I mean, well under 20,"" she said.

A review of her allegations by the VA inspector general later concluded veterans were removed from the list and placed in ""non-count"" status, even though they still wanted opioid-addiction treatment at the Baltimore VA.

But Aghevli said she quickly became ""unpopular"" with supervisors who turned around in the ensuing years and investigated her repeatedly, tried to transfer her, and threatened to shut down her program – which serves roughly 400 veterans. She said they excluded her from meetings, changed her hours, and at one point, detailed her to clerical duties.

Through it all, she continued to report patient care problems when she came across them – including improper discharges, short-staffing and medication issues – to her supervisors, to the inspector general and to members of Congress.

""If I see somebody not getting adequate treatment, or not getting treatment that's clinically indicated, I will speak up about it,"" Aghevli said.

But she said she is still being retaliated against. In April, Baltimore VA officials once again moved her out of her job to a data entry post and stripped her of her clinical privileges, pending investigation. Aghevli said the reason they gave was that she had visited a veteran patient in a non-VA hospital after he had suffered a health crisis, a situation that ostensibly could give rise to charges she was practicing at a hospital where she didn't work.

Aghevli called the explanation ""nonsensical."" She is going public with her story for the first time. ""I just am not sure what else to do,"" she said.

She wants protections for whistleblowers expanded and strengthened. ""I would like other people to not go through this,"" she said. ""It's been really awful.""

Noller, the VA spokesman, declined to comment on her case as well as Dettbarn's and Mitchell's unless they signed waivers of their rights under federal privacy laws. Mitchell and Dettbarn declined, fearing further retaliation.

Aghevli's lawyer, Kevin Owen, agreed on the condition the waiver be negotiated with VA general counsel. He said Friday that agency lawyers had not contacted him.

'I will not back down'

In Gilbert, Arizona, Mitchell has endured more subtle retaliation.

After she reported poor training and inadequate triage at the emergency room at the Phoenix VA, she reached an agreement with VA officials to move to a new job assessing health care quality and efficiency at facilities in the region.

""I was hoping to improve patient care on a wider scale,"" said Mitchell, who was a nurse before becoming a doctor.

But she said that, with very few exceptions, she hasn’t been allowed to perform those oversight duties. Mitchell has had to resort to helping veterans ""under the table"" – in some cases, receiving reports confidentially from VA employees, taking it upon herself to investigate, and then writing reports to regional administrators.

They included flagging poor care provided by a neurologist who was later removed, a facility’s failure to biopsy a potentially cancerous skin lesion and radiation oncology treatments delayed by short-staffing.

""They were not happy,” she said of administrators, but they didn’t stop her and facilities appeared to take actions to address the problems. Still, she said, VA employees told her they were ""actively being discouraged from talking"" to her.

Since 2018, Mitchell has been in charge of implementing an initiative to complement medical care with yoga, acupuncture and other methods to improve veterans’ health.

""They don’t want me involved in any patient safety problems – any problem of any significance, they want to keep me away from it,"" she said.

Mitchell has asked another federal agency that helps whistleblowers for help, the Office of Special Counsel, and is speaking out again about problems in the meantime that she says are jeopardizing veterans.

""As a physician, nurse, and basically as a human being, I will not back down if someone’s health or safety is being threatened,"" she said.

Hundreds of migrant caravan members found to have US criminal histories: DHS files,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hundreds-of-migrant-caravan-found-to-have-criminal-histories-dhs-files,"Hundreds of illegal immigrants attempting to cross the southern border as part of massive migrant caravans were found to have criminal histories in the U.S., according to newly obtained Department of Homeland Security documents.

The DHS files were provided to House Oversight Committee Republicans in May and included internal data showing more than 1,000 migrants traveling as part of caravans to the border within the past nine months had “U.S. criminal histories” and hundreds had “U.S. criminal convictions.”

BORDER ARRESTS SKYROCKET IN MAY, AS OFFICIALS DECLARE 'FULL-BLOWN EMERGENCY'

The files detailed one migrant caravan of nearly 8,000 individuals that started toward the border in October 2018 and arrived south of California by December. According to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), 660 of them had U.S. criminal convictions—with 40 convicted of assault or aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and three convicted of murder.

In January 2019, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) tracked another caravan that left Honduras with more than 3,300 migrants. ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) team identified that 860 of those individuals had U.S. criminal histories, including more than 20 convicted of assault or aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, nearly 30 convicted of sexual offenses, two convicted of violence against law enforcement, and one convicted of attempted murder.

The documents, provided to House Oversight Republicans, also revealed that CBP is currently monitoring another “movement of several groups ranging in size from 1,000 to 4,000” in the Mexican states of Chiapas and Veracruz, but did not specify how many of those migrants are believed to have criminal records.

In a letter to DHS Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan on Thursday, committee Ranking Member Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, requested further information about caravan members with criminal backgrounds to “assist” in their “oversight of the crisis at the southern border and better understand the threat posed by large caravans.”

Jordan requested arrest warrants, court documents and other materials detailing the criminal histories of the migrants in the January 2019 and October 2018 caravan; an update of CBP’s monitoring of the caravan movement in Mexican states; and summaries of ICE HSI materials by July 5.

In his letter, Jordan referred to President Trump’s decision in February to declare a national emergency and referred to his comments that the “southern border is a major entry point for criminals, gang members, and illicit narcotics” threatening “core national security interests.”

The newly revealed DHS information comes amid a stunning surge across the border this year. Last month, the number of migrants apprehended at the southern border skyrocketed to levels not seen in over a decade, with CBP reporting nearly 133,000 arrests in May. The number surpassed 144,000 when counting migrants deemed inadmissible—more than a 30 percent increase from the prior month and double the influx recorded at the beginning of the year. The number was the highest monthly total in more than 13 years, officials said.

“We are in a full-blown emergency,” Acting CBP Commissioner John Sanders said earlier this month. In April, authorities recorded 99,304 arrests.

FOOTAGE SHOWS MIGRANTS WALKING AROUND BORDER WALL TO ENTER US

McAleenan, in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, also warned that 90 percent of asylum seekers skip their hearings after being released into the U.S.

The continued crisis at the border comes as Trump has sought to extend and shore up the border wall, declaring a national emergency in a bid to divert billions toward construction -- an effort being challenged in the courts.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration announced that it had reached a deal with Mexico to drop threatened tariffs on Mexican imports in exchange for Mexico increasing efforts to limit U.S.-bound migration flows from Central America.

Through the agreement, the U.S. is slated to extend its policy of returning asylum applicants to Mexico while their claims are processed. The U.S. also committed to accelerating asylum claims while Mexico said it will “offer jobs, healthcare, and education according to its principles.”

The deal also stated that Mexico will take “decisive action” to dismantle smuggling and trafficking operations, while both countries will increase cooperation to protect the border.

Chinese telecom giant Huawei has filed a civil lawsuit against the U.S. government accusing the Commerce Department of mishandling equipment that it seized from the company in 2017.

According to the complaint filed Friday, the U.S. government took possession of several pieces of equipment, which were being shipped from an independent testing facility in the United States to China, in order to determine if the technology was subject to export controls.

Huawei contends it provided the necessary documentation and was told such disputes are usually resolved in 45 days. Nearly two years later, Huawei believes the equipment is still sitting in an Alaskan warehouse, according to the complaint.

Huawei is not seeking financial compensation but instead wants the court to force the Commerce Department to decide whether export control clearance is necessary and, if not, release the equipment.

A spokesperson for the Commerce Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The lawsuit comes as tensions between Huawei and the U.S. government have reached a fever pitch.

The Justice Department charged Huawei earlier this year with violating U.S. sanctions against Iran and stealing trade secrets from U.S. competitors. Meanwhile, Huawei sued the U.S.government, saying a law passed by Congress that banned federal agencies from doing business with the company was unconstitutional.

What's more, the Commerce Department slapped severe trade restrictions on Huawei last month that prevent U.S. companies from selling vital equipment to the company, a penalty that Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei recently said could cost the company $30 billion in lost sales over two years.

Justice Department files antitrust suit to stop massive acquisition by Quad/Graphics,https://www.jsonline.com,"['Rick Romell', 'Published A.M. Ct June']",06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.jsonline.com/story/money/business/2019/06/21/justice-department-files-antitrust-suit-stop-big-quad-graphics-acquisition/1519957001/,"CLOSE

The U.S. Justice Department is suing to block Quad/Graphics Inc.'s proposed $1.4 billion acquisition of LSC Communications, saying the merger would combine the only two significant magazine, catalog and book printers in the country.

""LSC is Quad’s primary competitor,"" Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim said in a statement. ""If this deal were allowed to proceed, Quad would dominate the markets for magazine, catalog, and book printing services and be able to raise prices and reduce quality at the expense of publishers, retailers, and, ultimately, American consumers.”

The two companies are by far the largest printers in the U.S. and their ""intense, head-to-head competition"" has benefited customers, the department said.

Sussex-based Quad, one of the largest private employers in Wisconsin, said it would ""vigorously defend"" the proposed acquisition. The firm said the Justice Department is ignoring ""dynamic conditions"" in commercial printing and the fact that printers compete not just with each other but with burgeoning digital advertising channels such as Google and Facebook.

""Given the continued migration of advertising dollars to digital channels,"" printers have pursued consolidations to reduce overcapacity and battle more effectively with digital competitors, Quad said in a statement.

Neither Quad nor LSC has been a stellar performer of late. LSC lost money in two of the last three years. Over that same period, Quad netted 1.5% on its sales and saw revenue decline.

Both, though, are large companies, with dozens of manufacturing and distribution plants and tens of thousands of workers.

Quad as of December had the equivalent of 20,600 employees, including 8,000 in Wisconsin and 16,900 across the U.S. Sales last year hit $4.2 billion.

Chicago-based LSC was created in 2016 when RR Donnelley & Sons Co. spun off the wing of its business that concentrated on printing magazines, catalogs, retail inserts and books.

LSC employed 22,000 people as of December, including 18,700 in the U.S. Its 2018 sales totaled $3.8 billion.

In an interview last fall, Joel Quadracci, Quad's chairman, president and CEO, said the acquisition of LSC would give Quad the scale and cash-generating capacity to smooth its transition toward becoming not just a printer but ""more of a marketing services partner"" to its customers.

""This is a defining moment in Quad’s 47-year journey,"" Quadracci said.

Sprinkled throughout the Justice Department's complaint, filed Thursday in federal court in Chicago, are examples of how the government says intense competition between Quad and LSC has benefited customers.

When the two printing giants dueled for a contract with a major book publisher, the government alleges, one LSC executive, likening the competition to the Battle of Gettysburg, declared, ""We must win"" — only to see Quad scoop up the account by offering the publisher a deal that would save it $37 million over its current arrangement.

In another case, the complaint says, Quad tried to keep a magazine publisher from switching to LSC by offering a 25% price cut. But when the publisher told LSC of the ""Godfather deal"" Quad had offered, LSC responded with even better terms. It won the contract, and the publisher realized $6.5 million in immediate benefits, the complaint says.

Such episodes, the government alleges, demonstrate why LSC's chief executive told investors a merger with Quad could lead to ""pricing stability"" and eliminate such battles between the companies.

According to the complaint, Quad and LSC control a high percentage of web offset presses in the U.S. and all rotogravure presses — the types of equipment publishers turn to for printing long runs of magazines.

Meanwhile, the government said, a presentation by Quad’s board of directors described LSC and Quad as holding a combined 69% of the catalog printing market.

In a statement, Quadracci said merging with LSC would help ensure print's viability as a channel for publishers and retailers.

""Our goal is to make print a more effective and affordable media option to that of digital giants such as Google and Facebook,"" Quadracci said. ""The DOJ does not appear to recognize the competitive effect of digital media on the print industry.""

The government, for its part, said in its complaint that people will continue to demand printed magazines, catalogs and books. Because of that, a digital-only platform is not an effective substitute to print for many publishers, the complaint said.

"DHS cancels some Global Entry appointments as summer travel heats up, citing border crush",https://www.cnn.com,['Geneva Sands'],06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/20/politics/global-entry-canceled-appointments-resources-border/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Department of Homeland Security has had to cancel some Global Entry appointments as the summer travel season heats up as it transfers people to help at the southern border, a department official tells CNN.

Global Entry is a Customs and Border Protection program that ""allows expedited clearance for pre-approved, low-risk travelers upon arrival"" in the US. The Trusted Traveler Programs website , which includes Global Entry, already has an alert warning applicants that the ""extended partial government shutdown has resulted in a backlog,"" of applications and renewals.

The personnel shift comes amid a swell of migrant families and children that have arrived at the US border this year. The influx has strained DHS immigration resources and caused concerns about overcrowding and delayed US Border Patrol processing.

In response to efforts at the border, ""CBP is temporarily reducing staff at Global Entry Enrollment Centers nationwide and reassigning them to support frontline traveler processing during the busy summer months,"" Customs and Border Protection said in a statement.

""Regrettably, this situation has forced the cancellation of some scheduled appointments and may make it difficult to schedule an immediate interview,"" the statement said.

Chip stocks fall after Commerce Dept bars 5 more Chinese companies from buying US parts,https://www.cnbc.com,['Yun Li'],06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/21/chip-stocks-fall-after-commerce-dept-bars-5-more-chinese-firms-from-buying-us-parts.html,"The U.S. Commerce Department has banned five more Chinese entities from buying U.S. components after blacklisting telecom giant Huawei last month.

Higon, Chengdu Haiguang Integrated Circuit, Chengdu Haiguang Microelectronics Technology, Sugon and Wuxi Jiangnan Institute of Computing Technology are the five Chinese firms added to the department's entity list, according to a filing.

The department said the activities of these companies ""pose a significant risk of being or becoming involved in activities contrary to the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States.""

Shares of U.S. semiconductors came under pressure after the announcement. Advanced Micro Devices tumbled more than 3%, while Xilinx and Nvidia also fell 2.2% and 1.5%, respectively.

The move came before President Donald Trump's key meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the G-20 summit this month to discuss the lingering trade differences. The U.S. and China have slapped tariffs on billions of dollars worth of each other's goods, while ramping up tit-for-tat threats in the ongoing trade war.

The Commerce Department said Sugon and the Wuxi Jiangnan Institute of Computing Technology are the leaders in China's development of exascale high-performance computing.

Sugon has publicly acknowledged ""a variety of military end uses and end users of its high-performance computers,"" the department said. Wuxi Jiangnan Institute of Computing Technology's mission is ""to support China's military modernization,"" the department noted.

The U.S. restrictions on Huawei have forced many American chipmakers and tech companies including Google to cut ties with the Chinese giant. Huawei's U.S. chip suppliers, including Qualcomm and Intel, are reportedly quietly lobbying to ease the Huawei ban."
EPA to connect Loudoun homes contaminated by landfill to public water,https://wtop.com,['News Traffic Weather'],06-21-2019,2019,6,https://wtop.com/loudoun-county/2019/06/epa-to-connect-loudoun-homes-contaminated-by-landfill-to-public-water/,"The privately owned and operated Hidden Lane Landfill was a 25-acre disposal site that health officials with Loudoun County and Virginia deemed to be the likely source of drinking water contamination in the Board Run Farms community that was first discovered in 1989.

More than 120 properties in the Broad Run Farms community affected by Hidden Lane Landfill superfund site groundwater contamination will be hooked up to the public water system by the federal Environmental Protestion Agency, according to Virginia’s Loudoun County.

The construction won’t cost property owners a dime but it will cost the agency millions.

The privately owned and operated Hidden Lane Landfill was a 25-acre disposal site that health officials with both the county and Virginia deemed to be the likely source of Broad Run Farms drinking water contamination first discovered in 1989.

The chemical that was discovered is called trichloroethylene, or TCE. According to the National Toxicology Program (an interagency group coordinated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services), it’s primarily used in two ways: to make hydrofluorocarbon chemicals, especially refrigerants, and as a solvent to remove grease from metal parts.

The NIH also says it’s a known carcinogen and can increase the risk of cancer.

“We are grateful to the EPA for this decision and while we advocated for the extension of public water to the entire Broad Run Farms community, this is a significant action that will benefit those residents most directly impacted in the community,” Algonkian District Supervisor Suzanne Volpe, who represents the area on the Board of Supervisors, said in a Thursday news release.

“I would also like to commend the dedicated and long-term efforts of Loudoun County staff as well as the Virginia Department of Health and the Department of Environmental Quality for getting us to this milestone.”

There’s no word yet on when construction of the new water lines is slated to begin.

"State Department condemns Iran, China for persecuting religious minorities",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Carol Morello', 'National Reporter Focusing On Foreign Policy', 'State Department', 'June At Pm']",06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/state-department-condemns-iran-china-for-persecuting-religious-minorities/2019/06/21/97b5621d-89c9-40d5-b86c-ea87a25b933b_story.html,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, with Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom Sam Brownback, left, and State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus, speaks about the 2018 International Religious Freedom Annual Report on June 21. (Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)

The State Department condemned China and Iran on Friday for treating religious minorities as national security threats meriting surveillance, imprisonment and sometimes death.

In introducing the annual report on International Religious Freedom, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo struck an unusual personal note, noting he had been a Sunday school teacher and a church deacon, and took a swipe at Washington.

“That might sound unusual to a lot of people inside the Beltway,” he said. “But I am one of millions of Americans, and billions of people across the world, who live in the knowledge of a higher power. I often humbly reflect on how God’s providence has guided me to this office, to defend this cause.”

Samuel Brownback, the ambassador for religious freedom, said: “We believe there is no more important time for the United States to promote religious freedom than now.”

The annual report looks at the government policies that violate religious belief and practices in every country of the world except the United States.

China and Iran are among 10 countries of particular concern when it comes to religious freedom, meaning they may face sanctions. The chapters are considerably longer than those of North Korea, which Brownback called “horrible” for religious freedom, or on Myanmar, where ethnic Rohingya have been subjected to harassment and violence.

The report was released amid growing tensions between the United States and Iran, as well as China.

The United States and China have been in a trade war for nearly a year. While talks go on, the Trump administration has shied away from placing sanctions on Chinese officials involved in the detention of 1 million or more ethnic Uighurs and other minority Muslims in the northwest region of Xinjiang. Brownback said some sanctions have been placed on the manufacturers of equipment used to surveil religious minorities, and the United States frequently raises its concerns publicly.

Iranian Christians and other religious minorities are among those who have lost opportunities to emigrate to the United States as part of deep cuts in refugee admissions from Iran. Brownback said the criteria for religious minorities getting preference as refugees changed during the Obama administration, and it is time for the policy to be reviewed.

The religious freedom report lists detailed accounts of religious minorities in countries around the world who were subjected to “death, forced disappearances, and organ harvesting in prison because of their religious beliefs or affiliation.”

Pompeo has spoken forcefully against the treatment of Uighur Muslims sent to what he has called “reeducation camps.” U.S. attempts to berate the Chinese have sparked little change, however. After Pompeo met with four Uighurs in March to discuss human rights abuses, the aunt and uncle of one of them, a U.S. citizen, learned his aunt and uncle had been moved from a camp and sentenced to eight years in prison.

The report said Chinese Christians also have been increasingly oppressed, with authorities closing churches, burning bibles and ordering believers to renounce their faith.

The chapter on Iran accuses the government of meting out harsh punishments to those who are not Shiite Muslims. Iran’s penal code specifies death for crimes like enmity against God, corruption on earth and insulting the prophets.

But there is little the U.S. government can do about it, except protest publicly. With no diplomatic relations between Tehran and Washington, the report says, U.S. diplomats “did not have opportunities to raise concerns directly with the government over its religious freedom abuses and restrictions.”"
"L3, Harris merger proceeding after Justice Department ruling",https://spacenews.com,['Caleb Henry'],06-22-2019,2019,6,https://spacenews.com/l3-harris-merger-proceeding-after-justice-department-ruling/,"SANTA BARBARA, California — Harris Corp. and L3 Technologies said June 21 that their merger has the regulatory approvals needed to close following a Justice Department decision.

The Justice Department stipulated that Harris Corp. divest its night vision business for the merger to proceed. Harris Corp. and L3 Technologies are the sole suppliers of a critical component used in military grade night vision systems, raising concerns that the combined company would monopolize the technology.

The Justice Department simultaneously filed a civil antitrust lawsuit June 20 to block the merger as originally proposed, and a settlement that would see Harris Corp.’s night vision business separated from the combined company.

Harris announced in April it would sell its night vision business to the U.S. division of Israeli defense and technology company Elbit Systems for $350 million in cash. In a June 21 statement, Harris and L3 reiterated that plan.

“The merger, as originally structured, would have given the combined company a monopoly over image intensifier tubes, an essential component in night vision devices used by the United States military,” Makan Delrahim, assistant attorney general of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division, said in a statement. “Today’s settlement will ensure that our armed forces continue to benefit from competition for a mission critical component that soldiers operating in low-light environments rely on every day.”

Harris and L3 supply space technology for numerous commercial and military programs. L3 builds spacecraft sensor payloads, launcher avionics and travelling wave tube amplifiers used in telecommunications satellites. Harris provides unfurlable antennas, hosted payloads, and launched a cubesat in November that could open the floodgates for constellation production, particularly for classified buyers.

Harris on June 21 received an $18 million contract modification to build L- and S-band antennas for the Air Force Satellite Control Network.

Harris and L3 said their approximately $34 billion merger is now set to close June 29. The merger remains on track to close around the time forecasted in October when first announced despite the Justice Department scrutiny. The company will take the name L3Harris Technologies, Inc, and will trade on the New York Stock Exchange as LHX.

Harris CEO Bill Brown said May 1 that he still expects L3Harris Technologies will reach $3 billion in free cash flow in three years."

— A bright, white dot spotted over the Dayton area and numerous suburbs of the city could be part of the U.S. Department of Defense’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, also known as DARPA.

>> Live Doppler 7 Radar

“DARPA launched three balloons from Cumberland, Maryland, in a flight test for the Adaptable Lighter Than Air Program,” said Heather Babb, spokeswoman for the Department of Defense. “ALTA will demonstrate capability for wind-borne navigation of a lighter-than-air vehicle over extended ranges.”

>> PREVIOUS: What was that bright, white dot hanging over parts of the Miami Valley?

Babb stopped short of confirming that the bright, white dot spotted by numerous News Center 7 viewers was indeed a DARPA balloon, however another spokesperson for DARPA said given the location it was likely one of their balloons.

Sightings of the object were reported Tuesday to News Center 7 from viewers in Xenia, Englewood, West Milton, West Carrollton and Eaton.

DARPA’s ALTA program’s balloons can fly at altitudes of more than 75,000 feet.

“While they do not have independent propulsion, the ALTA vehicle is designed to navigate by changing altitude and thus taking advantage of different wind profiles aloft,” according to DARPA’s website.

DARPA dates back to the launch of Sputnik in 1957 and also has played roles in precision weapons and stealth technology, and other technology advances such as the Internet, automated voice recognition, language transition and GPS.

DARPA is comprised of about 220 government employees in six technical offices, who oversee about 250 research and development programs."
Justice Dept review of intel in Russia probe fuels fears of politicization,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Olivia Gazis'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/justice-department-review-of-intelligence-in-russia-probe-fuels-fears-of-politicization/,"A mix of concern, confusion and defiance has spread through elements of the intelligence community as a murky picture emerges of Attorney General William Barr's review of its investigative and analytical work on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

In particular, current and former intelligence officials are questioning the purpose and propriety of the attorney general's intention, first reported by The New York Times, to enlist John Durham, the U.S. attorney for the District of Connecticut, in scrutinizing the analytical judgments that led a group of agencies to conclude that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign to boost then-candidate Trump's electability.

That judgment, put forth in a declassified Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA) commissioned by former president Barack Obama and released in January 2017, pooled the findings of the CIA, FBI and NSA. The CIA and FBI expressed ""high confidence"" in that conclusion, while the NSA had ""moderate confidence.""

""I see no problem with a DOJ review of whether the CIA and other intelligence community agencies lived up to their legal and regulatory responsibilities related to how they handled any information related to U.S. persons – U.S. citizens and U.S. nationals,"" said Michael Morell, a former CIA deputy director who is a CBS News senior national security contributor. ""Having said that, I see a DOJ review of whether or not the intelligence analysts made the right call as wholly inappropriate. I cannot ever remember a DOJ review of analysis.""

""[Durham] and his team have no experience with, or knowledge of, the process of intelligence analysis,"" Morell said. ""He and his team could well impose a law enforcement standard in coming to a conclusion — a much higher bar than exists in the intelligence community for analytic judgments.""

Both the House and Senate Intelligence Committees have already examined the process by which the ICA was assembled and offered their declassified assessments.

In their March 2018 final report on Russia's active measures, Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee — without describing what kind of evidence was examined — said ""most"" of the ICA's analysis ""held up to scrutiny."" But they criticized its judgment on Putin's strategic objectives for having ""failed to meet most of the analytic standards set forth in the primary guiding document for IC analysis."" (The committee's Democrats dissented from that view.)

That document – Intelligence Community Directive 203 – stipulates, among other things, that analytic products should be ""objective,"" ""timely,"" and ""independent of political consideration.""

But in July, the Senate Intelligence Committee — whose leadership has maintained a vastly more united and bipartisan front than the fractious panel in the House — issued a declassified summary of a months-long assessment that found the ICA to be a ""sound intelligence product."" The committee said it had reviewed ""thousands of pages of source documents and conducted interviews with all the relevant parties — including agency heads, managers, and line analysts — who were involved in developing the analysis and drafting the assessment.""

""In all the interviews of those who drafted and prepared the ICA, the Committee heard consistently that analysts were under no politically motivated pressure to reach any conclusions,"" the summary said. ""All analysts expressed that they were free to debate, object to content, and assess confidence levels, as is normal and proper for the analytic process.""

Analytical disagreement, the committee said, was ""reasonable, transparent, and openly debated.""

The Senate panel is expected to release a declassified version of a far more extensive report on the ICA in the coming months, though the bulk of their assessment is likely to remain classified.

Asked whether the Justice Department's review was duplicative of the panel's work, a spokeswoman for the Senate Intelligence Committee declined to comment.

Morell said a DOJ probe into analysts' conclusions could have a ""chilling effect"" on the analytic process.

""Any analyst asked to submit to an interview with Durham's investigators will want to have their own personal attorney at their side,"" he said. ""Imagine that — needing an attorney to explain an analytic judgment.""

""This will all be watched closely inside the IC and the prospect that DOJ prosecutors may ask questions about how an analyst came to a conclusion could well lead analysts to demur,"" Morell said.

A Democratic House Intelligence Committee official who requested anonymity to discuss ongoing, sensitive matters said the panel had engaged at multiple levels with multiple intelligence agencies and had ""heard a sense of anxiety"" and ""palpable unease.""

The official expressed concern that ""purposeful overreach"" by DOJ could undermine what have been shown to be sound conclusions, and that normal differences of opinion raised in the course of discussion that would go into crafting an analytical judgment could be exploited for political purposes.

In this case, the official said, in what could be a politically motivated effort to score-settle with former CIA Director John Brennan — has been sharply critical of President Trump — routine, healthy discussion could be cast as Brennan putting his thumb on the scale.

""There is no evidence that was the case. These assessments have withstood continued scrutiny for more than two years, and have only been buttressed by continued analysis and collection,"" the official said.

A spokesman for Mr. Brennan declined to comment. The CIA and NSA declined to comment. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The House Intelligence Committee's Democratic chairman, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, said at the National Press Club this week that he had met personally with Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, but the committee has otherwise had ""very little visibility"" into the scope and progress of the review. A Senate Intelligence Committee official also said that panel was in close communication with the intelligence community and similarly had not been offered details about the review beyond the contents of a letter the Department of Justice sent earlier this month.

In its letter, sent in response to an earlier inquiry from the House Judiciary Committee, DOJ indicated the review was ""broad in scope and multifaceted, and is intended to illuminate open questions regarding the activities of U.S. and foreign intelligence services as well as non-governmental organizations and individuals."" It did not explicitly mention a review of analytic processes or the ICA itself."
DHS to Move Biometric Data on Hundreds of Millions of People to Amazon Cloud,https://www.nextgov.com,['Jack Corrigan'],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2019/06/dhs-move-biometric-data-hundreds-millions-people-amazon-cloud/157837/,"The Homeland Security Department is looking to upgrade the software it uses to analyze biometric data on hundreds of millions of people around the globe, and it plans to store that information in Amazon’s cloud.

The agency’s Office of Biometric Identity Management will replace its legacy biometric analysis platform, called the Automated Biometric Identification System, or IDENT, with a new, more robust system hosted by Amazon Web Services, according to a request for information released Monday.

IDENT essentially serves as an enterprisewide clearinghouse for troves of biometric and biographic data collected by the Transportation Security Administration, Customs and Border Protection, Secret Service and other Homeland Security components. The system links fingerprint, iris and face data to biographic information, allowing officials to quickly identify suspected terrorists, immigration violators, criminals and anyone else included in their databases.

In total, IDENT contains information on more than 250 million people, a Homeland Security spokesperson told Nextgov.

According to the solicitation, Homeland Security is in the process of replacing IDENT with the Homeland Advanced Recognition Technology System, or HART. The new system will include the same biometric recognition features as its predecessor, and potentially additional tools that could identify individuals based on DNA, palm prints, scars, physical markings and tattoos.

Whereas IDENT stores records in government-run data centers, the Homeland Security solicitation states “HART will reside in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) FedRAMP certified GovCloud.” Further, “biometric matching capabilities for fingerprint, iris, and facial matching will be integrated with HART in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud.” Amazon Web Services will also store HART’s biometric image data.

Amazon Web Services’ GovCloud US-East and US-West regions are data centers specifically built by the company to house some of the government’s most restricted information. AWS is no stranger to hosting sensitive government data, having already claimed the CIA, Defense Department, NASA and other federal agencies as customers in part because of perceived security improvements over government legacy systems.

When reached for comment, an AWS spokesperson referred inquiries to DHS.

In 2018, Northrop Grumman won a $95 million contract to develop the first two stages of the HART system, and its contract is set to expire in 2021. The department plans to use responses to the latest solicitation to inform its strategy for further developing the platform, the DHS spokesperson said.

Specifically, officials are asking vendors for ideas on how to build those multiple identification functions into the new system, while leaving room to add any new recognition “modalities” as they arise. Officials also want input on developing a handful of general reporting, analytics and search tools, as well as desktop and mobile web portals where Homeland Security employees can access the system.

Interested vendors must respond to the request by July 17.

In addition to the hundreds of millions of records stored locally in its IDENT system, Homeland Security can also access swaths of biometric information housed at other agencies.

According to the solicitation, the agency shares biometric data and technology with the Defense Department and the FBI, which can access some 640 million photos for its own facial recognition operations. Officials also said they can tap into the State Department’s Consular Consolidated Database—which contained nearly 500 million passport, visa and expat records as of 2016—as well as the databases of “several foreign governments as well as state, local, tribal and territorial law enforcement agencies.”

The government’s use of biometric technology, particularly facial recognition, has come under sharp scrutiny in recent months. Members of the House Oversight Committee have expressed broad bipartisan support for reining in the use of biometrics at agencies like the FBI, and on Monday, a group of lawmakers raised concerns about CBP’s expanding facial recognition program.

Former EPA staffer says Wheeler lied to Congress,https://thehill.com,[],06-20-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/449626-former-epa-staffer-says-wheeler-lied-congress,"A longtime former Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) staffer is accusing Administrator Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerOvernight Energy: Trump proposal would nix agency reviews of long-term climate impacts | Greens rip decision | House votes to block offshore drilling for one year Overnight Energy: Fight over fuel standards intensifies | Democrats grill Trump officials over rule rollback | California official blasts EPA chief over broken talks | Former EPA official says Wheeler lied to Congress Former EPA staffer says Wheeler lied to Congress MORE of lying in a letter he wrote to Congress Thursday that denied agency staff were shut out as EPA developed a controversial rollback on Obama-era fuel standards.

Critics of the rollback have long contended that the EPA sidelined its Office of Transportation and Air Quality when developing the rule. The office is home to the agency’s in-house lab for testing vehicles emissions.

ADVERTISEMENT

Wheeler denied that accusation this week, but Jeff Alson, a former senior policy advisor to that office, said Wheeler is not telling the truth.

“I know that is a lie because I was there. I was one of 20 people at EPA working on this for a decade,” Alson told The Hill. Alson retired in April of last year after working 40 years at the agency.

The issue of sidelined staffers came to a head as lawmakers probed the stalled negotiations between EPA and California, which has long had more stringent standards for vehicle fuel economy and is fighting the EPA rollback.

As lawmakers grilled EPA officials over the failed negotiation, the EPA delivered a letter from Wheeler that blamed California for the standstill.

It also accused the state’s negotiator, California Air Resources Board Chair Mary Nichols, of incorrectly saying the Office of Transportation and Air Quality were shut out of the rulemaking process.

""Her testimony that EPA professional staff were cut out of this proposal's development is false,"" Wheeler wrote.

Alson said the administration has denied pushing aside career staff before, but he found this instance particularly grievous.

“To see it in a formal letter that was given to Congress and to specifically accuse someone else of lying when in reality that person was being truthful and when Administrator Wheeler was the one doing the lying, it just put me beyond the point of no return,” he said.

The EPA said Wheeler's letter speaks for itself.

""Career, professional staff within the Office of Air and Radiation were involved in the development of the proposal and continue to be involved in the final stages as we work with NHTSA to finalize this rule,"" a spokesperson said in an email to The Hill.

A key pillar of former President Obama's environmental legacy involved strengthening fuel emissions standards for cars to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2026. But Trump's rollback would freeze the average fuel economy at 37 mpg.

Alson said his office did have two or three “check the box” meetings with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the other agency involved in drafting the rollback, but he said the agency did not collaborate with his EPA office in developing the standards and would not share any of their information with the EPA.

“NHTSA would say nothing about what they were assuming. They wouldn’t give us a copy of their models, they wouldn’t share their assumptions, they wouldn’t share their projections of how much the standards were going to cost,” he said. “They wouldn’t give us anything.”

When Bill Wehrum, EPA’s head of the Office of Air and Radiation, appeared before the House Energy and Commerce Committee Thursday, several Democrats questioned him about the role of the Office of Transportation and Air Quality.

Rep. Paul Tonko Paul David TonkoOvernight Energy: Fight over fuel standards intensifies | Democrats grill Trump officials over rule rollback | California official blasts EPA chief over broken talks | Former EPA official says Wheeler lied to Congress Former EPA staffer says Wheeler lied to Congress Democrats grill Trump officials over fuel standard rollback MORE (D-N.Y.) pointed a Government Accountability Office report that said, “NHTSA cannot be expected to have the same level of in-house expertise related to vehicle power train design and environmental issues as EPA.”

When Tonko pressed Wehrum on the Office of Air and Radiation’s involvement, Wehrum said their work with NHTSA was a “very powerful combination.”

“EPA has had a substantial amount of involvement,” Wehrum said.

Alson said retirement has freed him to talk in ways his colleagues who still work at the EPA cannot. He has been vocal in his opposition to the rollbacks, including penning an op-ed in The Hill, but said he has held back from addressing inaccuracies from administrator's until now.

“The truth is Mary Nichols is telling the truth and Administrator Wheeler is lying, and it’s shameful and it breaks my heart that the man that heads up the agency where I worked for 40 years and spent my life trying to make the world a little bit better can blatantly lie to the American public.”"
The U.S. State Department Has 'Not Seen an Uptick' of Deaths in the Dominican Republic,https://people.com,['Steve Helling'],,,,https://people.com/crime/state-department-no-updick-deaths-dominican-republic/,"By now, the news is everywhere.

In the past year, according to the U.S. State Department, at least eight American tourists have died after falling ill in Dominican Republic resorts — and dozens more have gotten sick. The incidents have garnered widespread media coverage, causing many Americans to rethink their travel plans.

But despite the rash of illnesses, the U.S. State Department has not issued an elevated travel advisory for the island nation — and the agency says in a statement that they “have not seen an uptick” in deaths despite the media coverage.

“We are closely monitoring ongoing investigations by Dominican authorities into several recent deaths of U.S. citizens in the Dominican Republic,” the statement says. “We have no higher priority than the safety and welfare of U.S. citizens abroad.”

“Millions of Americans travel to the Dominican Republic every year,” the statement continues. “Speaking generally, we have not seen an uptick in the number of US citizen deaths reported to the Department. While the overwhelming majority travel without incident, we want to assure all Americans that we continue to work actively with the Dominican authorities at the very highest levels to ensure that U.S. citizens are safe and feel safe while in the Dominican Republic.”

In April 2019, the department rated the Dominican Republic a level 2 for safety on a scale where 1 is the safest and 4 is the most dangerous. The rating means visitors should “exercise increased caution due to crime.” In the weeks of intense media scrutiny following the deaths of Americans, there has been no change to the rating.

The FBI has agents in on the island and are investigating the deaths of at least six of the tourists who have died since the summer of 2018. Some of them passed away in what appear to be bizarre — and similar — circumstances. The agencies are not yet releasing further details about the investigations.

Robin Bernstein, the ambassador of the United States to the Dominican Republic, told Univision these high-profile incidents should not be considered anything more than isolated cases. “We have 2.7 million Americans who come to the country and the statistics is that this is a very … unique event,” Bernstein said in a statement. “They come to visit the beautiful beaches and enjoy the great culture. Unfortunately sometimes those things happen to people.”

DOJ investigating Jared Kushner transactions in Deutsche Bank money-laundering probe,https://www.salon.com,[],06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.salon.com/2019/06/20/doj-investigating-jared-kushner-transactions-in-deutsche-bank-money-laundering-probe/,"The Department of Justice has opened a criminal investigation into potential money laundering by Deutsche Bank, including transactions linked to White House adviser and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner.

The investigation apparently centers on why Deutsche Bank officials failed to alert the Treasury Department about potentially suspicious transactions by Kushner’s family and company in 2016, including transactions involving Russian individuals, the New York Times reports.

Reportedly, bank officials did not submit the reports to Treasury, even though its employees prepared ""suspicious activity"" reports on the Kushner transactions and others. A spokesperson for Kushner Cos., the family's real estate corporation, told the Times that the firm is not under investigation.

The DOJ has already contacted Tammy McFadden, a former anti-money-laundering compliance officer at the bank who told the Times in May that she flagged transactions involving Kushner’s company but that her superiors had declined to file the suspicious activity reports with the federal government.

Some of McFadden’s colleagues had similar experiences in 2017 when they flagged transactions by entities owned by President Trump. It is unclear whether the FBI is investigating the bank’s handling of those transactions, according to the Times' report.

Congressional Democrats have already received some files from Deutsche Bank as they probe the bank’s dealings with Trump. Deutsche Bank was the only mainstream financial institution willing to lend Trump money after a series of high-profile bankruptcies and defaults in the 1990s. The bank lent him more than $2 billion over the last two decades, including $350 million that Trump still owes, the Times reported.

Two House committees have subpoenaed Deutsche Bank for records related to Trump but the president sued to block the bank from turning the files over. A federal judge rejected Trump’s request to block the subpoena and the president's lawyers are currently appealing that ruling.

Deutsche Bank has been under a DOJ investigation since 2015, according to the Times, when agents probed the bank’s role in laundering money for wealthy Russians. The bank was hit with steep fines in both the U.S. and the United Kingdom, but has not faced any criminal charges. The DOJ expanded its investigation last fall.

McFadden told the Times last month that she was fired by Deutsche Bank last year after raising concerns over the bank’s practices and has since filed complaints with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators.

On Wednesday, the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) also called on the Federal Reserve System to investigate whether Deutsche Bank had violated the law by refusing to submit the suspicious activity reports on the Kushner and Trump transactions.

“Deutsche Bank’s careless attitude towards banking compliance laws and failure to police its accounts may now be impacting American government at the highest levels,” said CREW executive director Noah Bookbinder. “Questions about transactions between President Trump and foreign actors whose conduct seemingly warranted suspicious activity reports, potentially facilitated by Deutsche Bank, harms the public legitimacy of the institution of the presidency itself.”"
Trump tells Fox News DOJ looking into whether his phone calls were monitored,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'President Trump', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-hannity-campaign-launch-justice-department-phone-calls-monitored,"One day after formally launching his 2020 presidential bid, President Trump told Fox News' ""Hannity"" exclusively on Wednesday that investigators are working to determine whether his personal phone calls were secretly monitored by U.S. intelligence agencies during the 2016 campaign -- a possibility he called ""the ultimate.""

Trump also hammered House Democrats for putting his former top communication advisor Hope Hicks ""through hell,"" after pictures of Hicks testifying before a closed-door session on Capitol Hill earlier in the day leaked on social media.

Hicks is the Executive Vice President and Chief Communications Officer for Fox Corporation, and Fox News is a subsidiary of Fox Corporation.

""What's happened to the Democrats -- and in the meantime, they're not doing any work in Congress,"" Trump told Sean Hannity, calling the party ""unhinged.""

""They're not allowed to do that. It's probably illegal,"" Trump said, referring to the leaked pictures of Hicks. Some Democrats complained that Hicks, in her appearance before the House Judiciary Committee, was ordered by the White House to stay quiet about her time as an aide to Trump, citing legal privileges.

But, Trump condemned Democrats' ongoing hearings on collusion and obstruction as an attempt at a ""do-over"" of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.

""Take a look at Ukraine,"" Trump said. ""How come the FBI didn't take the server from the DNC? Just think about that one, Sean."" That was a reference to the DNC's decision in 2016 to turn over its server to the private security firm Crowdstrike, rather than the FBI, after what prosecutors said was a Russian-led hack.

The Hill's John Solomon reported earlier Wednesday that the FBI, in search warrant affidavits, relied heavily on leaked Ukrainian financial documents concerning former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort -- even though the bureau was repeatedly warned that the documents were untrustworthy and likely fake.

Earlier this year, Ukraine Prosecutor General Yurii Lutsenko opened a probe into the so-called ""black ledger"" files that led to Manafort's abrupt departure from the Trump campaign. The investigation commenced after an unearthed audio recording showed that a senior Ukrainian anticorruption official apparently admitted to leaking Manafort's financial information in 2016 -- including his ties to pro-Russian actors in Ukraine -- to benefit Clinton.

CLINTON-UKRAINE ALLEGATIONS 'BIG,' TRUMP SAYS

A Ukrainian court recently ruled that the Manafort leak amounted to illegal interference in the U.S. election. A 2017 investigation by Politico found that Ukrainian officials not only publicly sought to undermine Trump by questioning his fitness for office, but also worked behind the scenes to secure a Clinton victory.

""I don't hear Russia much anymore. You know, they've given up on that one."" — President Trump

Trump told Hannity the episode was hardly surprising, given that the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee (DNC), through the firm Fusion GPS, funded British ex-spy Christopher Steele's creation of an unverified and largely discredited dossier. The FBI went on to cite the dossier in secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court applications to surveil former Trump aide Carter Page.

""I think it's a disgrace,"" Trump said.

Numerous issues with the Steele dossier's reliability have surfaced, including several that were brought to the FBI's attention before it cited the dossier in its FISA application and subsequent renewals. Mueller's report made plain, for example, that former Trump attorney Michael Cohen did not travel to Prague to conspire with Russian hackers seeking to access Democrat files, as the dossier alleged.

Mueller also was unable to substantiate the dossier's claims that Page had received a large payment relating to the sale of a share of Rosneft, a Russian oil giant.

""The fact is, they were spying on my campaign, using intelligence agencies to do it. ... We're trying to figure out whether they listened to my calls. That would be the ultimate. We'll see what happens. If that happens, we'll probably find out. If they spied on my campaign and they may have, it will be one of the great revelations in history of this country. It will be very interesting. I think we're gonna find out.""

Trump said Attorney General Bill Barr is working ""very hard"" to get to the bottom the matter.

DOJ INVESTIGATING NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AS PART OF ONGOING REVIEW OF FBI MISCONDUCT

The lengthy phone conversation began with Trump recounting the Tuesday night launch of his campaign in the jam-packed Amway Center in Orlando. Thousands of Trump supporters arrived more than 40 hours in advance to secure a spot, despite sweltering Florida heat. Some had been camped in chairs for several nights.

""It was an incredible scene -- and outside there were thousands of people,"" Trump told Hannity, comparing the atmosphere to that of a national college football championship. ""It was just an electric evening. ... It's a tailgate party for our country.""

Trump noted that the U.S. has become ""number one in the world in energy,"" referring to the fact that the U.S. is the world's leading crude oil producer. The head of the International Energy Agency said in 2018 that, because of the ""shale revolution,"" the U.S. ""is becoming the undisputed leader of oil and gas production worldwide.”

The positive economic indicators, Trump said, have led Democrats to desperately pivot to discussing obstruction, now that Mueller's report found no evidence of Russian collusion by the Trump campaign, despite multiple efforts by Russian-linked actors to involve the Trump team in its hacking efforts.

""I don't hear Russia much anymore. You know, they've given up on that one,"" Trump said, before touting his administration's economic successes. ""We have the best, lowest unemployment rate for blacks, Asians, Hispanics -- nobody's ever seen numbers like this... If the other side had won, we'd have gone into a depression.

""We have more poeple working today -- almost 160 million people -- than have ever worked in the history of our country,"" Trump added. ""Think of it -- it's a great number.""

Trump also denied a Wall Street Journal report that he will live-tweet the upcoming Democrat primary debates, but suggested it might not be a bad idea.

""Instead of fake news, I'll make them correct news -- and maybe that's OK,"" Trump joked.

""When I make a speech, like last night -- there was a fantastic woman in the front with a sign, 'Please keep tweeting, it matters,'"" Trump continued. ""And, I think it does matter. I don't do it because I enjoy it. When somebody says an outright lie on MSNBC or CNN ... I can counteract those lies, and I have many more followers than they do."""
"A worthless degree? Betsy DeVos wants to change rules for which colleges stay open, close",https://www.usatoday.com,"['Chris Quintana', 'Published A.M. Et June']",06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2019/06/21/college-closing-accreditation-betsy-devos-u-s-department-education/1505318001/,"CLOSE Trump's education secretary's plans for reforming U.S. education revolve around charter schools and vouchers.

Going to Brightwood College in the 2018 fall semester was supposed to be a safe bet. So thousands of students enrolled across the country.

For those students and others, a degree is supposed to be a lifeline. They sink in time and money that could be spent in the workforce, all for the prospect of higher earnings and a more fulfilling career.

But Brightwood students’ investment didn’t pay off. What’s more, a regulatory group had signed off on the college’s programs — only to change its mind.

Accreditation, as it’s called, is meant to prevent predatory or shoddy schools from leading students astray. And the Accrediting Council of Independent Colleges and Schools had given its signal to students that Brightwood was a worthwhile investment.

Yet in December 2018, the agency revoked the accreditation of Education Corp. of America, which ran the Brightwood locations and other colleges across the country. The closures of dozens of institutions followed swiftly. Students had spent the time and money, but still had no degrees, and no clear path forward.

Don't be one of them: A college closed, leaving thousands without a degree. How to keep it from happening to you

Alexis Gurrola, a dental assisting student at Brightwood College, said she was told December 5 the college was closing. She said students and staff were told they would finish out the week, but that classes would not resume the following week. (Photo: Rachel Denny Clow/Caller-Times)

Many of them still struggle. In a Facebook group for students of the closed college, some commiserate over what they call worthless degrees. Others try to give advice about how to get their student loan discharged or receive their transcripts.

What’s more, the Accrediting Council of Independent Colleges and Schools had a checkered history itself. President Barack Obama's administration had moved to strip it of its powers to OK school programs, but following a legal battle, President Donald Trump's administration undid that move.

The Education Corp. of America colleges were just some of the institutions that suddenly closed in recent years. ITT Tech closed in 2016. Corinthian Colleges did the same in 2015. Both had been accredited by ACICS. The accrediting group said it gave multiple warnings, but the colleges weren't able to meet its standards.

What happened?: The trouble at for-profit colleges, in 5 graphs

Now, the Education Department is looking to change the arcane and bureaucratic process of accreditation.

Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and accreditors of universities say new rules will ultimately allow colleges to offer programs more quickly and effectively. That means students landing a job in fields that are hiring, they say.

“With these reforms, our nation’s colleges and universities can spend more time and effort on serving students and less time, energy, and money focused on bureaucratic compliance,” DeVos said in a statement.

Critics of the newly proposed rules say they would make it easier for shady colleges to operate for longer and with less federal oversight.

Many colleges are already doing a poor job of preparing students, said Clare McCann, of the think tank New America. Giving them more latitude under the guise of innovation may lead to students taking chances on junk programs, she argued.

“What these regulations really do is make it so it is much harder to hold those schools accountable,” McCann said.

If anything, the government should hold these agencies to a higher standard, she said.

The public has until July 12 to give feedback on the proposed changes. Here’s what you should know.

Did your college close? Why Brightwood College, Virginia College closed — and what students should do

What is accreditation?

To receive federal money, universities must meet the quality standards of an accrediting organization. According to the Education Department, these agencies ensure schools have “qualified instructors, an adequate curriculum, and necessary support services” for students. Translated, they’re meant to prevent students from ending up with worthless degrees.

Accreditation can essentially be seen as a seal of quality for students, the government and even future employers. And students atunaccredited colleges can’t access federal money in the form of student loans.

The government doesn’t directly accredit schools, but the Department of Education does decide who is and isn’t fit to be an accreditor. The new rules were agreed upon by department officials, accreditors, college leaders and students during several negotiation sessions.

What’s the Education Department trying to do?

Among the changes, the proposed rules would allow colleges to offer new programs with less scrutiny from accreditors. The idea is that colleges could see a hole in the workforce and quickly come up with a new degree or credential to fill it. Accrediting agencies and for-profit colleges like this proposed change.

Under the current rules, it may take months to make changes to a program’s curriculum, said Judith Eaton, president of the Council for Higher Education Accreditation. The group is made up of 3,000 colleges, and it focuses on accreditation issues. The new rules, she argued, would mean a less onerous process for accreditors when dealing with the federal government. And, she said, the new rules may make it so that universities feel free to experiment with, for example, new credentialing programs or increased online courses.

If a college or accrediting group abused the new rules, the Education Department should crack down quickly, she said.

What about colleges that fail?

Theproposed ruleswould also allow schools that have failed to meet accreditation standards up to four years to fix their issues — double the previous amount of two years. The rationale? These changes sometimes take a long time, and allowing the university to fix a problem may lead to more students graduating.

Closing an underperforming college right away, in contrast, may leave those students without an education and nowhere to go to finish their degree.

This is a change welcomed by Nicholas Kent, a vice president at Career Education Colleges and Universities, a group of for-profit colleges.

Critics have said this measure may allow bad colleges to do more damage, but Kent called that description “disingenuous,” saying different programs will have different needs. A nine-month certificate program, he said, will need less time to fix a problem compared with a 6-year-doctoral program.

And he said accreditors are not required to give four years to everyone. Instead, they have the discretion to do so, and they can set up other check-ins.

But allowing a bad institution to operate longer may mean more students attend the failing institution, wasting time and money. And it could cost taxpayers more money because the school could continue to get federal grants and loans, Antoinette Flores, an associate director at the liberal Center for American Progress, has argued.

Plus, she said, the proposed rules could make it easier for outside entities to buy failing colleges. The Department of Education wants to limit a new owner's liability.

“In practice, that means we’re never going to see any of these institutions going away,” Flores said. “That increases the likelihood we’re recycling failed, toxic assets in the system, and we’re never really getting rid of the lowest performances.”

What happens next?

The period for public comment ends July 12, so if you have an opinion, file it on the Federal Register's website.

Chaos within the EPA exposes Americans to toxins like asbestos,https://thehill.com,[],06-21-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/449756-chaos-within-the-epa-exposes-americans-to-toxins-like-asbestos,"Three years ago, there was bipartisan euphoria when President Obama signed the Frank L. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (LCSA) into law. The updated Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) finally gave the EPA regulatory authority to protect Americans from dangerous toxic substances like asbestos, a known human carcinogen. During the pen signing ceremony, Obama said the much-needed legislation was a crucial step forward, remarking, ""The [old] system was so complex, it was so burdensome that our country hasn't even been able to uphold a ban on asbestos.""

The ongoing battle for chemical safety reform continues.

MORE, former Oklahoma attorney general, was confirmed as the EPA Administrator.

Met with confrontation, Pruitt’s regulatory rollbacks and ethics violations forced him to resign 12 months after his Senate confirmation. Pruitt wasn’t alone. Many who formerly worked at American Chemistry Council (ACC) now hold high-level EPA positions. Most notably, Nancy Beck, was selected to head the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention (OCSPP). Overseeing the toxic chemical unit, Beck carried out Trump’s seeming pro-industry agenda. The revolving doors continue as Beck now heads to the White House's National Economic Council.

The EPA attempted to ban asbestos in 1989, but was sued by Corrosion Proof Fittings, a company that used asbestos in their products. In 1991, an appeals court overturned the ban, resulting in a failure to ban the deadly chemical through TSCA.

Nearly 70 countries have already banned asbestos, but sadly, three years after Obama signed LCSA into law, U.S. asbestos imports, use, and deaths continue. Each year, nearly 40,000 Americans die from preventable asbestos-caused diseases such as lung cancer, mesothelioma, cancer of the larynx and ovary and asbestosis (fibrosis of the lungs). For each life lost, a shattered family is left behind.

For more than a century, asbestos has been confirmed to cause suffering and deaths. The EPA has failed to protect public health and the environment by banning asbestos. Without a ban, asbestos remains lethal and legal today and can be found in consumer products, cosmetics, automotive products, and building materials.

The chlor-alkali industry is the primary asbestos importer and user of raw asbestos for the manufacturing of industrial chlorine and caustic soda. Knowing that there is no safe or controlled use, it’s incredulous that asbestos imports actually surged last year. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the chlor-alkali industry imported 750 metric tons of raw asbestos from Brazil and Russia.

The late Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) fought hard for meaningful chemical reform, and TSCA is on track to fail, again. The EPA’s present asbestos evaluation excludes the risk of asbestos in millions of homes, schools, and offices. Furthermore, industry-friendly rules like the “significant new use” rule (SNUR) is just another attempt to negate asbestos risk.

Trump has long been fascinated with asbestos, and said once on Twitter, “If we didn't remove incredibly powerful fire retardant asbestos & replace it with junk that doesn't work, the World Trade Center would never have burned down.”

Last summer, ADAO discovered that Uralasbest, a Russian asbestos company, placed a seal with Trump’s face on their product with the note ""Approved by Donald Trump, 45th President of the United States.""

Ginnie Mae removes loanDepot's VA loan restrictions,https://www.housingwire.com,"['Ben Lane Is The Editor For Housingwire. In This Role', 'He Helps Set A Leading Pace For News Coverage Spanning The Issues Driving The U.S. Housing Economy', ""Helps Guide Housingwire'S Overall Direction. Previously"", 'He Worked For Townsquarebuzz', 'A Hyper-Local News Service. He Is A Graduate Of University Of North Texas.']",,,,https://www.housingwire.com/articles/49393-ginnie-mae-removes-loandepots-va-loan-restrictions,"After nearly six months of being restricted from participating in some of Ginnie Mae’s mortgage bond programs as part of the agency’s crackdown on lenders for Department of Veterans Affairs loan churning, loanDepot is back in the game.

Ginnie Mae announced Friday that it has removed the mortgage bond restrictions it placed on loanDepot earlier this year.

Back in January, Ginnie Mae limited loanDepot to Ginnie Mae II custom pools for VA single-family guaranteed loans after the agency found that loanDepot’s prepayment speeds on VA loans may have been out of sync with the rest of the industry.

The government’s investigation into VA loan churning began nearly two years ago when the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Ginnie Mae, and the VA began looking into whether certain lenders are aggressively targeting service members and military veterans for quick and potentially risky refinances of their mortgages.

The investigation led to some lenders being booted from Ginnie Mae’s primary mortgage securities platforms, and other lenders, like loanDepot, being restricted for questionable conduct.

Ginnie Mae, like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, is a mortgage bond issuer, but focuses specifically on securitizing pools of government-backed mortgages insured by the VA, the Federal Housing Administration, and other agencies, so issues related to refinancing VA loans would affect Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities.

But now, loanDepot has apparently addressed its practices and Ginnie Mae is satisfied that the lender has things under control.

Therefore, loanDepot is now allowed to participate in the Ginnie Mae I and Ginnie Mae II multi-issuer securities programs.

“The removal of such a restriction is based on the Issuer having demonstrated to Ginnie Mae’s satisfaction that (a) its prepayment speeds are substantially in-line with those of equivalent multi-Issuer cohorts, and (b) such improved performance is sustainable,” the agency said in a statement.

According to the agency, loanDepot is eligible to participate in all bond programs for loans effective for July 1, 2019, issuance.

""While we were disappointed with Ginnie’s original decision, we have partnered with Ginnie Mae in an open and transparent fashion to be able to return to full participation in multiple issuer pools,"" loanDepot Chief Capital Markets Officer Jeff DerGurahian said in a statement. ""However, most importantly, despite the restrictions, we have remained steadfast in our commitment to serve the Veteran community and have never wavered in proudly serving United States Veterans fairly and responsibly.""

"10-year Treasury yield drops as low as 1.97%, first time below 2% since November 2016",https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/19/us-treasury-yields-tick-higher-as-investors-await-federal-reserve-meeting.html,"A chart showing the U.S. 10-year treasury yield below 2% as of 11:49 p.m. ET Wednesday.

The policymaking committee of the Fed also dropped the word ""patient"" from its statement, a sign interpreted by some investors as a hint that the central bank hasn't abandoned the idea of a rate cut in 2019. The Fed tweaked its statement to acknowledge that inflation is ""running below"" its 2% objective.

Though the central bank maintained the target overnight lending rate , that decision was accompanied by a growing number of officials open to one rate cut by the end of 2019 with eight members in favor. However, the consensus still didn't expect a reduction until 2020 at the earliest.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell below 2% for the first time since November 2016 on Wednesday — breaching a key psychological level — after the Federal Reserve struck a more dovish tone in its June policy statement and Chair Jerome Powell said that the case for easier monetary policy had strengthened.

At around 11:58 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to price, declined below 2% to 1.9821% — around its lowest levels since November 2016. The yield on the 2-year slipped to 1.7209%, its lowest level since 2017. The 3-month Treasury bill yield ticked lower to 2.175%, as of 7:30 p.m. ET.

While stock investors and home buyers may initially cheer the drop in the benchmark for corporate bond and mortgage rates, the return to levels not seen in more than two years raises serious questions about the state of the economy.

Softer economic gauges like May's anemic jobs report — which showed that the U.S. economy added just 75,000 positions — and a lackluster consumer pricing print suggested to economists and fixed-income traders earlier this month that the central bank may have to assure markets of its willingness to step in if GDP growth decelerates.

Speaking to reporters after the central bank meeting, Powell said policymakers are worried about certain economic data and see an improving case for easier policy.

""Overall, our policy discussion focused on the appropriate response to the uncertain environment,"" he said. ""Many participants now see the case for somewhat more accommodative policy has strengthened,"" Powell said.

Traders are now pricing in a more than 80% chance of a rate cut in July and 70% probability of another reduction in September, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.

""It was largely what the market was looking for: I don't think they went too far as to spook the market in any way,"" said Tom Garretson, a fixed-income strategist at RBC. ""Seeing that eight [officials] are seeing a rate cut this year was dovish.""

""This is mostly an inflation story,"" he added. ""If you look at GDP forecast for 2020 they're up to 2% from 1.9% ... even if they were worried about tariffs, it didn't show up in their forecast.""

The Fed has in recent months been grappling with a consistent shortfall in inflation relative to its self-imposed 2% target. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, increased 1.6% in the year to April after gaining 1.5% in March.

Treasury inflation-protected securities — bonds whose payouts are indexed to consumer prices — show that price growth expectations have slid in recent months. Inflation is a threat to the value of a bond's fixed coupon and principal payments.

Wednesday's decision from the Federal Open Market Committee came after President Donald Trump's repeated criticism of the Fed and Jerome Powell specifically for raising rates and tightening monetary conditions over the last year. Trump, who sees recent Fed policy as damaging to American markets and undermining his bargaining position in trade talks, has broken with tradition in his frequent and vocal criticism of the central bank.

Asked Tuesday whether he wants to remove Powell as Fed Chair, Trump said ""Let's see what he does."" Trump's comments came after Bloomberg News reported Tuesday morning that the White House had looked into demoting Powell in February.

Paul Manafort leaves the federal courthouse in Washington in 2017. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)

Contributing columnist

Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s legal troubles didn’t end when he was convicted on bank and tax fraud charges in 2018. He’s facing state-level mortgage fraud charges, and because his case is going to trial in New York City, he needed to be transferred between penitentiaries. That is a routine matter and regularly results in the defendant’s transfer to a state penitentiary, here Rikers Island.

But in this case, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen intervened, forwarding to Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. a letter from Manafort’s attorney suggesting that it would not be safe for Manafort to be held on Rikers Island. The result? Manafort will be housed at a federal penitentiary rather than going to Rikers. Should we really care?

Yes we should. If the decision was motivated by politics — and it is very hard to formulate a plausible alternative explanation — it’s an injustice in itself and an indication of rotten goings-on at the Justice Department.

Consider first the magnitude of the favor that the department provided Manafort. Any prisoner would greatly prefer incarceration in either of the two institutions where Manafort will remain to Rikers’ Island, which is a notorious hellhole. (Why Rikers continues to operate at all in its current state is a subject for another column.) Manafort would surely be kept in isolation for his own protection in Rikers, but the difference in the overall conditions at these facilities is enormous.

Now consider how rare it is that Manafort’s request was granted and the role that Rosen, the No. 2 official at the Justice Department, played in facilitating it. It is not simply unusual but unprecedented. I have canvassed colleagues with combined decades of service at the Justice Department, and to a person they aver that they have never heard of a similar situation.

That is not because prisoners don’t ask. It is, in fact, routine to field requests for placement in certain institutions; I did so regularly as a U.S. attorney. The standard-issue response is to let the defendant know that, by law, the decision was for the Federal Bureau of Prisons to make, and that at most, a Justice Department representative could transmit a recommendation.

Finally, consider the reasoning: A spokesman for the Justice Department said the decision was justified by Manafort’s “unique health and safety needs.”

This is bunk of the first order. No doubt Manafort is ill, and no doubt he requires special protection. But are his circumstances unique? Absolutely not. Manafort’s situation is not meaningfully different from dozens of others who are routinely, in fact invariably, resolved many levels below the deputy attorney general and in favor of state incarceration pending state trial.

So we have a one-of-a-kind decision, made at an unprecedented level and justified by fanciful reasoning. Some special factor was obviously at play. It is entirely possible that there were political implications in doing a good deed for Manafort.

It’s not hard to see what those implications might be. Manafort has been the closest thing to a stand-up wise guy in the Trump drama: He managed through squirrelly doublespeak to avoid giving special counsel Robert S. Mueller III the full book on President Trump, and he paid for it in added prison time.

In return, Manafort’s transfer makes it look as though Trump, or Attorney General William P. Barr channeling Trump, is showing him some love with a special favor nobody else ever gets. That’s good for Manafort in the immediate run, and at the same time, it would communicate even more strongly that the way to a pardon is continued noncooperation with federal authorities.

This is all very bad news coming from the Justice Department.

For starters, though we hardly remember this principle because it has been so thoroughly trammeled in the Trump years, it would be a serious breach of protocol if anyone at the White House even communicated with the Justice Department to urge special treatment for Manafort. Any such overture should have been immediately rebuffed.

If that didn’t happen, it would almost be worse because it would mean that the department acted out of subservience to the president’s political goals on its own motion. It is the antithesis of doing justice without fear or favor — rewarding a political ally of the president because he resisted pressure from the Justice Department.

The overall turning of tables could not be more dramatic. Manafort did his best to wriggle out from under the lawful Justice Department investigation of him and the president. Now that same department is acting as his friend, as well as the president’s friend; and friends look out for one another.

That suggests a final lesson from Manafort’s relatively sweet accommodations: Rosen, who was Barr’s handpicked choice, likely comes to the department with a staff that is already integrated with Barr’s. That happens in the case of particularly strong attorneys general. Barr is that, by virtue of his own force of character and his preeminent standing in the Trump universe. As long as Trump is president, Barr enjoys total dominion at the Justice Department. The department’s special treatment of Manafort illustrates why that state of affairs is so worrisome.

Former Mueller counsel Michael Dreeben leaving top DOJ post,https://www.politico.com,['Darren Samuelsohn'],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/19/former-mueller-counsel-michael-dreeben-leaving-top-doj-post-1371101,"Michael Dreeben helped beat back a challenge to the special counsel’s use of subpoenas to pry information from reluctant witnesses. | Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images legal Former Mueller counsel Michael Dreeben leaving top DOJ post Dreeben successfully fought off legal challenges to the special counsel's appointment in federal court.

Michael Dreeben, a longtime Justice Department lawyer who had a central role on special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe, is leaving the government in the coming weeks, a DOJ spokeswoman confirmed Wednesday.

The 30-year DOJ veteran had been on a sabbatical from his role as deputy solicitor general to work on the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. There, he successfully fought off legal challenges to Mueller’s appointment in federal court. He also helped beat back a challenge to the special counsel’s use of subpoenas to pry information from reluctant witnesses.

Story Continued Below

DOJ spokeswoman Kerri Kupec confirmed Dreeben’s upcoming departure from the government, making him the latest member of Mueller’s team to move on from government work since the Russia probe was wrapped up earlier this spring.

Mueller’s last day on the government payroll came May 29, the same day he broke a nearly two-year public silence about his work. The special counsel’s office then formally closed.

So far, only a handful of former Mueller staffers have surfaced in new roles since finishing their Russia probe duties. Andrew Weissmann, one of the senior prosecutors on the special counsel’s team, returned to New York University’s law school as a senior fellow in May. Another top lawyer, Greg Andres, also landed back at his old job as a partner at the New York office of Davis Polk.

Dreeben declined comment when asked about his plans after he leaves the government. In the solicitor general’s office, Dreeben represented the United States more than 100 times before the Supreme Court, an accomplishment that Chief Justice John Roberts noted in May 2016 made him the “second person to reach that rare milestone this century.”

In a statement Wednesday, Solicitor General Noel Francisco praised Dreeben's career.

“On behalf of the Office of the Solicitor General, I thank Michael for his many years of service to the Department,"" he said. ""We wish him the best of luck in the next chapter of his career."""
"PolyMet, the EPA, and the accusations against the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, explained",https://www.minnpost.com,"['Walker Orenstein', 'About The Author']",06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.minnpost.com/environment/2019/06/polymet-the-epa-and-the-accusations-against-the-minnesota-pollution-control-agency-explained/,"In the last year, the company PolyMet has made large strides toward building Minnesota’s first copper-nickel mine by securing the state and federal permits needed to move ahead on the $1 billion project.

But as PolyMet marches toward construction, a critical state water permit issued is facing new questions — and a federal investigation. A swirl of leaked emails and newly released documents have drawn accusations that the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency hid serious concerns from the public and that career staff at the Environmental Protection Agency were pressured by political leaders to go easy on PolyMet.

The MPCA has denied the allegations in a series of sworn statements from current and former staff. Yet environmental advocacy organizations are using the developments to bolster a legal challenge to the permit, which argues that PolyMet could dangerously pollute the St. Louis River watershed, which drains into Lake Superior.

If built, PolyMet would tap into reserves of copper, nickel and other precious metals like cobalt in an open-pit mine near Hoyt Lakes. The company, which is owned in part by Switzerland’s Glencore, says the mine would create 360 direct jobs and another 1,000 indirect ones. PolyMet contends that new technology, water treatment and tough regulations can prevent environmental disasters that have occurred at copper mines around the globe.

Here’s what you need to know about the allegations against the MPCA and what they could mean for the project going forward:

What are the accusations?

Last week, the EPA released a set of written comments that outlined major concerns with a draft of the MPCA permit, known as a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit (NPDES), that was issued to PolyMet in December 2018.

In part, federal regulators worried it would allow pollution, violate the Clean Water Act and hinder lawsuits against the mining company if problems do happen. While the permit requires PolyMet to treat water and has a form of water quality limits, the EPA wrote those regulations weren’t enforceable by the federal government, the public and potentially by the MPCA.

On top of that, opponents of PolyMet argue that MPCA staff worked to ensure EPA comments were hidden from the public and court records. Paula Maccabee, counsel for WaterLegacy, an advocacy group suing to challenge PolyMet’s permit, says she learned the comments existed only after she requested records from the MPCA and through confidential sources in the federal government.

On April 5, the EPA read its comments over the phone to the MPCA staff, some of whom destroyed hand-written notes of the meeting. WaterLegacy obtained earlier notes from the MPCA that suggested EPA had concerns. Maccabee said she later learned through the EPA and sources about the official written comments.

Then, earlier this week, the union representing EPA employees in Minnesota released an email they say was obtained through an “anonymous leak.” The union contends the email shows former MPCA Assistant Commissioner Shannon Lotthammer pressuring EPA staff to suppress concerns by submitting them outside a public comment process.

In a May court statement, the MPCA said it “did not receive written comments from EPA, did not take efforts to keep EPA’s written comments out of the administrative record, or fail to disclose the existence of EPA comments.” The union argued this was a lie.

The EPA’s Office of the Inspector General launched an “audit” of the situation on June 12, says an announcement.

The MPCA maintains there is no scandal to the EPA’s comments and no cover up to suppress them. In filings to the Court of Appeals, the state agency says WaterLegacy is attacking “one aspect” of a lengthy collaborative process between the MPCA and the EPA.

The MPCA says virtually all of the EPA concerns were raised by others during the public-comment period for the permits, and that it has responded to all those concerns.

Richard Clark, supervisor of the MPCA’s metallic mining sector unit, said in a court declaration that the EPA had raised identical questions “throughout the permit-development process.” Those worries were recorded in other notes and submitted as part of the administrative record of the approval process, Clark said.

In other words, state regulators contend the April phone call with the EPA had no new information. As for the missing notes, Clark said the EPA “read their comments very quickly, and the concerns were all ones that we had heard before.” One staffer stopped taking notes throughout the call and said they weren’t helpful. Another said notes he took were discarded after he incorporated them into legal work exempt from disclosure.

Darin Broton, an MPCA spokesman, said his agency adjusted the permit in many cases but said there were other instances in which they disagreed with EPA concerns.

In the end, the EPA did not object or veto the final permit, Broton said. In a statement to the court, Jeffry Fowley, a former longtime EPA staffer who specialized in Clean Water Act regulations and worked part time for the Environmental Integrity Project in 2018, has argued many problems EPA had were not resolved. That includes the discharge limits.

Maccabee and Aaron Klemz, a spokesman for the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy, said the Trump administration’s business-friendly approach might be to blame. The MCEA is also suing over the water permit.

But Broton said he could assure the public PolyMet did not get let off easy.

“There are really high stringent water quality standards incorporated into PolyMet’s permit at the end of the day,” Broton said. “That’s part of the back and forth we had with the EPA is to make sure that there was tough enforceable language in the permit to make sure that the company is doing what it says it’s going to do. And if not we have a way to actually hold them accountable.”

So why did the MPCA ask the feds to wait until after the public comment process?

In a court filing, Lotthammer, the former MPCA assistant commissioner, said her agency was already planning to make changes to its draft permit after the public-comment period.

“Rather than have EPA send us written comments on the version of the permit that we knew we were going to change, we believed that it would be more efficient — both for us and for EPA — if EPA waited to give us any written comments based on the next draft, in which we had the opportunity to address concerns shared by the public,” Lotthammer said in her statement. Lotthammer is now at the DNR.

MPCA staff said the EPA decides itself whether to submit written comments at any point in the permitting process.

Why is this important?

The MPCA has not promised to reevaluate its PolyMet permit in any way. But the developments could help bolster the legal argument of WaterLegacy and MCEA that the water quality permit is inadequate.

Copper-nickel mining comes with risks that iron ore mining does not, which has made PolyMet controversial. The extraction process can create an acidic runoff and leach heavy metals into water. On its website, PolyMet says they will be “monitoring, collecting, controlling, recycling and eventually treating on-site water to meet water quality standards before it is discharged back into the environment.”

Environmental groups have had some success challenging controversial projects in court.

Recently, the Court of Appeals ruled an environmental review of a proposed oil pipeline known as Line 3 didn’t consider an oil spill in Lake Superior’s watershed. The MPCA and Department of Natural Resources said they wouldn’t take final action on pending permits for the Enbridge pipeline until the Public Utilities Commission addressed the court’s concern with the Environmental Impact Statement.

Klemz noted EPA comments have forced revisions from state regulators in the past and should be widely known.

Maccabee said the recent PolyMet revelations undermine the credibility of the MPCA and its permit, which could affect the court case. “Minnesotans tend to believe that we can trust our regulators, that they’re operating openly and fairly — and if they say a permit is good, we should trust them,” she said. “The way the permit was handled in this case benefits one party: And that’s PolyMet.”

So what happens now?

Water Legacy has asked the appeals court to send its lawsuit back to district court for more fact-finding about the EPA’s comments. If granted, that process could be lengthy, said Klemz, who compared it to a trial. He speculated it could bring testimony from former MPCA chief John Linc Stine and others.

The court has not asked PolyMet to suspend its work toward building the mine, however. PolyMet says it is preparing the construction site, which includes renovations on a former LTV Steel taconite plant.

The MPCA has also promised to work on being more transparent in the future.

In a written statement, commissioner Laura Bishop said she was starting “an agency-wide assessment” to “improve accessibility” for those following major permits.

“This will include an openness for oral written comments from any person or organization during our permitting and rule-making processes as well as other times that stakeholders wish to engage with our agency,” Bishop said. “The MPCA will also improve documentation of, and public access to, communications that form the record of agency actions.”"
U.S. has no plans to cap H-1B work visa program: State Department,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-india-visas/us-has-no-plans-to-cap-h-1b-work-visa-program-state-department-idUSKCN1TL2VL,"FILE PHOTO: A man holds flags of India and the U.S. while people take part in the 35th India Day Parade in New York, U.S. August 16, 2015.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration has no plans to cap H-1B work visas for nations that force foreign companies to store data locally, the State Department said on Thursday.

Reuters reported on Wednesday that the United States had told India it was considering restricting the H-1B visa programs for countries with the data storage requirement. The H-1B program issues U.S. visas to skilled foreign workers.

“The Trump Administration has no plans to place caps on H-1B work visas for nations that force foreign companies to store data locally,” a State Department spokeswoman said in a statement in response to the Reuters article.

While an administration’s “Buy American Hire American” executive order calls for a broad review of U.S. worker visa programs, including the H-1B program, it was not targeted at a specific country, the spokeswoman said.

It is “completely separate from our ongoing discussions with India about the importance of ensuring the free flow of data across borders,” the spokeswoman added.

Earlier on Thursday, India said it was in talks with the United States on H-1B visas, but foreign ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar told a news conference: “We have not heard anything officially from the U.S. government” on capping such permits for Indians.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is scheduled to visit New Delhi next week for talks that will include areas of disagreement between the two countries over trade.

Two senior Indian officials told Reuters on Wednesday they had been briefed last week on a U.S. plan to cap the number of H-1B visas given annually to Indians at between 10% and 15% of the total number issued.

There is no country-specific limit on the 85,000 H-1B work visas the United States issues every year, and an estimated 70% of them go to Indians."
Paul Manafort Seemed Headed to Rikers. Then the Justice Department Intervened.,https://www.nytimes.com,"['William K. Rashbaum', 'Katie Benner']",06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/17/nyregion/manafort-rikers.html,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]

Paul J. Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman who is serving a federal prison sentence, had been expected to be transferred to the notorious Rikers Island jail complex this month to await trial on a separate state case.

But last week, Manhattan prosecutors were surprised to receive a letter from the second-highest law enforcement official in the country inquiring about Mr. Manafort’s case. The letter, from Jeffrey A. Rosen, Attorney General William P. Barr’s new top deputy, indicated that he was monitoring where Mr. Manafort would be held in New York.

And then, on Monday, federal prison officials weighed in, telling the Manhattan district attorney’s office that Mr. Manafort, 70, would not be going to Rikers.

Instead, he will await his trial at a federal lockup in Manhattan or at the Pennsylvania federal prison where he is serving a seven-and-a-half-year sentence for wide-ranging financial schemes, according to people with knowledge of the matter."
Walmart Pays $282 Million to Settle Federal Foreign Bribery Case,http://fortune.com,['Tom Schoenberg'],06-20-2019,2019,6,http://fortune.com/2019/06/20/walmart-pays-fine-doj-brazil-bribe-probe/,"Walmart Inc. has agreed to pay $282 million in penalties and a Brazilian unit admitted to violating a U.S. anti-bribery law, providing a relatively subdued ending to a seven-year investigation that spanned the globe and at one point looked poised to yield record foreign-corruption fines.

In parallel announcements on Thursday, the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission faulted the country’s largest retailer over payments made to fast-track store openings in Mexico, China, Brazil, and India. Walmart will pay about $138 million in criminal penalties and $144 million in disgorgement to resolve the SEC’s allegations.

WMT Brasilia pleaded guilty Thursday to failing to keep accurate records, while the U.S. parent reached a non-prosecution agreement with the Justice Department over violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The company will have a compliance monitor for two years as part of that accord and Walmart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said the company is “committed to doing business the right way.”

The retailer’s operations in Brazil are currently handled by a company called Walmart Brasil, which is 80% owned by private-equity firm Advent International.

The entity that pleaded guilty, WMT Brasilia, “was and always has been a holding company,”

according to a Walmart spokesperson. “Today it has ownership of the entity which owns 20% of the current business after we sold it last year.”

The resolution, disclosed in court filings in Virginia and press releases, was a muted end to what was once seen as a case targeting high-level officers. At one point, people familiar with the probe have said, U.S. authorities were asking up to $1 billion in penalties. While the penalty is about one-sixth of the $1.78 billion levied last year against Petroleo Brasileiro SA in one of South America’s biggest corruption scandals, Walmart wound up spending about $1 billion in legal fees and an overhaul of its compliance systems.

“The case may not have turned out to be as good or as fruitful as the government thought,” said Michael Koenig, a former federal prosecutor now a partner at Hinckley, Allen & Snyder. “This notion that the government is only successful if it gets a conviction or a billion-dollar settlement is just plain wrong. You have to go where the investigation leads and what may have started out as thinking this was going to be the greatest investigation since Enron for a host of reasons turned out not to be what the government thought.”

The expectation of what the Walmart investigation might reveal were set by a series of articles in the New York Times in 2012 outlining details of allegations the retailer paid some $24 million to Mexican officials to win quick zoning changes, sidestep licenses, and environmental permits and deflect opposition to open stores, turning Walmart into that country’s largest private-sector employer.

Allegations that America’s largest retailer was running a pay-to-play scheme outside the U.S. gave a boost to the Justice Department’s FCPA unit, which had suffered some high-profile court losses and was defending attempts by business interest groups to rein in its prosecutors.

But the Walmart case posed challenges for investigators. Much of the conduct uncovered in Mexico, for example, couldn’t be used as evidence because it was too old, people familiar with the matter have previously said. So the government sought to build stronger cases in other countries. In Brazil and India, investigators found more recent examples of what they believed were improper payments, yet struggled to find examples of rampant misconduct in China, the people said.

In the closing days of the Obama administration, Walmart balked at demands to pay more than $600 million in penalties, leading prosecutors to go back to gather more evidence from witnesses, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg at the time. That, in turn, led to a lengthy secret court battle over whether the Justice Department could bring Walmart’s internal lawyers before the grand jury. By this point, the investigation had already spanned more than five years.

In 2017, the company set aside almost $300 million for a possible settlement. Months later, a federal appeals court in Virginia blocked the Justice Department from interviewing Walmart’s lawyers, removing leverage the government had in the criminal case. The two sides became deadlocked for months over what misconduct the retail giant would admit to, a person familiar with the matter previously said.

On Thursday, the Brazilian unit admitted that $527,000 in improper payments to an intermediary were inaccurately recorded on financial records. Brazil employees logged those payments as going to construction companies when they knew the money was going to a former Brazilian government official, according to the plea agreement filed in Virginia. The former official’s ability to obtain licenses and permits quickly earned her the nickname “sorceress” or “genie,” according to the unit’s plea agreement. Walmart earned more than $3.6 million in profit from stores built by these construction companies.

The non-prosecution agreement with the U.S. outlines much broader conduct that prosecutors said ran from 2000 to 2011 and included Mexico, China, and India. Walmart executives were aware of problems regarding payments by the foreign subsidiaries to third parties but failed to stop them, according to the Justice Department.

“In numerous instances, senior Walmart employees knew of failures of its anti-corruption-related internal controls involving foreign subsidiaries, and yet Walmart failed for years to implement sufficient controls comporting with U.S. criminal laws,” assistant attorney General Brian Benczkowski said in a statement.

No criminal charges against individuals have been brought.

VA chief pressed on efforts to prevent veteran suicides,https://thehill.com,[],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/defense/449444-va-chief-pressed-on-efforts-to-prevent-veteran-suicides,"Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie Robert Leon WilkieOvernight Health Care: Court allows Trump abortion referral ban to take effect | GOP group launches M blitz against 'Medicare for All' | Star GOP lawyer raises constitutional concerns with surprise billing legislation VA chief pressed on efforts to prevent veteran suicides VA bans smoking, vaping at its hospitals MORE told lawmakers his agency is stepping up efforts to prevent veteran suicides during testimony before a Senate panel Wednesday.

Wilkie testified before a Senate Veterans Affairs Committee hearing, where he was pressed on efforts the Trump administration is taking to address what many have called a growing epidemic of suicide among former military servicemembers.

Wilkie said the issue called for a collaborative approach across government.

""Suicide is a national public health issue that affects communities everywhere. Just as there is no single cause of suicide, no single organization can end veteran suicide,"" Wilkie said in his remarks provided to the panel.

""We must work side-by-side with our partners at all levels of government and in the private sector to provide our veterans with the mental health and suicide prevention services they need.""

Wilkie highlighted the problem of firearm-related suicides, which he said accounted for 70 percent of veteran suicides. And he said officials would do more to prevent such deaths.

“The goal is to build time and space between the impulse to harm oneself and the act,” the secretary said.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) pressed Wilkie on that promise.

“The time and space between someone who overdoses on prescription drugs, you have hours,"" Blumenthal said. ""For someone who uses a gun, you have no time.”

Wilkie told the senator he was open to look at legislation that would take guns away from people if a judge deems those individuals a threat.

Wilkie said education was an important aspect as well, noting that more must be done to talk to servicemembers about mental health issues and to train those in the military from the start of basic training to recognize warning signs of mental illness and depression.

“Educating family members is absolutely key in things as simple as gun storage,” he added.

Lawmakers from both parties said officials must do more on suicide prevention.

Testifying alongside Wilkie was Dr. Keita Franklin, the executive director of the Suicide Prevention Program at the Veterans Health Administration.

Isakson asked Franklin about veteran suicide prevention hotlines. Franklin said the help offered over the hotlines had improved and veterans are now able to receive same-day support.

Wilkie added that the average wait time for callers is 8 seconds and there are no voicemail boxes."
"State Department identifies 23 violations, 'multiple security incidents' concerning Clinton emails",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hillary-clinton-emails-state-department-violations-security-incidents,"The State Department revealed Monday that it has identified ""multiple security incidents"" involving current or former employees' handling of Hillary Clinton's emails, and that 23 ""violations"" and seven ""infractions"" have been issued as part of the department's ongoing investigation.

The information came in a letter to Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, who is responsible for overseeing the security review.

""To this point, the Department has assessed culpability to 15 individuals, some of whom were culpable in multiple security incidents,"" Mary Elizabeth Taylor, the State Department's Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of Legislative Affairs, wrote to Grassley. ""DS has issued 23 violations and 7 infractions incidents. ... This number will likely change as the review progresses.""

ATTEMPT TO HACK CLINTON EMAILS STUNNED AIDES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, DOCS SHOW

President Trump highlighted the finding in a tweet overnight, questioning whether Democrats would investigate and saying, ""This is really big.""

The State Department, calling the matter ""serious,"" said it expected to conclude the investigation by Sept. 1. The department acknowledged that the probe was unusually time-consuming.

""Given the volume of emails provided to the Department from former Secretary Clinton's private email server, the Department's process has been necessarily more complicated and complex requiring a significant dedication of time and resources,"" Taylor wrote.

Taylor also noted that disciplinary consequences were pending.

""In every instance in which the Department found an individual to be culpable of a valid security violation or three or more infractions, the Department forwarded the outcome to the Bureau of Diplomatic Security's Office of Personnel Security and Suitability (DS/PSS), to be placed in the individuals' official security file,"" Taylor wrote. ""All valid security incidents are reviewed by DS and taken into account every time an individual's eligibility for access to classified information is considered.

""This referral occurred whether or not the individual was currently employed with the Department of State and such security files are kept indefinitely,"" Taylor added. ""Consistent with the referral policy, for individuals who were still employed with the Department at the time of adjudication, the Department referred all valid security violations or multiple infractions to the Bureau of Human Resources.""

The State Department declined to release the names of the employees, consistent with its procedures. The department promised another update once its review is completed.

NEWLY RELEASED EMAILS SHOW CLINTON TEAM DISCUSSING 'PRIVATE' COMMS CHANNEL WITH ISRAEL

Clinton's private email use has remained in the spotlight, as the DOJ looks into potential misconduct in the handling of federal authorities' surveillance and intelligence operations in 2016. Then-FBI Director James Comey said in 2016 that Clinton's handling of classified information was ""extremely careless"" -- remarks that were watered down from their original draft -- but that ""no reasonable prosecutor"" would bring charges.

It emerged earlier this year that then-FBI general counsel James Baker testified that he thought Clinton should have been prosecuted until he was convinced otherwise ""pretty late"" in the investigation.

And, last month, a trove of partially redacted FBI documents from the agency's investigation into whether Clinton mishandled classified information -- a probe known as the ""Midyear Exam"" -- revealed that top Clinton aides were shocked at apparent attempts to hack her private email servers.

The document release revealed numerous episodes in which the Clinton team either suspected it had been hacked or seemingly acknowledged that security measures had come up short.

""omg,"" top Clinton aide Huma Abedin wrote to Justin Cooper, the technology pro overseeing Clinton's private home-based email servers, when he told her shortly after midnight on Jan. 9, 2011, that ""someone was trying to hack us.""

And in March, it was revealed that the Justice Department ""negotiated"" an agreement with Clinton's legal team that ensured the FBI did not have access to emails on her private servers relating to the Clinton Foundation. Former FBI Agent Peter Strzok testified about the arrangement during a closed-door appearance before the House Judiciary Committee last summer, according to a transcript released this year.

""A significant filter team"" was employed at the FBI, Strzok said, to ""work through the various terms of the various consent agreements."" Limitations imposed on agents' searches included date ranges and names of domains and people, Strzok said, among other categories.

The agreement was reached, Strzok said, because ""according to the attorneys, we lacked probable cause to get a search warrant for those servers and projected that either it would take a very long time and/or it would be impossible to get to the point where we could obtain probable cause to get a warrant.""

Former Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who chaired the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee until 2017 and is now a Fox News contributor, said the arrangement signaled that agents wanted willful blindness.

""What's bizarre about this, is in any other situation, there's no possible way they would allow the potential perpetrator to self-select what the FBI gets to see,"" Chaffetz said, noting that the FBI was aware that the servers contained classified information in unclassified settings. ""The FBI should be the one to sort through those emails -- not the Clinton attorneys.""

The DOJ's goal, Chaffetz said, was to ""make sure they hear no evil, see no evil -- they had no interest in pursuing the truth."""
EXCLUSIVE: Justice Department concerned about conditions at South Fulton jail,https://www.ajc.com,[],,,,https://www.ajc.com/news/local/justice-department-concerned-about-conditions-south-fulton-jail/vv0W2rbvsgamQUX0rNxCSK/,"The U.S. Justice Department has weighed in on a lawsuit alleging deplorable conditions for mentally ill female inmates at a south Fulton County jail.

In a court filing on Thursday, U.S. Attorney BJay Pak and lawyers from the civil rights division in Washington alerted a federal judge in Atlanta to recent Justice Department positions concerning the constitutional requirements for housing prisoners with serious mental illness.

The motion — called a “statement of interest” — was filed in a case that demands improved conditions at the South Fulton Municipal Regional Jail in Union City. The suit, filed in April, said mentally ill women are being held in isolation under horrific conditions that increase their risk of serious psychological harm.

It was filed on behalf of two women, identified as M.J. and K.H., and the Georgia Advocacy Office, which protects the rights of people with disabilities.

The Justice Department’s filing alerted U.S. District Court Judge Billy Ray to the civil rights division’s lengthy investigation of the Hampton Roads Regional Jail in Portsmouth, Va. That probe, concluded in December, found the jail failed to provide adequate medical and mental health care to inmates and that prisoners were unconstitutionally held in restrictive conditions for prolonged periods of time.

Atlanta lawyer Joe Whitley, a former U.S. attorney here, called the Justice Department’s entry into the Atlanta case a potentially significant development.

“This is not something they ordinarily would do,” Whitley said. “Apparently they’ve seen things that caused them concern. The role of the civil rights division and the Department of Justice is often necessary to assure that people who are confined are treated in a manner consistent with the Constitution.”

Sarah Geraghty, a lawyer for the Southern Center for Human Rights, welcomed the Justice Department’s interest in the case.

“The fact that it chose to weigh in shows the gravity of the human rights violations at issue,” said Geraghty, who represents the female inmates. “The conditions being challenged in this case are strikingly similar to those found to violate federal law at the Hampton Roads jail.”

Some of the mentally ill women at the Union City jail have been found incompetent to stand trial for their alleged offenses. M.J., for example, was arrested in October for criminal trespass while proselytizing at The Mall West End. The 20-year-old woman has been unable to post $500 bond.

The lawsuit against the Union City jail included graphic photos of unsanitary jail cells and detailed grim conditions for the women detainees. The conditions “can result in dramatic worsening of symptoms, decompensation, psychosis, self-mutilation and suicide,” the suit said.

Some inmates at the South Fulton Municipal Regional Jail use their issued bedding to soak up water that floods the cell floors, according to a federal lawsuit filed in April by the Georgia Advocacy Office and two women being held there. Inmates who use their bedding to clean up flooding are left with no sheets or blankets to sleep on, the lawsuit says. This image is included in the federal lawsuit. Photo: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution

In recent court filings, Fulton County attorneys say plaintiffs M.J. and K.H. and other inmates “present unique security concerns as a result of their psychiatric disabilities.”

“(Their) disruptive, if not violent, behavior and their significant hygiene concerns dictate that their time outside their cells must be limited,” the county said. “The penological interests of safety and security for M.J. and K.H. and their fellow inmates, the staff and the general public who visit the jail dictate the amount of time inmates spend in their cells.”

The county has asked Ray to dismiss the lawsuit and to deny an injunction sought by the plaintiffs’ lawyers that says the women inmates should be allowed to spend four hours a day outside their cells, including one hour of outdoor time.

In a recent court filing, the plaintiffs’ lawyers included a sworn statement by their forensic psychiatry expert, Jeffrey Metzner, a professor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.

The south Fulton Jail’s so-called mental health pods are essentially solitary confinement units that warehouse the female detainees, he said. “Such warehousing, in conditions of confinement that include very little out-of-cell time, results in many of these detainees’ mental illnesses either deteriorating or not improving despite such illnesses being very treatable in an appropriate setting.”

E.P.A. Finalizes Its Plan to Replace Obama-Era Climate Rules,https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/climate/epa-coal-emissions.html,"The new rule, which is expected to come into effect within 30 days, assumes that the forces of the market will guide the country to a future of cleaner energy by naturally phasing out coal over time. It imposes only modest requirements on coal plants.

While it instructs states to reduce emissions, the new measure sets no targets. Instead, it lets states decide how much carbon reduction they consider reasonable and suggests ways to improve efficiency at individual power plants.

Jeffrey R. Holmstead, who served in the E.P.A. during both Bush administrations and now represents utility companies as a lawyer for the firm Bracewell, said he thought the current Supreme Court would be skeptical of any presidential effort to regulate carbon emissions under existing law.

“I t will establish what the E.P.A. can and can’t do,” Mr. Holmstead said of the new Trump rule. “I think it really will tie the hands of future administrations.”

Environmental groups say the Trump rule will slow the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions at a time when scientists warn that countries must rapidly decarbonize to avoid the most severe effects of climate change, including heat waves, extreme storms, droughts and floods.

Mr. Wheeler has said the Trump administration’s plan is legally sound, will not damage the economy and will still go a long way toward reducing carbon .

He maintained that, when the new measure is fully implemented, it will reduce carbon emissions in the power sector by 34 percent below 2005 levels, roughly equal to the goals of the Clean Power Plan."

The U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee voted Wednesday to approve his nomination, sending it next to the full U.S. Senate for final approval. The only committee nay vote came from Sen. Jacky Rosen, a Democrat from Nevada.

Edgar, 52, was nominated for the job by President Donald Trump.

Last year, Edgar was part of a contingent of elected officials from Southern California who were invited to the White House to discuss immigration. Since then, Edgar has been invited back to the White House. He’s also become a familiar face on Fox News, where he discussed his city’s vote to opt-out of a controversial California law that limits cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities.

Wednesday’s vote came with no discussion. At a hearing earlier this month Edgar testified that his background heading two companies in Orange County prepared him for the DHS job.

“I have spent over 30 years working for more than 40 Fortune 500 and Global 1000 companies as an executive and as an adviser across many industries, including aerospace/defense, government and technology,” Edgar told the committee.

Edgar has two companies: a management consultancy, Global Conductor Inc, which has some 40 employees, and Global Conductor Construction Corporation, a 35-employee construction business that specializes in installing underground technology for the telecommunications industry in Southern California. Edgar told the committee that his experience includes work in several areas of finance, accounting, budget management and regulatory compliance.

Edgar also suggested his beliefs about immigration are nuanced.

In a statement he read to the committee last week, Edgar spoke about his wife, Betty Sarkis, a teacher at La Quinta High School in Westminster. An Iranian immigrant whose family fled to the U.S. after the Shah was overthrown in 1979, Troy Edgar said “she embodies the American dream in a manner that enables me to understand the hopes and aspirations of millions of people who come to America.”

The issue of immigration, and how the government should treat people coming into the country, was key to the public debate in Los Alamitos last year when Edgar supported a move by Councilman Warren Kusumoto to have their city opt-out of the California sanctuary laws. The council’s 4-1 vote last April set off a flurry of anti-sanctuary resolutions and other actions by cities and counties across California.

Most of the measures passed after Los Alamitos’ vote were city resolutions, which have little weight were widely viewed as symbolic. But Los Alamitos passed a law to ignore the state law, a move that prompted the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California to file a lawsuit against the city. Separately, the City of Huntington Beach sued the state over the sanctuary law, and won, in a case that is now on appeal.

In his testimony last week, Edgar said he “believe(s) in public service and in answering the call of our great country.” If chosen for the job, he said he would “continue (the department’s) critical mission, maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of available resources, and protect taxpayer dollars.”

Schumer Requests Investigation Into Mnuchin’s Handling of the Harriet Tubman $20 Bill,https://www.nytimes.com,['Alan Rappeport'],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/us/politics/schumer-harriet-tubman-bill.html,"In May, Mr. Mnuchin said at a congressional hearing that the design imagery of the bill would not be ready until 2026 because of the complexity of creating new anti-counterfeiting measures. He would not commit to Tubman ever appearing on its face and said that a future Treasury secretary would make that decision.

Mr. Mnuchin has denied delaying the process and said in a statement last week that Treasury and the Bureau of Engraving and Printing remain committed to the schedule of new $20 notes going into circulation by 2030.

Len Olijar, the director of the bureau, said that, for security reasons, design concepts of a new $20 note were never going to be released next year and that “everything remains on the table” regarding whose portrait will be on the new bill. Mr. Olijar said that the image of a $20 note that The Times obtained featuring Tubman’s portrait, which was created by the bureau, was not an advanced design concept.

After Mr. Trump took office, the Treasury Department removed from its website all mentions of Tubman or the planned changes to the $20, $10 and $5 notes that the Obama administration set in motion. Mr. Mnuchin had said little on the subject until he was pressed about it during a House Financial Services Committee hearing last month.

The delay of the new design has prompted calls for the Trump administration to follow through in adding Tubman to the note and bipartisan legislation in the House that would require the Treasury Department to do so next year.

Requests from Congress for inspector general inquiries do tend to yield responses. Mr. Mnuchin’s department has faced internal investigations into the secretary’s travel practices and into his handling of an analysis of the Republican tax cut legislation. The inquiry into Mr. Mnuchin’s air travel found he broke no laws in his use of military aircraft but lamented the loose justification provided for such costly flights. The tax cut analysis investigation found no evidence of any improper political interference with the career tax staff."

Columnist

The State Department official in charge of U.S. arms control negotiations with Moscow and her husband had a years-long friendship with GOP operative Paul Erickson, the former boyfriend of convicted unregistered Russian agent Maria Butina — ties this official did not disclose to her superiors or to Congress during her confirmation process in the spring of 2018.

Erickson officiated the June 2017 wedding of Andrea Thompson, the undersecretary of state for arms control and international security affairs, and David Gillian, a former senior Australian army officer, three administration officials and Erickson’s lawyer have confirmed. At the time, Thompson was serving as national security adviser to Vice President Pence. Four months before the wedding, Gillian had transferred Erickson $100,000, which federal officials allege Erickson stole from Gillian, FBI and court documents show. Thompson never disclosed these ties to her superiors until approached this week by this columnist, the three administration officials said.

The wedding took place about six months before Erickson and Butina were publicly identified as being connected to Russian influence operations inside the United States. But by the time of Thompson’s confirmation, allegations of the couple’s influence activities had been widely reported.

Sen. Robert Menendez (N.J.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told me that his panel will investigate Thompson’s lack of disclosure to both Congress and the FBI.

“These reports about Under Secretary Thompson raise questions about how forthcoming she was with all relevant information during her confirmation process,” Menendez said. “I hope that any relevant connections implicating financial interests, or to someone who our government has charged with being an agent of a foreign power, would have been fully reviewed and vetted by the FBI during the security clearance process, and disclosed to the Foreign Relations Committee. It is not clear that happened.”

Thompson’s failure to disclose her contacts and her husband’s business dealings with Erickson is viewed inside the administration as a serious lack of judgment — considering that her former boss, then-national security adviser Michael Flynn, was fired for lying about his contacts with Russian officials.

Several administration officials told me Thompson should have disclosed these connections voluntarily, since she holds top security clearances and has worked for decades as a U.S. intelligence officer. Her failure to report this information, these officials suggested, represented an intelligence vulnerability that could have been used against her.

“When the person who marries you gets into trouble with the Russians and your job is to negotiate with the Russians, you have to disclose that,” a senior administration official told me. “Everybody with an intelligence clearance knows that.”

Butina attended the Thompson-Gillian wedding in South Dakota as Erickson’s guest, according to Erickson’s lawyer, William Hurd. Butina did not have significant interactions with either Thompson or Gillian at the wedding, beyond greetings and congratulations, Hurd told me.

“Paul Erickson had known Andrea Thompson and David Gillian for years. He considered them both friends and agreed to officiate at their wedding in 2017,” Hurd told me. “Maria Butina came to the wedding because Paul Erickson was dating her. If Paul had been dating a different woman, then that woman would have come to the wedding.”

The State Department declined to comment on the record. Thompson, through a State Department spokesperson, also declined to comment. Butina’s lawyer declined to comment. Gillian and the McChrystal Group, the consulting firm where he now works, did not respond to requests for comment.

As a career intelligence officer, Thompson would have been required under updated executive branch regulations to self-report any significant unofficial contacts with a foreign national or any attempt by a foreign national to gain influence.

There is no evidence to suggest Thompson or Gillian had significant interactions with Butina outside the wedding, either. Sources close to Thompson told me that Erickson had known the Thompson family for many years in South Dakota.

Thompson is not alleged to have been involved in her husband’s business dealings with Erickson. Additionally, there is no evidence Thompson was deliberately untruthful to her bosses, federal investigators or congressional officials during her vetting or confirmation process, which took place from late 2017 until her confirmation on April 26, 2018.

In December 2017, after Thompson had left the vice president’s office and was working at the State Department before being nominated for her current role, the New York Times revealed that Erickson had emailed top Trump campaign officials in May 2016 offering to set up a high-level back channel with the Russian government led by President Vladimir Putin.

Under the subject line “Kremlin Connection,” Erickson proposed that Trump could “make first contact” with “President Putin’s emissary” at an upcoming event hosted by the National Rifle Association, of which Erickson was a long-time member. The planned meeting did not take place, according to the Times.

But according to federal prosecutors, this was just one of a series of actions Erickson took in cooperation with Butina to make connections in Republican political circles and set up meetings for Alexander Torshin, who was then a deputy governor of the Russian central bank.

In July 2018, the Justice Department unveiled a criminal complaint against Butina, charging her with “conspiracy to act as an agent of the Russian Federation within the United States without prior notification to the Attorney General.” In an accompanying affidavit, the FBI claimed that ""U.S. Person 1,"" whom several reports have identified as Erickson, worked closely with Butina to build her influence inside the United States and “advance the interests of the Russian Federation.”

The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has opened an investigation into Butina, Torshin and their activities inside the United States. The FBI is also reportedly investigating whether Torshin helped funnel Russian money through the NRA to help the Trump campaign.

Erickson has never been charged with any crime related to Butina, Torshin or the NRA. In February, he was indicted in a seemingly unrelated matter, accused by federal prosecutors of defrauding dozens of investors related to a plan to build retirement facilities and housing for oil workers in North Dakota. According to an April 2018 FBI affidavit in that case, one of Erickson’s last investors was Gillian.

“Erickson told David Gillian he would receive a return of between 25 percent and 75 percent within approximately one year,” the affidavit alleges.

“In reality, the bank records indicated that Gillian’s $100,000 was not invested in real estate or anything else,” the affidavit continues. “In fact, that money was used to pay routine expenses and to pay off a previous investor, Congressman Marshall Sanford. Some of Gillian’s money went to Erickson’s girlfriend, Maria Butina.”

The criminal complaint against Erickson alleges he wired more than $20,000 to American University, where Butina was studying, three months after taking Gillian’s money. Gillian is now suing Erickson in civil court in South Dakota regarding the investment. Hurd, Erickson’s lawyer, has previously called the fraud charges against Erickson “unfounded.”

To be clear, Thompson’s connections with Erickson are not a crime and Erickson is innocent until proven guilty. Gillian is not accused of wrongdoing and is allegedly a victim of Erickson.

Rep. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said Thompson’s situation was symptomatic of larger staffing issues plaguing the Trump administration.

“From clumsy vetting to chronic failure to fill vacant positions, it’s no wonder there’s such dysfunction in the executive branch,” Engel said. “The White House needs to get its act together to make sure the officials in charge of protecting our national security meet the highest standards and comply fully with all laws and regulations on disclosure.”

Shanahan to be the permanent defense secretary, leaving the Pentagon in transition at a time of escalating tensions with Iran and questions about the role of the military on the border with Mexico.

Mr. Shanahan, a former Boeing executive who had been serving as the acting defense secretary, announced his resignation as an F.B.I. background investigation, conducted on all cabinet nominees, was continuing because of incidents of family violence.

Mr. Shanahan’s ex-wife had accused him of punching her in the stomach, which Mr. Shanahan has denied. He said his ex-wife started the fight, and his spokesman said she was arrested and charged with domestic violence. The charges were eventually dropped.

Mr. Trump named Mark T. Esper, the secretary of the Army and a former Raytheon executive, to take over as acting secretary of defense. He did not say whether Mr. Esper would be nominated for the permanent position, but told reporters he was a “highly respected” graduate of West Point and Harvard and predicted that “he’ll do very well.”"
