The situations all seem far-fetched, but the president's comments have people chattering in the halls of Congress and throughout the Beltway.

In 2016, Donald Trump waffled over whether he would accept the election results if he lost.

Since then, Trump has repeatedly joked about staying in office beyond the two terms the Constitution allows. Jerry Falwell Jr., Trump’s most prominent evangelical supporter, has suggested Trump should get two years tacked on to his first term as “pay back” for the Mueller investigation. The president’s own former lawyer, Michael Cohen, has warned that “there will never be a peaceful transition of power” should Trump fail in his reelection bid.

The scenarios all seem far-fetched — “It’s almost a question for science fiction movies,” cracked a former top Secret Service official — but the constant drumbeat nonetheless has people chattering in the halls of Congress and throughout the Beltway: What if Trump won’t accept defeat in 2020?

And one scenario in particular has Democrats nervous: the lawsuit-happy Trump contests the election results in court.

“It’s been a worry in the back of my mind for the last couple years now,” said Rep. Brendan Boyle, a Pennsylvania Democrat. California Rep. Ted Lieu, a frequent Trump critic and early impeachment inquiry supporter, acknowledged the same concern but said he trusted law enforcement “would do the right thing” and “install the winner” of the election. Even House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has told her party to prepare for the possibility that Trump contests the 2020 results.

Constitutional experts and top Republican lawmakers dismiss the fears as nonsense, noting there are too many forces working against a sitting president simply clinging to power — including history, law and political pressure.

“That is the least concern people should have. Of all the silly things that are being said, that may be the silliest,” said Missouri GOP Sen. Roy Blunt, who presided over the 2016 inauguration ceremony and expects to do so again in 2020. “The one thing we are really good at is the transition of power.”

Constitutional law expert Jonathan Turley said a lingering incumbent would simply become irrelevant once the new and duly elected president is sworn in. At that point, the defeated president is nothing more than a guest, “if not an interloper,” in the White House, the George Washington University professor noted.

“The system would make fast work on any president who attempted to deny the results of the election,” he said.

But a court battle over a presidential election is not unprecedented. And Trump has shown a willingness to tie up his disputes in winding litigation. The Democratic National Committee and Trump’s campaign were in court all the way up to Election Day 2016, fighting over charges of voter intimidation and ballot access.

“All candidates have a right to contest results in federal court,” Turley said. “It’s not up to the candidate to decide if an election is valid. It’s not based on their satisfaction or consent. They have every right to seek judicial review.”

Even so, contesting the results of the election in more than one state would be “a massive undertaking,” said Bradley Shrager, a lawyer specializing in election litigation who has worked with several Democratic campaigns. He added that “given the time frames to launch recounts and election contests, you’d have to be preparing months in advance to be able to do that.”

There are also deadlines for submitting an official electoral vote tally, Shrager said, so a legal battle wouldn’t drag out indefinitely.

Still, Pelosi’s comments nodded to the Democratic suspicion that Trump will put up a fight. She argued the Democrats’ must win by a margin so “big” that Trump can’t challenge the results.

The sentiment, Democrats say, is fueled by Trump’s cavalier attitude toward presidential term lengths.

Trump continues to talk up the prospect that he could serve past the constitutionally mandated period. On Twitter last weekend, Trump pondered , “do you think the people would demand that I stay longer?” The line mirrored language he used at a rally in Pennsylvania last month where he talked about living in the White House for 20 years.

“We ran one time and we’re 1-and-0. But it was for the big one. Now we’re going to have a second time. And we’re going to have another one. And then we’ll drive them crazy,” Trump said. “And maybe if we really like it a lot — and if things keep going like they’re going — we’ll go and we’ll do what we have to do. We’ll do a three and a four and a five.”

Trump also promoted Falwell Jr.’s line from May that the president should get two extra years “as pay back for time stolen by this corrupt failed coup”, retweeting the Liberty University president.

After the best week ever for @realDonaldTrump - no obstruction, no collusion, NYT admits @BarackObama did spy on his campaign, & the economy is soaring. I now support reparations-Trump should have 2 yrs added to his 1st term as pay back for time stolen by this corrupt failed coup — Jerry Falwell (@JerryFalwellJr) May 5, 2019

The president has long casually toyed with the idea that he could stay in office beyond the constitutionally set maximum.

In March 2018, Trump praised the ruling Communist Party of China for abolishing presidential term limits. Then, a month later, he publicly pondered why he couldn’t be in office for 16 years, an apparent reference to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who died during his fourth term. The 22nd Amendment, ratified a few years after Roosevelt’s death, prohibited future presidents from serving more than two consecutive elected terms.

It’s not just talk of extending term limits that have raised questions about the president’s respect for the next cycle. During the 2016 campaign, Trump stoked fears among his supporters that the election would be “rigged” and he refused to state during his final debate with Hillary Clinton that he’d concede to his Democratic opponent if she won.

His crusade extended into Election Day when, just before 5 p.m., Trump incorrectly tweeted that “Utah officials report voting machine problems across entire country.” In fact, the problems were just in one county. And even after being declared the 2016 winner, Trump continued to state without evidence that “millions” of people voted illegally, fueling questions about whether he would have taken this argument to court if the result hadn’t gone his way.

When asked whether Trump would commit to conceding the 2020 election if he lost, the Trump reelection campaign turned the issue back on Democrats. It was Stacey Abrams, the rising Democratic star, who actually refused to concede defeat in her bid for the Georgia governorship, an aide noted.

“This question would be better asked of Stacey Abrams, who still refuses to accept that she lost the governor’s race in Georgia, or Hillary Clinton, for that matter, who still whines that her coronation was stolen,” the aide told POLITICO. “It’s also irrelevant, because President Trump will be re-elected in 2020.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

The stakes for Trump in 2020 are high. If he loses, the president will lose his immunity from criminal prosecution the moment his successor is sworn into the White House. And several Democratic presidential hopefuls have suggested their Justice Department would be hard-pressed not to bring charges against Trump for obstructing justice, using the evidence in special counsel Robert Mueller’s final report . Federal prosecutors in New York have also been reviewing potential campaign finance violations.

Confronted with Trump’s past remarks, Republicans remain largely unmoved.

“As untraditional a president as he is, I think he understands if you lose an election you lose an election and the other person wins,” said Ohio Rep. Steve Chabot, a senior member of the powerful House Judiciary Committee. “There’s no chance of anything like that possibly happening. That’s just hysteria. No way would that ever happen.”

Chabot recalled getting similar questions about President Barack Obama holding on to power — serving more than two terms — before the 2016 election. “I didn’t want to laugh it off because these were my constituents. But I’d explain to them there’s no chance of that happening,” he said.

Unlike Obama, though, Trump has fanned the concerns with his rhetoric. He could also put all the scuttlebutt to rest if he wanted to, said John Q. Barrett, a St. John’s University law professor.

“He’s to blame at least in the minimal sense that he doesn’t shoot this down and say all the unequivocal, constitutionally obedient stuff that any president would say,” said Barrett, who served as an associate under Reagan-era independent counsel Lawrence Walsh. “Trump could pour a bucket of water on all this right away.”

The GOP may not take the idea seriously now. But they would be key to convincing Trump to concede in 2020 should the president resist an Electoral College loss, said Steven Levitsky, a comparative political scientist and professor of government at Harvard.

“No matter what the actual mechanisms are (which laws, which police), the key here is the Republican Party,” he said in an email.

The onus, Levitsky said, would fall to GOP leaders including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to “come out and say, ‘Enough is enough, Trump lost.’”

Republicans to date have often given Trump the benefit of the doubt on controversial statements and actions. But Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, said he is confident that even a GOP that has embraced all-things Trump would rebuke a lame duck Trump if he refused to respect the election results.

“Even my Republican colleagues, who are not willing to impeach, have said to me that they would not stand for a president defying a court-certified election result, nor would they stand for a president running for more than two terms,” he said.

Khanna added that he was more concerned with the integrity of the election itself, and “the shenanigans that could happen in the counting of the votes in these states.”

“It’s important to make sure that we have strong election protection lawyers in polling places around the country to prevent further interference, and verification on election night of each state’s results as they come in,” he said.

Despite giving assurances Trump would not cause problems if he lost, lawmakers can’t help but recall the most recent contested presidential election as an example of a close race that could become a model for an upside down 2020 race.

“I feel quite confident that whoever wins the next election will be president,” Chabot said. “Now, of course, that being said, then you have the 2000 Bush-Gore election. That was nuts.”"
"Trump, questioned on child separation policy, insists, ‘I brought the families together’",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Allyson Chiu', 'Reporter With The Morning Mix Team', 'June At Am', ""Allyson Chiu Is A Reporter With The Washington Post'S Morning Mix Team. She Has Previously Contributed To The South China Morning Post"", 'The Pacific Daily News.']",06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/06/21/trump-telemundo-family-separation-policy-obama/,"

President Trump listens during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the White House on June 20. (Evan Vucci/AP)

In what was billed as his first television interview with a Spanish-language network, President Trump was pressed on his administration’s “zero tolerance” immigration policy and insisted that it was “not a mistake,” doubling down on his previously discredited claims that former president Barack Obama was to blame for families being separated at the border.

“I brought the families together,” Trump said in a wide-ranging and at times contentious interview with Telemundo that aired late Thursday night. “I’m the one that put them together.”

The president’s comments come just days after he tweeted that U.S. immigration agents will soon “begin the process of removing the millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States.” Trump added, “They will be removed as fast as they come in.”

[Trump vows mass immigration arrests, removals of ‘millions of illegal aliens’ starting next week]

The plan Trump was apparently referring to earlier in the week would target thousands of migrant parents and children nationwide, and Homeland Security officials have expressed concerns that families could inadvertently become separated as a result, The Washington Post’s Nick Miroff and Maria Sacchetti reported.

Addressing a predominantly Hispanic audience on Thursday, Trump pushed back against “Noticiero Telemundo” anchor José Díaz-Balart’s assertion that he has been “very tough on immigrants.” The roughly 20-minute interview was posted to YouTube in English and was dubbed in Spanish on the television network.

“When you say that, you mean illegal immigrants,” Trump said. “I’ve been very good to immigrants.”

Díaz-Balart questioned Trump about his administration’s deeply unpopular family separation policy, which sparked a humanitarian and political crisis at the border last spring after thousands of parents were split up from their children. Facing broad backlash, Trump abruptly halted the separations in June 2018. The government identified more than 2,700 children that were separated from their families last year, but the actual number, estimated to be thousands more, is still unknown.

“So, the ‘zero tolerance’ policy, was it a mistake?” Díaz-Balart asked, moments after Trump boasted that his support among Latino voters is rising because “Hispanics want toughness at the border.”

“It’s not a mistake,” he replied. “We want to have strong borders.”

Ignoring Díaz-Balart’s attempts to bring up the thousands of children affected by the policy, Trump reverted to a common response when faced with questions about the separations: Falsely pinning the blame on Obama.

“When I became president, President Obama had a separation policy, I didn’t have it,” Trump said. “President Obama is the one that built those prison cells.”

Trump’s assertions about Obama’s immigration policies have been debunked several times by The Post’s Fact Checker. Current and former DHS officials said family separation was rare during the Obama years, and usually only happened if a child’s safety was at risk, The Post reported in April.

[Trump digs in on false claim that he stopped Obama’s family separation policy]

As Díaz-Balart continued to press Trump on the “zero tolerance” policy, the president defended himself by reiterating that he was the one responsible for reuniting families. (The reunification process began last year after U.S. District Judge Dana M. Sabraw issued a court order demanding children be returned to their families.)

“I inherited separation and I changed the plan and I brought people together,” Trump said, arguing that family separations were a deterrent to migrants trying to cross the border.

“But I hated to have the separation policy,” he said, prompting Díaz-Balart to ask the president again if “zero tolerance” was a mistake.

“What ‘zero tolerance’ means to me is we’re going to be tough on the border,” Trump said.

“That includes separating parents from children if that’s what it takes?” Díaz-Balart replied.

“No, no, no. I put them together,” Trump answered. “Just remember that, I put them together.”

The president also faced questions about revoking the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protected undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, and his recently signed deal with Mexico. The country agreed to take “strong measures” to crack down on the surge of Central American migrants at the southern border to avoid harsh tariffs.

“This week, I consider them a friend,” Trump said of Mexico. “They’ve been doing a great job actually.”

He later added: “If they weren’t great, I would put tariffs on them.”

Díaz-Balart and Trump also discussed how he anticipated faring with Latino voters in the upcoming election and his fellow 2020 candidates.

Trump told Díaz-Balart that he believes he’ll do “much better” with the Latino vote in 2020, specifically drawing attention to his stance on Cuba and Venezuela. The Trump administration has accused Cuba of being involved with keeping Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in power, and is continuing to impose strict regulations on the Caribbean country.

“I’ve been very, very tough on Cuba,” Trump said. “We’re going to get Cuba worked out properly. Not the way Obama did it, which was a disaster.”

[Trump administration ends group travel to Cuba by Americans]

Pushed on why Maduro remains in power, Trump said, “Some people say we’ve been too tough, I say we haven’t been tough enough.” The Post’s Karen DeYoung and Josh Dawsey reported Wednesday that Trump “is losing both patience and interest in Venezuela.”

“Well, it’s a process,” Trump said during Thursday’s interview, before expressing sympathy for Venezuelans who are starving and “have no nothing.”

“I love the Venezuelan people,” he said.

[With Maduro entrenched in Venezuela, Trump loses patience and interest in issue, officials say]

Though Trump said he wouldn’t “bother too much” with commenting on his political opponents, he still hurled a few zingers. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) “looks like a tired crazy right now,” he said. Trump also described former vice president Joe Biden as “exhausted.”

When Díaz-Balart brought up a recent Quinnipiac University poll, which had Biden, Sanders, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, among other candidates, leading Trump in Florida, the president dismissed the results.

“I don’t respect that poll,” he said.

Asked whether he had any regrets, Trump shook his head and said, “I’ve done a great job.”

And his two biggest mistakes as president?

“I would have not appointed a couple of people, and my life would have been a much simpler life,” he said, without specifying which people he was referring to. “My biggest mistakes was I put a couple of people in that I shouldn’t have put in.”"
Nadler: Hope Hicks testimony is huge gift in legal battle with Trump,https://www.politico.com,"['Andrew Desiderio', 'Kyle Cheney']",06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/21/hope-hicks-democrats-trump-1374706,"Former White House communications director Hope Hicks leaves a closed-door interview with members of the House Judiciary Committee. | Andrew Harnik/AP Photo EXCLUSIVE Nadler: Hope Hicks testimony is huge gift in legal battle with Trump In an exclusive interview, Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler also said Democrats would soon sue former White House Counsel Don McGahn.

House Democrats are planning to file a lawsuit within days to force former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify on Capitol Hill — and they say Hope Hicks’ reluctant testimony Wednesday will help deliver them a crucial win in court.

Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said Hicks’ blanket refusal to tell lawmakers about her tenure in the West Wing is the real-life illustration Democrats needed to show a judge just how extreme the White House’s blockade on witness testimony has become.

“It very much played into our hands,” Nadler said in an interview in his Capitol Hill office Thursday. “It’s one thing to tell a judge blanket immunity is not a right thing. It’s another thing when a judge can see what that means in actuality, and how absurd it is.”

Nadler said he is working with the House general counsel to draft the lawsuit against McGahn, a central witness for special counsel Robert Mueller. The New York Democrat said he’s confident that a win in the McGahn case would create a precedent that forces the White House to back off its resistance to Democrats’ investigations and permit other key Mueller witnesses, like Hicks, to talk to lawmakers.

“That court case is key to everything,” Nadler said. “[Hicks] will be forthcoming only under legal compulsion.”

White House lawyers intervened hundreds of times on Wednesday to claim that Hicks, a longtime confidante of Trump who served as White House communications director, had “absolute immunity” from talking to Congress. Though some Democrats were infuriated by Hicks’ refusal to answer even basic questions about her years working in the Trump White House, Nadler said he anticipated the stonewalling and that his decision to move forward with the interview was by design.

“I understand, obviously, there are people in the press, in Congress and elsewhere saying, ‘Why’d they waste their time with that? What was the point? What’d they accomplish?’” Nadler said. “We knew this was going to happen. The point of it was to dramatize for the court what the implications of this are.”

Hicks wouldn’t answer questions as basic as where her desk was located in the White House or whether an Israel-Egypt war broke out while she worked in the government — something that clearly never happened. She also declined to discuss interactions she had with figures outside the White House, including former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and former Trump legal team spokesman Mark Corallo.

“It’s very useful to show the judge what this means in practical reality… what an incredible assertion of executive supremacy and of congressional irrelevance,” Nadler said.

“In effect what it’s saying is, you can’t really investigate fraud, waste, abuse of power in the White House because anyone in a position to talk about it, we’re blocking,” he added. “And the [Hicks interview] was very useful to give us the record that we can show the judge how extreme it really is.”

Nadler emphasized that the committee’s inability to get Hicks to answer any questions about the Trump White House offered a long-term strategic victory, too.

If a court finds that the administration’s conception of “immunity” goes too far and orders McGahn to testify, it’s a precedent Nadler said could be used to speed the appearances of Mueller witnesses like Hicks and other former White House officials who testified about Trump’s efforts to thwart the special counsel’s investigation of his 2016 campaign’s contacts with Russia.

McGahn, who like Hicks provided damning testimony to Mueller about Trump’s efforts to interfere with the probe, refused to appear before the Judiciary Committee last month or to provide documents demanded in a subpoena.

Aides carry boxes of documents out of a House Judiciary Committee room following a closed door interview with former White House communications director Hope Hicks on Capitol Hill.

Hicks, though, opted to appear before the committee — allowing Nadler to test the willingness of the White House to block every single question about her White House service.

Last week, the House voted to empower Nadler and other committee chairs to sue the Trump administration to enforce subpoenas that have been defied or ignored. In the meantime, the Justice Department has given Judiciary Committee members access to some of Mueller’s “key” evidence, including FBI witness interview notes.

Several Democrats — including Nadler — have privately argued to Speaker Nancy Pelosi that opening an impeachment inquiry would strengthen their hand in the courts, arguing that a formal judicial proceeding is one of the only ways to speed up federal court battles that can often take months or years.

But Pelosi has maintained her hard line against impeachment, even as she has characterized the White House’s continued resistance to House Democrats’ investigations as “obstruction of justice.”

Nadler said Thursday that his committee’s lawsuit against McGahn will come well before any final decision is made on impeachment. Therefore, he argued, Hicks’ testimony will arm the House general counsel with another crucial data point in its ongoing legal fights.

“We want to go to court now,” Nadler said. “We want to unlock this now. Impeachment is not now.”

In addition to Hicks and McGahn, Trump has instructed his former deputy counsel Annie Donaldson to defy the committee’s subpoenas seeking documents and witness testimony. The Justice Department has repeatedly provided legal justification for the White House’s positions and crafted new opinions asserting the president’s view.

The president’s continued stonewalling has frustrated the Democratic rank-and-file, and a majority of Democrats who serve on the Judiciary Committee have now endorsed opening up a formal impeachment inquiry. For now, though, the panel isn’t going there.

Instead, the committee has in recent weeks held hearings with former federal prosecutors and Nixon White House Counsel John Dean in an effort to air the findings of the Mueller report for the public. But Democrats are still agitating for a breakthrough and hope they may be getting closer.

“I understand, obviously, people are getting frustrated,” Nadler said. “‘Why aren’t you having fact witnesses? Why are you having John Dean and former prosecutors pontificate?’ Well the fact of the matter is, we can’t get fact witnesses until we win in court.”"
Tucker Carlson: Warmongers in Washington badly want a war with Iran. Trump is rightfully skeptical,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Tucker Carlson', 'Tucker Carlson Currently Serves As The Host Of Fox News Channel S', 'Fnc']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-warmongers-in-washington-badly-want-a-war-with-iran-trump-is-rightfully-skeptical,"Since 9/11, the U.S. has spent trillions of dollars and thousands of American lives trying to remake the Middle East in our image. It's sad to say it out loud, but we have to: It hasn't worked. Many of us thought it would, but it hasn't.

By every measure, our foreign wars have ended in dismal failure for the United States -- however noble their intentions, and some did have noble intentions. Donald Trump was one of the rare Republican politicians honest enough to admit this. He said it out loud three years ago, and promised not to repeat the same mistakes if elected president. And partly because he said that, he was elected president.

Now something fascinating is happening. The very people -- in some cases, literally the same people who lured us into the Iraq quagmire 16 years ago -- are demanding a new war, this one with Iran. The president, to his great credit, appears to be skeptical of this -- very skeptical.

Iran recently downed an unmanned American drone. President Trump, speaking Thursday, seemed to suggest this shouldn't necessarily trigger a conflict with Iran.

""Iran made a big mistake. This drone was in international waters. Clearly we have it all documented,"" Trump said. ""I would imagine it was a general or somebody that made a mistake in shooting that drone down. Unfortunately, that drone was unarmed. It was not -- there was no man in it. And there was no -- it was just -- it was over international waters, clearly over international waters. But we didn't have a man or woman in the drone. We had nobody in the drone.""

In Washington, there are no real consequences for being wrong. And as a result, policymakers are. They make the same mistakes again and again

""It would have made a big difference, let me tell you,"" he added. ""It would have made a big, big difference. I find it hard to believe it was intentional, if you want to know the truth. I think that it could been somebody who was loose and stupid that did it.""

CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE ENTIRE EPISODE.

So that's not nearly bellicose enough for the permanent foreign policy establishment in Washington, many of whom crave a war with Iran, and see every provocation as an opportunity to start one. Sen. Lindsey Graham, for example, says Americans ought to be ready to fight and die for shipping lanes on the other side of the world.

""So here's what to watch for. If the Iranians follow through on their threat to starting reaching again at higher levels to basically take their enrichment program to a kind of a nuclear level in terms of a weapons grade production, Israel's in a world of hurt,"" he said. ""So the best thing the president can do is stop that. And how do you stop that to make Iran understand you're not going to let that happen? I think you should put their oil refineries on our target list, and that he should look at sinking the Iranian Navy if they attack shipping again.""

In Washington, there are no real consequences for being wrong. And as a result, policymakers are. They make the same mistakes again and again, and it's certainly not just Lindsey Graham.

At the New York Times, left-wing warmonger, Bret Stephens, is also calling on America to sink the Iranian Navy. Many on the left are for it. John Bolton cheers him on from within the White House. Bill Kristol nods with approval from outside the White House.

None of these people will admit their actual intentions. They'll tell you they don't really want to war with Iran. That's a crock. They want a war badly, badly enough to lie about it. That's why they're putting American troops into situations where conflict is inevitable in order to start a war.

Everyone in Washington knows exactly what's happening. They've seen it many times before.

Hundreds of migrant caravan members found to have US criminal histories: DHS files,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hundreds-of-migrant-caravan-found-to-have-criminal-histories-dhs-files,"Hundreds of illegal immigrants attempting to cross the southern border as part of massive migrant caravans were found to have criminal histories in the U.S., according to newly obtained Department of Homeland Security documents.

The DHS files were provided to House Oversight Committee Republicans in May and included internal data showing more than 1,000 migrants traveling as part of caravans to the border within the past nine months had “U.S. criminal histories” and hundreds had “U.S. criminal convictions.”

BORDER ARRESTS SKYROCKET IN MAY, AS OFFICIALS DECLARE 'FULL-BLOWN EMERGENCY'

The files detailed one migrant caravan of nearly 8,000 individuals that started toward the border in October 2018 and arrived south of California by December. According to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), 660 of them had U.S. criminal convictions—with 40 convicted of assault or aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and three convicted of murder.

In January 2019, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) tracked another caravan that left Honduras with more than 3,300 migrants. ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) team identified that 860 of those individuals had U.S. criminal histories, including more than 20 convicted of assault or aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, nearly 30 convicted of sexual offenses, two convicted of violence against law enforcement, and one convicted of attempted murder.

The documents, provided to House Oversight Republicans, also revealed that CBP is currently monitoring another “movement of several groups ranging in size from 1,000 to 4,000” in the Mexican states of Chiapas and Veracruz, but did not specify how many of those migrants are believed to have criminal records.

In a letter to DHS Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan on Thursday, committee Ranking Member Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, requested further information about caravan members with criminal backgrounds to “assist” in their “oversight of the crisis at the southern border and better understand the threat posed by large caravans.”

Jordan requested arrest warrants, court documents and other materials detailing the criminal histories of the migrants in the January 2019 and October 2018 caravan; an update of CBP’s monitoring of the caravan movement in Mexican states; and summaries of ICE HSI materials by July 5.

In his letter, Jordan referred to President Trump’s decision in February to declare a national emergency and referred to his comments that the “southern border is a major entry point for criminals, gang members, and illicit narcotics” threatening “core national security interests.”

The newly revealed DHS information comes amid a stunning surge across the border this year. Last month, the number of migrants apprehended at the southern border skyrocketed to levels not seen in over a decade, with CBP reporting nearly 133,000 arrests in May. The number surpassed 144,000 when counting migrants deemed inadmissible—more than a 30 percent increase from the prior month and double the influx recorded at the beginning of the year. The number was the highest monthly total in more than 13 years, officials said.

“We are in a full-blown emergency,” Acting CBP Commissioner John Sanders said earlier this month. In April, authorities recorded 99,304 arrests.

FOOTAGE SHOWS MIGRANTS WALKING AROUND BORDER WALL TO ENTER US

McAleenan, in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, also warned that 90 percent of asylum seekers skip their hearings after being released into the U.S.

The continued crisis at the border comes as Trump has sought to extend and shore up the border wall, declaring a national emergency in a bid to divert billions toward construction -- an effort being challenged in the courts.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration announced that it had reached a deal with Mexico to drop threatened tariffs on Mexican imports in exchange for Mexico increasing efforts to limit U.S.-bound migration flows from Central America.

Through the agreement, the U.S. is slated to extend its policy of returning asylum applicants to Mexico while their claims are processed. The U.S. also committed to accelerating asylum claims while Mexico said it will “offer jobs, healthcare, and education according to its principles.”

The deal also stated that Mexico will take “decisive action” to dismantle smuggling and trafficking operations, while both countries will increase cooperation to protect the border.

Justice Dept review of intel in Russia probe fuels fears of politicization,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Olivia Gazis'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/justice-department-review-of-intelligence-in-russia-probe-fuels-fears-of-politicization/,"A mix of concern, confusion and defiance has spread through elements of the intelligence community as a murky picture emerges of Attorney General William Barr's review of its investigative and analytical work on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

In particular, current and former intelligence officials are questioning the purpose and propriety of the attorney general's intention, first reported by The New York Times, to enlist John Durham, the U.S. attorney for the District of Connecticut, in scrutinizing the analytical judgments that led a group of agencies to conclude that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign to boost then-candidate Trump's electability.

That judgment, put forth in a declassified Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA) commissioned by former president Barack Obama and released in January 2017, pooled the findings of the CIA, FBI and NSA. The CIA and FBI expressed ""high confidence"" in that conclusion, while the NSA had ""moderate confidence.""

""I see no problem with a DOJ review of whether the CIA and other intelligence community agencies lived up to their legal and regulatory responsibilities related to how they handled any information related to U.S. persons – U.S. citizens and U.S. nationals,"" said Michael Morell, a former CIA deputy director who is a CBS News senior national security contributor. ""Having said that, I see a DOJ review of whether or not the intelligence analysts made the right call as wholly inappropriate. I cannot ever remember a DOJ review of analysis.""

""[Durham] and his team have no experience with, or knowledge of, the process of intelligence analysis,"" Morell said. ""He and his team could well impose a law enforcement standard in coming to a conclusion — a much higher bar than exists in the intelligence community for analytic judgments.""

Both the House and Senate Intelligence Committees have already examined the process by which the ICA was assembled and offered their declassified assessments.

In their March 2018 final report on Russia's active measures, Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee — without describing what kind of evidence was examined — said ""most"" of the ICA's analysis ""held up to scrutiny."" But they criticized its judgment on Putin's strategic objectives for having ""failed to meet most of the analytic standards set forth in the primary guiding document for IC analysis."" (The committee's Democrats dissented from that view.)

That document – Intelligence Community Directive 203 – stipulates, among other things, that analytic products should be ""objective,"" ""timely,"" and ""independent of political consideration.""

But in July, the Senate Intelligence Committee — whose leadership has maintained a vastly more united and bipartisan front than the fractious panel in the House — issued a declassified summary of a months-long assessment that found the ICA to be a ""sound intelligence product."" The committee said it had reviewed ""thousands of pages of source documents and conducted interviews with all the relevant parties — including agency heads, managers, and line analysts — who were involved in developing the analysis and drafting the assessment.""

""In all the interviews of those who drafted and prepared the ICA, the Committee heard consistently that analysts were under no politically motivated pressure to reach any conclusions,"" the summary said. ""All analysts expressed that they were free to debate, object to content, and assess confidence levels, as is normal and proper for the analytic process.""

Analytical disagreement, the committee said, was ""reasonable, transparent, and openly debated.""

The Senate panel is expected to release a declassified version of a far more extensive report on the ICA in the coming months, though the bulk of their assessment is likely to remain classified.

Asked whether the Justice Department's review was duplicative of the panel's work, a spokeswoman for the Senate Intelligence Committee declined to comment.

Morell said a DOJ probe into analysts' conclusions could have a ""chilling effect"" on the analytic process.

""Any analyst asked to submit to an interview with Durham's investigators will want to have their own personal attorney at their side,"" he said. ""Imagine that — needing an attorney to explain an analytic judgment.""

""This will all be watched closely inside the IC and the prospect that DOJ prosecutors may ask questions about how an analyst came to a conclusion could well lead analysts to demur,"" Morell said.

A Democratic House Intelligence Committee official who requested anonymity to discuss ongoing, sensitive matters said the panel had engaged at multiple levels with multiple intelligence agencies and had ""heard a sense of anxiety"" and ""palpable unease.""

The official expressed concern that ""purposeful overreach"" by DOJ could undermine what have been shown to be sound conclusions, and that normal differences of opinion raised in the course of discussion that would go into crafting an analytical judgment could be exploited for political purposes.

In this case, the official said, in what could be a politically motivated effort to score-settle with former CIA Director John Brennan — has been sharply critical of President Trump — routine, healthy discussion could be cast as Brennan putting his thumb on the scale.

""There is no evidence that was the case. These assessments have withstood continued scrutiny for more than two years, and have only been buttressed by continued analysis and collection,"" the official said.

A spokesman for Mr. Brennan declined to comment. The CIA and NSA declined to comment. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The House Intelligence Committee's Democratic chairman, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, said at the National Press Club this week that he had met personally with Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, but the committee has otherwise had ""very little visibility"" into the scope and progress of the review. A Senate Intelligence Committee official also said that panel was in close communication with the intelligence community and similarly had not been offered details about the review beyond the contents of a letter the Department of Justice sent earlier this month.

In its letter, sent in response to an earlier inquiry from the House Judiciary Committee, DOJ indicated the review was ""broad in scope and multifaceted, and is intended to illuminate open questions regarding the activities of U.S. and foreign intelligence services as well as non-governmental organizations and individuals."" It did not explicitly mention a review of analytic processes or the ICA itself."
The U.S. State Department Has 'Not Seen an Uptick' of Deaths in the Dominican Republic,https://people.com,['Steve Helling'],,,,https://people.com/crime/state-department-no-updick-deaths-dominican-republic/,"By now, the news is everywhere.

In the past year, according to the U.S. State Department, at least eight American tourists have died after falling ill in Dominican Republic resorts — and dozens more have gotten sick. The incidents have garnered widespread media coverage, causing many Americans to rethink their travel plans.

But despite the rash of illnesses, the U.S. State Department has not issued an elevated travel advisory for the island nation — and the agency says in a statement that they “have not seen an uptick” in deaths despite the media coverage.

“We are closely monitoring ongoing investigations by Dominican authorities into several recent deaths of U.S. citizens in the Dominican Republic,” the statement says. “We have no higher priority than the safety and welfare of U.S. citizens abroad.”

“Millions of Americans travel to the Dominican Republic every year,” the statement continues. “Speaking generally, we have not seen an uptick in the number of US citizen deaths reported to the Department. While the overwhelming majority travel without incident, we want to assure all Americans that we continue to work actively with the Dominican authorities at the very highest levels to ensure that U.S. citizens are safe and feel safe while in the Dominican Republic.”

In April 2019, the department rated the Dominican Republic a level 2 for safety on a scale where 1 is the safest and 4 is the most dangerous. The rating means visitors should “exercise increased caution due to crime.” In the weeks of intense media scrutiny following the deaths of Americans, there has been no change to the rating.

The FBI has agents in on the island and are investigating the deaths of at least six of the tourists who have died since the summer of 2018. Some of them passed away in what appear to be bizarre — and similar — circumstances. The agencies are not yet releasing further details about the investigations.

Robin Bernstein, the ambassador of the United States to the Dominican Republic, told Univision these high-profile incidents should not be considered anything more than isolated cases. “We have 2.7 million Americans who come to the country and the statistics is that this is a very … unique event,” Bernstein said in a statement. “They come to visit the beautiful beaches and enjoy the great culture. Unfortunately sometimes those things happen to people.”

A spokesperson at the U.S. State Department tells PEOPLE that they will continue to monitor the situation, and will issue an elevated warning “if and when necessary.”"
"DHS cancels some Global Entry appointments as summer travel heats up, citing border crush",https://www.cnn.com,['Geneva Sands'],06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/20/politics/global-entry-canceled-appointments-resources-border/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Department of Homeland Security has had to cancel some Global Entry appointments as the summer travel season heats up as it transfers people to help at the southern border, a department official tells CNN.

Global Entry is a Customs and Border Protection program that ""allows expedited clearance for pre-approved, low-risk travelers upon arrival"" in the US. The Trusted Traveler Programs website , which includes Global Entry, already has an alert warning applicants that the ""extended partial government shutdown has resulted in a backlog,"" of applications and renewals.

The personnel shift comes amid a swell of migrant families and children that have arrived at the US border this year. The influx has strained DHS immigration resources and caused concerns about overcrowding and delayed US Border Patrol processing.

In response to efforts at the border, ""CBP is temporarily reducing staff at Global Entry Enrollment Centers nationwide and reassigning them to support frontline traveler processing during the busy summer months,"" Customs and Border Protection said in a statement.

""Regrettably, this situation has forced the cancellation of some scheduled appointments and may make it difficult to schedule an immediate interview,"" the statement said.

DOJ investigating Jared Kushner transactions in Deutsche Bank money-laundering probe,https://www.salon.com,[],06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.salon.com/2019/06/20/doj-investigating-jared-kushner-transactions-in-deutsche-bank-money-laundering-probe/,"The Department of Justice has opened a criminal investigation into potential money laundering by Deutsche Bank, including transactions linked to White House adviser and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner.

The investigation apparently centers on why Deutsche Bank officials failed to alert the Treasury Department about potentially suspicious transactions by Kushner’s family and company in 2016, including transactions involving Russian individuals, the New York Times reports.

Reportedly, bank officials did not submit the reports to Treasury, even though its employees prepared ""suspicious activity"" reports on the Kushner transactions and others. A spokesperson for Kushner Cos., the family's real estate corporation, told the Times that the firm is not under investigation.

The DOJ has already contacted Tammy McFadden, a former anti-money-laundering compliance officer at the bank who told the Times in May that she flagged transactions involving Kushner’s company but that her superiors had declined to file the suspicious activity reports with the federal government.

Some of McFadden’s colleagues had similar experiences in 2017 when they flagged transactions by entities owned by President Trump. It is unclear whether the FBI is investigating the bank’s handling of those transactions, according to the Times' report.

Congressional Democrats have already received some files from Deutsche Bank as they probe the bank’s dealings with Trump. Deutsche Bank was the only mainstream financial institution willing to lend Trump money after a series of high-profile bankruptcies and defaults in the 1990s. The bank lent him more than $2 billion over the last two decades, including $350 million that Trump still owes, the Times reported.

Two House committees have subpoenaed Deutsche Bank for records related to Trump but the president sued to block the bank from turning the files over. A federal judge rejected Trump’s request to block the subpoena and the president's lawyers are currently appealing that ruling.

Deutsche Bank has been under a DOJ investigation since 2015, according to the Times, when agents probed the bank’s role in laundering money for wealthy Russians. The bank was hit with steep fines in both the U.S. and the United Kingdom, but has not faced any criminal charges. The DOJ expanded its investigation last fall.

McFadden told the Times last month that she was fired by Deutsche Bank last year after raising concerns over the bank’s practices and has since filed complaints with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators.

On Wednesday, the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) also called on the Federal Reserve System to investigate whether Deutsche Bank had violated the law by refusing to submit the suspicious activity reports on the Kushner and Trump transactions.

“Deutsche Bank’s careless attitude towards banking compliance laws and failure to police its accounts may now be impacting American government at the highest levels,” said CREW executive director Noah Bookbinder. “Questions about transactions between President Trump and foreign actors whose conduct seemingly warranted suspicious activity reports, potentially facilitated by Deutsche Bank, harms the public legitimacy of the institution of the presidency itself.”"
Reparations Won’t Start With Congress. A President Needs to Do That.,https://www.politico.com,['Theodore R. Johnson'],06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/06/21/reparations-hearing-2020-candidates-congress-227194,"Theodore R. Johnson is a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice.

On Wednesday, exactly 154 years after a promise was made to newly freed black Americans, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties convened a hearing to discuss reparations for the breaking of that promise. The date of the hearing marked Juneteenth, a holiday that commemorates the abolition of slavery and the associated “absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property” that were to follow. The denial of those equal rights, however, led to massive racial inequalities that still plague the United States.

At the center of the hearing was H.R. 40, a bill that’s been introduced in every Congress for the past three decades that “establishes a commission to study and consider a national apology and proposal for reparations” for slavery, Jim Crow and their lingering effects. The bill represents one of the most serious efforts to jump-start a national inquiry into reparations, an idea that emerged with new urgency after Ta-Nehisi Coates’16,000-word Atlantic article in 2014 on the issue. Though 80 percent of white people still oppose reparations, their support has doubled, from 6 percent in 2014 to 13 percent today, since the publication of that essay.

Story Continued Below

For all the attention the congressional hearing got this week, Congress is the wrong venue if America is really going to move forward with a reparations study. It’s highly unlikely such a contentious measure would ever make it through the House or the Senate, assuming either would even put it to a vote. Instead, the push is going to have to come from the White House.

Though it won’t happen in the Trump administration, this idea is no longer as outlandish as it once might have seemed. The United States is now heading into its first presidential campaign where several candidates have expressed their support for studying reparations for the descendants of enslaved black Americans. The White House has unique power to focus national attention, and a presidential commission—far more than the congressional commission discussed this week—would have the prestige and traction to pull in national leaders and shape public opinion.

To date, of the 2020 Democratic candidates, only Julián Castro has specifically said he would create a commission to study the issue, but most of the top candidates ranging from Elizabeth Warren to Kamala Harris to Cory Booker have expressed support for the idea in some form. Many of them have expressed support for H.R. 40 and the congressional commission specifically. But executive action on reparations is an issue that each candidate should address more specifically. The creation of a presidential commission for a hot-button issue like reparations is well within the range of what presidents have done: Throughout the 20th century, presidential commissions and similar entities exploring a range of issues became a mainstay of American governance. From 1901 to 1929 alone, nearly 500 such commissions, councils, committees, task forces and the like were created by just five presidents. And the pace continues with modern presidents. Just last year, President Donald Trump announced two new commissions in the span of three days—one on school shootings and another on prisoner reentry.

On a controversial issue like reparations, it should be the president who steps up to the plate and commissions a study because state actions like making official apologies and reparations should ultimately be led by heads of state.

Presidential action is also necessary because it’s the surest route to a study, and such a study might be the only viable first step in the process because it could grease the wheels for a more productive national discussion on the issue. And on a controversial issue like reparations, improving the terms of the debate is essential to moving forward.

In a recent paper, political scientists David Miller and Andrew Reeves found that presidential commissions can be successful in accomplishing a range of political objectives—allaying constituents’ demands, incorporating diverse perspectives and fostering consensus, conferring credibility on policy ideas and proposals and providing a public framing for the issue in question that provides a point of reference for the national discourse. These benefits are particularly useful for the reparations debate, because too much of it is dominated by caricatured views that distort the issue. A reparations study could make the issues of racial inequality and embedded racial disadvantages plain by documenting their origins, entrenchment and present impacts.

In particular, the study can drill into some of the most controversial parts of the reparations debate: its focus on cash payments and its narrative framing that pits citizens against one another. Figures from economists on the cost of a reparations package range as high as $8 trillion to $14 trillion, making the $500 million proposed by presidential candidate Marianne Williamson, the only candidate to explicitly argue for direct cash payments, seem paltry. A study can give voters a real idea of what that figure might look like. And too many Americans believe reparations consists of white Americans alive today being held culpable for slavery and Jim Crow and personally responsible for compensation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell echoed these sentiments in a recent interview, saying “I don't think reparations for something that happened 150 years ago when none of us currently living are responsible is a good idea.” Both of these views are usually followed by technocratic arguments about the amount of money it would take or trying to determine citizen’s eligibility.

The study could address these questions head-on. It would show that reparations are an issue not between white and black Americans, but between the American government and the citizens it didn’t protect from racial violence and political, economic and social disenfranchisement. Because we are a capitalist society that accumulated wealth from the labor of enslaved people, financial penalties as restitution to close today’s racial wealth gap are often the default measures to address the historical wrongs. But we are also a democratic republic, so the study could explore other innovative means of reparations, such as this thought experiment on weighted voting in which African American’ votes are given more value than white votes for a designated period of time.

Because of the ease with which presidential commissions are created and the number of them presidents establish, they are sometimes cast as ineffective, low-cost tools to satisfy political demands without actually delivering policy solutions or reform. But when it comes to matters of civil rights and racial injustice, history demonstrates that American presidents have had to use the powers of the presidency to force the nation to confront its race issues rather than waiting on congressional action.

The two most consequential commissions regarding race relations in the past century are instructive on this point. Lynching and racial violence terrorized black Americans throughout the nation in the early 20th century, yet anti-lynching legislation routinely failed to make it through Congress. Civil rights activists pressed presidents to take action and finally met with some success after Harry Truman ascended to the White House. After hearing details about state and vigilante violence against black Americans, Truman exclaimed, “""My God! I had no idea it was as terrible as that! We've got to do something!"" Three months later, he signed Executive Order 9808, which established the President’s Committee on Civil Rights in 1946 to investigate ways to strengthen civil rights protections. The group published its findings in a report a year later, recommending improved oversight of civil rights protections, anti-lynching measures, improvements in fair employment practices and the abolition of poll taxes. As a result, Truman desegregated the military and federal workforce by executive order, a move that helped ensure his improbable election victory in 1948. (As for anti-lynching legislation, Congress has still not sent a bill to any president’s desk.)

Twenty years after Truman’s Committee finalized its report, President Lyndon Johnson signed Executive Order 11365 creating the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders to analyze the causes behind a rash of race riots across the country. Commonly referred to as the Kerner Commission, it published its report in February 1968 and found that the root of the uprising was black Americans’ lack of economic opportunity. The report did not mince its words, placing fault at the feet of racism and calling for federal housing, jobs and societal desegregation programs. Johnson mostly dismissed the report, but the information moved public opinion. When Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated two months after the report’s release, Johnson signed the Fair Housing Act of 1968 into law.

Of course, the study is just a first step. Any recommendations that come out of such a presidential commission would be nonbinding, subject to the president’s discretion and probably would require legislative action and judicial review before implementation. But given the evolving politics of reparations, a study can set the tone for wherever the debate goes next.

DHS to Move Biometric Data on Hundreds of Millions of People to Amazon Cloud,https://www.nextgov.com,['Jack Corrigan'],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2019/06/dhs-move-biometric-data-hundreds-millions-people-amazon-cloud/157837/,"The Homeland Security Department is looking to upgrade the software it uses to analyze biometric data on hundreds of millions of people around the globe, and it plans to store that information in Amazon’s cloud.

The agency’s Office of Biometric Identity Management will replace its legacy biometric analysis platform, called the Automated Biometric Identification System, or IDENT, with a new, more robust system hosted by Amazon Web Services, according to a request for information released Monday.

IDENT essentially serves as an enterprisewide clearinghouse for troves of biometric and biographic data collected by the Transportation Security Administration, Customs and Border Protection, Secret Service and other Homeland Security components. The system links fingerprint, iris and face data to biographic information, allowing officials to quickly identify suspected terrorists, immigration violators, criminals and anyone else included in their databases.

In total, IDENT contains information on more than 250 million people, a Homeland Security spokesperson told Nextgov.

According to the solicitation, Homeland Security is in the process of replacing IDENT with the Homeland Advanced Recognition Technology System, or HART. The new system will include the same biometric recognition features as its predecessor, and potentially additional tools that could identify individuals based on DNA, palm prints, scars, physical markings and tattoos.

Whereas IDENT stores records in government-run data centers, the Homeland Security solicitation states “HART will reside in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) FedRAMP certified GovCloud.” Further, “biometric matching capabilities for fingerprint, iris, and facial matching will be integrated with HART in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud.” Amazon Web Services will also store HART’s biometric image data.

Amazon Web Services’ GovCloud US-East and US-West regions are data centers specifically built by the company to house some of the government’s most restricted information. AWS is no stranger to hosting sensitive government data, having already claimed the CIA, Defense Department, NASA and other federal agencies as customers in part because of perceived security improvements over government legacy systems.

When reached for comment, an AWS spokesperson referred inquiries to DHS.

In 2018, Northrop Grumman won a $95 million contract to develop the first two stages of the HART system, and its contract is set to expire in 2021. The department plans to use responses to the latest solicitation to inform its strategy for further developing the platform, the DHS spokesperson said.

Specifically, officials are asking vendors for ideas on how to build those multiple identification functions into the new system, while leaving room to add any new recognition “modalities” as they arise. Officials also want input on developing a handful of general reporting, analytics and search tools, as well as desktop and mobile web portals where Homeland Security employees can access the system.

Interested vendors must respond to the request by July 17.

In addition to the hundreds of millions of records stored locally in its IDENT system, Homeland Security can also access swaths of biometric information housed at other agencies.

According to the solicitation, the agency shares biometric data and technology with the Defense Department and the FBI, which can access some 640 million photos for its own facial recognition operations. Officials also said they can tap into the State Department’s Consular Consolidated Database—which contained nearly 500 million passport, visa and expat records as of 2016—as well as the databases of “several foreign governments as well as state, local, tribal and territorial law enforcement agencies.”

The government’s use of biometric technology, particularly facial recognition, has come under sharp scrutiny in recent months. Members of the House Oversight Committee have expressed broad bipartisan support for reining in the use of biometrics at agencies like the FBI, and on Monday, a group of lawmakers raised concerns about CBP’s expanding facial recognition program.

E.P.A. Finalizes Its Plan to Replace Obama-Era Climate Rules,https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/climate/epa-coal-emissions.html,"The new rule, which is expected to come into effect within 30 days, assumes that the forces of the market will guide the country to a future of cleaner energy by naturally phasing out coal over time. It imposes only modest requirements on coal plants.

While it instructs states to reduce emissions, the new measure sets no targets. Instead, it lets states decide how much carbon reduction they consider reasonable and suggests ways to improve efficiency at individual power plants.

Jeffrey R. Holmstead, who served in the E.P.A. during both Bush administrations and now represents utility companies as a lawyer for the firm Bracewell, said he thought the current Supreme Court would be skeptical of any presidential effort to regulate carbon emissions under existing law.

“I t will establish what the E.P.A. can and can’t do,” Mr. Holmstead said of the new Trump rule. “I think it really will tie the hands of future administrations.”

Environmental groups say the Trump rule will slow the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions at a time when scientists warn that countries must rapidly decarbonize to avoid the most severe effects of climate change, including heat waves, extreme storms, droughts and floods.

Mr. Wheeler has said the Trump administration’s plan is legally sound, will not damage the economy and will still go a long way toward reducing carbon .

He maintained that, when the new measure is fully implemented, it will reduce carbon emissions in the power sector by 34 percent below 2005 levels, roughly equal to the goals of the Clean Power Plan."

“DARPA launched three balloons from Cumberland, Maryland, in a flight test for the Adaptable Lighter Than Air Program,” said Heather Babb, spokeswoman for the Department of Defense. “ALTA will demonstrate capability for wind-borne navigation of a lighter-than-air vehicle over extended ranges.”

>> PREVIOUS: What was that bright, white dot hanging over parts of the Miami Valley?

Babb stopped short of confirming that the bright, white dot spotted by numerous News Center 7 viewers was indeed a DARPA balloon, however another spokesperson for DARPA said given the location it was likely one of their balloons.

Sightings of the object were reported Tuesday to News Center 7 from viewers in Xenia, Englewood, West Milton, West Carrollton and Eaton.

DARPA’s ALTA program’s balloons can fly at altitudes of more than 75,000 feet.

“While they do not have independent propulsion, the ALTA vehicle is designed to navigate by changing altitude and thus taking advantage of different wind profiles aloft,” according to DARPA’s website.

DARPA dates back to the launch of Sputnik in 1957 and also has played roles in precision weapons and stealth technology, and other technology advances such as the Internet, automated voice recognition, language transition and GPS.

DARPA is comprised of about 220 government employees in six technical offices, who oversee about 250 research and development programs."

Let’s say you decide to call the White House and weigh in on the issues of the day. Chances are you may be on hold for a while, but when the line finally picks up, you’ll be greeted by a soothing voice to take your comment.

If you are really lucky, you’ll get Operator 16, who is not allowed to give her name. But we’ll let you in on a secret: That’s 99-year-old Louise Griffin, who’s been volunteering at the executive mansion for 26 years.

“Good morning,” she says. “This is the comment line. May I have your comment, please?”

Officially, she’s only supposed to stay on the line with you for two minutes, taking notes that will be passed on to her supervisor and maybe even the Oval Office. Most of the callers these days are phoning in to compliment President Trump.

“Well, most of them love him, so when they call they’re telling you that they really enjoy him,” she says. But sometimes, if a caller is mad about an issue or just annoyed about sitting on hold, Griffin will allow them to go on for more than the allotted time. “If I see that they need help with something, I’ll let them talk longer. And sometimes you can calm people down by helping. I have had them tell me, ‘You have helped me so much, and I am so happy that I got you.’ It’s a huge compliment.”

In a city bitterly divided along partisan lines, Griffin is absolutely nonpolitical and insistently optimistic. She’s worked for four presidents and thinks it’s a privilege to be part of history, whoever is in office.

“You meet different people from all over the world,” she says. “And it was so nice to know and hear what they had to say and how wonderful they thought it was. You know, there’s nothing like being in the White House. Really.”

Griffin was born on Dec. 18, 1919, and has spent her entire life in Washington. The fifth of six children, she grew up in Southwest and decided she was going to be a teacher when she was in fourth grade.

“I loved my elementary school teachers,” she says. “We had penmanship teachers when I was coming along and my teacher would allow me to do her roll book. And I said, ‘Oh, that’s nice of you.’ Ever since I wanted to be a teacher.”

There was a stint working for the Department of the Army during World War II, a few years at Howard University studying for her master’s in education, then a career as a teacher and an assistant principal in D.C. public schools, plus marriage and three kids.

It was, she says, a good life. Retirement, however, was not what she expected. Griffin was — well, let’s just say it — a little bored.

She ran a small catering business, took a calligraphy class at Catholic University, did a lot of puzzles. In 1993, when the Washington Calligraphers Guild announced that the White House needed more volunteers, Griffin raised her hand.

Apart from the West Wing political operatives who get so much media attention and then move on, the White House relies on lifelong employees and unpaid volunteers who do the behind-the-scenes work that ensures the executive mansion remains an American landmark. It’s a calling, more patriotic than partisan, and Griffin was thrilled to be part of it.

She showed up three or four days a week; she was so good that her supervisors vied to keep her in their offices.

Her first assignment was reading mail, not using her gorgeous handwriting. She worked on inaugurations, the annual Christmas tours, Easter Egg Rolls. She addressed greeting cards and other correspondence. The only thing she didn’t enjoy much was taking RSVPs for state dinners, where she discovered a little something about ambitious people.

“Sometimes they will do anything to get what they want,” she explains with just the slightest wrinkle of her nose. “And they’ll argue with you to get what they want.”

Along the way, she met Bill Clinton and George W. Bush but not Barack Obama or — so far — Trump. Because much of the volunteer work involves the East Wing, she has photos with Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama and Melania Trump.

Does she have a favorite president? “I can’t say that I did. I really can’t because I like them all.” Bill Clinton (spoiler alert) was chatty. Loved to talk to everyone. Loved to talk to the volunteers. And especially loved to talk to Griffin.

Eventually, she landed in the call center taking comments and discovered that all those years as a teacher were great preparation for that job.

What happens in the call center stays in the call center. The public comment line (202-456-1111) is staffed by volunteers who are sworn to keep the specific comments private. But most are reacting to current events: “Anything that they hear on the television or things that are happening,” Griffin says. “Mainly, that’s what they’re interested in.”

Before social media made it as easy to tweet at the president, calling was the preferred way for the public to share messages with the commander in chief. But even now, the lines never stop ringing, and people sometimes wait up to 30 minutes to make their feelings known.

Griffin believes it’s important that someone answers those calls: “Those people would not be able to express themselves if the volunteers weren’t answering those telephones.”

On Sept. 11, 2001, Griffin was in the call center at 9 that morning when a woman called.

“She was screaming and crying. I said, ‘I can’t understand what you’re saying.’ And she got herself together. She said, ‘A plane just hit the World Trade building.’ ”

The Secret Service ordered everyone to evacuate; the streets were filled with people trying to get a cell signal. There were rumors a plane was headed for the White House. It is the only sad memory she has of working there.

But Griffin returned the following Monday, a moment captured by a Reuters photographer as President Bush welcomed her and other volunteers back to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.

“He was so happy that we came,” she says. Not every volunteer returned, but Griffin says she wasn’t afraid to go back. She figured it would not happen a second time.

The years have flown by; Griffin gave up some of her duties because they required so much standing. She’s now the oldest volunteer, a title that her colleagues don’t let her forget, and spends every Monday working the phones.

But at home she is surrounded by the White House every day. Official Easter eggs line her mantel and four presidential talking dolls sit in front of the fireplace. The living room desk holds photos of Griffin and the historic figures she has served, and her scrapbooks are filled with White House Christmas cards, programs from state visits and letters from presidents wishing her a “Happy Birthday” — the latest from Trump with his distinctive signature slashed across the bottom.

“I am inspired by the strength and selflessness you have exhibited throughout your life, and I am grateful for your more than 25 years of volunteer service at the White House. Thank you for your tireless dedication to helping ensure that the voices of the American people are heard.”

A lovely sentiment. He may even drop by the call center one of these Mondays."
Treasury bond yields are at the lowest level since 2016. Here's what that means,https://www.cnn.com,"['Anneken Tappe', 'Cnn Business']",06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/20/investing/10-year-treasury-yield/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Yields on the 10-year US Treasury bond fell to a two-and-a-half-year low Thursday morning after the Federal Reserve indicated multiple interest rate cuts could be coming soon.

Bond yields tend to fall when investors sense rate cuts are looming. Bond yields move inversely to prices, so if the price of a bond goes up, the yield goes down.

But Thursday's move is notable, because the last time the 10-year Treasury bond yielded less than 2% was in November 2016.

The Federal Reserve raised interest rates nine times between late 2015 and late 2018, lifting yields on US government debt. The 10-year Treasury yield rose above 3.2% in late 2018.

Since then, bond yields had been trending lower as investors sought safety amid a global economic slowdown.

Paul Manafort leaves the federal courthouse in Washington in 2017. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)

Contributing columnist

Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s legal troubles didn’t end when he was convicted on bank and tax fraud charges in 2018. He’s facing state-level mortgage fraud charges, and because his case is going to trial in New York City, he needed to be transferred between penitentiaries. That is a routine matter and regularly results in the defendant’s transfer to a state penitentiary, here Rikers Island.

But in this case, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen intervened, forwarding to Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. a letter from Manafort’s attorney suggesting that it would not be safe for Manafort to be held on Rikers Island. The result? Manafort will be housed at a federal penitentiary rather than going to Rikers. Should we really care?

Yes we should. If the decision was motivated by politics — and it is very hard to formulate a plausible alternative explanation — it’s an injustice in itself and an indication of rotten goings-on at the Justice Department.

Consider first the magnitude of the favor that the department provided Manafort. Any prisoner would greatly prefer incarceration in either of the two institutions where Manafort will remain to Rikers’ Island, which is a notorious hellhole. (Why Rikers continues to operate at all in its current state is a subject for another column.) Manafort would surely be kept in isolation for his own protection in Rikers, but the difference in the overall conditions at these facilities is enormous.

Now consider how rare it is that Manafort’s request was granted and the role that Rosen, the No. 2 official at the Justice Department, played in facilitating it. It is not simply unusual but unprecedented. I have canvassed colleagues with combined decades of service at the Justice Department, and to a person they aver that they have never heard of a similar situation.

That is not because prisoners don’t ask. It is, in fact, routine to field requests for placement in certain institutions; I did so regularly as a U.S. attorney. The standard-issue response is to let the defendant know that, by law, the decision was for the Federal Bureau of Prisons to make, and that at most, a Justice Department representative could transmit a recommendation.

Finally, consider the reasoning: A spokesman for the Justice Department said the decision was justified by Manafort’s “unique health and safety needs.”

This is bunk of the first order. No doubt Manafort is ill, and no doubt he requires special protection. But are his circumstances unique? Absolutely not. Manafort’s situation is not meaningfully different from dozens of others who are routinely, in fact invariably, resolved many levels below the deputy attorney general and in favor of state incarceration pending state trial.

So we have a one-of-a-kind decision, made at an unprecedented level and justified by fanciful reasoning. Some special factor was obviously at play. It is entirely possible that there were political implications in doing a good deed for Manafort.

It’s not hard to see what those implications might be. Manafort has been the closest thing to a stand-up wise guy in the Trump drama: He managed through squirrelly doublespeak to avoid giving special counsel Robert S. Mueller III the full book on President Trump, and he paid for it in added prison time.

In return, Manafort’s transfer makes it look as though Trump, or Attorney General William P. Barr channeling Trump, is showing him some love with a special favor nobody else ever gets. That’s good for Manafort in the immediate run, and at the same time, it would communicate even more strongly that the way to a pardon is continued noncooperation with federal authorities.

This is all very bad news coming from the Justice Department.

For starters, though we hardly remember this principle because it has been so thoroughly trammeled in the Trump years, it would be a serious breach of protocol if anyone at the White House even communicated with the Justice Department to urge special treatment for Manafort. Any such overture should have been immediately rebuffed.

If that didn’t happen, it would almost be worse because it would mean that the department acted out of subservience to the president’s political goals on its own motion. It is the antithesis of doing justice without fear or favor — rewarding a political ally of the president because he resisted pressure from the Justice Department.

The overall turning of tables could not be more dramatic. Manafort did his best to wriggle out from under the lawful Justice Department investigation of him and the president. Now that same department is acting as his friend, as well as the president’s friend; and friends look out for one another.

That suggests a final lesson from Manafort’s relatively sweet accommodations: Rosen, who was Barr’s handpicked choice, likely comes to the department with a staff that is already integrated with Barr’s. That happens in the case of particularly strong attorneys general. Barr is that, by virtue of his own force of character and his preeminent standing in the Trump universe. As long as Trump is president, Barr enjoys total dominion at the Justice Department. The department’s special treatment of Manafort illustrates why that state of affairs is so worrisome.

Former EPA staffer says Wheeler lied to Congress,https://thehill.com,[],06-20-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/449626-former-epa-staffer-says-wheeler-lied-congress,"A longtime former Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) staffer is accusing Administrator Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerOvernight Energy: Fight over fuel standards intensifies | Democrats grill Trump officials over rule rollback | California official blasts EPA chief over broken talks | Former EPA official says Wheeler lied to Congress Former EPA staffer says Wheeler lied to Congress California official blasts EPA head over car standard negotiations MORE of lying in a letter he wrote to Congress Tuesday that denied agency staff were shut out as EPA developed a controversial rollback on Obama-era fuel standards.

Critics of the rollback have long contended that the EPA sidelined its Office of Transportation and Air Quality when developing the rule. The office is home to the agency’s in-house lab for testing vehicles emissions.

ADVERTISEMENT

Wheeler denied that accusation this week, but Jeff Alson, a former senior policy advisor to that office, said Wheeler is not telling the truth.

“I know that is a lie because I was there. I was one of 20 people at EPA working on this for a decade,” Alson told The Hill. Alson retired in April of last year after working 40 years at the agency.

The issue of sidelined staffers came to a head as lawmakers probed the stalled negotiations between EPA and California, which has long had more stringent standards for vehicle fuel economy and is fighting the EPA rollback.

As lawmakers grilled EPA officials over the failed negotiation, the EPA delivered a letter from Wheeler that blamed California for the standstill.

It also accused the state’s negotiator, California Air Resources Board Chair Mary Nichols, of incorrectly saying the Office of Transportation and Air Quality were shut out of the rulemaking process.

""Her testimony that EPA professional staff were cut out of this proposal's development is false,"" Wheeler wrote.

Alson said the administration has denied pushing aside career staff before, but he found this instance particularly grievous.

“To see it in a formal letter that was given to Congress and to specifically accuse someone else of lying when in reality that person was being truthful and when Administrator Wheeler was the one doing the lying, it just put me beyond the point of no return,” he said.

The EPA said Wheeler's letter speaks for itself.

""Career, professional staff within the Office of Air and Radiation were involved in the development of the proposal and continue to be involved in the final stages as we work with NHTSA to finalize this rule,"" a spokesperson said in an email to The Hill.

A key pillar of former President Obama's environmental legacy involved strengthening fuel emissions standards for cars to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2026. But Trump's rollback would freeze the average fuel economy at 37 mpg.

Alson said his office did have two or three “check the box” meetings with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the other agency involved in drafting the rollback, but he said the agency did not collaborate with his EPA office in developing the standards and would not share any of their information with the EPA.

“NHTSA would say nothing about what they were assuming. They wouldn’t give us a copy of their models, they wouldn’t share their assumptions, they wouldn’t share their projections of how much the standards were going to cost,” he said. “They wouldn’t give us anything.”

When Bill Wehrum, EPA’s head of the Office of Air and Radiation, appeared before the House Energy and Commerce Committee Thursday, several Democrats questioned him about the role of the Office of Transportation and Air Quality.

Rep. Paul Tonko Paul David TonkoOvernight Energy: Fight over fuel standards intensifies | Democrats grill Trump officials over rule rollback | California official blasts EPA chief over broken talks | Former EPA official says Wheeler lied to Congress Former EPA staffer says Wheeler lied to Congress Democrats grill Trump officials over fuel standard rollback MORE (D-N.Y.) pointed a Government Accountability Office report that said, “NHTSA cannot be expected to have the same level of in-house expertise related to vehicle power train design and environmental issues as EPA.”

When Tonko pressed Wehrum on the Office of Air and Radiation’s involvement, Wehrum said their work with NHTSA was a “very powerful combination.”

“EPA has had a substantial amount of involvement,” Wehrum said.

Alson said retirement has freed him to talk in ways his colleagues who still work at the EPA cannot. He has been vocal in his opposition to the rollbacks, including penning an op-ed in The Hill, but said he has held back from addressing inaccuracies from administrator's until now.

“The truth is Mary Nichols is telling the truth and Administrator Wheeler is lying, and it’s shameful and it breaks my heart that the man that heads up the agency where I worked for 40 years and spent my life trying to make the world a little bit better can blatantly lie to the American public.”"

VA chief pressed on efforts to prevent veteran suicides,https://thehill.com,[],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/defense/449444-va-chief-pressed-on-efforts-to-prevent-veteran-suicides,"Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie Robert Leon WilkieOvernight Health Care: Court allows Trump abortion referral ban to take effect | GOP group launches M blitz against 'Medicare for All' | Star GOP lawyer raises constitutional concerns with surprise billing legislation VA chief pressed on efforts to prevent veteran suicides VA bans smoking, vaping at its hospitals MORE told lawmakers his agency is stepping up efforts to prevent veteran suicides during testimony before a Senate panel Wednesday.

Wilkie testified before a Senate Veterans Affairs Committee hearing, where he was pressed on efforts the Trump administration is taking to address what many have called a growing epidemic of suicide among former military servicemembers.

Wilkie said the issue called for a collaborative approach across government.

""Suicide is a national public health issue that affects communities everywhere. Just as there is no single cause of suicide, no single organization can end veteran suicide,"" Wilkie said in his remarks provided to the panel.

""We must work side-by-side with our partners at all levels of government and in the private sector to provide our veterans with the mental health and suicide prevention services they need.""

Wilkie highlighted the problem of firearm-related suicides, which he said accounted for 70 percent of veteran suicides. And he said officials would do more to prevent such deaths.

“The goal is to build time and space between the impulse to harm oneself and the act,” the secretary said.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) pressed Wilkie on that promise.

“The time and space between someone who overdoses on prescription drugs, you have hours,"" Blumenthal said. ""For someone who uses a gun, you have no time.”

Wilkie told the senator he was open to look at legislation that would take guns away from people if a judge deems those individuals a threat.

Wilkie said education was an important aspect as well, noting that more must be done to talk to servicemembers about mental health issues and to train those in the military from the start of basic training to recognize warning signs of mental illness and depression.

“Educating family members is absolutely key in things as simple as gun storage,” he added.

Lawmakers from both parties said officials must do more on suicide prevention.

Isakson asked Franklin about veteran suicide prevention hotlines. Franklin said the help offered over the hotlines had improved and veterans are now able to receive same-day support.

"10-year Treasury yield drops as low as 1.97%, first time below 2% since November 2016",https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/19/us-treasury-yields-tick-higher-as-investors-await-federal-reserve-meeting.html,"A chart showing the U.S. 10-year treasury yield below 2% as of 11:49 p.m. ET Wednesday.

The policymaking committee of the Fed also dropped the word ""patient"" from its statement, a sign interpreted by some investors as a hint that the central bank hasn't abandoned the idea of a rate cut in 2019. The Fed tweaked its statement to acknowledge that inflation is ""running below"" its 2% objective.

Though the central bank maintained the target overnight lending rate , that decision was accompanied by a growing number of officials open to one rate cut by the end of 2019 with eight members in favor. However, the consensus still didn't expect a reduction until 2020 at the earliest.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell below 2% for the first time since November 2016 on Wednesday — breaching a key psychological level — after the Federal Reserve struck a more dovish tone in its June policy statement and Chair Jerome Powell said that the case for easier monetary policy had strengthened.

At around 11:58 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to price, declined below 2% to 1.9821% — around its lowest levels since November 2016. The yield on the 2-year slipped to 1.7209%, its lowest level since 2017. The 3-month Treasury bill yield ticked lower to 2.175%, as of 7:30 p.m. ET.

While stock investors and home buyers may initially cheer the drop in the benchmark for corporate bond and mortgage rates, the return to levels not seen in more than two years raises serious questions about the state of the economy.

Softer economic gauges like May's anemic jobs report — which showed that the U.S. economy added just 75,000 positions — and a lackluster consumer pricing print suggested to economists and fixed-income traders earlier this month that the central bank may have to assure markets of its willingness to step in if GDP growth decelerates.

Speaking to reporters after the central bank meeting, Powell said policymakers are worried about certain economic data and see an improving case for easier policy.

""Overall, our policy discussion focused on the appropriate response to the uncertain environment,"" he said. ""Many participants now see the case for somewhat more accommodative policy has strengthened,"" Powell said.

Traders are now pricing in a more than 80% chance of a rate cut in July and 70% probability of another reduction in September, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.

""It was largely what the market was looking for: I don't think they went too far as to spook the market in any way,"" said Tom Garretson, a fixed-income strategist at RBC. ""Seeing that eight [officials] are seeing a rate cut this year was dovish.""

""This is mostly an inflation story,"" he added. ""If you look at GDP forecast for 2020 they're up to 2% from 1.9% ... even if they were worried about tariffs, it didn't show up in their forecast.""

The Fed has in recent months been grappling with a consistent shortfall in inflation relative to its self-imposed 2% target. The Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, increased 1.6% in the year to April after gaining 1.5% in March.

Treasury inflation-protected securities — bonds whose payouts are indexed to consumer prices — show that price growth expectations have slid in recent months. Inflation is a threat to the value of a bond's fixed coupon and principal payments.

Wednesday's decision from the Federal Open Market Committee came after President Donald Trump's repeated criticism of the Fed and Jerome Powell specifically for raising rates and tightening monetary conditions over the last year. Trump, who sees recent Fed policy as damaging to American markets and undermining his bargaining position in trade talks, has broken with tradition in his frequent and vocal criticism of the central bank.

Asked Tuesday whether he wants to remove Powell as Fed Chair, Trump said ""Let's see what he does."" Trump's comments came after Bloomberg News reported Tuesday morning that the White House had looked into demoting Powell in February.

Trump also said Tuesday he will be having an ""extended meeting"" next week with the Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the G-20 meeting in Japan.

Meanwhile, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said Tuesday that the central bank may need to ease monetary policy in the coming months if inflation doesn't bounce back toward its target.

""In the absence of improvement, such that the sustained return of inflation to our aim is threatened, additional stimulus will be required,"" Draghi said.

"State Department identifies 23 violations, 'multiple security incidents' concerning Clinton emails",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hillary-clinton-emails-state-department-violations-security-incidents,"The State Department revealed Monday that it has identified ""multiple security incidents"" involving current or former employees' handling of Hillary Clinton's emails, and that 23 ""violations"" and seven ""infractions"" have been issued as part of the department's ongoing investigation.

The information came in a letter to Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, who is responsible for overseeing the security review.

""To this point, the Department has assessed culpability to 15 individuals, some of whom were culpable in multiple security incidents,"" Mary Elizabeth Taylor, the State Department's Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of Legislative Affairs, wrote to Grassley. ""DS has issued 23 violations and 7 infractions incidents. ... This number will likely change as the review progresses.""

ATTEMPT TO HACK CLINTON EMAILS STUNNED AIDES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, DOCS SHOW

President Trump highlighted the finding in a tweet overnight, questioning whether Democrats would investigate and saying, ""This is really big.""

The State Department, calling the matter ""serious,"" said it expected to conclude the investigation by Sept. 1. The department acknowledged that the probe was unusually time-consuming.

""Given the volume of emails provided to the Department from former Secretary Clinton's private email server, the Department's process has been necessarily more complicated and complex requiring a significant dedication of time and resources,"" Taylor wrote.

Taylor also noted that disciplinary consequences were pending.

""In every instance in which the Department found an individual to be culpable of a valid security violation or three or more infractions, the Department forwarded the outcome to the Bureau of Diplomatic Security's Office of Personnel Security and Suitability (DS/PSS), to be placed in the individuals' official security file,"" Taylor wrote. ""All valid security incidents are reviewed by DS and taken into account every time an individual's eligibility for access to classified information is considered.

""This referral occurred whether or not the individual was currently employed with the Department of State and such security files are kept indefinitely,"" Taylor added. ""Consistent with the referral policy, for individuals who were still employed with the Department at the time of adjudication, the Department referred all valid security violations or multiple infractions to the Bureau of Human Resources.""

The State Department declined to release the names of the employees, consistent with its procedures. The department promised another update once its review is completed.

NEWLY RELEASED EMAILS SHOW CLINTON TEAM DISCUSSING 'PRIVATE' COMMS CHANNEL WITH ISRAEL

Clinton's private email use has remained in the spotlight, as the DOJ looks into potential misconduct in the handling of federal authorities' surveillance and intelligence operations in 2016. Then-FBI Director James Comey said in 2016 that Clinton's handling of classified information was ""extremely careless"" -- remarks that were watered down from their original draft -- but that ""no reasonable prosecutor"" would bring charges.

It emerged earlier this year that then-FBI general counsel James Baker testified that he thought Clinton should have been prosecuted until he was convinced otherwise ""pretty late"" in the investigation.

And, last month, a trove of partially redacted FBI documents from the agency's investigation into whether Clinton mishandled classified information -- a probe known as the ""Midyear Exam"" -- revealed that top Clinton aides were shocked at apparent attempts to hack her private email servers.

The document release revealed numerous episodes in which the Clinton team either suspected it had been hacked or seemingly acknowledged that security measures had come up short.

""omg,"" top Clinton aide Huma Abedin wrote to Justin Cooper, the technology pro overseeing Clinton's private home-based email servers, when he told her shortly after midnight on Jan. 9, 2011, that ""someone was trying to hack us.""

And in March, it was revealed that the Justice Department ""negotiated"" an agreement with Clinton's legal team that ensured the FBI did not have access to emails on her private servers relating to the Clinton Foundation. Former FBI Agent Peter Strzok testified about the arrangement during a closed-door appearance before the House Judiciary Committee last summer, according to a transcript released this year.

""A significant filter team"" was employed at the FBI, Strzok said, to ""work through the various terms of the various consent agreements."" Limitations imposed on agents' searches included date ranges and names of domains and people, Strzok said, among other categories.

The agreement was reached, Strzok said, because ""according to the attorneys, we lacked probable cause to get a search warrant for those servers and projected that either it would take a very long time and/or it would be impossible to get to the point where we could obtain probable cause to get a warrant.""

Former Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who chaired the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee until 2017 and is now a Fox News contributor, said the arrangement signaled that agents wanted willful blindness.

""What's bizarre about this, is in any other situation, there's no possible way they would allow the potential perpetrator to self-select what the FBI gets to see,"" Chaffetz said, noting that the FBI was aware that the servers contained classified information in unclassified settings. ""The FBI should be the one to sort through those emails -- not the Clinton attorneys.""

The DOJ's goal, Chaffetz said, was to ""make sure they hear no evil, see no evil -- they had no interest in pursuing the truth."""
Homeland Security: We've tested Windows BlueKeep attack and it works so patch now,https://www.zdnet.com,['Liam Tung'],,,,https://www.zdnet.com/article/homeland-security-weve-tested-windows-bluekeep-attack-and-it-works-so-patch-now/,"A single actor is scanning Windows systems vulnerable to the BlueKeep flaw A threat actor hidden behind Tor nodes is scanning for Windows systems vulnerable to BlueKeep flaw. Read more: https://zd.net/2JWjK73

The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) cybercrime emergency response team is warning Windows admins to patch the wormable BlueKeep flaw, after confirming it can be used to remotely execute code on vulnerable PCs.

The US government's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has raised the official alert over a potentially devastating flaw that affects the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) service in multiple versions of Windows, from Windows 2000 to Windows 2008.

Microsoft considered CVE-2019-0708, now known as BlueKeep, so severe that it even released a patch for unsupported Windows XP – a measure it hadn't taken since WannaCry wreaked havoc across the globe in mid-2017.

SEE: Cybersecurity in an IoT and mobile world (ZDNet special report) | Download the report as a PDF (TechRepublic)

The bug was reported to Microsoft ahead of its May Patch Tuesday update by the UK's National Cyber Security Centre, the organization under UK spy agency GCHQ tasked with improving the nation's cybersecurity defenses in the public and private sector.

Microsoft released patches for XP because it believed BlueKeep's worm capabilities – the ability to automatically spread from one vulnerable machine to another – could be exploited in an attack on the same global scale as WannaCry, whose worm capabilities were enabled by EternalBlue, the leaked NSA exploit for the SMBv1 file-sharing protocol.

The NSA is also worried about BlueKeep. Earlier this month it urged admins to patch the flaw and change configurations to prevent potential attacks. Its warning followed research that found that at least one million Windows computers were still vulnerable to BlueKeep. The NSA said it was ""likely only a matter of time"" before attacks emerged.

Currently there's no publicly available exploit code for BlueKeep. However, several organizations claim to have developed exploits for it, including Zerodium, McAfee, Kaspersky, Check Point, MalwareTech, and Valthek.

CISA on Monday confirmed it has successfully exploited BlueKeep on a Windows 2000 PC. The agency has not tested other affected versions of Windows.

""CISA tested BlueKeep against a Windows 2000 machine and achieved remote code execution. Windows OS versions prior to Windows 8 that are not mentioned in this Activity Alert may also be affected; however, CISA has not tested these systems,"" it said.

However, CISA has since stepped back from that claim and replaced its original statement with: ""CISA has coordinated with external stakeholders and determined that Windows 2000 is vulnerable to BlueKeep.""

Nonetheless, its advice, like the NSA's and Microsoft's, remains the same: apply Microsoft's May fixes for the RDP BlueKeep bug. Similarly, it recommends enabling Network Level Authentication (NLA), which would shield organizations from any forthcoming BlueKeep attacks. And it suggests blocking TCP port 3389, which is used to start an RDP session.

Should a public BlueKeep exploit emerge or nation-state hackers develop one privately and decide to use it, the potential impact could be very different to WannaCry.

That malware heavily damaged organizations in Europe, most notably the UK's National Health Service (NHS), which faced a $125m WannaCry bill, was forced to cancel 19,000 appointments, and then spent £500,000 on contractors to restore data in the wake of the attack.

Security firm BitSight ran an internet scan in mid-June for systems vulnerable to BlueKeep. It too found about a million vulnerable machines, but the exposure to BlueKeep is greatest in China, where less than 50 percent of machines have been patched.

China by far has the most machines in the world that are vulnerable to BlueKeep, amounting to about a third of the million vulnerable machines. It is followed by the US, but more than 75 percent of US machines have been patched.

It seems Europe has learned its lessons from WannaCry and the subsequent EternalBlue-powered NotPetya outbreak. The UK, Netherlands, Germany, France, have all patched over 75 percent of systems with exposed RDP hosts.

Countries in the same bracket as China, with less than 50 percent of machines patched, include South Korea and Hong Kong, while the patch rate in Russia, India, Brazil, and Italy sits between 50 percent and 75 percent.

The VA is improving because it's using more private healthcare,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/the-va-is-improving-because-its-using-more-private-healthcare,"Recently, the battle over the future of veterans healthcare increased in intensity because arguably the two most prominent politicians in the country weighed in on the issue, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and President Trump.

At a town hall in April, Ocasio-Cortez criticized the Trump administration’s efforts to expand healthcare choice for veterans through the Department of Veterans Affairs and said in regards to the VA that “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” It isn’t surprising that Ocasio-Cortez would vigorously defend the VA while attacking reforms meant to give veterans more private healthcare options. Many of her ideological partners, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., consider the VA a model government-run healthcare system and a positive example of “socialism in action.”

A week later, Trump responded to Ocasio-Cortez with a tweet that seemingly agreed with her assertion that the VA is performing well. Underlying his tweet was the implication that the uptick in performance is due to legislation he signed into law that increased choice for veterans and accountability for VA employees — bills Ocasio-Cortez and her allies have criticized.

This exchange between the president and AOC predictably set off a debate about who was right and who was wrong about the VA. Unfortunately, in a world of 280-character tweets and cable news segments that are clipped and shared without context, it is difficult to convey a nuanced position about any public policy issue, including the future of the VA. The reality is the VA is neither completely fixed nor completely broken but is instead an institution at a crossroads with an opportunity to break the cycle of reform and failure that has plagued it since its inception. This is especially true with the recent launch of the Veterans Community Care Program which, if properly implemented, will substantially increase healthcare freedom for veterans through the VA and improve access to medical services.

Even as someone who has been highly critical of the agency for years, I have to admit the VA has made some improvement since the deadly 2014 waitlist scandal.

Between 2014 and 2017, according to a study by the JAMA network, wait times across the VA have generally gone down. However, this decrease occurred while the VA increased the number of private sector appointments by over 50%, demonstrating better use of non-VA providers and the introduction of the albeit imperfect Veterans Choice Program helped improve wait times for veterans.

Despite this good news, the VA still faces many systemic issues that need to be dealt with. Too many VA hospitals are delivering sub-standard care and hundreds of thousands of veterans are still waiting long periods of time for appointments. Additionally, most of the VA’s healthcare facilities are over 50 years old, meaning not only are the buildings increasingly aged but they are not in locations best suited to serve the more dispersed veterans population of the future.

The VA MISSION Act, signed into law last year by Trump, was designed to address these issues. Over the next few years the VA will continue implementing the law, and it faces its first major test with the rollout of the Veterans Community Care Program.

It is critical for the future of veterans healthcare that the VA properly implement all the major components of the VA MISSION Act. Failure to do so will undermine the Trump administration’s VA reform agenda and compromise healthcare for millions of veterans. In addition, any attempts to roll back the VA MISSION Act by members of Congress who oppose giving veterans more healthcare choice — like Ocasio-Cortez — should be strongly resisted.

Finally, as more veterans get care from outside of the VA, elected officials at the state and federal levels must explore ways to eliminate barriers standing in the way of veterans making full use of their new private sector healthcare options. Critical reforms include expanded use of telehealth (as Virginia did) and repealing certificate-of-need laws (as Florida did this year). These and other patient-centered reforms, expand access to health care for both veterans and non-veterans while encouraging innovation.

The VA has improved since 2014, but challenges remain. We all want veterans to get the care they need and deserve. To achieve that, everyone needs to acknowledge that VA healthcare still needs some major improvements and to commit ourselves to ensuring the necessary reforms are made.

DOJ makes rare intervention to prevent Rikers Island transfer for Paul Manafort,https://abc13.com,[],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://abc13.com/doj-makes-rare-intervention-to-prevent-rikers-island-transfer-for-paul-manafort/5351816/,"President Donald Trump 's f ormer campaign chairman, Paul Manafort , has been spared from an expected transfer to Rikers Island jail in New York following a rare intervention by the Department of Justice, a DOJ official confirmed to ABC News.Trump has previously complained about how Manafort was being treated and has suggested he might pardon him.Manafort, 70, who is currently serving out a federal prison sentence in Pennsylvania , was expected to be transferred to the infamous Rikers complex as he waited to face mortgage fraud and other state charges brought by the Manhattan District Attorney's office.But in a statement to ABC News Monday evening, a senior DOJ official acknowledged that the department stepped in to the dispute last week after Manafort's attorneys raised concerns ""related to his health and personal safety."" During his federal trial, Manafort's physical condition appeared to be deteriorating and at times during hearings he had to use to a wheelchair or a cane.The New York Times reported Monday that among the DOJ officials to get directly involved was Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, who was confirmed to his position as the department's number 2-ranked official last month.""Mr. Manafort's attorneys proposed that he remain in federal custody and be made available to the state when necessary,"" the official said. ""The Department requested the views of New York prosecutors, who did not object to Mr. Manafort's proposal. In light of New York's position, and Mr. Manafort's unique health and safety needs, the Department decided to err on the side of caution by keeping Mr. Manafort in federal custody during the pendency of his state proceedings.""Manafort has since been transferred to the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Lower Manhattan ahead of his expected arraignment on the state charges.His attorneys did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABC News.Several former Obama-era federal prosecutors raised issue with the high-level DOJ intervention, noting it ran counter to typical rules governing detention for federal inmates facing state charges in New York.President Trump has repeatedly expressed his objections to the treatment of Manafort by federal prosecutors in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.After the Manhattan District Attorney announced separate state charges against Manafort in March of this year, Trump reacted telling reporters, ""on a human basis, it's a very sad thing.""The White House did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment on the DOJ decision."
U.S. has no plans to cap H-1B work visa program: State Department,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-india-visas/us-has-no-plans-to-cap-h-1b-work-visa-program-state-department-idUSKCN1TL2VL,"FILE PHOTO: A man holds flags of India and the U.S. while people take part in the 35th India Day Parade in New York, U.S. August 16, 2015.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration has no plans to cap H-1B work visas for nations that force foreign companies to store data locally, the State Department said on Thursday.

Reuters reported on Wednesday that the United States had told India it was considering restricting the H-1B visa programs for countries with the data storage requirement. The H-1B program issues U.S. visas to skilled foreign workers.

“The Trump Administration has no plans to place caps on H-1B work visas for nations that force foreign companies to store data locally,” a State Department spokeswoman said in a statement in response to the Reuters article.

While an administration’s “Buy American Hire American” executive order calls for a broad review of U.S. worker visa programs, including the H-1B program, it was not targeted at a specific country, the spokeswoman said.

It is “completely separate from our ongoing discussions with India about the importance of ensuring the free flow of data across borders,” the spokeswoman added.

Earlier on Thursday, India said it was in talks with the United States on H-1B visas, but foreign ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar told a news conference: “We have not heard anything officially from the U.S. government” on capping such permits for Indians.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is scheduled to visit New Delhi next week for talks that will include areas of disagreement between the two countries over trade.

Two senior Indian officials told Reuters on Wednesday they had been briefed last week on a U.S. plan to cap the number of H-1B visas given annually to Indians at between 10% and 15% of the total number issued.

There is no country-specific limit on the 85,000 H-1B work visas the United States issues every year, and an estimated 70% of them go to Indians."
USDA moves prevent plant harvest date to September 1st,https://www.ksfy.com,['Sam Wright'],,,,https://www.ksfy.com/content/news/USDA-Moves-prevent-plant-harvest-date-to-September-1st-511606771.html,"This year has been historically tough for South Dakota's AG industry thanks to above normal precipitation, but the USDA adjusted a federal aid package announced by President Trump a month ago which required farmers to plant cover crop on prevent plant acres by November first. It initially received mixed criticism because South Dakota is notorious for unpredictable, and usually harsh weather. Dave Poppens works with beans, corn, has a feed lot, and knows the natural challenge he is tasked with overcoming every year; which is why a change in dates helps level the playing field with states in more manageable climates.

""November we could have a foot of snow on the ground, so it makes a big difference in this part of the country,"" Poppens said.

The move has received support from many of South Dakota’s state leaders including Governor Kristi Noem, Congressman Dusty Johnson, and Senator John Thune.

""I have been advocating for this common sense change for months. You don't have to talk to more than two producers in South Dakota that waiting until November the first to allow them to either graze or mechanically harvest cover crops without an indemnity reduction on their prevent acres is far too late,” Senator Thune said.

There is another component of this, producers will also have the flexibility to allow cattle to graze on cover crop areas. The wet season has diminished forage options for a lot of operations.

""Now you can plan on things,” said South Dakota Cattlemen’s Association president Steve Ollerich.

“You can't plan for November first. We could have a blizzard October 10 or 15 and it'd be all covered up with snow.""

Vaccine Investigators Use Bacterium's Own Protein Against It : USDA ARS,https://www.ars.usda.gov,[],,,,https://www.ars.usda.gov/news-events/news/research-news/2019/vaccine-investigators-use-bacteriums-own-protein-against-it/,"A cow naturally infected with M. avium subspecies paratuberculosis that is in the late stages of disease and has typical clinical signs such as weight loss, watery diarrhea, and general poor health. This cow is part of a study herd used in research on Johne’s disease at the National Animal Disease Center, Ames, Iowa.

Vaccine Investigators Use Bacterium's Own Protein Against It

By Jan Suszkiw

June 21, 2019

A team of Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and university scientists is investigating a new “ingredient” for use in vaccinating cattle against Johne’s disease, a chronic wasting affliction that costs the U.S. dairy industry more than $200 million per year.

The ingredient in question is a type of protein on the surface of the bacterium Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP), which causes Johne’s disease.

The researchers found that the protein, dubbed 35 kDa membrane peptide, helps the bacterium invade epithelial cells lining the cow's small intestine, thickening it and blocking the uptake of nutrients from feed or forage. This can lead to diarrhea, weight loss, diminished milk production and sometimes death. Calves are especially vulnerable and if their mothers are infected, they can acquire the bacterium from the colostrum of their mothers. Adult animals typically become infected after grazing on forage or pasture areas where MAP has been excreted or ""shed"" in feces.

Vaccinating the animals with dead MAP cells can prevent such fecal shedding; however, this process can also generate misleading results called false-positives when vaccinated cattle are tested for bovine tuberculosis, a disease caused by a close relative of the bacterium.

An alternative approach could come from vaccinating the animals with specific pieces of MAP rather than using the entire bacterium, notes John Bannantine, a microbiologist with the ARS National Animal Disease Center in Ames, Iowa.

Toward that end, he and colleagues from Washington State University and Inje University in Gimhae, South Korea, devised a new laboratory procedure called an ex vivo bacterium viability assay. Using it, they evaluated the peptide's potential as a vaccine through its ability to mobilize certain immune system cells in blood samples drawn from infected cattle rather than using the animals themselves.

The results, among others reported in the May 2019 issue of Vaccine, showed that the peptide helps prime immune cells called cytotoxic CD8 T cells to seek out infected cells and kill MAP bacteria present within them. There is no haven from cytotoxic T cells, adds Bannantine, with the ARS center's Infectious Bacterial Diseases Research Unit.

Upcoming studies will focus on ways to formulate and deliver the peptide. Once there is a successful formulation, they will conduct cattle vaccine trials. Ultimately, the research could open the door to a new way of preventing Johne's disease without interference with bovine tuberculosis tests.

Trump Fires Back at Iran But Downplays the Likelihood of War,https://www.usnews.com,[],06-20-2019,2019,6,https://www.usnews.com/news/world-report/articles/2019-06-20/trump-fires-back-at-iran-but-downplays-the-likelihood-of-war,"President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the Oval Office of the White House, June 20, 2019, in Washington, DC. (Evan Vucci/AP)

President Donald Trump on Thursday condemned Iran's downing of a U.S. drone over international waters while also indicating he is not interested in starting another Middle East War.

""Iran made a mistake,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""A very big mistake.""

Asked repeatedly if and how the U.S. might respond, Trump was coy.

""You'll find out,"" he said on several occasions.

The president said the situation would have been gravely different if Iran had struck a manned aircraft – something Pentagon and State Department officials have warned in recent days would necessitate a retaliatory strike from the U.S. military.

Trump also appeared to distance the incident from Iran's political leadership, saying that shooting down the unarmed Navy RQ-4 Global Hawk surveillance drone incident might have been ""a mistake.""

""I have a feeling that it was a mistake made by somebody who shouldn't be doing what they did,"" Trump said. ""I think that somebody under the command of that country made a big mistake""

""I find it hard to believe it was intentional,"" he added. ""I think it could have been somebody who was loose and stupid that did it.""

Other officials have questioned whether any element in Iran except for its top leadership makes decisions of such consequence. The Pentagon's No. 2 officer told reporters on Tuesday – after the U.S. accused Iran of attacking two cargo ships near the Strait of Hormuz – that the structure of Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps is too hierarchical for lower-level officials to act on their own.

""Almost all of the decisions are driven to their senior commanders, specifically Qassem Soleimani,"" Air Force Gen. Paul Selva, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a small group of reporters, referencing the shadowy commander of the IRGC's zealous overseas arm known as the Quds Force. ""It's hard to believe, given the persistence of what's going on, that he's not aware and involved in the decision-making and that he isn't consulting with senior leaders in Iran.""

Trump on Thursday dismissed speculation that the attack on the American drone would force the U.S. to escalate militarily. And he denied reports that notable Iran hawks within his administration – national security adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo – are pushing for war.

""In many cases, it's the opposite,"" Trump said. ""I want to get out of endless wars.""

""This is a new wrinkle, this is a new fly in the ointment, what happened, shooting down the drone. And this country will not stand for it.""

During Trump's remarks, the Pentagon released new details of the incident. Lt. Gen. Joseph Guastella, commander of U.S. air forces in the Middle East, called it a ""dangerous and escalatory attack"" that risked ""possibly endangering innocent civilians."" The surface-to-air missile that shot down the drone launched from Goruk in southern Iran and struck the aircraft while it was in international airspace more than 20 miles from the Iranian coast. It fell into international waters, Guuastella said in a statement.

Trump's top allies on Capitol Hill offered a harsher assessment but still hesitated to say the U.S. is on an irreversible war path.

""They're trying to break our will, intimidate us,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham said. The South Carolina Republican and member of the influential Senate Armed Services Committee has become one of Trump's closest advisers on foreign affairs, particularly to do with Iran.

""If they're itching for a fight, they're going to get one,"" Graham told reporters. When asked about the likelihood of war, he said, ""we're a lot closer today than we were yesterday. And only God knows what tomorrow's going to bring."""

Yields moved off their lows later Tuesday morning after President Donald Trump tweeted that he will be meeting with China's Xi Jinping at the G-20 summit next week.

By 4:30 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note had fallen to 2.056%, off a 20-month low of 2.016% hit earlier in the session. The yield on the 2-year Treasury note rose to 1.864% while the rate on the 3-month bill hovered at 2.226%.

While the Fed is expected to leave the key interest rates unchanged in its June meeting, many expect the Chair Jerome Powell to telegraph easier monetary policy ahead during Wednesday's press conference. His comments at 2:30 p.m. ET will follow the release of the central bank's decision at 2 p.m.

Softer economic gauges like May's anemic jobs report and a lackluster consumer pricing print convinced many economists and fixed-income traders earlier this month that the central bank will hint at its ability to lower borrowing costs if needed.

""I think they should cut rates, and I think the discussion should instead be whether to cut 25 basis points or 50 basis points,"" said Jim Bianco, head of the Chicago-based advisory firm Bianco Research. ""But they'll probably do what they usually do, which is wait until it's too late.""

""The market has been very vocal of its pricing of expected inflation,"" he added. ""The only thing transitory is Powell's use of the word 'transitory,'"" he said, referring to the Fed chair's characterization of sluggish inflation as a temporary blip.

""We say in our statement of longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy that the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below 2%,"" Powell said last month.

""And in this case, as we look at these readings in the first quarter for core, we do see good reasons to think that some were or all of the unexpected decrease may wind up being transient,"" he added.

Traders are now pricing in a more than 80% chance of a rate cut in July and 70% probability of another reduction in September, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.

Meanwhile, ECB President Draghi said Tuesday that the central bank may need to ease monetary policy again over the coming months, possibly through new rate cuts or asset purchases, if inflation doesn't bounce back toward its target.

""In the absence of improvement, such that the sustained return of inflation to our aim is threatened, additional stimulus will be required,"" Draghi said.

The central bank foresees ""lingering softness"" on the horizon, exacerbated by geopolitical factors and trade disputes that have dampened exports and softened manufacturing."

Investigators are looking into why the bank didn’t file alerts, known as Suspicious Activity Reports, even though compliance employees had prepared them, according to the report.

DOJ investigators are relying on information provided by Tammy McFadden, a whistleblower who helped prepare the reports. They have been talking to Val Broeksmit, the son of a banker who oversaw a unit of the bank that’s been troubled by money-laundering violations since before the 2016 Kushner transaction.

Columnist

The State Department official in charge of U.S. arms control negotiations with Moscow and her husband had a years-long friendship with GOP operative Paul Erickson, the former boyfriend of convicted unregistered Russian agent Maria Butina — ties this official did not disclose to her superiors or to Congress during her confirmation process in the spring of 2018.

Erickson officiated the June 2017 wedding of Andrea Thompson, the undersecretary of state for arms control and international security affairs, and David Gillian, a former senior Australian army officer, three administration officials and Erickson’s lawyer have confirmed. At the time, Thompson was serving as national security adviser to Vice President Pence. Four months before the wedding, Gillian had transferred Erickson $100,000, which federal officials allege Erickson stole from Gillian, FBI and court documents show. Thompson never disclosed these ties to her superiors until approached this week by this columnist, the three administration officials said.

The wedding took place about six months before Erickson and Butina were publicly identified as being connected to Russian influence operations inside the United States. But by the time of Thompson’s confirmation, allegations of the couple’s influence activities had been widely reported.

Sen. Robert Menendez (N.J.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told me that his panel will investigate Thompson’s lack of disclosure to both Congress and the FBI.

“These reports about Under Secretary Thompson raise questions about how forthcoming she was with all relevant information during her confirmation process,” Menendez said. “I hope that any relevant connections implicating financial interests, or to someone who our government has charged with being an agent of a foreign power, would have been fully reviewed and vetted by the FBI during the security clearance process, and disclosed to the Foreign Relations Committee. It is not clear that happened.”

Thompson’s failure to disclose her contacts and her husband’s business dealings with Erickson is viewed inside the administration as a serious lack of judgment — considering that her former boss, then-national security adviser Michael Flynn, was fired for lying about his contacts with Russian officials.

Several administration officials told me Thompson should have disclosed these connections voluntarily, since she holds top security clearances and has worked for decades as a U.S. intelligence officer. Her failure to report this information, these officials suggested, represented an intelligence vulnerability that could have been used against her.

“When the person who marries you gets into trouble with the Russians and your job is to negotiate with the Russians, you have to disclose that,” a senior administration official told me. “Everybody with an intelligence clearance knows that.”

Butina attended the Thompson-Gillian wedding in South Dakota as Erickson’s guest, according to Erickson’s lawyer, William Hurd. Butina did not have significant interactions with either Thompson or Gillian at the wedding, beyond greetings and congratulations, Hurd told me.

“Paul Erickson had known Andrea Thompson and David Gillian for years. He considered them both friends and agreed to officiate at their wedding in 2017,” Hurd told me. “Maria Butina came to the wedding because Paul Erickson was dating her. If Paul had been dating a different woman, then that woman would have come to the wedding.”

The State Department declined to comment on the record. Thompson, through a State Department spokesperson, also declined to comment. Butina’s lawyer declined to comment. Gillian and the McChrystal Group, the consulting firm where he now works, did not respond to requests for comment.

As a career intelligence officer, Thompson would have been required under updated executive branch regulations to self-report any significant unofficial contacts with a foreign national or any attempt by a foreign national to gain influence.

There is no evidence to suggest Thompson or Gillian had significant interactions with Butina outside the wedding, either. Sources close to Thompson told me that Erickson had known the Thompson family for many years in South Dakota.

Thompson is not alleged to have been involved in her husband’s business dealings with Erickson. Additionally, there is no evidence Thompson was deliberately untruthful to her bosses, federal investigators or congressional officials during her vetting or confirmation process, which took place from late 2017 until her confirmation on April 26, 2018.

In December 2017, after Thompson had left the vice president’s office and was working at the State Department before being nominated for her current role, the New York Times revealed that Erickson had emailed top Trump campaign officials in May 2016 offering to set up a high-level back channel with the Russian government led by President Vladimir Putin.

Under the subject line “Kremlin Connection,” Erickson proposed that Trump could “make first contact” with “President Putin’s emissary” at an upcoming event hosted by the National Rifle Association, of which Erickson was a long-time member. The planned meeting did not take place, according to the Times.

But according to federal prosecutors, this was just one of a series of actions Erickson took in cooperation with Butina to make connections in Republican political circles and set up meetings for Alexander Torshin, who was then a deputy governor of the Russian central bank.

In July 2018, the Justice Department unveiled a criminal complaint against Butina, charging her with “conspiracy to act as an agent of the Russian Federation within the United States without prior notification to the Attorney General.” In an accompanying affidavit, the FBI claimed that ""U.S. Person 1,"" whom several reports have identified as Erickson, worked closely with Butina to build her influence inside the United States and “advance the interests of the Russian Federation.”

The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has opened an investigation into Butina, Torshin and their activities inside the United States. The FBI is also reportedly investigating whether Torshin helped funnel Russian money through the NRA to help the Trump campaign.

Erickson has never been charged with any crime related to Butina, Torshin or the NRA. In February, he was indicted in a seemingly unrelated matter, accused by federal prosecutors of defrauding dozens of investors related to a plan to build retirement facilities and housing for oil workers in North Dakota. According to an April 2018 FBI affidavit in that case, one of Erickson’s last investors was Gillian.

“Erickson told David Gillian he would receive a return of between 25 percent and 75 percent within approximately one year,” the affidavit alleges.

“In reality, the bank records indicated that Gillian’s $100,000 was not invested in real estate or anything else,” the affidavit continues. “In fact, that money was used to pay routine expenses and to pay off a previous investor, Congressman Marshall Sanford. Some of Gillian’s money went to Erickson’s girlfriend, Maria Butina.”

The criminal complaint against Erickson alleges he wired more than $20,000 to American University, where Butina was studying, three months after taking Gillian’s money. Gillian is now suing Erickson in civil court in South Dakota regarding the investment. Hurd, Erickson’s lawyer, has previously called the fraud charges against Erickson “unfounded.”

To be clear, Thompson’s connections with Erickson are not a crime and Erickson is innocent until proven guilty. Gillian is not accused of wrongdoing and is allegedly a victim of Erickson.

Rep. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said Thompson’s situation was symptomatic of larger staffing issues plaguing the Trump administration.

“From clumsy vetting to chronic failure to fill vacant positions, it’s no wonder there’s such dysfunction in the executive branch,” Engel said. “The White House needs to get its act together to make sure the officials in charge of protecting our national security meet the highest standards and comply fully with all laws and regulations on disclosure.”

Critics say Interior's top lawyer came 'close to perjury' during Hill testimony,https://thehill.com,[],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/449176-critics-say-interior-top-lawyer-came-close-to-perjury-during,"A green group is requesting an investigation of the Department of the Interior’s top lawyer, arguing he downplayed his role in the department’s controversial public records review process while testifying in May.

Daniel Jorjani, the principal deputy solicitor at Interior, told senators he did not regularly review documents requested through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) before their release.

But a batch of documents released through a public records request from EarthJustice shows the confusion that stemmed from the policy and how Jorjani was involved in processing the requests.

“He misled Congress and stepped very close to perjury,” said Aaron Weiss, deputy director at the Center for Western Priorities, arguing that Jorjani held back information from lawmakers who inquired about the public record process.

Interior has long been criticized for its policy of allowing political appointees to review FOIA requests about them or their work before being released to reporters and other requesters, including environmental groups.

In addition to his role in the solicitor’s office, Jorjani is also the department’s chief FOIA officer and employees were directed to copy him in their discussions of public records requests.

“It doesn’t pass the smell test to ask him to be sent all these things so he can not look at them,” Weiss said. “There’s clear documentation showing he has been looped in the entire time, so you can't deny that to the Senate in writing -- that’s just lying.”

Jorjani was recently nominated to be the solicitor for Interior, a post that has remained vacant under the Trump administration. Several Democrats have said they will not support his nomination in part because of his lack of response to questions on Interior’s public records policy.

“The Interior Department under President Trump Donald John TrumpAOC is the Trump-era hero we need Nadler apologized after repeatedly calling Hope Hicks 'Ms. Lewandowski' at hearing Trump confirms US was 'cocked and loaded' for Iran strike MORE has treated information as a political weapon, regardless of what our laws require or what democracy demands of its leaders,” said Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-A.Z.) chair of the House Natural Resources, said in a statement. “[Interior’s] top lawyer shouldn’t sign off on it.”

Molly Block, a department spokeswoman, said “the process ensures that matters of concern to Department leadership are flagged for awareness. This also allows a FOIA officer to receive contextual information in order to help them better apply the relevant legal standards.”

EarthJustice requested an investigation of Interior’s public records review process from the department's Office of Inspector General (OIG), arguing it imposes barriers and delays in getting information.

Records requested by EarthJustice and included in their complaint to the OIG also answer other questions Jorjani didn’t answer in his testimony to Congress.

Sen. Ron Wyden Ronald (Ron) Lee WydenOvernight Defense: House passes T spending package with defense funds | Senate set to vote on blocking Saudi arms sales | UN nominee defends climate change record Grassley announces opposition to key Trump proposal to lower drug prices Exclusive: Trump administration delayed releasing documents related to Yellowstone superintendent's firing MORE (D-Ore.) pressed Jorjani to disclose how many times Interior’s record review process caused the department to miss litigation deadlines.

In a written response to Wyden, Jorjani said he could not comment on individual litigation matters.

But a review of documents released to EarthJustice suggests there are at least three instances where Interior did not meet court deadlines because they were waiting for political appointees to review FOIA requests.

In a meeting in late May to discuss Jorjani’s nomination, Senate Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Joe Manchin Joseph (Joe) ManchinCritics say Interior's top lawyer came 'close to perjury' during Hill testimony The Hill's 12:30 Report — Presented by MAPRx — Trump takes heat for remarks on help from foreign governments The Hill's Morning Report - Trump and House Democrats resume battle MORE (D-W.V.) said Wyden’s questions “lacked the response it deserved” from Jorjani.

“The solicitor must uphold the law above all else, above party politics and ideology. That was not the sense I got,” about Jorjani, Manchin said at the time.

Beck, the Interior spokeswoman, maintained that Jorjani’s role does not often require reviewing FOIA requests.

“He is responsible for providing direction to a FOIA program of over 140 employees working on a caseload that has increased more than 25 percent during this administration. In this role he does not typically review individual FOIA requests,” she said.

Other emails released from EarthJustice show Interior’s career staff were confused by how to process FOIA requests once political appointees were involved.

“What response is needed for us to release the documents? For example, several people responded by saying, ‘Thanks for sharing,’ or just ‘Thank you.’ Is that enough? Can I presume that we can release the records? Do I need to wait for all the people on the email chain to respond a certain way?” asked Clarice Julka, a FOIA public liaison for Interior wrote in April of 2018. “Right now, I’m holding up releases because I’m not sure what response I need to have before I can release. Should I continue to wait on these releases or should I go ahead?”

Later that month she expressed annoyance at delays and other issues stemming from political appointee review.

“It’s very confusing and I feel that we shouldn’t be responsible to read your or their minds about how to handle this since from the past, it’s been very clear that my office will be blamed for anything deemed to be a mistake,” she said.

Interior policy notes that if political appointees do not respond when notified about a FOIA request, it will be considered a green light to proceed with the request.

Despite that, numerous emails between FOIA staffers and other employees at Interior show employees were often seeking explicit approval before fulfilling FOIA requests.

But one email shows Interior Sec. David Bernhardt was hesitant to put his own approval in writing.

An email from a FOIA officer to Julka references a conversation with a woman listed only as Rachel.

“She met with Bernhardt this morning to discuss an upcoming release for litigation that is supposed to go out this Friday, April 27. She indicated that Bernhardt said it could go out then, but she also indicated he will not be putting this affirmation into writing and that if he said it could go out, we do not need to hear from anyone else. I explained that per my most recent understanding, we all need approvals in writing from both the comms office and himself. Rachel told me that was not going to happen this time,” the email said.

Weiss said such a move lacks transparency.

“It begs the question of what else David Bernhardt doesn’t want to put in writing?” he said."
"EPA fast tracking chemical reviews amid Trump deregulation push, environmental group reports",https://www.houstonchronicle.com,"['James Osborne', 'Washington Energy Correspondent', 'Follow James On', 'Past Articles This Author', 'Robert Downen', 'Sarah Smith', 'Staff Writers', 'John Mcclain', 'Bob Levitus', 'Ilene Bassler']",06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/EPA-fast-tracking-chemical-reviews-amid-Trump-14015893.php,"WASHINGTON - New chemicals coming into the marketplace are getting fast tracked for approval by the EPA, despite bipartisan reforms in 2016 designed to increase scrutiny over chemicals and reduce public health risks, according to a new report by the Environmental Defense Fund.

Researchers at the advocacy group found over the past year the Environmental Protection Agency was approving 80 percent of the new chemicals that came before it, a rate in line with EPA approval rates before Congress passed the reforms in 2016.

“Political appointees at EPA have taken every opportunity to undermine the 2016 [reforms] and elevate the industry’s interests over public health,” said Richard Denison, lead senior scientist at EDF. “The consequences of these mistakes will be felt by generations to come.”

The controversy comes amid a wider deregulatory push by the Trump administration, which has criticized EPA for holding up industrial expansion that could add jobs and boost the U.S. economy.

The shift described by Environmental Defense Fund. comes as a boon to many Houston-area chemical manufacturers, which have already seen restrictions on chemicals including trichloroethylene, an industrial cleaning agent, and methylene chloride, a paint stripper, rolled back under the Trump administration.

On HoustonChronicle.com: In Washington, politics around oil, climate in flux

The American Chemistry Council, a trade group representing chemical companies, described the Environmental Defense Fund’s report as “false” and an attempt to “undermine the implementation of [the reforms] and disparage the dedicated staff at EPA and the chemical industry.”

“The 2016 amendments to the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) are being effectively and efficiently implemented,” Jon Corley, a spokesman for the trade group, said.

An EPA spokesman said the agency was “ensuring the safety of chemicals in the marketplace, protecting human health and advancing the agency’s core mission.”

But concern is mounting in Congress that the Trump administration is going too far to appease chemical manufacturers.

“At almost every turn, the Trump administration has failed to live up to the letter and spirit of the historic bipartisan reform,” said Senator Tom Udall, D-N.M. “EPA leaders - starting with [Administrator] Andrew Wheeler - must change course, commit themselves to protecting the public, and carry out the [reforms] as Congress wrote it.”

In one instance, staff at EPA recommended restricted use for a chemical used in air and laundry fresheners called jeffamine diacrylamide because it’s in a class of chemicals commonly associated with elevated risk of cancer. But that recommendation was overruled and the chemical approved without the recommended restrictions, Denison said.

“We don’t know who made decision,” he said. “We’re lucky we know the original decision because EPA posted it on its website, but in response to this and other incidents, they stopped doing that,”

So far the company that makes the chemical, International Flavors and Fragrances of New York, has not released products containing jeffamine diacrylamide onto the market, Denison said.

"Pete Buttigieg says ""it's almost certain"" he wouldn't be first gay president",https://www.cbsnews.com,"[""Caitlin O'Kane""]",,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/buttigieg-weve-probably-had-excellent-presidents-who-were-gay/,"2020 presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg could make history as the youngest president in the history of the United States — and the first openly gay one. Buttigieg, however, believes he wouldn't be the only gay president.

Pete Buttigieg Axios on HBO

Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, came out as gay in 2015, before being elected to his second term as mayor. He is now married to junior high school teacher Chasten Glezman, who would become first gentleman if Buttigieg wins the presidency.

In an interview with ""Axios on HBO,"" Buttigieg was asked about critics potentially saying he's too young, too liberal and too gay to be commander-in-chief.

He was asked, ""You are young. You are a liberal. You are gay. How will you respond?""

""I'll respond by explaining where I want to lead this country,"" the candidate replied. ""People will elect the person who will make the best president. And we have had excellent presidents who have been young. We have had excellent presidents who have been liberal. I would imagine we've probably had excellent presidents who were gay — we just didn't know which ones.""

Buttigieg said ""statistically, it's almost certain"" that there has been a gay president before. Of course, none have been openly gay, and almost every president, except for two, have been married to women.

An estimated 4.5 percent of the U.S. population is LGBTQ, a 2018 study by the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law found. So Buttigieg's assumption that at least one out of the nation's 45 presidents was gay is not so far-fetched — he just doesn't know which one.

""My gaydar even doesn't work that well in the present, let alone retroactively,"" he told Axios. ""But one can only assume that's the case."""
Shanahan withdraws as Trump's defense pick as domestic incidents resurface,https://www.cnn.com,"['Zachary Cohen', 'Curt Devine', 'Drew Griffin', 'Michael Warren']",06-18-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/18/politics/shanahan-out-defense-secretary/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump said Tuesday that acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan has ""decided not to go forward with his confirmation process."" Shanahan's withdrawal was announced shortly after the Washington Post published a report detailing a violent incident in 2011 in which his son attacked his own mother with a baseball bat.

""Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, who has done a wonderful job, has decided not to go forward with his confirmation process so that he can devote more time to his family,"" Trump tweeted.

""I thank Pat for his outstanding service and will be naming Secretary of the Army, Mark Esper, to be the new Acting Secretary of Defense. I know Mark, and have no doubt he will do a fantastic job!"" he added.

Trump announced his intention to nominate Shanahan on May 9, but the paperwork necessary to begin confirmation hearings hadn't been filed.

On Tuesday, the Washington Post reported details related to a November 2011 incident in which Shanahan rushed to defend his then-17-year-old son, William, in the days after the teenager brutally beat his mother with a baseball bat.

Two weeks later, Shanahan wrote a memo to prepare his son's initial court appearance, arguing that he had acted in self defense, according to the Post.

But in an interview on Monday, Shanahan told the Post that he later regretted writing the memo and never intended for anyone other than his son's attorneys to read it.

""Quite frankly it's difficult to relive that moment and the passage was difficult for me to read. I was wrong to write those three sentences,"" Shanahan told the Post.

""I have never believed Will's attack on his mother was an act of self-defense or justified. I don't believe violence is appropriate ever, and certainly never any justification for attacking someone with a baseball bat,"" he said.

Later Tuesday, Shanahan released a statement saying he withdrew from consideration after details surfaced related to ""a painful and deeply personal family situation from long ago.""

""After having been confirmed for Deputy Secretary less than two years ago, it is unfortunate that a painful and deeply personal family situation from long ago is being dredged up and painted in an incomplete and therefore misleading way in the course of this process,"" he said.

""I believe my continuing in the confirmation process would force my three children to relive a traumatic chapter in our family's life and reopen wounds we have worked years to heal. Ultimately, their safety and well-being is my highest priority,"" Shanahan added.

Shanahan's decision

Shanahan, who was struggling with how the details surrounding his contentious divorce have resurfaced in recent days, met with Trump in the Oval Office on Monday. The President said his outgoing acting defense secretary informed him on Tuesday morning that he was withdrawing from consideration for the permanent post.

""Pat Shanahan, who is a wonderful person, is, as you know, going to take some time off for family matters,"" Trump told reporters before heading to Florida for a campaign rally.

""I didn't ask him to withdraw. He walked in this morning"" to withdraw, he added.

The President praised Shanahan as a ""terrific person"" and said he only recently learned of the domestic violence allegations.

""I had heard about it yesterday for the first time,"" Trump said of the allegations, which Shanahan had been discussing in interviews with The Washington Post for months, according to the newspaper.

Trump also denied there was an issue with his administration's vetting process, despite multiple individuals withdrawing from consideration for posts after being announced as intended nominees.

""We have a very good vetting process,"" he said.

It was after Shanahan made the decision to withdraw, not Trump, that the President started calling aides and allies asking who should be his next pick. He wanted to be able to name who would take over for Shanahan as soon as he announced his withdrawal, sources said.

An administration official told CNN that Shanahan was fully vetted and that the White House was aware of the domestic abuse allegations in his family -- though not every single detail.

The view early on was that it was not him personally. But as previously reported, even though he was never arrested or charged, there had been growing concerns in recent days his ex-wife would resurface and publicly accuse him of domestic abuse which would then cause parallels to be drawn about the situation involving former White House aide Rob Porter

Court filings detail 2010 incident

In court filings, Shanahan's ex-wife Kimberley accused him of hitting her during a dispute at their home in August 2010.

A police officer who responded to the dispute noted that ""Patrick had a black eye and a bloody nose"" and that Kimberley did not have ""any visible marks"" on her, though Kimberley told the officer Patrick struck her several times in the stomach, according to a police incident report.

His ex-wife, who later changed her name to Kimberly Jordinson, was arrested and charged with assault for the incident. The charges against her were later dropped.

In an unrelated incident, Jordinson was also charged in Florida in 2014, for smashing a car's front and back windshields with a sledgehammer according to a police report, but she was not convicted.

Jordinson told CNN on Tuesday that the FBI never asked her about the 2010 domestic violence incident or the couple's contentious divorce until a few weeks ago.

Jordinson said she has been interviewed by the FBI a total of three times. The first two times were before Shanahan became deputy secretary of defense. She said during those earlier interviews, the agents focused on the incident in which her son beat her with a baseball bat, causing severe injuries.

The FBI returned for a third interview two or three weeks ago, to ask about the 2010 argument, Jordinson said.

Jordinson says she asked the FBI agents why they hadn't asked her about the fight before, and they said a note had previously been placed in the file to conduct a follow-up interview about the 2010 incident, but that interview was never conducted.

When CNN first spoke to Jordinson in January, she said she had not spoken to Shanahan since the 2010 incident, and that the two only communicated through attorneys.

""He is just going to spend the rest of his life hiding the truth, because he does not want the truth to come out,"" she said on Tuesday.

Jordinson also countered reports that she is mentally ill or has a substance abuse problem. ""I have never been diagnosed with a mental condition. I do not take medication for a mental condition,"" she said. She added, ""I have gone to therapy to deal with fallout from this divorce. I'm deeply saddened by what has happened to this family."" She also said she has never abused alcohol or drugs, and has never done illegal drugs.

She told CNN that she is still in the process of suing Shanahan for an additional $300,000-$400,000 for money owed from the divorce and expenses related to the raising of their three children.

Shanahan addressed the issues in a statement earlier this week.

""Though my marriage ended in sorrow and disappointment, I never laid a hand on my then-wife and cooperated fully in a thorough law enforcement investigation that resulted in her being charged with assault against me—charges which I had dropped in the interest of my family,"" he said.

Patrick and Kimberley's daughter Kayla Shanahan released her own statement saying: ""I never once saw my father raise a hand against my mother or against his children. To the contrary, my mother has a history of domestic abuse and physical violence, victimizing my father and her children, as well as having been subject of a restraining order unrelated to our family.""

Their son, Will Shanahan defended his father as a ""source of stability.""

""I and my brother and sister were subject to emotional and physical abuse by our mother. My father was and is the source of stability in our lives, in contrast to the constant physical and emotional trauma inflicted on us by our mother,"" he said in a statement.

Trump taps Esper as acting secretary

Esper, who Trump named as acting defense secretary on Tuesday, has been floated within the administration as a potential Pentagon chief for months — both before and after Trump said he would nominate Shanahan to the post.

Now, as Shanahan withdraws, the President is again considering the former Army secretary for the permanent job — though has only named him to the acting post for now. One White House official said the administration is still regrouping and figuring out their next steps after Shanahan's withdrawal.

Trump said Tuesday that he ""most likely"" will nominate Esper for the permanent job soon.

Ryan McCarthy, the under secretary for the Army, is expected to be named as the new acting Army secretary in the coming days, a person familiar with Trump's thinking said.

Esper was Trump's third pick for army secretary, and has been involved in efforts to secure funding for the border wall and to deploy US troops to the southern border.

Esper received a call from the White House about 30 minutes before the tweet announcing him as acting secretary, according to a US defense official.

The service secretaries, including Esper, will meet later Tuesday afternoon with Shanahan to discuss a transition.

""This is a good move by the administration,"" a senior GOP aide on the Senate Armed Services Committee said, predicting a smooth confirmation should the White House name Esper to the permanent post.

""They don't make him acting without nominating him,"" the aide said. ""Esper would be a very smart pick for the White House.""

Trump was generally aware for months of the rumors about Shanahan and domestic violence allegations, though it's not clear to what extent he knew the details.

The White House had grown increasingly concerned in recent days over Shanahan's issues with his background check, a White House official said. Additionally, Trump began having second thoughts about nominating him after initially telling Shanahan in the Oval Office he would, according to the official.

The official added that Shanahan stylistically didn't fit Trump's mold of what he wanted in a defense secretary and he began to question whether that was the right role for him. Shanahan is more reserved and is not an aggressive and forward type of leader. He also doesn't have military experience.

""The defense secretary plays a leadership role, not a business management role. Huge difference,"" the official said.

Asked about Esper's interest in the secretary of defense role, his spokesman pointed to a December statement in which the Army secretary told the Ft. Worth Star-Telegram: ""I'm very happy and privileged to be secretary of the Army.""

A senior GOP aide on the Senate Armed Services Committee told CNN Tuesday that naming Esper to replace Shanahan was ""a good move by the administration"" and said he would be ""a very smart pick"" should the White House choose to nominate him.

""He would have a very smooth confirmation,"" the aide said, adding that Esper is ""the most qualified in the Department.""

The aide also told CNN that most committee staff are relieved about Trump's announcement.

""We don't have to go through that confirmation battle,"" they said, referring to Shanahan.

An administration official said Esper is ""potentially qualified"" for the permanent job but that several other people are also being considered.

The source added that the White House wants someone as quickly as possible, but that it is just starting the replacement process."
US Treasury yields on track for weekly declines after Fed signals possible cut ahead,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],06-21-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/21/us-treasury-yields-higher-amid-tensions-with-iran.html,"U.S. government debt yields were set for weekly losses Friday after many investors took the Federal Reserve policy announcement earlier in the week as a sign the central bank could cut rates in the coming months.

Though yields rose on the week's final day of trading, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was on track for an 4-basis-point decline for the week as it hovered around 2.06%. The 10-year yield fell below 2% for the first time since 2016 on Thursday.

The 2-year Treasury note yield was last seen at 1.79% around 11:25 a.m. ET.

Bond yields, which move inversely to price, have been under pressure since Fed struck a dovish tone in its June policy statement on Wednesday. At the time, Chair Jerome Powell said that the case for looser policy had improved.

""Overall, our policy discussion focused on the appropriate response to the uncertain environment,"" he said. ""Many participants now see the case for somewhat more accommodative policy has strengthened,"" he said.

While Fed officials voted to maintained its target overnight lending rate, eight members showed that they'd be in favor of cutting rates this year, while the same number voted in favor of the status quo.

The policymaking committee of the Fed also dropped ""patient"" from its statement and acknowledged that inflation is ""running below"" its 2% objective."
Walmart Pays $282 Million to Settle Federal Foreign Bribery Case,http://fortune.com,['Tom Schoenberg'],06-20-2019,2019,6,http://fortune.com/2019/06/20/walmart-pays-fine-doj-brazil-bribe-probe/,"Walmart Inc. has agreed to pay $282 million in penalties and a Brazilian unit admitted to violating a U.S. anti-bribery law, providing a relatively subdued ending to a seven-year investigation that spanned the globe and at one point looked poised to yield record foreign-corruption fines.

In parallel announcements on Thursday, the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission faulted the country’s largest retailer over payments made to fast-track store openings in Mexico, China, Brazil, and India. Walmart will pay about $138 million in criminal penalties and $144 million in disgorgement to resolve the SEC’s allegations.

WMT Brasilia pleaded guilty Thursday to failing to keep accurate records, while the U.S. parent reached a non-prosecution agreement with the Justice Department over violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The company will have a compliance monitor for two years as part of that accord and Walmart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said the company is “committed to doing business the right way.”

The retailer’s operations in Brazil are currently handled by a company called Walmart Brasil, which is 80% owned by private-equity firm Advent International.

The entity that pleaded guilty, WMT Brasilia, “was and always has been a holding company,”

according to a Walmart spokesperson. “Today it has ownership of the entity which owns 20% of the current business after we sold it last year.”

The resolution, disclosed in court filings in Virginia and press releases, was a muted end to what was once seen as a case targeting high-level officers. At one point, people familiar with the probe have said, U.S. authorities were asking up to $1 billion in penalties. While the penalty is about one-sixth of the $1.78 billion levied last year against Petroleo Brasileiro SA in one of South America’s biggest corruption scandals, Walmart wound up spending about $1 billion in legal fees and an overhaul of its compliance systems.

“The case may not have turned out to be as good or as fruitful as the government thought,” said Michael Koenig, a former federal prosecutor now a partner at Hinckley, Allen & Snyder. “This notion that the government is only successful if it gets a conviction or a billion-dollar settlement is just plain wrong. You have to go where the investigation leads and what may have started out as thinking this was going to be the greatest investigation since Enron for a host of reasons turned out not to be what the government thought.”

The expectation of what the Walmart investigation might reveal were set by a series of articles in the New York Times in 2012 outlining details of allegations the retailer paid some $24 million to Mexican officials to win quick zoning changes, sidestep licenses, and environmental permits and deflect opposition to open stores, turning Walmart into that country’s largest private-sector employer.

Allegations that America’s largest retailer was running a pay-to-play scheme outside the U.S. gave a boost to the Justice Department’s FCPA unit, which had suffered some high-profile court losses and was defending attempts by business interest groups to rein in its prosecutors.

But the Walmart case posed challenges for investigators. Much of the conduct uncovered in Mexico, for example, couldn’t be used as evidence because it was too old, people familiar with the matter have previously said. So the government sought to build stronger cases in other countries. In Brazil and India, investigators found more recent examples of what they believed were improper payments, yet struggled to find examples of rampant misconduct in China, the people said.

In the closing days of the Obama administration, Walmart balked at demands to pay more than $600 million in penalties, leading prosecutors to go back to gather more evidence from witnesses, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg at the time. That, in turn, led to a lengthy secret court battle over whether the Justice Department could bring Walmart’s internal lawyers before the grand jury. By this point, the investigation had already spanned more than five years.

In 2017, the company set aside almost $300 million for a possible settlement. Months later, a federal appeals court in Virginia blocked the Justice Department from interviewing Walmart’s lawyers, removing leverage the government had in the criminal case. The two sides became deadlocked for months over what misconduct the retail giant would admit to, a person familiar with the matter previously said.

On Thursday, the Brazilian unit admitted that $527,000 in improper payments to an intermediary were inaccurately recorded on financial records. Brazil employees logged those payments as going to construction companies when they knew the money was going to a former Brazilian government official, according to the plea agreement filed in Virginia. The former official’s ability to obtain licenses and permits quickly earned her the nickname “sorceress” or “genie,” according to the unit’s plea agreement. Walmart earned more than $3.6 million in profit from stores built by these construction companies.

The non-prosecution agreement with the U.S. outlines much broader conduct that prosecutors said ran from 2000 to 2011 and included Mexico, China, and India. Walmart executives were aware of problems regarding payments by the foreign subsidiaries to third parties but failed to stop them, according to the Justice Department.

“In numerous instances, senior Walmart employees knew of failures of its anti-corruption-related internal controls involving foreign subsidiaries, and yet Walmart failed for years to implement sufficient controls comporting with U.S. criminal laws,” assistant attorney General Brian Benczkowski said in a statement.

No criminal charges against individuals have been brought.

State Dept. says no 'uptick' DR deaths of Americans after a string of fatal incidents,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/International/us-state-dept-uptick-deaths-americans-dominican-republic/story?id=63806929,"Despite a string of high-profile deaths this year of Americans from illnesses in the Dominican Republic, the U.S. State Department said Wednesday there has not been an ""uptick"" in fatal incidents of Americans in the Caribbean country.

The State Department confirmed at least nine American tourists have died in the Dominican Republic in roughly the past 12 months, and some of their families say they became gravely ill before they perished.

""We have not seen an uptick in the number of U.S. citizen deaths reported to the Department"" in the Dominican Republic, a State Department spokesperson told ABC News.

The spokesperson said that more than 2.7 million U.S. citizens visit the Dominican Republic each year and, as in most countries, ""the overwhelming majority travel without incident.""

The U.S. Embassy in Santo Domingo said last week that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is now helping to probe the deaths of at least three Americans who perished in a five-day span at neighboring hotels in the same resort run by Bahia Principe Hotels & Resorts.

Dominican authorities asked for the FBI's help in conducting toxicology analysis in the investigations stemming from the deaths at the luxury destination, according to officials at the U.S. Embassy.

Nathaniel Holmes/Facebook

Nathaniel Holmes, 63, and his fiancée, Cynthia Ann Day, 49, of Maryland were found dead on May 30 in their room at the Grand Bahia Principe La Romana Resort in San Pedro de Macoris on the southeast coast of the Dominican Republic.

Autopsies performed in the Dominican Republic determined preliminary causes of death for both Holmes and Day were respiratory failure and pulmonary edema, or water in the lungs.

A lawyer for the families of Day and Holmes said they are awaiting the results of independent autopsies on the couple.

The couple died just five days after Miranda Schaupp-Werner, 41, of Allentown, Pennsylvania, was found dead at the Luxury Bahia Principe Bouganville hotel at the same resort.

An autopsy performed on Schaupp-Werner determined that she also died from respiratory failure and pulmonary edema, according to the Dominican Republic National Police.

The FBI, at the request of Dominican officials, is conducting toxicology analysis to determine how Holmes, Day and Schaupp-Werner died. The results of the analysis have not been completed.

""The safety of U.S. citizens that live in, work in, and visit the Dominican Republic remains our highest priority,"" Robin Bernstein, the U.S. Ambassador to the Dominican Republic, said in a statement earlier this month. ""These incidents are tragic and we offer our deepest condolences to those personally impacted.""

According to the U.S. State Department's website, 13 Americans died in the Dominican Republic in 2018, but those deaths were not all from natural causes and included homicides, drownings and vehicle accidents.

Nathaniel Holmes/Facebook

The State Department confirmed this week the Jan. 26 death of Thomas Jerome ""Jerry"" Curran, 78, of Bedford, Ohio, who became ill while staying at a different Dominican Republic resort.

Curran's death brings the total of Americans who died in the Dominican Republic since June 2018 to nine.

Other Americans who perished after coming down with illnesses while in the Dominican Republic were Yvette Monique Sport, 51, of Pennsylvania, in June 2018; David Harrison, 45, of Maryland, in July 2018; Robert Wallace, 67, of California, on April 14; Leyla Cox, 53, of New York, on June 10; and Joseph Allen, 55, of New Jersey, on June 13.

It's unclear if Sport and Harrison's death were included in the U.S. State Department's report of Americans who perished in the Dominican Republic in 2018.

Dominican officials are working to reinforce the island's food and beverage safety standards amid the deaths, following reports that some Americans died after consuming beverages from their hotels and suddenly falling ill.

Dominican Tourism Minister Francisco Javier Garcia said in a statement last week that his agency is working with the National Hotel Association ""to reinforce safety conditions and quality control in food, beverages and any other element that has a positive impact on the satisfaction of those who visit our county as tourists.""

But Garcia cautioned against a rush to judgment.

""While what happened is tragic and regrettable,"" García said, ""it is important for everyone who wishes to disseminate information about the situation to do it in context and with perspective. It is advisable to wait for the official reports before speculating on the causes of death."""
House Homeland Security Republicans to introduce slew of cybersecurity bills,https://thehill.com,[],06-18-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/448971-house-homeland-security-republicans-to-introduce-slew-of-cybersecurity,"Republicans on the House Homeland Security Committee are gearing up to introduce a bevy of bills aimed at enhancing the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) cybersecurity capabilities.

The bills are the first glimpse into the new ""American Security Agenda"" that committee Republicans plan to pursue this Congress.

Rogers will say that the goal of the agenda is to “take a hard look at the Department’s missions and act to ensure that DHS is prepared to tackle the emerging threats to our homeland,” including threats to social media, satellites and theft of intellectual property.

Republican members of the committee plan to introduce seven pieces of legislation in the coming weeks, with several specifically focused on cybersecurity.

Three other bills set to be introduced by GOP Homeland Security committee members will include one to help TSA identify emerging threats to the transportation system, and others on reforming DHS’s structure and management.

Rogers will note in his speech that “these seven bills are just the start,” and that “we are working on other bills to address emerging threats that we hope to introduce soon as part of our agenda.”

A Homeland Security Committee aide told The Hill in a phone call that while timing for the formal reintroduction of these bills has not been set, some will be reintroduced “this week."" The aide emphasized that “we are not going to drop everything tomorrow,” and that the overall agenda outlined by Rogers will be “built out in the next 16 months.”

The aide said that Rogers and Thompson appear to be in agreement on most of the cybersecurity issues, noting that both congressmen are “very interested in making sure that DHS keeps up with nation states and hackers and making sure that our cyber infrastructure is secure.”

The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee has also been consulted on the issues Rogers will outline, the aide confirmed to The Hill, noting that the chairmen and ranking members of both committees have met to discuss the agenda.

The aide said that both Rogers and Katko engage with DHS on a weekly basis, and that the committee’s job is “to make sure they [DHS] can do their job correctly.”

“Instead of changing the deck chairs on a sinking ship, we want to make sure that this a department that is fully engaged and prepared for the 21st century,” the aide said."
Moving USDA research agencies is part of Trump’s war on science and statistics,https://www.washingtonpost.com,['Editorial Board'],06-17-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/moving-usda-research-agencies-is-part-of-trumps-war-on-science-and-statistics/2019/06/17/51c85328-9134-11e9-aadb-74e6b2b46f6a_story.html,"IN ITS war on science and statistics, the Trump administration has a habit of sidelining inconvenient information. Last week, it was at it again.

On Thursday, the Agriculture Department announced a decision to relocate two of its research agencies, the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, from Washington to the Kansas City region. The Economic Research Service, which investigates the economics of food, farming, natural resources and rural America, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which was established as part of the Food, Conservation and Energy Act of 2008, play a key role in providing the data essential for honest policy-making.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue initially declared an intention to move these sub-agencies 10 months ago but didn’t specify a location then. The USDA now says the move would put the agencies closer to the agricultural heartland while saving money both for taxpayers and for employees, because Washington is an expensive city. While the rationale may seem plausible , in reality the implications are worrying.

In theory, there’s no reason such agencies couldn’t function well in Kansas City or elsewhere. After all, as with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta, this would hardly be the first time a government agency operates from beyond Washington. But the way this operation has been managed, with insufficient warning and explanation, suggests an intention by the administration to encourage qualified analysts to leave government and stifle independent and objective research.

If carried out, the move will disrupt ongoing scientific research and displace several hundred federal employees with valuable experience. Since the abrupt announcement last August, many of the agencies’ top economists and scientists have quit.

The investigations carried out by these agencies have long underpinned decisions by Congress and by American farmers, much as research from the Bureau of Labor Statistics underpins decisions in others parts of the economy. And much of the information produced by the Economic Research Service has indeed been inconvenient for the administration, as it has illustrated the ills wrought by President Trump’s trade wars and how small farmers were helped only marginally by the 2017 Republican tax overhaul.

Democratic members of the House and Senate have introduced the Agriculture Research Integrity Act, which would bar the move. They are right to do so, but it would be best if the USDA took the hint and retreated from this abrupt and ill-considered relocation. The better way to get sunnier data would be to develop better policies."
EPA to Repeal Obama-Era Clean Power Plan,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Barbie Latza Nadeau'],06-19-2019,2019,6,https://www.thedailybeast.com/environmental-protection-agency-to-repeal-obama-era-clean-power-plan,"The Environmental Protection Agency plans to repeal the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, which sought to regulate emissions by some of America’s biggest power-plant polluters, The Wall Street Journal reports. The move would mean that power plants would be regulated on a case-by-case basis rather than being held to industry-wide regulations, allowing older plants to continue operations as they move toward more efficient technology. EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler is expected to announce the repeal on Wednesday, according to the Journal, which has seen a copy of the summary. It would fulfill a campaign promise made by Donald Trump to boost coal plant productivity."
