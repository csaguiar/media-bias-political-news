"Donald Trump says he never called Meghan Markle 'nasty,' calls comments about Duchess 'fake news'",https://www.foxnews.com,['Jessica Sager'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/donald-trump-twitter-meghan-markle-nasty-denial,"Donald Trump denied calling Meghan Markle ""nasty.""

Last week, it was reported that Duchess Meghan, 37, would skip out on events with President Trump during his state visit to the U.K., citing maternity leave following the birth of her and Prince Harry's son Archie Mountbatten-Windsor.

An interview she'd done previously while promoting ""Suits"" resurfaced at the time, in which she'd called Trump ""misogynistic ... and so vocal about it,"" adding, “I’m voting for Hillary Clinton, not because she is a woman, but because Trump has made it easy to see that you don’t really want that kind of world that he’s painting.”

She also said she may have moved to Canada permanently if he got elected.

In an interview with The Sun on Saturday, Trump reportedly said he was ""shocked"" by Duchess Meghan's past remarks.

“I didn’t know that. What can I say? I didn’t know that she was nasty,"" Trump reportedly told the outlet. When confronted with the fact that she wouldn't be seeing him during his state visit, he replied, “I didn’t know that. I hope she is OK.”

"Trump says Mexico is an 'abuser' of the US, amid tariff negotiations",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-mexico-is-an-abuser-of-the-us-amid-tariff-negotiations,"President Trump on Sunday called Mexico an “abuser” of the United States, and warned that if the country does not do more to “stop the invasion” of the Southern border, his newly-imposed tariffs on Mexican goods would force companies based in Mexico to be “brought back” into the U.S.

The president’s tweets come following his announcement on Thursday to impose a new 5 percent tariff on all Mexican imports — a tariff that would increase over time.

MEXICO DISPATCHES TEAM TO DC TO NEGOTIATE TARIFFS, AS TRUMP DEMANDS ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION REMEDY

“The problem is that Mexico is an ‘abuser’ of the United States, taking but never giving. It has been this way for decades. Either they stop the invasion of our Country by Drug Dealers, Cartels, Human Traffickers, Coyotes and Illegal Immigrants, which they can do very easily, or our many companies and jobs that have been foolishly allowed to move South of the Border, will be brought back into the United States through taxation (Tariffs),” Trump tweeted early Sunday.

“America has had enough!” he added.

Trump announced the new tariffs, which are slated to go into effect on June 10, on Thursday. The president said a new 5 percent tariff would be placed on all Mexican imports to pressure the country to do more to help crack down on the surge of migrants trying to cross the U.S. Southern border. Trump warned, though, that the tariff percentage would gradually increase up to 25 percent “until the illegal immigration problem is remedied.”

Fox News has learned that the tariffs, on all goods by land, sea, and air from Mexico, will hike up to 10 percent on July 1, 15 percent on August 1, 20 percent on September 1, and to 25 percent by October 1.

“Tariffs will permanently remain at the 25 percent level unless and until Mexico substantially stops the illegal flow of aliens coming through its territory,” the White House said in a statement this week.

MEXICAN PRESIDENT SAYS HE EXPECTS 'GOOD RESULTS' FROM TARIFF NEGOTIATIONS WITH US

But upon the announcement of the new tariffs, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador dispatched his foreign relations secretary to Washington on Friday, as the country scrambled to negotiate a solution with the U.S.

Over the weekend, though, Obrador said he expects “good results” from the upcoming talks in Washington and reportedly suggested he is open to reinforcing efforts to stem illegal immigration. Obrador said that Mexican officials plan to convey to the Trump administration what they have been doing to stop illegal immigration, and added that they are open to additional measures “without violating human rights.”

In a letter to Trump on Thursday following the announcements of the tariffs, Obrador said that “social problems are not solved with duties or coercive measures,” and added that the United States has a history of being a nation of immigrants.

“The Statue of Liberty is not an empty symbol,” he wrote in the letter.

But despite upcoming talks, White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, on ""Fox News Sunday,"" said the president's move to impose tariffs was one to show how serious he is about the situation at the border.

""I fully expect these tariffs to go on to at least the 5 percent level on June 10th the president is deadly serious about fixing the situation at the southern border,"" Mulvaney told Fox News' Chris Wallace Sunday.

Mulvaney also explained how tariffs against Mexico would benefit the U.S., citing the positive change in the economy following the administration slapping tariffs on Chinese goods.

""American consumers have gone to products that are made in the United States, for example, that don’t carry those tariffs, and we think the same thing will happen here and the American consumers will not pay for the burden of tariffs,"" Mulvaney said. ""American taxpayers are paying hundreds of billions of dollars for illegal immigrants. They’re paying hundreds of billions of dollars for the drugs that come across the southern border, so there’s already a cost associated with this that we are trying to get off of the backs of ordinary Americans.""

Meanwhile, on Sunday, the president blasted congressional Democrats, claiming they “are doing nothing” to address securing the border.

“The Democrats are doing nothing on the Border to address the Humanitarian and National Security Crisis! Could be fixed so easily if they would vote with Republicans to fix the loopholes!” he tweeted.

Trump added: “The Wall is under construction and moving along quickly, despite all of the Radical Liberal Democrat lawsuits. What are they thinking as our Country is invaded by so many people (illegals) and things (Drugs) that we do not want. Make America Great Again!”

The president’s tweets come as the border sees a historic number of migrants attempting to enter the U.S.

Last week, more than 1,000 illegal immigrants were apprehended by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents near the U.S.-Mexico border—the largest ever group of migrants ever apprehended at a single time, sources told Fox News.

The group of 1,036 illegal immigrants found in the El Paso sector included migrants from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, according to sources.

There were 58,474 families apprehended last month, according to CBP. In March, the agency said that there was an increase of nearly 106 percent over the same period last year.

A top Border Patrol official told lawmakers in April that authorities have apprehended more families illegally crossing the border between October 2018 and February of this year than during all of the 2018 fiscal year (Oct. 1, 2017-Sept. 30, 2018).

"Trump encourages no-deal Brexit ahead of state visit, offers Britain trade deal with US",https://www.cnbc.com,['Tucker Higgins'],06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/02/trump-tells-uk-to-walk-away-if-eu-doesnt-agree-to-brexit-deal.html,"U.S. President Donald Trump answers questions on the comments of special counsel Robert Mueller while departing the White House May 30, 2019 in Washington, DC.

President Donald Trump encouraged the United Kingdom to ""walk away"" from any negotiations with the European Union

if the country is unable to secure a favorable Brexit deal.

""If you don't get the deal you want, if you don't get a fair deal, then you walk away,"" Trump said in an interview published Sunday in The Sunday Times ahead of his first official state visit to the U.K.

Trump's comments come as British politics remain on edge. The country is scheduled to leave the E.U. on October 31, after delaying its original departure date by months due to a lack of political consensus in Britain.

Prime Minister Theresa May announced her resignation earlier last month after repeatedly failing to gain support for the withdrawal deal she negotiated with the E.U. Parliament rejected the withdrawal deal three times and May was unable to win backing for it to pass in a fourth vote.

Trump also said he ""wouldn't pay"" the $50 billion so-called ""divorce bill"" to settle the U.K.'s financial obligations with the E.U.: ""I'm only saying this from my stand point. I would not pay, that's a tremendous number,"" Trump said.



A number of leading Brexit supporters are calling for the U.K. to prepare to leave the E.U. without any deal at all, which means Britain would have no trade arrangement with the bloc, likely resulting in economic disruption.



Former British foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who has thrown in his hat to succeed May as Conservative Party leader, has said that Britain will leave the E.U. in October with or without a deal.



Trump praised Johnson's bid to succeed May in an interview with The Sun newspaper published on Friday. The president said that Johnson would make an ""excellent"" prime minister.

""I actually have studied it very hard. I know the different players. But I think Boris would do a very good job. I think he would be excellent. I like him. I have always liked him,"" Trump told The Sun newspaper.

Trump dangled a trade deal between the United States and Britain, saying his administration would ""work on it very, very quickly.""

""I'd go all out,"" Trump told The Times. ""It would be a great advantage for UK. One of the advantages of Brexit is the fact that you can deal with the number one country by far, we're the number one by far in terms of every metric in terms of an economy.""

The president's three-day visit to the U.K. begins Monday."

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez bashed US foreign policy during a private meeting with Bronx community leaders, prompting two military veterans to storm out.

“She knocks the country, she knocks the president. And that’s not what America is about,” said Silvio Mazzella, a Vietnam War vet and treasurer of Community Board 11.

Anthony Vitaliano — an Army veteran who worked in the NYPD for 38 years, and commanded the Bronx’s homicide detectives — was sitting between Ocasio-Cortez and a staffer for the freshman Dem.

“I just couldn’t hear her BS anymore. I just got up, got my umbrella in my hand and walked right out.” — Anthony Vitaliano, Army veteran who worked in the NYPD for 38 years

AOC held the closed-door meeting with about a dozen members of the board on Wednesday night, marking a rare visit to the Bronx part of her district.

One Middle Eastern board member raised the issue of the conflict in Yemen.

The progressive firebrand slammed the US policy of providing bombs to Saudi Arabia, which has supported Yemen’s government in a brutal civil war, according to attendees. Some blamed her for not including the roles of other nations in explaining the volatile region’s violence.

“Talking about America, that really turned me off completely,” said Mazzella, 74, who said he fought in Vietnam from 1966 to 1968.

When Israel came up later in the meeting, Ocasio-Cortez suggested President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are autocrats, according to a person at the meeting.

“I was revolted,” said the attendee, who didn’t want his name published.

He, Mazzella and Vitaliano said they all walked out in disgust before the end of the session.

Earlier, board members complained about problems with the US Postal Service, which regularly misses mail deliveries and a local Amtrak property that is a magnet for graffiti vandals. CB 11 is a working-class neighborhood on the eastern side of the Bronx covering Allerton, Morris Park, Pelham Gardens and Van Nest. In addition to parts of the Bronx, Ocasio-Cortez’s district includes north-central Queens.

“Did she care about the issues? She wrote them down,” said Vitaliano, 78. “The jury will be out on the local issues.”

She “danced around the whole” question of Columbus Day, for which the neighborhood holds a parade every year, said Vitaliano, who supports creating a day for indigenous people but wants to preserve the treasured Italian-American tradition.

The room wasn’t entirely hostile to AOC, though. One attendee said, “There were a lot of people that really adored what she was saying.”

AOC’s office denied that anyone stormed out of the meeting.

“The only person that left the meeting while it was underway was someone who had to go pick up their children,” said AOC spokesman Corbin Trent.

Asked about Trent’s comment, Vitaliano said, “That’s bulls–t. Everybody that was there knows I walked out.”"

Organizers of the protests from the ""Together Against Trump"" organization told ABC News that protests are planned at Buckingham Palace on Monday, when the president will be attending a state banquet with the Queen, and on Tuesday, when he will be visiting Prime Minister Theresa May.

The protest at Buckingham Palace is expected to be a small event, with only 66 people so far registered as ""attending"" on the event entitled: Protest at the Palace: Spoil Trump’s Banquet.

However, the protest on Tuesday, beginning in London’s historic Trafalgar Square at 11 a.m. local time, is expected to be a much more dramatic affair. Nearly 8,000 people are registered for the Facebook event, while another 33,000 social media users have said they are ""interested"" as of Sunday morning.

A spokesperson from the ""Together Against Trump"" group told ABC News that they expect protests to take place throughout the country, but that the event in Trafalgar Square is the main event.

A number of Facebook groups, including the ""Stop Trump Coalition"" and ""Stand up to Trump,"" have come together to organize the protests against his state visit, so that the “world will know that people here reject him and his toxic politics.”

“On 4 June thousands of protestors will be marching to surround Trump as he joins Theresa May on a visit most believe should never have happened,” a spokesperson for ""Stand up to Trump"" told ABC News. “We will be bringing central London to a standstill. By the time he leaves he will know, and the world will know that people here reject him and his toxic politics.”

Trump’s last visit to the U.K. in July 2018 drew controversy as protesters flew a huge blimp with straw-blond hair, an orange-hued face and out-of-proportion hands that was intended to depict President Donald Trump as a baby. However, it is unclear whether the ""Trump Baby"" blimp will make a return this year.

A crowdfunding page called “Bring Trump Baby Back” has been calling for donations to raise the $37,000 needed to fly the blimp. So far only $22,500 has been raised.

Despite this, organizers remain “confident” that the blimp will return, according to ITV News, although protest organizer Kevin Smith that “we will only fly the baby if we hit the [£30,000] target.”"
Pence: 'I wouldn't know why there would be' impeachment proceedings,https://www.cnn.com,['Eli Watkins'],06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/02/politics/mike-pence-trump-impeachment/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Vice President Mike Pence said he did not know why there would be a basis for Congress to pursue impeachment against President Donald Trump.

""I wouldn't know why there would be; I really wouldn't,"" Pence said in an interview that aired Sunday with Fox News' Maria Bartiromo.

Growing numbers of Democrats in Congress have called for impeachment proceedings to begin, and one sitting member on the GOP side, Michigan Rep. Justin Amash, have argued the special counsel investigation demonstrated Trump committed impeachable offenses.

Pence said on Fox News that the issues former FBI Director Robert Mueller and his team investigated were ""entirely over.""

""The special counsel confirmed that there was no collusion between our campaign and the Russians, and the Department of Justice has confirmed that there was no collusion, no obstruction, the matter is entirely over,"" Pence said.

"Schiff says impeachment 'is destined for failure,' calls GOP 'cult of the president's personality'",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/schiff-calls-gop-the-cult-of-the-presidents-personality-hints-potential-impeachment-could-fail-without-their-support,"House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said that impeachment ""is destined for failure"" without Republican support, while blasting the party as “the cult of the president’s personality"" and stating that he is actually against ""putting the country"" through impeachment proceedings.

Schiff, on ABC News’ “This Week,” said that while he believes House Democrats could impeach the president, the move would likely fail, due to a lack of support from Republicans in the House and Senate.

NADLER: THERE 'CERTAINLY IS' JUSTIFICATION TO IMPEACH TRUMP

""I think we're going to do what is right for the country, and at this point, the speaker has not reached the conclusion, and I haven't either that it's the best for the country to put us through an impeachment proceeding that we know will, is, destined for failure in the Senate,"" Schiff said.

Schiff added that the president's ""conduct qualifies"" as ""high crimes and misdemeanors,"" but said: ""at the same time, we have to recognize that the reality — that one party, the Republican Party, has turned itself into the cult of the president’s personality and is not likely to act consistent with its constitutional obligations.""

Schiff added, however, that if Trump ""continues to stonewall"" Congress, and ""demonstrate his unfitness for office,"" congressional Democrats could move forward.

""There may be little additional cost to going through that process, even if unsuccessful in the Senate,"" Schiff said. ""But we're not there yet and I think if it is a close call, close calls go against putting the country through that.""

Schiff’s comments come as rank-and-file congressional Democrats have ramped up their calls for impeachment, following a rare public statement by Special Counsel Robert Mueller last week, who announced it was “not an option” for his team of prosecutors to charge the president with a crime due to longstanding Justice Department policy.

Mueller detailed the findings in his probe, maintaining that there was “not sufficient evidence to charge a conspiracy” with regard to whether members of the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russian government during the 2016 presidential election.

But Mueller did not mince words on his inquiry into whether the president obstructed justice.

“If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said that,” Mueller said. “We did not determine whether the president did commit a crime.”

Mueller explained the longstanding Justice Department policy, which states that a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime, and thus said “charging the president was not an option we could consider.”

Mueller added that “it would be unfair to accuse someone of a crime when there could be no court resolution of the charge.”

TRUMP BLASTS MUELLER AS 'HIGHLY CONFLICTED,' CALLS IMPEACHMENT A 'DIRTY, FILTHY, DISGUSTING WORD'

But Mueller said that while the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinion blocks a president from indictment while in office, “the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse the president of wrongdoing.”

Some on the left took that comment as a green light to ramp up talks about impeachment proceedings against the president.

Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., also compared Mueller's remarks to an ""impeachment referral,"" and said, ""We need to start impeachment proceedings. It's our constitutional obligation.""

Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., who is also running for president, said now that Mueller's job is done, ""Impeachment hearings should begin tomorrow.""



House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., whose committee would oversee impeachment proceedings, said that there ""certainly is"" justification to begin impeachment, but said it was critical to first gain the support fo the American people.

“Impeachment is a political act, and you cannot impeach a president if the American people will not support it,” said Nadler, D-N.Y. “The American people, right now, do not support it because they do not know the story. They don’t know the facts.”

Nadler added: “We have to get the facts out. We have to hold a series of hearings, we have to hold the investigations.”

But despite growing calls from rank-and-file Democrats, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has tread lightly on the topic, vowing to investigate allegations against the president, but stopping short of calling to begin impeachment proceedings.

Pelosi, this week, also said that Democrats “want to do what’s right and what gets results.”

“We’re legislating, we’re investigating and we’re litigating,” Pelosi said. “Everybody wants justice, everybody wants the president to be held accountable.”

But House Majority Whip James Clyburn, D-S.C., despite Pelosi’s resistance to the idea, said Sunday he feels Democrats have “already begun” impeachment proceedings.

“We’ve got all these committees doing their work, we’re having hearings, we’ve already won two court cases and there are other cases that are still to be determined, so why should we get out in front of this process?” Clyburn said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

“It’s kind of interesting to me when you talk to people and ask them what they think we ought to do,” he added. “They agree with what we’re doing, it’s just that, emotionally, they would like to see something done and see it done quicker.”

Trump, though, blasted the idea as a “scam.”

“I don’t see how they can,” Trump said Thursday. “It’s a dirty, filthy, disgusting word, impeach. It’s high crimes – there was no high crime. So how do you impeach?”

The White House also has ignored the discussion, and seized only on Mueller's move to announce the official conclusion of the Russia probe. Mueller, last week, said the investigation was officially complete, his office would close, and said he was resigning from the Justice Department to return to private life.

But even without launching official impeachment proceedings, congressional Democrats are leading several high-profile Trump-focused investigations. The House Judiciary Committee, which would oversee potential impeachment proceedings, is investigating the administration’s handling of Mueller’s report, and even voted to hold Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt for defying a subpoena requiring that he turn over an unredacted version of Mueller’s report, and its underlying evidence and documents. The president, in turn, asserted executive privilege over the files in a bid to protect them from release.

Meanwhile, the House Intelligence Committee, Oversight Committee, Ways and Means Committee and Financial Services Committee are all investigating the president and have aggressively sought his financial statements and documents for their probes, as well as testimony from high-profile Trump administration officials.

Thus far, the White House has directed the officials to defy their subpoenas to appear before Congress, and the president has vowed to block “all” subpoenas.

But Republicans, like House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Doug Collins, R-Ga., are shifting their focus to Barr’s review of the origins of the Russia investigation. Barr appointed U.S. attorney from Connecticut John Durham to lead an investigation into the FBI’s original Russia probe, and alleged misconduct related to Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants, as well as the FBI’s use of informants against the Trump campaign in 2016.

“It’s time for us to find out how this started and go from there,” Collins said on “Fox News Sunday.”"

Pentagon Tells the White House to Stop Politicizing Military,http://time.com,['Lolita C. Baldor'],,,,http://time.com/5599511/pentagon-white-house-politicizing-military/,"SEOUL, South Korea — The Pentagon has told the White House to stop politicizing the military, amid a furor over a Trump administration order to have the Navy ship named for the late U.S. Sen. John McCain hidden from view during President Donald Trump’s recent visit to Japan.

A U.S. defense official said Patrick Shanahan, Trump’s acting defense chief, is also considering sending out formal guidance to military units in order to avoid similar problems in the future.

Shanahan confirmed details about a Navy email that said the White House military office wanted the USS John McCain kept “out of sight” when Trump was in Japan about a week ago. The internal Navy email came to light last week, triggering a storm of outrage.

Trump, who long feuded with McCain, has said he knew nothing about the request, but added that “somebody did it because they thought I didn’t like him, OK? And they were well-meaning, I will say.”

Shanahan told reporters traveling with him to South Korea on Sunday that he is not planning to seek an investigation by the Pentagon’s internal watchdog into the matter “because there was nothing carried out” by the Navy. He added that he still needs to gather more information about exactly what happened and what service members did.

“How did the people receiving the information — how did they treat it,” Shanahan said. “That would give me an understanding on the next steps” to take.

Shanahan did not detail what those steps could be, but a defense official said Shanahan is considering a clearer directive to the military about avoiding political situations. The goal would be to ensure there is less ambiguity about how the military should support VIP events and how service members should respond to such political requests, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

Shanahan also said that he spoke with McCain’s wife, Cindy, a few days ago. He declined to provide any details.

The order to keep the Navy destroyer out of sight reflected what appeared to be an extraordinary White House effort to avoid offending an unpredictable president known for holding a grudge, including a particularly bitter one against McCain.

Trump’s acting chief of staff, in appearances on two Sunday news shows in the U.S., called the matter “much ado about nothing” and did not expect anyone working for the White House to face discipline. “To think that you’re going to get fired over this is silly,” said Mick Mulvaney, making the comparison to someone who tries to sit bickering colleagues apart from each other at an office meeting.

“The fact that some 23- or 24-year-old person on the advance team went to that site and said ‘Oh my goodness, there’s the John McCain, we all know how the president feels about the former senator, maybe that’s not the best backdrop, can somebody look into moving it?’ That’s not an unreasonable thing to ask,” Mulvaney said.

The McCain incident has dogged Shanahan throughout his weeklong trip to Asia, even as he tried to deal with critical national security issues involving the eroding U.S. relationship with China and the continuing threat from North Korea.

Shanahan, who has been serving in an acting capacity since the first of the year, has yet to be formally nominated by Trump as permanent defense chief. His speech to a major national security conference in Singapore on Saturday was a chance to audition for the job on the international stage.

A formal nomination has been expected, and Congress members have said they believe there will be a hearing on his nomination in the next month or so. The McCain issue is sure to come up, but it’s not clear how it may affect either his nomination or confirmation by the Senate. It may well depend on what steps he takes to respond to the matter in the coming days.

According to Shanahan spokesman Lt. Col. Joseph Buccino, Shanahan told his chief of staff on Friday to speak with the White House military office “and reaffirm his mandate that the department of defense will not be politicized.” Buccino said the chief of staff reported back that he delivered the message.

Asked what he has learned about the incident so far, Shanahan said he was told that despite the White House request, the Navy did not move the ship and that a barge that was in front of it was moved before Trump arrived. He said that a tarp that had been draped over the ship’s name was removed, but that it was put there for maintenance, not to obscure its identity.

Asked directly if members of his senior staff were aware of the White House request before the president’s visit, Shanahan said he’s been told they did not know. He also has said he was not aware of the request and that he would never have authorized it.

What is still unclear, however, is who at the Pentagon may have known about the request and either agreed with it or chose not to discourage it. It’s also not clear whether Navy leaders deliberately chose the McCain crew as one of the ships to be on holiday leave during Trump’s visit, or if other measures were taken to ensure that the McCain was not visible from where the president stood when he arrived on the USS Wasp to make remarks.

The warship , commissioned in 1994, was originally named for the senator’s father and grandfather, both Navy admirals named John Sidney McCain. Last year, the Navy rededicated the ship to honor the senator as well.

Jason Chaffetz: Lawbreaking FBI leaker must be prosecuted – Justice Department fails to do so,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Jason Chaffetz', 'Jason Chaffetz Is A Fox News Contributor Who Was The Chairman Of The U.S. House Oversight Committee When He Served As A Representative Utah. He Is The Author Of']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/jason-chaffetz-justice-department-leakers,"While the predictable news conference with Special Counsel Robert Mueller made headlines this week for repeating what we already knew, a bigger story from the Department of Justice broke that got far too little attention.

In a Wednesday report released by the Inspector General for the Department of Justice, we learned that the OIG was able to identify a former deputy assistant director at the FBI who violated the law by leaking sealed court documents to the media, engaging in repeated unauthorized contacts with journalists, and accepting a gift from the media.

BARR SAYS DOJ HAS 'MULTIPLE LEAK' PROBES UNDERWAY

We already knew leaking and unauthorized media contacts were a cultural and systemic problem at the FBI. A June 2018 OIG Report revealed the extent of the practice and provided a graphic illustration:

Although FBI policy strictly limits the employees who are authorized to speak to the media, we found that this policy appeared to be widely ignored during the period we reviewed. We identified numerous FBI employees, at all levels of the organization and with no official reason to be in contact with the media, who were nevertheless in frequent contact with reporters. The large number of FBI employees who were in contact with journalists during this time period impacted our ability to identify the sources of leaks.

But this week, we learned the OIG actually has identified one of the sources and suggested the allegations were supported by ""a preponderance of evidence."" Though that is certainly newsworthy, the real news was the Justice Department response. Officials mysteriously, though not surprisingly, declined to prosecute one of their own.

Creating new laws for theJustice Department to ignore does not solve the problem. But Congress can be part of the solution through the oversight function.

These are serious allegations against a very senior FBI official. How can the department not take action when there is direct evidence in hand? This is someone who deliberately and illegally disclosed sensitive information from sealed court filings. If the Justice Department looks the other way, what message does that send to the rest of the FBI? What better way to signal to the entire federal law enforcement apparatus that laws and rules are optional?

Unfortunately, we routinely have people at DOJ who put their thumb on the scale to impact politics. It's obviously part of the culture fostered by the two previous FBI directors, Robert Mueller and James Comey. They have both shown political animus and bias toward President Trump.

Comey himself released sealed information, likely for a political purposes. Mueller this week left no doubt of his own animus toward the president. No wonder the American people have lost faith in our federal law enforcement.

Not only is there no penalty for violating the law, there may actually be an incentive for doing so. For leakers with partisan motivations, the chance to impact an election may outweigh the risk of an unlikely prosecution.

If we want to instill confidence in the system, we need to be able to demonstrate that when somebody violates rules and laws within the FBI, they, too, will be prosecuted and held accountable.

There is little Congress can do legislatively. Leaking is already against the law. Creating new laws for the Justice Department to ignore does not solve the problem. But Congress can be part of the solution through the oversight function.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., should call on the Justice Department to answer to the American people for this failure to prosecute. Members of the Judiciary Committee in the House and Senate should question Inspector General Michael Horowitz about his findings and demand answers from the DOJ about the failure to prosecute. There may be no better way to get the answers the American people deserve.

State Department now requires U.S. visa applicants to share social media accounts,https://www.cbsnews.com,[],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/state-department-now-requires-us-visa-applicants-to-share-social-media-accounts-2019-06-01/,"The State Department is now requiring nearly all applicants for U.S. visas to submit their social media usernames, previous email addresses and phone numbers. It's a vast expansion of the Trump administration's enhanced screening of potential immigrants and visitors.

In a move that's just taken effect after approval of the revised application forms, the department says it has updated its immigrant and nonimmigrant visa forms to request the additional information, including ""social media identifiers,"" from almost all U.S. applicants.

The change, which was proposed in March 2018, is expected to affect about 15 million foreigners who apply for visas to enter the United States each year.

Social media, email and phone number histories had only been sought in the past from applicants who were identified for extra scrutiny, such as people who'd traveled to areas controlled by terrorist organizations. An estimated 65,000 applicants per year had fallen into that category.

The department says collecting the additional information from more applicants ""will strengthen our process for vetting these applicants and confirming their identity.""

The new rules apply to virtually all applicants for immigrant and nonimmigrant visas. The department estimated it would affect 710,000 immigrant visa applicants and 14 million nonimmigrant visa applicants, including those who want to come to the U.S. for business or education, according to an initial notice.

The new visa application forms list a number of social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube and require the applicant to provide any account names they may have had on them over the previous five years. They also give applicants the option to volunteer information about social media accounts on platforms not listed on the form.

In addition to their social media histories, visa applicants are now asked for five years of previously used telephone numbers, email addresses, international travel and deportation status, as well as whether any family members have been involved in terrorist activities.

Only applicants for certain diplomatic and official visa types are exempted from the requirements."
The EPA says a chemical in Monsanto's weed-killer doesn't cause cancer — but there's compelling evidence the agency is wrong,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Hilary Brueck'],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.businessinsider.com/glyphosate-cancer-dangers-roundup-epa-2019-5,"Gardeners Alva and Alberta Pilliod say they used Monsanto's Roundup spray to keep weeds off their driveway for more than two decades, applying the herbicide while wearing flip flops, shorts, and tank tops. Now, they both have Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL). In a lawsuit, they were awarded $2.05 billion in damages in May.

School groundskeeper Dewayne Johnson, now in his 40s, also used to spray Roundup up to 30 times every summer. He has the same blood cancer as the Pilliods, and won nearly $80 million in a suit last year.

A third man, Edwin Hardeman, used Roundup for more than 25 years to keep weeds off his oak trees. He got NHL, too. A jury in California ruled in March that Roundup was a ""substantial factor"" in his diagnosis.

More than 13,000 similar lawsuits have popped up in the US. Almost all are being filed by gardeners, groundskeepers, and other professional weed-whackers who allege that their consistent, repeated use of Roundup gave them cancer. One of the latest allegations came this week from 44-year-old groundskeeper Jeffrey Sabraski. Sabraski alleges he sprayed Roundup several times per week, wearing nothing but shorts and t-shirts, and has also developed NHL. He's suing Monsanto, as the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported on Wednesday.

Roundup is the most widely-used herbicide in the world, and its key chemical is called glyphosate. The plaintiffs in this recent surge of court cases say that Monsanto didn't sufficiently warn them about the potential health risks associated with the product or tell them how to protect themselves from exposure.

But teasing out the health risks of glyphosate isn't easy. The World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) says the chemical is ""probably"" carcinogenic to humans. But the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the agro-chemical giant Bayer, which now owns Monsanto, both say glyphosate isn't linked to cancer in any meaningful way.

""EPA continues to find that there are no risks to public health when glyphosate is used in accordance with its current label and that glyphosate is not a carcinogen,"" the agency said on its website. Canadian health authorities support the US' stance.

However, peeling back the curtain on the scientific studies that have looked at glyphosate thus far can tell us a lot about how the chemical can indeed be dangerous when people and animals are exposed to it in the wrong ways.

What Monsanto and the EPA say about glyphosate

Glyphosate, which has been in use around the world since the 1970s, blocks an enzyme pathway that helps plants grow. The herbicide's patent expired in 2000, and Indian and Chinese farmers are now the weed-killer's biggest buyers.

It's tricky for epidemiologists to say conclusively that something causes cancer, so what we know so far — from thousands of studies conducted in rats, mice, and humans — is that the pesticide might be linked with cancer, or it might not. Glyphosate might make cancer more likely to sprout up, since there's evidence it can encourage DNA damage. But more research is still needed to learn how, exactly, it affects the human body.

Monsanto maintains there's no good evidence the chemical causes cancer. The company often points to a 2017 study of more than 54,000 pesticide sprayers in Iowa and North Carolina (mostly farmers), which found no statistically significant association between glyphosate and cancer.

The company also often highlights the results of large-scale studies of French, Norwegian, and North American farmers that have found glyphosate to be safe.

But farmers are largely protected from the dangers of herbicides and pesticides, since they spray fields using industrial-grade farm equipment. In that same study, in fact, chemical sprayers who had the most exposure to glyphosate were found to have a slightly higher risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia than people who'd never used the weed-killer. The difference, however, was so small that more research is needed to confirm these results.

The EPA has also consistently said that consumers have nothing to worry about when it comes to glyphosate.

""In 2017, EPA published comprehensive ecological and human health risk assessments for glyphosate. No human health risks were identified,"" the agency said in April. However, the EPA cautioned that ""potential ecological risks were identified for terrestrial and aquatic plants, birds, and mammals, primarily from exposure to spray drift.""

Humans, of course, are terrestrial mammals, too. And gardeners who use lots of glyphosate — without much protection — would arguably also be exposed to spray drift.

""The evidence is not as strong so as to be absolutely sure"" Manolis Kogevinas, of the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, told Business Insider. ""But yeah, there's definitely a chance that they will develop cancer.""

The IARC has a different stance

In March 2015, the IARC convened a group of 17 experts from 11 countries to determine the potential human health dangers of glyphosate, along with four other pesticides and herbicides. The international, non-partisan committee concluded that glyphosate is ""probably"" carcinogenic to humans, based on studies in humans and lab animals.

That's why glyphosate is now a ""Group 2A"" carcinogen, according to IARC. That means that the chemical is considered to be a contributor to cancer, but not on the level of more well known cancer-causers like formaldehyde and UV radiation.

But the IARC also has a complicated history with glyphosate research. Reuters reported in 2017 that the agency had cut sections out of a draft report that suggested glyphosate might not contribute to cancer. In a follow-up letter to Congress, IARC director Christopher Wild wrote that the group revised that draft because some of the data came from ""a review article co-authored by a Monsanto scientist.""

He added that the information from that article ""was insufficient for independent evaluation of the individual studies and the conclusions reached by the Monsanto scientist.""

Why these groups came to different conclusions about glyphosate

A tightly reviewed and vetted paper published in the journal Environmental Sciences Europe earlier this year looked into why the EPA and IARC appear to disagree about the risks of glyphosate. It found that the EPA's conclusions relied mainly on ""unpublished regulatory studies,"" many of them industry-funded. The IARC, on the other hand, looked at ""mostly peer-reviewed studies.""

That could explain why 99% of the glyphosate studies that the EPA considered found that the chemical is not a cancer-causer, while 70% of the studies the WHO looked at suggested it probably is.

""It's kind of easy to understand why EPA would say, 'Well, geez, you know, it must be okay,'"" study author Charles Benbrook, an agricultural economist who now serves as an expert witness for plaintiffs involved in Roundup litigation, told Business Insider. ""It was okay because they were looking at a bunch of negative studies that Monsanto [did]. Monsanto repeated essentially the same study like 30 times.""

Benbrook alleges that the reason so many big payouts are being won in court is that Monsanto didn't properly warn people who used Roundup at home or on a small scale that they should wear protective clothing when they applied the weed-killer.

""It's not farmers out in the field with their large, modern spray rigs, where the operator is inside a steel and glass cab with a sophisticated air filtration system that essentially eliminates exposure,"" Benbrook said. ""Some people are spraying Roundup 6 or 8 hours a day for five days a week with this kind of handheld equipment.""

Monsanto maintains that as long as consumers follow the instructions on the label, glyphosate-based herbicides are perfectly safe. The company also points to hundreds of glyphosate studies in EPA databases that were not Monsanto-funded.

""At the end of the day, whether you're in the court of law, regulatory agencies, or court of public opinion, it's the science that should matter here,"" a Bayer spokesman said in an email to Business Insider. ""And the extensive body of science over 40 years, including several recent human epidemiology studies, shows that glyphosate-based herbicides are not associated with NHL. Customers who know these products best continue to rely on them.""

The company also points to the courtroom testimony of Robert Phalen, an environmental scientist who testified in the Pilliod's trial that human skin actually repels glyphosate. (Phalen once authored a textbook with another scientist also named Robert Phalen, who has said modern air may be ""a little too clean."")

Monsanto tweaked its Roundup formula in Europe

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that pets stay off lawns and plants that have just been sprayed with glyphosate, since animals can develop digestive or intestinal issues if they touch the substance when it hasn't dried. Glyphosate has also recently been linked to more severe cases of fatty liver disease in people.

But beyond glyphosate, there's another compound in Roundup: soap-like detergents called surfactants that help the chemical penetrate the leaves of plants to work its weed-killing magic. Benbrook believes Monsanto should be doing more to warn people about how surfactants work and how to protect themselves.

""It's the surfactants that are carrying the glyphosate first through the skin and inside the body, and then inside of cells where damage can be done to DNA,"" he said.

In Europe, Benbrook noted, surfactant chemicals have been made less toxic for consumers. In the US, however, there's been less regulatory pressure, so Monsanto has not changed Roundup formulas in the same way. ""When juries learn that Monsanto is making a product that's at least 10 times, maybe 100 times safer all across Europe?"" he said. ""That's not acceptable. That's one of the reasons that I think we can expect a continuation of these mammoth punitive damage awards that have occurred in the first three trials.""

Bayer said that allegation is one ""we don't believe is supported by the extensive body of science.""

The company told Business Insider in an email that ""regulators have specifically assessed the safety of the class of surfactants used in glyphosate-based herbicides; in 2009, the U.S. EPA concluded that these surfactants are not carcinogenic.""

The statement added that Monsanto tweaked the surfactants in products sold in Europe ""due to market preferences or country-specific requirements in the region.""

Traces of glyphosate in food don't seem to hurt people

As lawsuits about glyphosate have entered the spotlight, some people have expressed concerns about the trace amounts of the chemical in our food.

The traces of glyphosate found in a bowl of Cheerios or a glass of wine are probably not going to kill anyone, though.

""Using the internationally accepted limits, an average adult male would have to drink over 1,000 liters of wine a day to reach any level of risk,"" pharmacologist Ian Musgrave recently wrote in The Conversation.

That said, it's worth remembering that different people's bodies can react differently to chemicals. The foods pregnant women eat impact how their fetus grows and develops, for example, and the developing digestive systems of infants and toddlers may be more delicate than others. Scientists are still studying how pesticides can impact childhood brain development.

Kogevinas still doesn't think the chemical's presence in food is much to worry about, though.

""If you ask me, is the glyphosate the problem in my food? No, it is not,"" he said. But he noted that he prefers to buy organic produce to avoid pesticides more generally.

Kogevinas lives in Barcelona, where the Roundup formulations adhere to the European standards, but that didn't affect his decision about whether or not to buy it: He has opted never to use glyphosate in his own garden."

That is the question for now-former Special Counsel Robert Mueller, left hanging by the statement his office jointly issued with Justice Department flacks on Wednesday, clarifying (as it were) remarks he had made hours earlier at his parting-shot press conference.

At issue is Mueller’s decision to punt on the question of whether President Trump should be indicted for obstruction of justice. In his startling remarks, Mueller sought to justify himself by citing instruction from the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel. The longstanding OLC opinion, an outgrowth of Nixon- and Clinton-era scandals, holds that a sitting president may not be indicted. The two press offices were struggling to reconcile (a) Mueller’s pointed reliance on this OLC guidance at the presser with (b) his prior disclaimers of such reliance.

According to Attorney General William Barr, in a meeting over two weeks before Mueller submitted his final report, the special counsel emphatically denied that his refusal to render a prosecutorial judgment on obstruction hinged on the OLC guidance. Naturally, in their continuing quest to frame Barr as the most diabolical villain since Lex Luthor, the media-Democrat complex insisted that the AG must be lying.

This is what derangement will do to you. I do not think Mueller’s contradictory assertions are that hard to figure out. But if you were inclined to blame sleight of hand, the culprit would be Mueller. You’ll notice that when we finally heard from him on Wednesday, he lauded Barr’s good faith, never claiming that the AG had misrepresented him. Moreover, the conversation between them on the OLC guidance was not a one-on-one affair. There were other people in the room when Mueller denied that the OLC guidance was his rationale for abdicating.

DHS says citizenship approvals rose in 2018,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Stephen Dinan']",05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/may/31/dhs-says-citizenship-approvals-rose-2018/,"Homeland Security reached a five-year high in approvals of citizenship applications last year, and swore in more people as naturalized citizens as well, according to the new statistical report released Friday night.

Those numbers contradict the criticisms of congressional Democrats who had complained about backlogs building at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the Homeland Security branch that handles legal immigration.

The new report also suggests that far from a crackdown, the government is processing more asylum-seeker petitions than any of the last four years. That included a 61 percent increase from 2017 to 2018 in affirmative asylum applications — though refugee interviews are down from more than 1250,000 in 2016, the last year under President Barack Obama, to just 26,400 in fiscal year 2018 under President Trump.

Still, when the whole panoply of humanitarian programs is considered — asylum, refugees, crime victim visas, Temporary Protected Status and screening for credible fear or reasonable fear of persecution — the numbers were 32 percent higher than fiscal year 2017. Credible fear and reasonable fear are first steps on the asylum track.

USCIS’s workload has become contentious in recent years, with immigrant-rights groups accusing the Trump administration of building a bureaucratic “wall” to deny people the chance to enter the U.S. legally. The accusation is a play on their disdain for Mr. Trump’s border wall intended to stop illegal immigration.

Hispanic Democrats in Congress say things are so bad that they requested — and have been granted — an investigation to be done by the Government Accountability Office. Rep. Joaquin Castro, chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said the case backlog is an example of “President Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda.”

Yet the backlog in citizenship applications, for example, exploded during the end of the Obama administration. The Washington Times, which tracked the explosion at the time, sought comment from immigrant-rights activists and lawmakers, including Democrats, but didn’t find many who blamed the Obama administration for the slow processing.

The new numbers from USCIS also detail some of the more hidden parts of the agency’s work, such as its efforts to weed out fraud in legal immigration applications.

Experts say fraud is rampant, but the agency has not released any major fraud assessments in years.

Still, the Fraud Detection and National Security division reported 149,3000 investigative leads or actions year — a 14 percent increase over 2017. That included 30,400 tips of fraud, 7,600 national security matters and nearly 17,000 public safety matters.

FDNS also reported screening social media in 11,700 cases.

"Queen Elizabeth set to fete Trump, as she has so many other US presidents",https://www.cnn.com,['Betsy Klein'],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/01/politics/donald-trump-queen-elizabeth-ii-state-visit/index.html,"(CNN) Queen Elizabeth II has met with nearly every American President since Dwight Eisenhower during her more than 67 years on the throne. Next week, she'll welcome President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump back to the United Kingdom, this time for a rare state visit.

Though the Trumps and the Royal Family are expected to adhere to the highest levels of protocol during the visit, Trump's remarks ahead of the trip threaten to damage goodwill with the Queen -- he publicly insulted her grandson's wife on the eve of the visit.

During an interview with The Sun, Trump was asked about comments made by Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, ahead of the 2016 election. Speaking on ""The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore"" in 2016, Markle called Trump misogynistic and said his politics are divisive, saying she would move to Canada if he won the presidency.

Trump responded, ""I didn't know that she was nasty. I hope she is OK,"" later adding, ""I am sure she will go excellently (as a royal). She will be very good."" Buckingham Palace had no comment on Trump's interview regarding Markle.

The Trumps previously met with the Queen at Windsor Castle last June, a more informal meeting over tea.

The trip comes amid a blitz of foreign travel for the President and will be the Trumps' second state visit in less than two weeks. In May, they were Japanese Emperor Naruhito's first state guests since he ascended to the Chrysanthemum Throne earlier that month.

For the Trump's official visit, Buckingham Palace is pulling out all of the Royal stops befitting a world leader. An official state visit requires the formal invitation of the Queen to a head of state ""on the advice of the Foreign and Commonwealth office,"" per Buckingham Palace , and usually involves a ceremonial welcome, a state banquet, other meetings with British officials and a formal farewell.

Trump, who is known to appreciate pomp and circumstance, is sure to revel in the pageantry. His adult children, Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, Eric Trump and Tiffany Trump, will also be joining him and the first lady.

Likewise, they ""will have the opportunity to meet some other members of the Royal Family"" during the arrival ceremony, said a senior administration official briefing reporters on the trip. America's own member of the Royal Family, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, is not expected to attend, as she has largely remained out of the public spotlight since giving birth in early May.

The 'special relationship'

The ""special relationship"" with the United Kingdom also carries special significance for the President. After their 2018 tea, Trump told interviewer Piers Morgan that he was thinking of his mother when he met the Queen.

""I was thinking about my mother. My mother passed away a while ago and she was a tremendous fan of the Queen. She thought she was a woman of elegance, and my mother felt she was a great woman. I remember even as a little guy, if there was any kind of a ceremony to do with the Queen, my mother would be watching the television -- she wanted to see it,"" Trump said at the time.

Trump recalled: ""I was walking up and I was saying (to Melania), 'Can you imagine my mother seeing this scene? Windsor. Windsor Castle.' And it was beautiful, it was really beautiful but the Queen is terrific. She is so sharp, so wise, so beautiful. Up close, you see she's so beautiful. She's a very special person.""

Trump told Morgan that the Queen walked him through all of the presidents she had met.

""Harry Truman was the first president that she got to meet and know, and she went through a whole list. It was a very nice moment, Piers, very nice,"" he said.

The Queen met President Harry Truman when she was still Princess Elizabeth, during a trip to Washington in 1951 at the age of 25. She and Prince Philip stayed at Blair House with Truman and his family since the White House was under a four-year major renovation, according to the White House Historical Association.

State visits

Since then, she's met with every US President, with the one exception of President Lyndon B. Johnson. But this is only the third state visit from a US president during Queen Elizabeth II's reign; the invitation has only been extended to Trump's most recent predecessors -- Barack and Michelle Obama in May 2011 and George W. and Laura Bush in November 2003.

She hosted the Kennedys for a banquet -- not an official state visit -- in 1961, which was recently depicted in the Netflix drama ""The Crown,"" hinting at an icy, if not entirely accurate , relationship between the Queen and first lady Jacqueline Kennedy.

The Nixons, Carters, and Clintons also met her informally in 1970, 1977, and 1994, respectively, and she hosted a formal dinner honoring the Reagans at Windsor Castle in 1982. Carter drew the Queen Mother's ire during that 1977 visit when he kissed her on the lips.

""Nobody has done that since my husband died,"" she reportedly said.

The Queen has traveled to the United States for informal visits and state visits multiple times during her reign. For her first state visit to the US as Queen in 1957, she and Prince Philip stayed in the same suite in the White House in which her parents, King George VI and the Queen Mother, had stayed in 1939, according to the White House Historical Association, and she was greeted with large crowds on her motorcade from the airport.

At the White House

In 1976, President Gerald Ford and Betty Ford hosted her for a state dinner in the Rose Garden. President Ronald Reagan and first lady Nancy Reagan served the Queen enchiladas and chile rellenos when she visited them at their Santa Barbara ranch in 1983, and days later, hosted a State Dinner in her honor at San Francisco's M.H. de Young Memorial Museum.

She rolled up her sleeves -- though not literally -- during an official state visit in 1991, planting a tree on the White House South Lawn alongside President George H. W. Bush, replacing a storm-damaged tree her father planted in 1937. And she attended tie state dinner at the George W. Bush White House in 2007.

She shared a warm relationship with the Obamas, as Michelle Obama recently recalled

""So, I had all this protocol buzzing in my head, and I was like, 'Don't trip down the stairs and don't touch anybody, whatever you do,' "" the former first lady said during a book tour event. ""And so, the Queen says, 'Just get in, sit wherever,' and she's telling you one thing and you're remembering protocol and she says, 'Oh it's all rubbish, just get in.' ""

It remains to be seen whether the Queen shares the same affection for Trump.

Asked if he got the feeling she liked him, Trump told Morgan: ""Well, I don't want to speak for her, but I can tell you I liked her. So, usually that helps. But I liked her a lot."""

The move has alarmed human rights activists, especially those focused on LGBT rights and women's rights, who fear it will mean an end to promoting protections for both groups around the world.

""It's an important review of how we think about human rights inside of our efforts in diplomacy,"" Pompeo told reporters Thursday, adding the effort is focused on ""how do we make sure that we have a solid definition of human rights upon which to tell all our diplomats around the world how to engage on those important issues.""

The State Department has declined to comment beyond Pompeo's remarks. But it did issue a public notice in the Federal Register on Thursday that says the body, named the Commission on Unalienable Rights, will provide Pompeo ""advice and recommendations concerning international human rights matters"" and meet about once a month.

""The Commission will provide fresh thinking about human rights discourse where such discourse has departed from our nation's founding principles of natural law and natural rights,"" according to the notice.

Use of the term ""natural law"" has concerned some advocacy groups and department staff, as it is interpreted in this case as ""God-given"" or religiously-based rights that affect issues like sexuality, abortion rights, and more. In particular, the phrase has been prominent in the work of Princeton professor Robert George.

George has played a prominent role in the creation of the commission, according to a source familiar with the plans for the commission. George, co-founder of the National Organization for Marriage, a nonprofit that advocates against same-sex marriage, is among the 15 academics recommended to make up the panel, according to the source.

Author of the 1999 book ""In Defense of Natural Law,"" where he argued against homosexuality and abortion rights and in favor of religious liberty, George also wrote the original concept note that outlined a vision for the commission, the source said.

The commission ""is absolutely about those issues, but it's not explicit in the paper,"" the source said. ""It questions whether and which human rights are universal.""

George did not respond to a request for comment.

Dr. Kiron Skinner, Pompeo's director of policy planning, is listed as the top official on the Federal Register notice. Skinner, who leads the department's long-term foreign policy strategy team, recently raised eyebrows by describing the U.S. rivalry with China as a clash of civilizations and ""the first time that we will have a great power competitor that is not Caucasian.""

Along with George and Skinner, the full list of participants has been recommended to the Secretary, but he still has to approve the final list. As part of the process, however, the department had to publish the Federal Register notice, which is dated May 22.

Igniting further concern about the project is the fact that the department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor was not consulted in the process, two sources told ABC News.

""The wording of the Commission's mandate raised eyebrows with human rights advocates and congressional staff. The fact that it was announced with no prior outreach to or input from the human rights community immediately raised concerns over its motives... [and] the State Department already has a well-defined understanding of how to advance human rights and maintains several offices dedicated to various human rights issues,"" said Rob Berschinski, who served as deputy assistant secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, or DRL, in the Obama administration.

Pompeo said Thursday the project is ""separate"" from DRL, but ""deeply connected to the work that not only DRL does, but that the entire State Department does around the world.""

Promoting the right to religious freedom has been a high priority for Pompeo, who will host his second summit on the topic this July. But he and the Trump administration, in general, have been criticized for pulling punches on U.S. partners over their human rights abuses. Saudi Arabia and Egypt, for example, have been embraced by the top Trump officials despite their crackdowns on political opposition, women's rights activists, and NGOs.

""If the administration truly wants to engage in a meaningful dialogue about respecting human rights, then we are happy to have that discussion. But the fact that this panel was announced without details or consultation with human rights experts suggests that this may be just another instrument to negate rights, rather than protect them,"" said Tarah Demant, director of Amnesty International's Gender, Sexuality, and Identity program."
US Border Patrol agents will deploy to Guatemala to train 'side-by-side',https://www.cnn.com,['Geneva Sands'],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/31/politics/us-border-patrol-agents-will-train-guatemala/index.html,"(CNN) US Border Patrol agents and other Department of Homeland Security law enforcement officers will be sent to Guatemala to assist in training missions with local authorities as part of a two-year plan aimed at decreasing migration flows to the United States.

Agents will be ""side-by-side"" with local Guatemalan authorities, deployed to locations where US law enforcement has not traditionally operated, according to a senior DHS official.

This is a unique surge of DHS personnel to Guatemala, with a ""significant increase"" in US law enforcement presence in the country, said acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan.

The deployment of DHS officers follows an agreement signed earlier this week between the US and Guatemalan governments. It comes as the administration is trying to find a way to stem the influx of migrant families, mostly from Central America, through Mexico to the US.

The number of migrants illegally crossing the the southern US border has been on a steady upswing, resulting in dangerous overcrowding in US holding facilities at the border. The month of May is on pace to have the highest number of border crossings in over 12 years, according to McAleenan.

US Department of Energy is now referring to fossil fuels as “freedom gas”,https://arstechnica.com,['Megan Geuss'],,,,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/05/us-department-of-energy-is-now-referring-to-fossil-fuels-as-freedom-gas/,"Call it a rebranding of ""energy dominance.""

In a press release published on Tuesday, two Department of Energy officials used the terms ""freedom gas"" and ""molecules of US freedom"" to replace your average, everyday term ""natural gas.""

The press release was fairly standard , announcing the expansion of a Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) terminal at the Freeport facility on Quintana Island, Texas. It would have gone unnoticed had an E&E News reporter not noted the unique metonymy ""molecules of US freedom.""

DOE Assistant Secretary for Fossil Energy Steven Winberg is quoted as saying, ""With the US in another year of record-setting natural gas production, I am pleased that the Department of Energy is doing what it can to promote an efficient regulatory system that allows for molecules of US freedom to be exported to the world.”

Also in the press release, US Under Secretary of Energy Mark W. Menezes refers to natural gas as ""freedom gas"" in his quote: “Increasing export capacity from the Freeport LNG project is critical to spreading freedom gas throughout the world by giving America’s allies a diverse and affordable source of clean energy.""

Slate notes that the term ""freedom gas"" seems to have originated from an event with DOE Secretary Rick Perry. Earlier this year, the secretary signed an order to double the amount of LNG exports to Europe, saying, “The United States is again delivering a form of freedom to the European continent. And rather than in the form of young American soldiers, it’s in the form of liquefied natural gas.”

A reporter at the order signing jokingly asked whether the LNG shipments should be called ""freedom gas,"" and Perry said, ""I think you may be correct in your observation.""

If the DOE is still running with the term as a joke, then the wit in the Energy Secretary's office is bone dry. Ars contacted the DOE to see if ""freedom gas"" and ""molecules of US freedom"" are now going to be standard in department communication with the public. We are also curious if any potential drop in LNG exports could result in patriotism bloat. The DOE has not responded, though we'll update the story if it does.

According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), Canada, Mexico, South Korea, and Japan were the top importers of freedom gas last year. China, India, and the UK buy a smaller number of molecules of US freedom."
"DOJ watchdog: Former FBI official illegally leaked court docs, disclosed 'sensitive' information and took gift from media",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-watchdog-finds-fmr-fbi-deputy-assistant-director-leaked-sensitive-information-took-gift-from-media-but-declines-prosecution,"The Justice Department's internal watchdog announced in an investigative summary released Wednesday that an unnamed former FBI deputy assistant director engaged in ""misconduct,"" including leaking ""sensitive"" information to the media, violating federal law by disclosing sealed court records and taking a gift from someone in the media.

Nevertheless, the inspector general (IG) indicated, without explanation, that ""prosecution of the DAD [deputy assistant director] was declined."" The investigation's findings will be referred to the FBI for potential further action, the IG said.

The official became the second high-level FBI employee to be formally rebuked by the IG over media contacts seen as improper. Former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe was fired from the bureau in March 2018 by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions after an inspector general report revealed that he ""lacked candor"" when discussing his communications about federal probes with members of the media.

The IG first indicated in its June 2018 report on DOJ and FBI misconduct that ""although FBI policy strictly limits the employees who are authorized to speak to the media, we found that this policy appeared to be widely ignored during the period we reviewed.""

The IG, flagging what it called an apparent ""cultural"" problem at the bureau, said at the time it would announce the conclusion of multiple separate ""investigations"" into the matter at a later date. The Wednesday report appeared to be the opening salvo in those reports. A distinct, comprehensive IG report covering a variety of additional matters, including potential FBI surveillance abuses, is expected in a matter of weeks.

John Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, and John Huber, the U.S. attorney in Utah, are conducting independent parallel probes into the FBI and DOJ. Last week, President Trump authorized Attorney General William Barr to declassify and release materials pertinent to the reviews.

The investigative summary released Wednesday specifically found by a preponderance of evidence that the DAD had ""engaged in misconduct when the DAD accepted a ticket, valued at approximately $225, to attend a media-sponsored dinner, as a gift from a member of the media, in violation of federal regulations and FBI policy.""

STRZOK'S SPECIAL COUNSEL PHONE TOTALLY WIPED BY RECORDS OFFICER WHO ASSUMED NOTHING IMPORTANT WAS ON THERE

The report also assessed that the DAD ""disclosed to the media the existence of information that had been filed under seal in federal court, in violation of 18 USC § 401, Contempt of Court, provided without authorization FBI law enforcement sensitive information to reporters on multiple occasions; and had dozens of official contacts with the media without authorization, in violation of FBI policy."" Contempt of court can be punished by a jail term or a fine, at the court's discretion.

Media leaks played a central role in advancing the narrative that the Trump campaign may have colluded with Russia, and Republican lawmakers have charged that the FBI and DOJ planted sensitive information to further their own political and investigative goals.

The FBI, for example, extensively relied on news articles -- including one from Yahoo News -- to obtain a surveillance warrant to monitor former Trump aide Carter Page. The FBI did not inform the FISA court that the Yahoo article relied on a source that, according to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the FBI knew was politically motivated. Internal FBI text messages obtained by Fox News also show FBI brass fretting that a senior DOJ officials had similar concerns about a FISA source's bias.

And text messages between ex-FBI employees and former lovers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, unearthed last year, revealed that government officials were ""leaking like mad"" in the run-up to the Trump-Russia collusion probe.

""In addition to the significant number of communications between FBI employees and journalists, we identified social interactions between FBI employees and journalists that were, at a minimum, inconsistent with FBI policy and department ethics rules,"" the IG wrote in June. ""For example, we identified instances where FBI employees received tickets to sporting events from journalists, went on golfing outings with media representatives, were treated to drinks and meals after work by reporters, and were the guests of journalists at nonpublic social events.""

The IG concluded by describing ""the harm caused by leaks, fear of potential leaks, and a culture of unauthorized media contacts.""

""We do not believe the problem is with the FBI’s policy, which we found to be clear and unambiguous,"" the IG added. ""Rather, we concluded that these leaks highlight the need to change what appears to be a cultural attitude.""

'Trump Baby' blimp to fly in London for U.S. president's visit,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-britain-blimp/trump-baby-blimp-to-fly-in-london-for-us-presidents-visit-idUSKCN1T30IW,"LONDON (Reuters) - The “Trump Baby” inflatable balloon that was the focus of protests when the U.S. president visited London last year will fly again this week when he returns for state visit including a lavish banquet hosted by the queen, activists said.

The team behind the blimp said on Sunday it would be flown at locations near Donald Trump throughout his visit, after a crowdfunding campaign raised a target of 30,000 pounds ($38,000) for groups backing causes from climate action to women’s rights.

This six-meter high blimp, which depicts Trump as a snarling, diaper-wearing orange baby, became a rallying symbol for hundreds of thousands of anti-Trump protesters, who packed central London during his previous trip.

“Trump will try his best to avoid the public on his trip, but with Trump Baby flying we’re sending a very clear message of solidarity to those affected by his despicable politics,” said Ajuub Faraji, one of the organizers who label themselves Trump blimp “Babysitters”.

Trump and his wife Melania are due in Britain on June 3-5 for a state visit - a pomp-laden affair involving a banquet at Buckingham Palace. The invitation comes from Queen Elizabeth although the decision was taken on her behalf by politicians.

It is the most prestigious welcome Britain can offer a dignitary, a step above last year’s official visit.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who gave approval to demonstrators to fly the blimp last year, strongly criticized the government’s decision to offer such a high honor to Trump this year.

It is “un-British to be rolling out the red carpet this week for a formal state visit for a president whose divisive behavior flies in the face of the ideals America was founded upon – equality, liberty and religious freedom,” Khan wrote in the Observer newspaper.

Nigel Farage, a Trump ally and one of the leading campaigners to bring Britain out of the European Union, called the decision to allow the blimp last year “the biggest insult to a sitting U.S. president ever”.

While much of the British public is hostile to Trump, there have been calls to tone down protests against him during this visit, when he will attend observances of the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landing by U.S. and British forces on the beaches of Nazi-occupied France during World War Two.

“This is not, then, all about Donald Trump; it is about honoring a crucial offensive that helped bring an end to the war in Europe,” the Evening Standard newspaper wrote in an editorial, noting that for many surviving veterans it was the last major anniversary they would be able to attend. “The U.S. president is right to attend; whatever we think of Mr Trump, we should make him welcome for this important anniversary.”"
State Department to launch new human rights panel stressing 'natural law',https://www.politico.com,['Nahal Toosi'],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/human-rights-state-department-1348014,"The Commission on Unalienable Rights will advise Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a move that has surprised and puzzled human rights activists. | Chris J. Ratcliffe/Getty Images foreign policy State Department to launch new human rights panel stressing 'natural law'

The Trump administration plans to launch a new panel to offer ""fresh thinking” on international human rights and “natural law,” a move some activists fear is aimed at narrowing protections for women and members of the LGBT community.

The new body, to be called the Commission on Unalienable Rights, will advise Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, according to a notice the State Department quietly published Thursday on the Federal Register.

Story Continued Below

“The Commission will provide fresh thinking about human rights discourse where such discourse has departed from our nation's founding principles of natural law and natural rights,” states the notice, which is dated May 22.

Several human rights activists said Thursday that they were surprised by the move and trying to learn details. Some privately said they worry that talk of the “nation’s founding principles” and “natural law” are coded signals of plans to focus less on protecting women and LGBT people.

The word “natural” in such context is often interpreted to mean “God-given,” a phrasing that is less common in modern human rights literature but which could signal a religious component, experts said.

Activists and former U.S. officials noted that the Trump administration’s record on human rights so far is spotty at best.

“Many in the human rights community will welcome an opportunity to advise the Trump Administration on where its policies contradict America’s founding principles. There will be much to discuss,” said Rob Berschinski, a top official with Human Rights First.

The State Department already has an entire bureau devoted to the issues of human rights, democracy and labor, and it was not clear whether officials in that bureau were involved or even aware of the plans for the new commission.

The top State Department contact listed on the notice was Kiron Skinner, Pompeo's director of policy planning. Her team acts like an in-house think tank that considers long-term foreign policy strategy.

Skinner drew criticism recently for seeming to suggest that China, a rising power, is such a fundamentally different culture from the United States that arguments about human rights may not have much effect in dialogue with Beijing. Skinner’s defenders have argued she is a serious thinker who probably simply stumbled in trying to articulate her point.

State Department officials were not able to offer details about the planned commission on Thursday.

But in remarks to reporters after this article was first published, Pompeo said the goal of the panel was to sort out “how do we connect up what it is we’re trying to achieve throughout the world, and how do we make sure that we have a solid definition of human rights upon which to tell all our diplomats around the world.”

“It was a project that I wanted to proceed on, and it’s an important review of how we think about human rights inside of our efforts in diplomacy,” he said. He added that while the panel is separate from the human rights bureau, it is “deeply connected” to that bureau’s work.

Former top U.S. officials who dealt with rights issues expressed puzzlement over the commission’s creation.

“On the one hand it’s commendable that the secretary wants to place more emphasis on these issues, given that the administration to date has not been very outspoken on them,” said David Kramer, who served as the assistant secretary of State for human rights under the administration of Republican President George W. Bush. “On the other hand, I’m not sure what this commission is supposed to do that the human rights bureau doesn’t already do.”

“I don’t think this is the advisory committee for expanding rights,” quipped Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.), a congressman who held the same assistant secretary role in the administration of President Barack Obama.

Generally speaking, President Donald Trump and his aides have de-emphasized the role of human rights in their foreign policy, raising the issue only selectively — typically to raise pressure on countries considered adversaries.

The Republican administration has, for instance, highlighted the plight of female activists seeking more freedom in Iran, a longtime U.S. nemesis, but largely ignored similar challenges facing such activists in Saudi Arabia, a longtime U.S. ally.

The administration has made promoting religious freedom overseas a high priority, a move that has delighted Trump’s many evangelical Christian supporters.

But the administration also has rolled back domestic regulations aimed at protecting members of the LGBT community, especially those who are transgender.

It also has cut down sections about women’s reproductive rights in the State Department’s annual human rights report and made attempts to eliminate references to “sexual and reproductive health” in U.N. documents.

According to the notice posted Thursday, the new commission will meet at least once a month. It is not clear who will serve on the panel or when their appointments will take effect, but activists and former U.S. officials noted that its composition will greatly affect the policies it promotes."
Migrants at overcrowded border facilities may become violent: DHS watchdog,https://nypost.com,['June'],06-01-2019,2019,6,https://nypost.com/2019/06/01/migrants-at-overcrowded-border-facilities-may-become-violent-dhs-watchdog/,"Migrants seeking asylum and being held at an overcrowded US Border Patrol facility in Texas could become violent due to the inhumane conditions, an internal Department of Homeland Security watchdog found.

The El Paso Del Norte Processing Center in West Texas had packed 900 people into a building meant to hold just 125 when the agency’s inspector general made a surprise visit to the facility in early May, according to a report released Friday.

One cell built to hold 12 people contained 76 migrants, forcing detainees to stand on toilets to find room to breathe.

“Border Patrol management on site said there is an ongoing concern that rising tensions among detainees could turn violent,” the report found.

On Wednesday, Border Patrol caught 1,036 migrants illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border near El Paso —largest single group ever."
Department of Corrections turns over disputed documents to Justice Department,https://www.al.com,"['William Thornton', 'Wthornton Al.Com']",06-01-2019,2019,6,https://www.al.com/news/2019/06/department-of-corrections-turns-over-disputed-documents-to-justice-department.html,"The Alabama Department of Corrections surrendered documents this week that the U.S. Department of Justice said dealt with reports of excessive force and sexual abuse against inmates by correctional officers.

According to a four-page motion filed Thursday by lawyers representing the DOJ, the ADOC provided documents “specifically related to use of force and sexual abuse by staff.” As a result, the DOJ withdrew a petition to enforce a subpoena that it filed last October.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Gray Borden had given both sides until Friday to come up with a solution to the impasse.

There is no word yet on what DOJ will do with the documents. In April the Justice Department released a report on its two-and-a-half-year investigation into violence and poor conditions within Alabama’s men’s prisons. The DOJ concluded that there is reasonable cause to believe that conditions in the prisons violate the Eighth Amendment.

Last month, in an effort to get the contested documents, Justice Department lawyers said there are still areas of the investigation that have “not been completed.”

A footnote on the first page of the 62-page report on Alabama’s prisons says that the investigation was opened to look at whether ADOC was adequately ensuring inmate safety from physical and sexual violence between inmates, and whether inmates had safe and sanitary living conditions.

However, the footnote stated that an investigation into a third issue - whether inmates were safe from excessive force and sexual abuse from staff members – is ongoing “because the Department’s petition to enforce its subpoena for documents relevant to that issue is pending with the court.”

On Oct. 12, 2018, DOJ filed a petition requesting the federal court force ADOC to turn over a series of individual prisoner investigative files, and documents on open and closed investigations, including autopsy reports on some inmates and some medical records not previously made available at correctional facilities.

The filing also requested weekly reports from ADOC’s Intelligence and Investigations Division from September 2016 to September 2017.

Since 2012, Alabama men’s and women’s prisons have come under repeated scrutiny for staffing and safety, as well as a pervasive atmosphere of documented sexual and physical abuse."
Mark Meadows sends referral to DOJ about mysterious UK communique about Christopher Steele,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/mark-meadows-sends-referral-to-doj-about-mysterious-uk-communique-about-christopher-steele,"Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., sent a referral to the Justice Department about a message a top United Kingdom national security official delivered to the Trump transition team a week before President Trump's inauguration.

Congressional investigators told the Hill that in January 2017 then-U.K. national security adviser Sir Mark Lyall Grant hand-delivered a memo to soon-to-be national security adviser Michael Flynn's team that asserted the U.K. government had doubts about the credibility of British ex-spy Christopher Steele. Recent reports suggest Steele had briefed British intelligence officials on his dossier after the 2016 presidential election, and the heads of MI5 and MI6 were made aware of the contents of the dossier by late November.

“A whistleblower recently revealed the existence of a communique from our allies in Great Britain during the early days of the Russia collusion investigation,” Meadows said.

“Based on my conversations with that individual, and the credible timelines that are supported by other events, I made a referral to Attorney General William Barr and Inspector General Michael Horowitz for further investigation,” the North Carolina Republican added. “There now is overwhelming evidence to suggest that on multiple occasions the FBI was warned that Christopher Steele and the dossier had severe credibility issues.”

Steele compiled a dossier that contained salacious and unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia. He was hired by opposition research firm Fusion GPS and was paid, in part, by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign. His dossier has become a flashpoint of concern for Republicans after the declassification of a House Intelligence Committee memo that said the FBI used the unverified research to obtain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants beginning in October 2016 to wiretap onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

GOP investigators learned of the communique's existence within the past few weeks by a whistleblower who was part of Flynn's team and are pressing for answers ahead of Trump's visit to the United Kingdom early next month. Its existence came to light a month after the revelation of a State Department official's notes about an October 2016 meeting with Steele, sent to the FBI, that warned he was unreliable and that he had said he was being encouraged to get his allegations out prior to the 2016 presidential election.

The communique could be significant as it would have been delivered before the FBI applied for three FISA renewals against Page in 2017 using Steele's research. Sources said Flynn was not aware of its existence until he was questioned as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, after he pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with a Russian envoy, and therefore Trump too was likely not told about it.

The possible misuse of Steele's dossier has come into greater focus in recent weeks, including questions about whether the dossier contained possible Russian disinformation and whether former FBI Director James Comey or former CIA Director John Brennan tried to include the dossier in the January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment on Russian interference in the 2016 election.

At least three federal investigations are looking into alleged FISA abuse, and other matters related to the way the FBI and the Justice Department conducted the Trump-Russia investigation, and several top ex-officials. Among them are Barr's examination of the origins of the counterintelligence inquiry into Trump's campaign. He has tasked U.S. Attorney John Durham to lead the review. Barr says he is working closely with Horowitz, who is nearing completion of his FISA abuse investigation.

Steele is reportedly open to speaking with Horowitz but has declined to cooperate with Barr."
Justice Department fails to comply with court order to release Michael Flynn transcripts,https://www.pressherald.com,['Email Writer'],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.pressherald.com/2019/05/31/justice-department-fails-to-comply-with-court-order-to-release-michael-flynn-transcripts/,"Federal prosecutors on Friday declined to make public transcripts of recorded conversations between Michael Flynn and Russia’s ambassador to the United States in December 2016, despite a judge’s order.

In a court filing Friday, the Justice Department wrote that it did not rely on such recordings to establish Flynn’s guilt or determine a recommendation for his sentencing.

Prosecutors also failed to release an unredacted version of portions of the Mueller report related to Flynn that the judge had ordered be made public.

Flynn, who served briefly as President Trump’s first national security adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversation with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, and he cooperated with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation. He is awaiting sentencing.

The government’s unusual response came after U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan in Washington ordered earlier in May that the Justice Department make public various materials related to the case, including transcripts of any audio recordings of Flynn, such as his conversations with Russian officials.

Prosecutors provided one item that Sullivan ordered be released: a transcript of a voice mail left by an attorney for Trump, much of which had already appeared in Mueller’s report. It is unclear how the judge will react to the government’s noncompliance with other elements of his order.

While Flynn’s interactions with Kislyak were described in Mueller’s report and in court documents, the exact words the two men used have not been revealed. U.S. officials have not publicly confirmed the existence of recordings, which are classified.

Sullivan made clear he wanted the full transcript of Flynn’s calls to be shared with the public, although he did not provide his reasoning. The Justice Department’s response appeared to duck that order.

Prosecutors Brandon L. Van Grack of the Justice Department’s national security division, who was formerly on Mueller’s team, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Deborah Curtis of Washington provided little explanation as to why they were not turning over the transcripts but indicated that the judge had asked for material that was not relevant to Flynn’s eventual sentencing.

In a single line addressing Sullivan’s order, prosecutors wrote that the government “is not relying on any other recordings, of any person, for purposes of establishing the defendant’s guilt or determining his sentence, nor are there any other recordings that are part of the sentencing record.”

Sullivan’s request was atypical, some legal experts said, in that he demanded the release of classified records that prosecutors did not use to prove Flynn’s guilt.

Still, some former prosecutors said the government’s response was also notably spare.

“I’m sure they spent a ton of time thinking about how to do this — to protect intelligence equities, to protect their case, to try not to annoy the judge, to balance all those interests,” said Barbara McQuade, a former U.S. attorney in Michigan.

She noted that although there was no public indication that prosecutors had filed additional material under seal, it was possible that they did.

“If they’re simply trying to avoid the order by sidestepping it and saying ‘it’s not necessary to your sentencing decision,’ judges tend not to be satisfied with such a response,” she added.

The U.S. attorney’s office in Washington declined to comment.

The transcripts of the Flynn-Kisylak calls would provide a rare glimpse into the power of American surveillance to capture the private discussions of foreign emissaries — and an intimate look at a budding relationship between a top Russian official and one of the president-elect’s most trusted lieutenants in the weeks before Trump took office.

Flynn’s lying about his contacts with the Russian ambassador made him the shortest-serving national security adviser in U.S. history: He spent just 24 days in the prestigious White House job.

Sullivan ordered the transcripts of Flynn’s conversations released two weeks ago after The Washington Post filed a motion seeking the release of redacted and sealed documents in the case. The Post argued that the public deserved to know more about the Trump adviser’s role in key events and the information he shared with investigators.

As part of his order, Sullivan had also given the government until Friday to release an unredacted version of portions of Mueller’s report dealing with Flynn.

In declining to release that, prosecutors wrote that the “limited remaining redactions pertain to sourcing of information, such as references to grand jury subpoenas.”

They provided no explanation other than to say that “all of the information in the Report that the defendant provided to the Special Counsel’s Office has been unredacted, as has all of the information in the Report that others provided about the defendant.”

The one item that the Justice Department made public on Sullivan’s order was a full transcript of a voice mail that John Dowd, a private attorney for Trump, left for Flynn lawyer Robert Kelner in November 2017.

Most of the voice mail was quoted in Mueller’s report, which described a message left by a personal counsel to Trump for a Flynn attorney after the former national security adviser began to cooperate with investigators. The special counsel scrutinized the message as part of his investigation into whether Trump sought to obstruct the Russia investigation.

The Trump counsel was Dowd, according to people familiar with the episode.

In the voice mail to Kelner, Dowd described himself as “sympathetic.”

“I understand your situation, but let me see if I can’t state it in starker terms,” he said, adding that if “there’s information that implicates the President, then we’ve got a national security issue.”

“So you know, …we need some kind of heads up,” he added. “Um, just for the sake of protecting all our interests if we can, without you having to give up any … confidential information….remember what we’ve always said about the President and his feelings toward Flynn and, that still remains.”

In a statement Friday, Dowd said there was never anything improper about his contact with Flynn’s lawyer and that he had never tried to discourage Flynn’s cooperation with the government.

“This is clearly a baseless, political document designed to smear and damage the reputation of counsel and innocent people,” Dowd said of the special counsel report.

Elizabeth Warren says she wants to make it legal to indict presidents,https://www.vox.com,['May'],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.vox.com/2019/5/31/18647042/elizabeth-warren-trump-indictment-mueller,"Special counsel Robert Mueller said indicting President Donald Trump was “not an option” this week, citing a longstanding Justice Department policy that shields a sitting president from criminal indictments and prosecution.

Now Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) says she would change the policy as president.

Warren, among the first major Democratic 2020 candidates to call for Trump’s impeachment, released a two-part proposal on presidential powers Friday. First, she called on Congress to pass a law clarifying that the president of the United States is subject to the same federal criminal code as everyone else. Second, she pledged to appoint an attorney general and assistant AG who would change current Justice Department policy around indicting sitting presidents.

“Donald Trump believes that he can violate the law, and he believes that the role of the Department of Justice is to help him get away with it. That’s not how our country is supposed to work,” Warren wrote. “I pledge to nominate an [Office of Legal Counsel] head who will reverse the Watergate-era rule that a President cannot be indicted for criminal behavior.”

On Wednesday, Mueller reiterated he was operating under DOJ policy, as presented by the Office of Legal Counsel, that a sitting president cannot be charged with a federal crime.

“Under longstanding department policy a president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office,” Mueller said. “That is unconstitutional. ... The special counsel’s office is part of the Department of Justice and by regulation it was bound by that department policy. Charging the president with a crime was, therefore, not an option we could consider.”

To be clear, what Mueller is referring to is not something expressly written in the Constitution. It’s a large gray area in the nation’s body of law — which Warren says she would address as president.

The question of presidential immunity, briefly explained

The closest the Supreme Court has come to answering the question of presidential immunity recently is a 1997 ruling in Clinton v. Jones, which maintained that a president is subject to civil lawsuits. But whether a sitting president can be subject to criminal prosecution remains an unanswered question in the courts.

Upon review in 1973 and again in 2000, OLC concluded that the best way to address criminal charges is to wait until a president leaves office, leaving impeachment as the avenue for accountability.

As Vox’s Dylan Matthews explained, the most famous argument in favor of making presidents immune from criminal prosecution is from a 1997 law review article by Yale constitutional law professor Akhil Amar and a then-student of his, Brian Kalt, who’s now a law professor at Michigan State University:

Amar and Kalt argue that the president is a unique official, as the sole person ultimately in charge of the executive branch. “If he is arrested, so too is the executive branch of the government,” they write. This distinguishes him from a normal legislator or judge, who can be prosecuted, because there are plenty of other judges and legislators who can carry on their work. “Any distraction of the President from his duties is much more significant than similar distractions of these other, prosecutable officials, and has a much bigger impact on the well-being of the nation and all its People,” they conclude.

But even Kalt says this is unsettled territory. There is an argument to be made that the president should be subject to the same legal standard as everybody else, and that there are structures in place to address a president with “distractions” from his executive duties.

The investigation into Trump, and the special counsel report outlining evidence that Trump may have obstructed justice, has raised this issue into the forefront once again.

Dozens of Homeland Security agents and investigators will deploy to Guatemala as part of the Trump administration’s desperate attempt to slow unauthorized migration to the United States from Central America, according to U.S. officials with knowledge of the plans.

The Department of Homeland Security personnel will work as “advisers” to Guatemala’s national police and migration authorities, and they will aim to disrupt and interdict human smuggling operations, the officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe a plan that has not been made public. U.S. authorities hope that the effort will cut off popular routes to the United States and deter migrants from beginning their journeys north through Mexico.

Plans call for at least several dozen DHS agents and investigators, and one DHS official briefed on the plans said about 80 U.S. law enforcement personnel will deploy as part of the mission. Another DHS official said Immigration and Customs Enforcement will send 18 Homeland Security Investigations agents and intelligence analysts, along with six agents from the Enforcement and Removal Operations division.

Acting DHS secretary Kevin McAleenan has advocated the more muscular DHS presence and finalized the agreement with Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales and other top Guatemalan officials during meetings this week in Guatemala City.

“The U.S. and Guatemala are formalizing a number of initiatives to improve the lives and security of our respective citizens by combating human trafficking and the smuggling of illegal goods, helping to limit ‘push’ factors that encourage dangerous irregular migration to the U.S., perpetuating the ongoing crisis at our border,” McAleenan said in a statement, after signing a “Memorandum of Cooperation” with Guatemalan officials.

President Trump, who threatened Thursday to impose severe tariffs on Mexican imports if the country’s government doesn’t crack down on migration, has said he will cut off aid to Central America in an effort to pressure the region’s leaders.

But McAleenan has urged more — not less — cooperation with Central America, and his plan to assign personnel from U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Homeland Security Investigations to work alongside Guatemalan police amounts to an attempt to put more weight behind the approach.

According to DHS, the agreement allows for “concrete actions” including “law enforcement training and collaboration to improve criminal investigations.”

The U.S. agents probably would deploy to Guatemala and its border with Mexico for weeks at a time in an “advisory” role. U.S. security personnel assigned to Guatemala are typically authorized to carry weapons.

“Other areas of cooperation include increasing the security of the Guatemalan border to stem the flow of irregular migration while ensuring proper preparation to improve the ability of both countries to identify and better understand their root causes,” according to a DHS news release.

While the scale of the deployment and the location — the Guatemala-Mexico border — would be unusual, there are precedents for U.S. law enforcement presence in Central America. Armed Drug Enforcement Administration agents conduct operations in the region, and CBP advisers work with Mexican officials to improve immigration screening procedures and to upgrade technology.

One of the areas U.S. agents will target is the department of Huehuetenango in Guatemala’s destitute western highlands, where emigration levels are among the highest in the region.

Villages along the Pan-American Highway through Huehue­tenango have been emptying out, and in some places, residents say half the population has left for the United States in the past two years. Coffee fields have been abandoned. Many families have used their houses as collateral for the trip, taking out loans to pay their smugglers.

According to DHS officials, 3 percent of Huehuetenango’s entire population has left for the United States in the past seven months.

In the border city of La Mesilla, just south of the Mexican state of Chiapas, some migrants arrive at night at the local bus terminal, where they look for smugglers to hire. Nearby hotels — including the Texas Hotel, named for some of the migrants’ destination —cater to families on their way north. Many leave La Mesilla by truck and van, arriving at unmarked border crossings, not far from main highway corridors.

U.S. authorities have apprehended more than 100,000 migrants crossing the border from Mexico in each of the past three months, and unauthorized border crossings have soared to their highest level in at least 12 years. McAleenan told reporters Thursday that border agents are processing an average of 4,500 people each day, an increase of more than 30 percent since March, when he declared that U.S. agents and infrastructure had hit “the breaking point.”

In rural Guatemala, there is a widespread belief that bringing a child on the journey to the United States will make it easier to avoid detention and deportation. U.S. courts have limited the amount of time children can be held in immigration jails to 20 days, and because U.S. authorities can’t process their asylum claims that fast, the families are typically issued a court appointment and released into the U.S. interior.

“That’s the thing everyone knows now. If you go, you need to bring a child,” said Juan Vasquez, from La Libertad, who is considering migrating with his two daughters in coming weeks. “You can bring someone else’s child, but they say they are now doing DNA tests on the border, which make it difficult.”

Many Guatemalans say they have been told the ability to enter the United States with a child is part of an official U.S. policy that is due to expire in about a year; such rumors are often spread by smugglers trying to drum up business. “It’s something that they say is going to expire,” said Anselmo Torres, 58, also from La Libertad, whose two daughters migrated earlier this year with children of their own.

The United States has no such policy, but Trump last year ordered an end to family separations of migrants apprehended at the border after his “zero tolerance” crackdown triggered a ferocious backlash. He has since insisted the family separations would have worked as a deterrent if he had kept them in place.

At least nine people accused of human smuggling were arrested in Guatemala City on Wednesday, part of a joint operation between DHS and Guatemalan authorities, according to Guatemalan officials. It was the first such joint operation after the signing of the memorandum.

At the scene of the arrest, officials wearing jackets emblazoned with the acronym for “Homeland Security Investigations” — a division of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement — were seen standing next to Guatemalan police officers.

U.S. Rep. Vicente Gonzalez (D-Tex.) said he met with Guatemala’s ambassador to the United States, Manuel Espina, and that Espina told him Guatemala would welcome U.S. troops to help secure its northern border. After the meeting, Gonzalez wrote a letter to President Trump, urging him to accept the offer. The letter, asking for the United States to send military personnel, was obtained by The Washington Post.

“Guatemalan president Jimmy Morales has indicated that he would welcome the introduction of U.S. troops on Guatemala’s northern border,” Gonzalez wrote on April 16. “If you want to see fewer apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border, I would strongly encourage you to seriously consider President Morales’ offer.”

Gonzalez said he believes sending 100 U.S. agents to Guatemala would be insufficient, and he would continue pushing to send U.S. military forces to Guatemala, with Morales’s approval, “on a humanitarian mission to help secure Guatemala’s border.”

Gonzalez said he did not receive a response from the White House.

Justice Department asks Supreme Court to move quickly on DACA,https://www.cnn.com,"['Ariane De Vogue', 'Cnn Supreme Court Reporter']",05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/29/politics/daca-supreme-court/index.html,"Washington (CNN) A frustrated Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to say by the end of next month if it will hear arguments on whether it can wind down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, an Obama-era program that protects young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children from deportation.

Such action could mean the court hears oral arguments and issues a decision in the middle of the 2020 presidential election.

As things stand, lower courts have ruled against the administration's attempts to rescind the program and issued a nationwide injunction that keeps it on the books, and the Supreme Court has not acted upon a longstanding request from the Justice Department to take up the issue.

The justices' inaction suggests that some of them believe the issue should percolate in the lower courts before Supreme Court review."
"Sterigenics created cancer risk 10 times higher than federal EPA standards in Willowbrook, new report says",https://www.chicagotribune.com,['Michael Hawthorne'],05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-met-sterigenics-epa-cancer-risks-20190529-story.html,"Ethylene oxide emitted by Sterigenics continued to pose high cancer risks after the company installed new pollution-control equipment last summer, according to a new federal study based in part on months of air quality testing in Willowbrook and nearby west suburban communities.

Top officials at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency confirmed Wednesday that toxic pollution from the company’s Willowbrook sterilization plant was responsible for long-term cancer risks up to 10 times higher than what the EPA considers acceptable.

Cancer risks remained high in the area despite improvements Sterigenics voluntarily undertook to prevent all but one-tenth of 1% of the ethylene oxide it used from escaping into surrounding neighborhoods.

“Based on current science, there are very high levels of risk,” said William Wehrum, the Trump administration’s top air official, who told sometimes angry residents at a public meeting in Burr Ridge that he takes their concerns “very, very seriously.”

Responding to questions, EPA officials said pollution from Sterigenics increased the risk of developing cancer for people living as far as 25 miles away from Willowbrook. The biggest risks were in six suburbs — Willowbrook, Darien, Burr Ridge, Hinsdale, Indian Head Park and Western Springs — and declined steadily the farther away a neighborhood was from the facility, according to a map the EPA posted online and statements from agency officials during the meeting.

Wehrum and other EPA officials suggested the company could take more aggressive steps that would allow its now-shuttered facility to safely resume operations. But bipartisan state legislation sent Thursday to Gov. J.B. Pritzker would ban Sterigenics from reopening unless medical equipment suppliers — the company’s main clients — certify their products can only be sterilized with ethylene oxide.

The new EPA report comes as the federal agency is pledging to adopt more stringent restrictions on sterilization facilities nationwide, a rare departure from attempts by Wehrum and other Trump appointees to block, delay or undermine environment and public health regulations.

Willowbrook is a focal point in the ongoing debate, largely because EPA scientists determined last year that neighborhoods near Sterigenics are among just a few dozen throughout the U.S. where breathing toxic chemicals is responsible for more than 1 case of cancer for every 10,000 people exposed during their lifetime.

Like in the Willowbrook area, ethylene oxide is the main chemical of concern in nearly all of those other areas. The volatile gas has been on the federal list of carcinogens since 1985, and in 2016 the EPA released a long-delayed reassessment linking it more conclusively to breast cancer, leukemia and lymphomas at extremely low levels of exposure.

Several residents at the Wednesday meeting said they don’t trust the EPA or Sterigenics to protect them. Agency officials, they noted, acknowledged that local cancer risks likely were significantly higher in the past when the Willowbrook facility emitted up to 169,000 pounds of ethylene oxide a year.

“The only appropriate resolution … is for Sterigenics to permanently shut down,” said Margie Donnell, a member of the Stop Sterigenics community group.

More than 19,000 people live within a mile of the Willowbrook facility. Four schools and a day care center also are close by, including Hinsdale South High School in Darien and Gower Middle School in Burr Ridge.

Laws and regulations don’t allow the EPA to force Sterigenics to close for good, Wehrum said, but the agency can take action to ensure cancer risks posed by the company’s pollution are within federal guidelines.

Wednesday’s meeting was the third public forum organized by federal and state officials since the EPA released its latest National Air Toxics Assessment in late August.

A Chicago Tribune analysis of agency data revealed that of 73,057 census tracts in the United States, seven tracts near Sterigenics are among just 109 nationwide with long-term cancer risks exceeding the agency’s guidelines. The findings prompted months of intense pressure from elected officials and the public, forcing the EPA to pay closer attention to a once-obscure industry.

“It is not lost upon us, and it certainly isn’t lost upon me, the depth to which this has affected you,” John Kim, acting director of the Illinois EPA, told residents. “We are doing everything we can to bring you relief.”

After months of meetings with Wehrum and his staff, Sterigenics is vowing to overhaul its facility again, even as the company contends that other sources of ethylene oxide were responsible for spikes of the toxic gas recorded by monitoring equipment deployed near its facility between November and March."

""This is the most powerful law enforcement agency on earth,"" Nunes said of the FBI. ""How is it that they couldn't figure out whether or not Michael Cohen was in Prague?

""The whole thing is assinine from the start and what they keep doing is digging,"" Nunes told FNC's Bill Hemmer. ""That's what the Democrats in Congress keep doing. They keep digging. And if the press were to actually tell the truth in this country I think this would be overwhelming that what Barr is doing to rein this in and actually go after and investigate the investigators, I think you would see 75% of American say, yeah, what happened here was wrong. We shouldn't use the counterintelligence capabilities in this country to target a political candidate.""







REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA): Department of Justice is not supposed to be telegraphing whether or not somebody is possibly guilty or not. Either you are or aren't. Either they're going to prosecute you or they're not. And I think saying that the DOJ doesn't operate as some adjunct piece of governing body of the Congress is exactly right...



There are multiple ways that the FBI in short order -- this is the most powerful law enforcement agency on earth. How is it that they couldn't figure out whether or not Michael Cohen was in Prague? Carter Page, he had been willing to talk to the FBI. In fact, he sent James Comey a letter back in October of 2016. So, month after month after month goes by. The most powerful large enforcement agency on earth, something doesn't add up here. It just stinks. It really stinks and I think the American people know it and I think their gig's up.



I think the Democrats are in trouble because they perpetuated this hoax on the American people, the Clinton folks and then the Democrats in Congress don't forget... the Democrats opposed us every single time we had... to figure out whether it was Fusion GPS that wrote the Steele Dossier and they were being paid by the Clinton campaign and the Democrats themselves. They oppose that. Do you remember when we put out a memo that said there was FISA abuse that occurred? They opposed that. These are the same characters who are, quite frankly, not being held accountable by the press. The press has really let us down here in this country...



This is like when whoever they've been investigating, they destroyed a murder weapon, or they destroyed tapes, or they did something... the prosecution believed beyond a reasonable doubt that there really was a crime and they did something to cover that crime up.



Comey's memos are really defensive exhibit A against and obstruction of justice charge because you have the president of the United States saying, 'Look, Comey, investigate this. Cohen wasn't in Prague. There's no pee tape. I didn't have any girlfriends in Russia. I didn't talk to anybody in Russia.' That's the president saying this. So, how are they really going to get an obstruction of justice charge? The whole thing is assinine from the start and what they keep doing is digging. That's what the Democrats in Congress keep doing. They keep digging. And if the press were to actually tell the truth in this country I think this would be overwhelming that what Barr is doing to rein this in and actually go after and investigate the investigators, I think you would see 75% of American say, yeah, what happened here was wrong.

Ex-State Department head of diplomatic security 'surprised' by Hillary Clinton's private email use,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ex-state-department-head-of-diplomatic-security-surprised-by-hillary-clintons-private-email-use,"The official in charge of protecting State Department staff said he was ""surprised"" to learn that Hillary Clinton used a personal email address to conduct government business.

Eric Boswell, the former head of diplomatic security, acknowledged in a deposition this month that he warned Clinton and other State Department staff against the use of personal emails.

""We also urge Department users to minimize the use of personal web email for business, as some compromised home systems have been reconfigured by these actors to automatically forward copies of all composed emails to an undisclosed recipient,"" read a 2011 memo that bore his signature.

Clinton was a recipient of the memo, but Boswell could not confirm whether the secretary of state actually read it.

Boswell, who stepped down from his position in 2012, said he and other former State Department officials had spoken about Clinton's use of the private email address clintonemail.com as a ""general issue.""

""We were surprised,"" he added.

Boswell participated in a deposition this month as part of a court-ordered discovery related to Clinton’s use of an unauthorized email server during her time as secretary of state. A federal judge ruled that several Obama administration officials would have to answer conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch's questions about whether Clinton intentionally attempted to evade the Freedom of Information Act by using a nongovernment email system.

Boswell also warned Clinton against her use of Blackberry devices in the executive offices of the State Department. In a previously declassified memo to Cheryl Mills, Clinton's chief of staff, Boswell said the secretary of state should discontinue her use of the device due to ""vulnerabilities and risks."" Although Clinton assured Boswell she read the internal memo and ""gets it,"" an email obtained by Judicial Watch indicates she still carried the device ""[a]gainst the advice of the security hawks.""

The debate over whether Clinton's home-based email server, which she claims was set up for convenience, remains alive today. During a hearing with Attorney General William Barr this month, Rep. Louie Gohmert accused FBI Director Christopher Wray of a pro-Clinton cover-up by not pressing the intelligence community for proof that it was not hacked by China.

Also this month, partially redacted documents were released by the FBI that were part of the bureau's ""Midyear Exam"" investigation, which looked into Clinton's mishandling of classified information on her unauthorized private email servers while serving as secretary of state. The documents put on display a sense of alarm among Clinton's staff following what they feared to be a hack of the server and glaring security oversights.

The FBI investigation into Clinton's emails came to a conclusion during the 2016 presidential election. Former FBI Director James Comey publicly recommended in 2016 that no charges be brought against Clinton, who was then a candidate for president, but admonished Clinton and her colleagues for being ""extremely careless"" in handling classified information.

One of the main controversies stemming from Clinton's emails was how a technician managing the server deleted 33,000 emails. The FBI was only able to recover about 5,000 of the emails, which were released in tranches up until earlier this year as part of a Judicial Watch lawsuit. Clinton has said she ""never received nor sent any material that was marked classified,"" but the FBI found 110 emails did contain classified information.

Clinton has long blamed the FBI's handling of the investigation as a reason for her 2016 loss to President Trump."
Opinion | Can a Sitting President Be Charged With a Crime?,https://www.nytimes.com,[],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/30/opinion/letters/trump-president-indictment.html,"To the Editor:

Robert Mueller’s public statement left most with the impression that the president would have been indicted but for the legal opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel that a president cannot be charged with a crime while in office. This is enshrined in a Justice Department policy that Mr. Mueller had to follow. But this policy is not based on any provision of the Constitution, any law passed by Congress or any court decision.

The policy flies in the face of the principle that no man is above the law in this country, including the president. That is not just a concept. It is the basis of numerous court decisions such as United States v. Nixon and Clinton v. Jones. No case has decided otherwise.

It is time that the policy that handcuffed Mr. Mueller be revisited and abandoned, or tested in court. Otherwise the only consequence for a criminal president is the impeachment process, which is unlikely today with a Senate controlled by the president’s own party.

"Cornell team, EPA to partner on emissions big data project",https://news.cornell.edu,[],,,,https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2019/05/cornell-team-epa-partner-emissions-big-data-project,"A team from associate professor Max Zhang’s lab will work with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) over the next year on a machine learning model designed to predict fossil fuel emissions. The project was a winning entry in the EPA-sponsored EmPOWER Air Data Challenge.

Zhang directs the Energy and the Environment Research Laboratory at the Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. His collaborators on the EPA project are Ye Jiang and Vignesh Rao, students in the Cornell Engineering master’s program in computer science; and doctoral student Jeff Sward.

The project, “Predicting the Environmental Performance of Power Plants Using Machine Learning,” will apply the machine learning model to air pollution monitoring data from the EPA’s Clean Air Markets Division (CAMD) to predict emissions rates from fossil fuel-burning power plants. The group will develop the model further to identify anomalies in CAMD data to enhance the quality of the data.

According to the EPA, most of the fossil fuel-fired, electricity-generating units in the U.S. submit quarterly reports on their hourly nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide emissions, along with operating parameters such as hourly heat input and gross electricity generation.

“Electronic data auditing involves a massive data set,” Zhang said. “Any power plant larger than 25 megawatts in the United States, including generators at Cornell, is equipped with the continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS). To maintain the quality of the data is very important for the environment, and we will develop a better data-driven tool to improve the quality of the CEMS data.”

Zhang said his lab initially developed the machine learning model for emissions as part of a project funded by the NewYork State Energy Research and Development Authority to evaluate the impact of clean energy initiatives in the state. “The timing was perfect to compete for this EmPOWER Air Data Challenge,” he said, “because we had some results already.”

The EPA and the Sibley School have signed a Memorandum of Understanding on the project, to be completed by June 2020. One of the agency’s goals is to advance power sector-related research and knowledge.

The Cornell team will work with and have direct support from EPA staff, experts and peers in the research community, to assist with CAMD tools and data analysis.

The EPA selected three winning EmPOWER projects for the 2019-20 academic year, including Zhang’s. The others chosen are at the Georgia Institute of Technology, on data engagement in the classroom; and the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Oregon, a joint project applying satellite data on pollution to estimate health impacts from a decline in coal emissions.

Zhang sees Cornell’s EmPOWER project as a good opportunity for students to gain practical experience working with a government agency on environmental issues.

“I have a number of computer science students working in my lab this academic year. They are all very motivated to make a real-world impact,” he said. “I’d welcome computer science and engineering students to look at what we’re doing and join us for socially relevant research projects.”"
DHS awards $276M contract for CDM dashboard,https://www.fedscoop.com,['Billy Mitchell'],05-30-2019,2019,5,https://www.fedscoop.com/continuous-diagnostics-mitigation-cdm-dashboard-ecs-federal/,"Written by Billy Mitchell

The Department of Homeland Security has awarded ECS Federal a $276 million contract to provide a governmentwide dashboard for the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) program.

The Fairfax, Virginia, company will receive $7.7 million in the base year of the potential six-year contract, according to data on the Federal Procurement Data System. DHS’s goal is to improve how security information about federal networks is visualized for IT personnel in agencies across the government.

The General Services Administration’s FEDSIM office issued the contract on behalf of DHS’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), formerly the National Protection and Programs Directorate.

The dashboard “will provide a total integrated technology solution for the CDM Federal and Agency dashboards, and will provide DHS with an integrated Dashboard solution for continuous monitoring and mitigation of cyber threats and vulnerabilities to the Federal .gov environment by expanding and enhancing the current instance of the Federal Dashboard through a suite of integrated hardware and software tools resulting in a ‘CDM Dashboard Ecosystem,'” a CISA official told FedScoop via email. “The enhancement of the CDM Dashboard through this [task order] will provide Federal agencies with a user-friendly and intuitive solution that can be utilized to visualize and prioritize risks and vulnerabilities in an Agency’s cybersecurity posture.”

The overall purpose, the official said, is to “provide actionable information to allow agencies to ‘fix the worst problems first'” across their networks.

CDM Program Manager Kevin Cox recently described the next steps for the program now that the initial contracts have been awarded and basic tool sets are available.

“It’s a question of: Will the CDM program become this wider sense of getting full cybersecurity solutions in place across all these different capability areas, or will we be more targeted on high-value assets, specific environments, etc.?” Cox said.

Cox also explained how the dashboard will open agencies up to new tools, analytics and business intelligence.

“If one agency has an incident, there’s a greater likelihood that spreads and gets to other agencies or that it’s happening at the same time across many agencies,” he said. “So we wanted to get that visibility.”"
DOJ demands to see CoreLogic's MLS data in antitrust probe,https://www.housingwire.com,"['Jessica Guerin Is An Editor At Housingwire Covering Reverse Mortgages', 'The Housing Wealth Space. She Is A Graduate Of Boston University', 'Has A Master S Degree Northwestern S Medill School Of Journalism. She Worked Previously As The Editor-In-Chief Of The Reverse Review Magazine', 'Which Was Recently Acquired Housingwire.']",,,,https://www.housingwire.com/articles/49198-doj-demands-to-see-corelogics-mls-data-in-antitrust-probe,"The Department of Justice recently sent a letter to CoreLogic requesting access to its MLS data regarding buyer broker compensation, a clear sign that the federal authorities are actively investigating allegations of antitrust violations among multiple listing service providers.

The DOJ’s letter follows two class-action lawsuits recently filed against the National Association of Realtors and brokerages, including Realogy, HomeServices of America, RE/MAX and Keller Williams, that center around the practice of requiring that a buyer’s broker be compensated in a home-sale transaction.

Both suits allege that NAR and the MLS providers conspired to drive up seller costs and reduce competition by requiring a home seller to pay compensation to the buyer’s broker, even though their involvement in the transaction is minimal.

For its part, NAR has said that it has no role in determining the buyer broker’s fee and has promised to fight the allegations, calling them “baseless” and full of “an abundance of false claims.”

But it appears the DOJ isn’t so convinced.

In a letter to CoreLogic, which was posted on the website Notorious R.O.B, the DOJ specifically requests “all documents relating to any MLS member’s search of [listings] based on compensation offered by listing brokers to buyer brokers, or the type of compensation, such as a flat fee, offered to listing brokers by buyer brokers.”

It also requests any documents relating to a possible antitrust issue regarding the ability to search based on the type of compensation offered.

Meanwhile, a form filed by CoreLogic with the Securities and Exchange Commission Wednesday stated that the company’s chief legal officer, Arnold Pinkston, will be leaving in mid-June to pursue an opportunity elsewhere.

Although Pinkston will be leaving the company in the midst of the DOJ investigation, the filing explicitly states that his decision was not based on a disagreement with the company.

CoreLogic spokesperson Alyson Austin confirmed to HousingWire that the company received a Civil Investigative Demand from the DOJ “relating to an investigation of practices of residential real estate brokerage services in local markets in the United States.” Austin said the company intends to comply with the request and is not the focus of the investigation."

The Paralympic-style competition, which will be hosted in 2020 by the Marine Corps, brings together injured, ill or wounded active-duty service members and veterans to compete each year for the honor of their branch of service.

Events in the 2019 games, which will take place in June in Tampa, Florida, include archery, cycling, shooting, sitting volleyball, swimming, track and field, wheelchair basketball, indoor rowing, powerlifting, and time trial cycling.

""When they win a medal, they win it for their team. And they don't play their national anthem. They play their service song,"" said retired Marine Maj. Gen. Juan Ayala, the director of the city's San Antonio Office of Military and Veteran Affairs.

The games can mean a great deal to wounded service members like Marine Cpl. Mathew Maddux.

Maddux, the Marines' ambassador for the 2020 games, was injured in 2017 when a malfunction in his tank caused a nuclear, biological and chemical system to overheat and combust next to him. The blast left him with burns on his face, impaired peripheral vision, vertigo problems and a prosthetic ear.

Waking up after the incident, Maddux said he knew right away life would be different. Like the Marine he is, Maddux learned to adapt and overcome, competing in the 2018 Warrior Games.

""I was the ultimate champion last year -- did all the sports,"" Maddux said. ""I got a bronze medal in the 4x100, like a relay team.""

More than physically, he says, the games helped him mentally.

""Mentally reassuring yourself that you can still go out there and be an athlete,"" Maddux said. ""Still go out there and still be in a fight.""

Ayala, who the 2015 Warrior Games when he was still in the Marines, says the competition is special.

""They're focused on the recuperative powers to make that athlete feel like he or she are back in the game, they're back in the unit, they're back in the fight,"" Ayala said.

Kamala Harris Wants States to Get DOJ Permission Before Passing Anti-Abortion Laws,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Gideon Resnick'],05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/kamala-harris-wants-states-to-get-doj-permission-before-passing-anti-abortion-laws,"Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) on Tuesday evening will unveil a new plan, called the Reproductive Rights Act, to stop states from instituting unconstitutional restrictions on abortion.

According to a senior campaign official, the California senator and 2020 presidential candidate will announce during an MSNBC town hall that as president she would implement, for the first time, a pre-clearance requirement for states and localities attempting to restrict women’s reproductive rights.

The plan would go above and beyond codifying the landmark Roe v. Wade decision with federal law by requiring that states and localities with a history of violating the Supreme Court decision obtain approval from Harris’ Department of Justice before any abortion law or practice can take effect.

Under Harris’ plan, states and localities will be subject to the pre-clearance requirement if they have a pattern of violating Roe v. Wade in the preceding 25 years, akin to a requirement in the Voting Rights Act.

According to the Brennan Center for Justice, between 1998 and 2013, 86 proposed election changes to voting rights were blocked with VRA pre-clearance requirements. The Supreme Court’s 2013 Shelby County v. Holder decision effectively neutered pre-clearance and has left Congress to attempt to restore and strengthen parts of the Voting Rights Act through legislation.

Harris’ proposal dictates that any change in a covered jurisdiction will not be enforceable until DOJ determines that it comports with standards of Roe v. Wade and the Women’s Health Protection Act, a Harris-sponsored bill that would ban certain abortion limitations. Guardrails under the plan, like public determinations and required reviews, would ensure DOJ enforcement even under an administration hostile to reproductive rights, the campaign official said, and patients and providers will have the opportunity to sue if the federal agency does not.

“We have to get really serious about the degree to which the Republicans have really targeted women’s access to abortion as their political way of winning of elections,” Laurie Rubiner, former vice president of public policy at Planned Parenthood said, praising the Harris plan. “I do think that the way that she has thought about this is very creative. I really like that what she is saying is ‘we’re going to shift that burden to the state’ especially in places where they have a history of passing these unconstitutional laws,"" she said referring to how it is currently often incumbent upon providers to file suit against state laws now.

Sasha Bruce, Senior Vice President of NARAL Pro-Choice America was also encouraged by the proposal and hoped to see the rest of the field continue to adopt concrete plans.

""Every candidate in this field should know it’s not enough to simply call yourself pro-choice,"" she said in a statement. ""All candidates need to back up their words with a concrete plan for action, especially given the tenuous thread by which reproductive freedom hangs.""

Harris, like many of her Democratic competitors, also wants to nominate judges who uphold the Roe decision, work to repeal the Hyde Amendment (which bars any federal funds from being spent on abortion), and protect providers like Planned Parenthood from defunding.

The senator’s plan comes as as a number of states like Alabama, Georgia, and Missouri have passed restrictive anti-abortion laws in recent weeks."
"Changes underway at Aurora Housing Authority to address old problems, documents show",https://www.chicagotribune.com,['Sarah Freishtat'],06-02-2019,2019,6,https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/aurora-beacon-news/ct-abn-aurora-housing-authority-change-st-0602-story.html,"The troubled Aurora Housing Authority has undergone significant changes in the months since it has come under new leadership, according to documents and the new executive director.

The agency has taken steps to close out questionable contracts and update its policies, and to better manage finances that had been questioned by auditors, documents obtained by The Beacon-News show. The documents show the agency has also taken steps to disentangle itself from the Northern Lights Development Corporation, an affiliated developer that once had a questioned relationship with the agency.

Executive Director Ralph Jordan described the agency he took over in July as one in “crisis” and “chaos.” Since then, he said he has made changes to some financial practices and “stabilized” the housing authority and is now looking toward summer youth programs, housing improvements and expanding affordable housing opportunities in Aurora.

“Now, we can focus on real housing things,” he said.

Jordan took over a housing authority deemed “troubled” by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The agency was first faulted by HUD in 2017 for the year ending March 2016, when findings in an audit questioned spending, personal use of housing authority vehicles, record keeping and aspects of the agency’s relationship with the affiliated Northern Lights Development Corporation. For the year ending March 2017, HUD faulted the agency for its public housing occupancy rate and for its finances, though housing authority officials said at the time the financial issues were due largely to failure to submit an audit which they later submitted.

A 2017 Beacon-News investigation documented questionable expenses at the housing authority’s administrative offices and the close relationship between the housing authority and Northern Lights, which were both overseen by the former housing authority executive director. Among the investigation’s findings were that Northern Lights won at least two publicly-bid contracts from the housing authority, including one in which it did not offer the lowest estimated cost.

The previous director left in June 2017, and the agency was under interim leadership for the year before Jordan arrived.

The housing authority’s most recent audit paints a picture of an agency in administrative turmoil. It covers the year ending in March 2018, before Jordan’s arrival, and was made public by the authority at the end of April 2019. It found the housing authority wasn’t properly accounting for tenants’ security deposits and hadn’t followed the correct process for awarding some of its contracts. The agency wasn’t properly accounting for federal dollars from one program used to pay for expenses in another program and wasn’t adequately managing money for one housing program, the audit found. It again faulted the agency for aspects of its relationship with Northern Lights.

All told, the audit questioned $320,075 in specific costs, plus housing authority practices.

Jordan said the issues outlined in the audit were ones he inherited and have been addressed. A March 2019 response to the audit shows changes underway at the housing authority.

The agency has created designated accounts for tenants’ security deposits and is reviewing changes to the way it obtains contracts, according to the document. It converted to a new accounting model that helps the agency better track its finances, and is reimbursing housing programs where necessary. The document also outlines changes to Northern Lights’ practices and to the developer’s relationship with the housing authority.

Northern Lights had been defunct after the former executive director left, but it is once again functioning, Jordan said. He is planning to further change the relationship between Northern Lights and the housing authority as well as the name of the developer. Though the two will still be linked, no housing authority employees work for the developer — as they had previously — and the development company will no longer be used for day-to-day operations of the housing authority or for managing properties, he said.

Instead, Northern Lights will focus on new development and, possibly, helping the housing authority with social services, Jordan said.

“The housing authority money will be for the housing authority, and that’s it,” he said.

The housing authority continues to work on improving in other, operational areas, and has boosted its occupancy rate above 98%, Jordan said, a move he called a “big improvement over last year.” Staff members have worked to remove tenants he described as bad, and exterminate bugs. They have focused on building relationships with tenants through monthly meetings, he said.

Now approaching one year on the job, Jordan is looking to modernize housing authority properties and improve the roofs, though he is still waiting on HUD approval.

He is looking forward to a summer youth jobs program geared primarily toward residents of the housing authority that will have teens working on jobs such as cleaning up properties and undergoing “life skills training.” The agency has also partnered with the park district to offer a summer recreational program including sports and arts and crafts for children at three housing authority sites.

Moving forward, he plans to look at ways to provide more affordable housing in Aurora. He also plans to look at possibilities for 13 acres of land surrounding the Aurora Housing Authority’s office off Jericho Road, including applying for tax credits to build low-income housing for elderly residents. The site was once public housing but was torn down in 2012, and controversy surrounded the decision not to rebuild public housing at the site.

When Jordan took over, he found staff who were left aside and the focus seemed to be on the not-for-profit development corporation, he said. Since then, staff communication and teamwork have improved, and he has changed the focus of the organization, he said.

“My focus has been on my actual tenants that I have at my public housing sites,” he said. “And make sure that they live in conditions that are going to be better.”

Acting DHS secretary McAleenan says he has no problem standing up to Trump,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/acting-dhs-secretary-mcaleenan-problem-standing-trump/story?id=63383183,"Acting Homeland Secretary Kevin McAleenan said he has no problem standing up to President Donald Trump when it comes to making recommendations on the border crisis, insisting in an interview this week with ABC News that ""if you make a good case and get your facts in order, he'll listen.""

McAleenan took charge of the Homeland Security Department after Kirstjen Nielsen was forced to resign last month and Trump promised supporters he'd take a tougher approach on stopping illegal immigration. While only in the role on a temporary basis, McAleenan was mostly a popular choice, even among some Democrats, because of his reputation as more of a pragmatic law enforcement official than an anti-immigration hardliner.

McAleenan has since drawn on this public persona to make his case to Congress to help address the border crisis through legislation, even when appearing inherently at odds with the president on such matters as supporting foreign aid and family separations. McAleenan has said that the 2018 policy that led to thousands of family separations at the border wasn't successful because it eroded public trust; Trump has said ending routine family separations has been a ""disaster"" that's led to more border crossings.

When asked by ABC News' Matt Gutman whether he's ever stood up to the president, McAleenan said ""of course,"" adding that Trump expects his cabinet to provide honest assessments.

""I'm a person of integrity,"" McAleenan said in an interview from Guatemala on Wednesday. ""I've been a career law enforcement officer. I think [Trump] expects no less than the best facts and the best recommendations I can make to him, and I'll continue to do that.”

But while McAleenan was in Guatemala, his mission there seemed to run counter to Trump's ""America First"" approach. Whereas McAleenan was working with the government in Guatemala to try to crack down on smuggling networks and hearing from non-governmental organizations on the importance of foreign aid, Trump has largely panned diplomatic outreach and foreign aid.

This spring, the State Department announced Trump wanted to cut all direct assistance to Guatemala, as well as El Salvador and Honduras -- the three countries that represent the vast majority of asylum seekers at the U.S. border. Officials have since said future funds are frozen, but existing contracts are still being paid.

Trump announced late Thursday, with McAleenan's support, that he was planning to levy tariffs against Mexico unless it stopped Central Americans traveling through its borders. McAleenan led a phone call with a reporters announcing the plan.

Trump has taken other major steps to try to curb illegal immigration only to be swiftly blocked by the courts. The Justice Department announced this week it would appeal a federal judge's ruling that blocked Trump from bypassing Congress to pay for border wall construction by pulling $1 billion from military accounts, including pay and pension funds.

Migrant families are arriving in record numbers this year, with officials expecting to handle some 1 million people at the southern border this year – double the number from last year. The reasons are complex, ranging from poverty to threats from gangs to weather-related disasters that have wiped out farmland.

Yesterday, Border Patrol agents apprehended the largest group of illegal aliens ever: 1,036 people who illegally crossed the border in El Paso around 4am. Democrats need to stand by our incredible Border Patrol and finally fix the loopholes at our Border! pic.twitter.com/6K1rIUzorM — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2019

The Trump administration also blames court-ordered limits on the ability to detain children past 20 days, insisting that has only encouraged travelers to bring children with them because of the promise of a quick release, allowing them to live and work while waiting for an overwhelmed immigration court system to take up their case.

Critics have countered that the president has done too little to address the humanitarian crisis in Central America and that his threats to close the border and build a wall may have even encouraged the latest rush of asylum seekers.

USDA moving ahead with reorganization plan opponents argue would 'eviscerate' research units,https://www.cnn.com,['Sam Fossum'],05-31-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/31/politics/usda-reorganization-trump/index.html,"(CNN) Hundreds of professional researchers at the US Department of Agriculture are waiting to hear where outside the Washington area their jobs will be relocated -- part of a drive by Secretary Sonny Perdue to cut costs in the federal bureaucracy that many workers also see as a way to disrupt climate research and other work their bosses disagree with.

The looming changes have triggered unionization drives, with workers in charge of research grants set to vote June 11 on joining the American Federation of Government Employees, one of the major federal workers' unions, after USDA economists voted to join earlier this month.

One watchdog group opposed to the relocation says the relocation is a ""back-door"" way to cut staff at the Economic Research Service (ERS), which provides research and statistical analysis for lawmakers, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), which oversees the allocation of federal funding for primarily academic research across the country.

""If Secretary Perdue wishes to eviscerate ERS and NIFA research that is opposed by the White House, let him make that case to Congress, rather than hide behind an unjustified, criticized plan to force world class researchers to make the decision to uproot their families or leave their careers,"" Institute for Agriculture and Trade senior policy analyst Steve Suppan said in a statement

The Trump administration has been focused on remaking the federal bureaucracy , triggering a steady outflow of career civil servants. The Environmental Protection Agency's workforce, for example, has decreased by nearly 1,200 employees in the last two years, according to federal data -- many of whom were scientists, according to records obtained by the Washington Post

The ERS and NIFA units have produced research with conclusions that contradict the Administration's talking points, especially on topics like the impacts of climate change on crop or livestock production, or how changes in trade or tax policy, like tariffs or Trump's tax plan, can affect US agriculture. For example, two ERS researchers presented a paper last year that suggested Trump's 2017 tax reform would benefit the wealthiest farmers at the expense of lower-earning farm households , according to the New York Times.

The relocation initiative has brought simmering discontent at USDA to a head. The agency, which handles everything from farm management to school lunches, was among those hit by last winter's record-setting partial federal government shutdown . It has seen the largest drop in employee engagement -- a measure that gauges satisfaction and commitment -- falling 6.9% between 2017 and 2018, the most out of any of the large agencies surveyed, according to an annual government survey.

""These are knowledge-based organizations,"" said Max Stier, president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, which tracks the federal bureaucracy. ""Employee engagement is directly correlated to performance.""

The USDA says workers will be able to remain in their jobs, but for most, that will mean moving from Washington, DC, to a new location.

Three location finalists -- Indiana, Kansas City or North Carolina's Research Triangle -- were announced earlier this month by Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. In addition to the relocation, Perdue plans to move both the ERS and NIFA under the Office of the Chief Economist, a political branch of the department.

The USDA said the only goal is efficiency.

""It's been our goal to make USDA the most effective, efficient and customer-focused department in the entire federal government. In our administration, we have looked critically at the way we do business, with the ultimate goal of ensuring the best service possible for our customers, and for the taxpayers of the United States,"" Perdue said in a statement to CNN. ""In some cases, this has meant realigning some of our offices and functions, or even relocating them, in order to make more logical sense or provide more streamlined and efficient services. None of this reflects on the jobs being done by our ERS or NIFA employees.""

But three longtime agency employees, one from ERS and two from NIFA, told CNN that researchers and economists view the move as an intentional decision to undercut their work. All three employees requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation.

These workers described a steady flow of coworkers leaving since Perdue's initial announcement about the relocation plans last year, with one saying they are receiving goodbye emails from colleagues at a rate of roughly two per week.

""People who have families are hanging in limbo,"" one of the NIFA employees said. ""Many of the decisions they have to make are based on the school year and they simply can't make those decisions without any certainty.""

The ERS employee said that ERS employees have been told that there will be a limited number of buy-outs and that they will be offered on a first come, first served basis. The rest will have to choose whether to move or quit. They've been told they will receive some kind of assistance with a move, but those details aren't clear.

A USDA spokesperson told CNN that USDA has not yet determined how many people will be offered separation or retirement packages.

""We continue to openly and transparently share information with our employees, stakeholders and Congress,"" the spokesperson added.

Peter Winch, an American Federation of Government Employees representative who helped organize the ERS union, said that the union will try to stop the move and, failing that, will bargain to help make the transition as ""soft as possible.""

Winch said that there are about 225 NIFA staff eligible to participate in the June 11 unionization vote, which covers all professional and non-professional employees. There were 204 ERS staffers eligible to vote earlier this month, Winch said.

According to notes in the USDA budget, there were 350 staff at NIFA and 320 at ERA at the end of 2018.

The relocation plan has drawn opposition from House Democrats , who included language in their budget banning USDA from using funds allocated by Congress to relocate either NIFA or ERS outside the capital. A group of Democratic senators have also introduced legislation that would bar USDA from moving and reorganizing ERS and NIFA

The USDA's inspector general is also investigating whether Perdue has the legal authority to move the agencies.

Former USDA officials and scientific and agricultural associations have also come out against the plan, arguing that it may push trained staff out the door and pose a risk to the agency's independent and objective analysis.

""ERS is ranked as number three in the world of institutions in the field of agricultural economics, a reflection of our leadership in economic research,"" 56 former USDA officials wrote in a letter submitted to Congress . ""This proposal puts a world-renowned research agency at risk and could set back the federal statistical system at a time when the United States should be leading the world in innovation.""

Other agencies within the USDA are also experiencing tumult.

Last week, USDA announced it will cease operating the Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers, which help train low-income, rural students on how to respond to national emergencies, and will transfer them to the Department of Labor. Nine out of the 25 centers are expected to close as part of the move, according to the announcement, and a union spokesperson from the National Federation of Federal Employees told CNN that the move will cut more than 1,000 jobs

The ERS employee said that even if the move never happens, damage may already have been done.

""My fear is that the quagmire will continue to bleed us,"" the ERS employee said. ""That's what is so nefarious about all this, just how strategic this feels."""
