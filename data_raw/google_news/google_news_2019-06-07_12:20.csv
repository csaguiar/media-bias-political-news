"CNN’s Don Lemon laments Trump-era ‘toxicity’ and trolls, says he may move on: reports",https://www.foxnews.com,['Dom Calicchio'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/cnns-don-lemon-laments-trump-era-toxicity-and-trolls-says-he-may-move-on-reports,"The news – plus barbs from social media trolls and other critics -- may be too much for CNN’s Don Lemon to bear much longer.

The host of “CNN Tonight” told an audience in New York City on Thursday that the current “level of toxicity” in society – which he attributed to the Trump presidency – has him questioning whether he’ll still be on the air when the 2020 presidential election rolls around, according to reports.

“I don’t know if it’s worth this level of toxicity,” the 53-year-old Lemon said about continuing in his current position, the Daily Beast reported.

“I’m 10 years older than when he rode down the escalator in July 2015,” Lemon added, referring to Donald Trump's campaign announcement four years ago.

Lemon made the remarks at the Financial Times’ “Future of News” conference.

The anchor also spoke about the negative, unsolicited feedback he sometimes receives.

“I was doing a shoot in the park the other day and someone shouted at me, ‘I’m sick of watching you. We built this country. I can’t wait for CNN to fire your black a--, you f----t,'” he recalled, according to Deadline.

“So, all of those sorts of people call you on the phone and say those things, or they write you. I don’t go on social media anymore, it’s so toxic,” he added.

Lemon went on to blame the Trump era, and even the president himself.

“I’m black and gay on cable television in prime time — a unicorn — and I’m a target of the right, a target of white extremists, neo-Nazis and of the president,” Lemon said, according to Deadline.

He added later, “ I wonder how long I will continue to do this particular job,” the Daily Beast reported.

Lemon speculated he might be happier as a celebrity chef, or perhaps doing journalism “in a different way.”"
Automakers Tell Trump His Pollution Rules Could Mean ‘Untenable’ Instability and Lower Profits,https://www.nytimes.com,['Coral Davenport'],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/06/climate/trump-auto-emissions-rollback-letter.html,"Mr. Newsom said he is not interested in a “midway” deal requiring California to loosen its rules. “A rollback of auto emissions standards is bad for the climate and bad for the economy,” he wrote in an email. “I applaud the automakers for saying as much in their letter today to the President. We should keep working towards one national standard — one that doesn’t backtrack on the progress states like California have made.”

The letters are the latest twist in Mr. Trump’s effort to roll back regulations on auto manufacturing, an industry he has vowed to support. Some industry chief executives and lobbyists have been privately telling the White House for months that the president’s efforts may do more harm than good, but Thursday’s action represents a particularly strong pushback.

“Our thinking is, the rule is still being finalized, there is still time to develop a final rule that is good for consumers, policymakers and automakers,” said Gloria Bergquist, a vice president at the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers.

Criticizing the president’s plan comes with risk for the automakers. The White House has courted their support for his moves, and, privately, some officials have said that they fear industry criticism could lead the president to retaliate by imposing tariffs on auto imports. That, too, could be painful, because many cars and components are now made or partly assembled across the border in Mexico or Canada.

But they also fear the costs of the uncertainty and regulatory headaches that potentially await them should Mr. Trump’s rollback go through as planned.

For example, automakers would have to demonstrate that the average mileage of all the cars they sell in California is much higher than in states like Utah, where the new Trump standard of about 37 miles per gallon would be in effect.

But because Americans increasingly prefer SUVs over thriftier vehicles, manufacturers might have to significantly cut prices on electric vehicles in the high-mileage states, a potentially money-losing proposition, while raising the prices of gas guzzlers. At the same time, auto lots in low-mileage states might hold a completely different mix of vehicles at different prices."

Speaking exclusively to Fox News’ Laura Ingraham in Normandy, France, in an interview that aired Thursday, the president first took time to pay tribute to the heroes who fought on D-Day 75 years ago, describing them as “incredibly brave people” who displayed incredible “valor.”

Then, the president switched gears, slamming Pelosi, D-Calif., as a “nasty, vindictive, horrible person” -- after saying he had “tried to be nice to her.”

“I think she’s a disgrace. I actually don’t think she’s a talented person, I’ve tried to be nice to her because I would have liked to have gotten some deals done,” Trump said on “The Ingraham Angle.”

“She’s incapable of doing deals, she’s a nasty, vindictive, horrible person, the Mueller report came out, it was a disaster for them.”

FOX NEWS EXCLUSIVE: TRUMP SAYS MUELLER MADE A 'FOOL' OF HIMSELF

Trump then referenced former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report, suggesting some Democrats hoped it would give them the so-called silver bullet to take him down.

“They thought their good friend Bobby Mueller was going to give them a great report and he came out with a report with 13 horrible, angry Democrats who are totally biased against me,” the president told Ingraham.

“A couple of them worked for Hillary Clinton, they then added five more, also Democrats. With all of that, two-and-a-half years, think of it, from before I even got elected, they’ve been going after me and they have nothing.”

Ingraham then asked Trump if he cared whether or not Mueller would testify publicly about his report. The president used the question as another chance to unload on Pelosi.

JESSE WATTERS: PELOSI 'THROWING THE LEFT A BONE' WITH REPORTED COMMENT SHE WANTS TO SEE TRUMP IN 'PRISON'

“Let me tell you, he made such a fool out of himself the last time she -- because what people don’t report is the letter he had to do to straighten out his testimony because his testimony was wrong but Nancy Pelosi, I call her nervous Nancy, Nancy Pelosi doesn’t talk about it,” Trump told Fox News.

“Nancy Pelosi’s a disaster, OK, she’s a disaster and let her do what she wants, you know what? I think they’re in big trouble because when you look at the kind of crimes that were committed, and I don’t need any more evidence, and I guess from what I’m hearing there’s a lot of evidence coming in.

“And then ask Nancy, why is her district [having] drug needles all over the place? It’s the most disgusting thing what she’s allowed to happen to her district, with needles, with drug addicts... with people living on the sidewalk.”

Trump continued, referencing Pelosi’s reported comment to fellow top Democrats that she would like to see him in “prison.”

MUELLER SAYS CHARGING TRUMP WITH A CRIME WAS ‘NOT AN OPTION’ IN RUSSIA PROBE

“It was a horrible, nasty, vicious statement while I’m overseas... She didn’t want to – she is a terrible person and I’ll tell you her name, it’s nervous Nancy because she’s a nervous wreck.”

Pelosi, as Politico reported, made the remark while defending her stance against impeaching the president in an evening meeting with House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., and other top Democrats.

“I don’t want to see him impeached, I want to see him in prison,” she said, according to multiple Democratic sources familiar with the meeting. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., and Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., also reportedly attended the meeting.

Trump also discussed his potential 2020 opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, during his interview with Ingraham.

After being asked about Biden downplaying the potential threat of China to the U.S. at a recent town-hall event, Trump said: “He just doesn't get it, he just doesn't get it.”

“How happy would President Xi be to have Joe Biden be the nominee of the Democratic party,” Ingraham followed up, to which the president replied: “Well he wants him, he wants him.”

Elsewhere during the president’s wide-ranging interview with Ingraham, he said Mueller made “such a fool” out of himself last week when he delivered his first and only public statement about the Russia investigation.

“Let me tell you, he made such a fool out of himself ... because what people don’t report is the letter he had to do to straighten out his testimony because his testimony was wrong,” Trump told Ingraham.

Trump was referring to Mueller’s initial suggestion that the president was not charged with an obstruction-of-justice offense because of longstanding Justice Department policy.

“Charging the president with a crime was not an option we could consider,” Mueller said last week, citing an Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinion stating that a sitting president could not be indicted.

“If we had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said that. ... We concluded that we would not reach a determination one way or the other about whether the president committed a crime,” Mueller said.

Trump Allows High-Tech U.S. Bomb Parts to Be Built in Saudi Arabia,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Michael Laforgia', 'Walt Bogdanich']",06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/07/us/saudi-arabia-arms-sales-raytheon.html,"WASHINGTON — When the Trump administration declared an emergency last month and fast-tracked the sale of more American arms to Saudi Arabia, it did more than anger members of Congress who opposed the sale on humanitarian grounds.

It also raised concerns that the Saudis could gain access to technology that would let them produce their own versions of American precision-guided bombs — weapons they have used in strikes on civilians since they began fighting a war in Yemen four years ago.

The emergency authorization allows Raytheon Company, a top American defense firm, to team with the Saudis to build high-tech bomb parts in Saudi Arabia. That provision, which has not been previously reported, is part of a broad package of information the administration released this week to Congress.

The move grants Raytheon and the Saudis sweeping permission to begin assembling the control systems, guidance electronics and circuit cards that are essential to the company’s Paveway smart bombs. The United States has closely guarded such technology for national security reasons."
"Trump says U.S. lawmakers ""should be ashamed"" for resisting his ""beautiful"" Mexico tariffs",https://www.cbsnews.com,[],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariff-on-mexico-beautiful-president-blasts-republican-opponents-migrant-invasion/,"President Trump has defended his threat to impose steep new tariffs on all goods imported from Mexico, rejecting concerns of economists and some fellow Republicans that the proposed increase of up to 25% could hurt U.S. businesses and consumers as much as it punishes Mexico. Mr. Trump is threatening to slap tariffs on all Mexican imports from Monday, starting at 5%, unless Mexico stems the flow of migrants reaching the U.S. southern border.

""Tariffs are a beautiful thing. It's a beautiful word if you know how to use them properly,"" Mr. Trump told Fox News host Laura Ingram on Thursday in France, where he was taking part in 75th D-Day anniversary commemorations.

Mr. Trump said the U.S. Congress bears some of the blame for the circumstances at the border, where record numbers of migrants -- primarily from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala -- have crossed illegally into the U.S. in recent weeks from Mexico. But he said Mexico was also culpable, ""because they are letting people walk up through their country and they shouldn't let anybody walk up through their country.""

""Now I've told Mexico if you don't stop this onslaught, this invasion -- people get angry when I use the word 'invasion,' people like Nancy Pelosi that, honestly, they don't know what the hell they're talking about,"" Mr. Trump said, taking a new shot at his rival, the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives.

U.S.-Mexico trade talks continue amid GOP pushback on tariffs

The president accused Mexico, through what he views as inadequate enforcement of its own borders, of allowing ""an invasion without guns"" across the U.S. frontier.

""They send in $500 billion worth of drugs, they kill 100,000 people. They ruin a million families every year,"" Mr. Trump claimed. ""If you look at that, that's really an invasion without the guns.""

On Thursday U.S. officials told CBS News that Mexico's government had offered to deploy 6,000 troops along its own southern border and to overhaul its asylum laws in a bid to appease the Trump administration and avoid the new tariffs being imposed on Monday. There has reportedly been debate within the Trump administration about delaying the June 10 deadline, but White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Thursday that the U.S. was ""still moving forward with tariffs at this time.""

Mr. Trump dismissed concerns that hiking tariffs on Mexican imports could hit U.S. consumers and manufacturers, claiming instead that if they were imposed the U.S. would, ""make a fortune, because all the companies are going to move back into the country.""

The impact of tariffs

CBS News' MoneyWatch reported on Thursday, however, that many U.S. companies, especially small to medium size manufacturers, would struggle to absorb the costs of moving their operations out of Mexico, and struggle even more to move those operations onto U.S. soil where labor costs are much higher.

Michelle Casario, an assistant professor of economics at Villanova University, told CBS News this week that if even the first-tier 5% tariff is levied on imports from Mexico, American ""consumers could expect to see higher prices from avocados to tomatoes, beer to tequila, phones to computers to televisions, and even higher prices at the gas pump,"" due to how intertwined the neighboring nations' economies have become during 25 years of free trade.

Mexico tariffs could raise average price of American car by $1,500

Due to those concerns, and the fact that any reciprocal tariffs imposed by Mexico could hurt American farmers who export south of the border, Mr. Trump faces considerable opposition within his party. In the Senate, at least, it's possible that Republicans could try to block him from moving forward with the planned tariff hike.

Mr. Trump told Fox News that such opposition from Congress -- including from his own party members -- was diminishing his bargaining power as his administration negotiates with the Mexican government to get it to crack down on the migrant flow.

The president said Congress, ""should be saying, 'we are with the President, we will do whatever he wants to do,' and Mexico would fold like an umbrella.""

Instead, Mr. Trump complained that, ""I have these people -- and I'm saying there are some Republicans, too -- I think they should be ashamed of themselves… they come out and they talk about 'tariffs are bad,' so, they are killing-- they are hurting my negotiation."""
FBI agent: Russian official tried to arrange Trump-Putin call for day after inauguration,https://www.politico.com,"['Darren Samuelsohn', 'Kyle Cheney']",06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/06/fbi-trump-puting-call-inaguration-1356589,"Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn’s case took several unexpected twists on Thursday as it inches toward closure. | Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP Photo legal FBI agent: Russian official tried to arrange Trump-Putin call for day after inauguration The bureau learned about the Russian ambassador’s attempt while interviewing Michael Flynn early in the administration.

A top Russian official tried to set up a video teleconference between President Donald Trump and President Vladimir Putin of Russia on the day after Trump’s inauguration, according to a senior FBI agent’s interview notes released on Thursday.

Peter Strzok, at the time a lead FBI agent investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, heard about the attempt to connect Trump and Putin while he and another bureau agent interviewed the president’s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, at the White House just days into the new administration.

Story Continued Below

Flynn relayed that he’d gotten the request to arrange a Trump-Putin call from Sergey Kislyak, then the Russian ambassador to the U.S., when the two men spoke shortly after Christmas in 2016 as part of a broader conversation covering a range of issues important to the two countries.

U.S. and Russian officials have never confirmed that a conversation took place between Trump and Putin on Jan. 21, 2017, though the White House on Jan. 28 of that year offered a readout of a “congratulatory call” from the Russian leader that happened that day.

“The positive call was a significant start to improving the relationship between the United States and Russia that is in need of repair,” the White House said at the time, describing a conversation lasting about one hour and involving issues including Syria and fighting Islamic terrorism.

John Dowd message for Robert Kelner

Federal prosecutors released Strzok’s notes from his Jan. 24, 2017, interview with Flynn as part of the ongoing case against the former top Trump aide, who still awaits sentencing stemming from his December 2017 guilty plea for lying to the FBI about his conversations with Kislyak.

Strzok, a deputy FBI assistant director at the time of the Flynn interview, has been a top target for the president and his Republican allies after the disclosure that he’d sent a series of anti-Trump text messages to one of his colleagues. The FBI in August 2018 fired Strzok over the exchanges, a disciplinary move that Trump cited as reason to wrap up the Russia investigation that Strzok in its early stages had a senior role in leading.

Flynn’s case took several unexpected twists on Thursday as it inches toward closure. First, his longtime lawyers notified the presiding federal judge that their client had fired them and hired new attorneys. That move set off a raft of speculation in legal and political circles that Flynn is considering backing out of his plea deal with the government in a play for a presidential pardon.

Also on Thursday, federal prosecutors released the audio recording of a November 2017 voicemail left by John Dowd, Trump’s personal attorney at the time, to one of Flynn’s lawyers seeking information about discussions they were having with special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigators before Flynn ultimately pleaded guilty.

Mueller cited Dowd’s comments — he urged Flynn’s lawyers to “remember what we’ve always said about the president and his feelings toward Flynn, and that still remains” — in the obstruction of justice section of the special counsel’s final report, which was released in April.

Strzok’s notes from the FBI agents’ interview with Flynn, known in bureau parlance as a “302” for the form an agent fills out, offer several more details about multiple conversations between the Trump aide and the Russian ambassador after the 2016 election.

According to Strzok’s write-up, Flynn called Kislyak twice around Christmas 2016 to express condolences for a pair of tragedies — the murder of Russia’s ambassador to Turkey and an airplane crash in which members of a Russian choir were killed. Both calls, Flynn told the FBI agents, were to maintain a good relationship with his Russian counterpart.

On Dec. 28 of that year, Kislyak also texted Flynn, who told the FBI agents he was traveling in the Dominican Republican at the time and had poor cellphone reception, so therefore didn’t call Kislyak until the following day. Flynn told the agents that when the two connected, they discussed setting up the video call between Trump and Putin, as well as picking a representative to a terrorism conference in Khazakhstan.

That call was the same day that then-President Barack Obama announced he would expel 35 Russian diplomats in response to Russia’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 election. But Flynn said he didn’t recall any discussion with Kislyak about that. When agents pressed Flynn, asking specifically whether he had told Kislyak not to engage in a “tit-for-tat” with Obama, Flynn told them, “Not really.”

In Flynn’s guilty plea, he admitted that this version of events was untrue. He acknowledged speaking with a member of the Trump transition team about how to persuade Russia not to escalate the situation with the Obama administration, and immediately reported back to the team after his conversation with Kislyak. The next day, Putin agreed not to retaliate for the U.S. actions.

Flynn also told the FBI agents about the origins of his relationship with senior Russian officials, which began in 2013, when he was Obama’s defense intelligence chief. At the time, Flynn said, he was invited to the headquarters of the GRU, Russia’s military intelligence agency, for a “leadership development” program. Flynn met the head of the GRU, Igor Sergun, on that trip and kept in touch with him afterward, but their relationship abruptly ended when Russia invaded Crimea in 2014.

Flynn told the FBI agents that he and Sergun had “common ground” — both discussed their experiences in military conflict, and both had sons of about the same age. Flynn called Kislyak in early 2016 to express condolences when Sergun died in Lebanon.

In his FBI interview, Flynn also recalled that his second trip to Russia came in late 2015, when he was famously invited to a gala hosted by RT, a Russian media outlet. Pictures of the event show that he was seated at the same table as Putin. Flynn told agents that he and his son paid a visit to Kislyak around the time of this trip as a courtesy — and he noted that he had received a “threat briefing” from the Defense Intelligence Agency before attending."
House Democrats likely to hold AG Barr in contempt after DOJ denies demand for census documents,https://www.foxnews.com,['Talia Kaplan'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/census-2020-barr-contempt-house-democrats-wilbur-ross,"The Justice Department on Thursday denied a House committee's demand for more documents related to the Trump administration's decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, which likely will lead to another contempt-of-Congress citation for Attorney General William Barr.

In a letter to House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd said the documents that the Democrat-led committee subpoenaed could not be released because they were protected by “the attorney-client privilege, deliberative process privilege, and/or the attorney work product doctrine.”

“Given the ongoing accommodation efforts by the Department, we believe that a vote on contempt would be entirely premature,” the letter stated, citing “eight submissions to the Committee in its ongoing, rolling document production totaling more than 17,000 pages,” since the DOJ received the committee’s February document request and the subpoena that followed two months later.

FEDERAL JUDGE BARS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION FROM ADDING CITIZENSHIP QUESTION TO 2020 CENSUS

Boyd noted that “The Department has also identified tens of thousands more responsive pages that it is in the process of producing” and made two senior officials available for interviews.

Cummings, D-Md., had said the panel would vote soon on contempt measures for Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross unless specific documents were received by Thursday.

A Commerce Department spokesperson, in an email, called holding the Secretary in contempt an “empty stunt” and pointed out that the department had delivered about 14,000 pages of documents. The spokesperson said repeated requests for the committee to explain its needs for this specific information were never met.

Ross also testified before the committee for nearly seven hours earlier this year, the spokesperson said, adding that the department was planning to make three of its senior officials available for interviews in the next three weeks.

A representative for Cummings did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment but in a statement earlier this month said that the failure of Barr and Ross to respond to the Oversight subpoenas was “part of a pattern” by the administration to engage in a “cover-up” and challenge the authority of Congress to conduct constitutionally required oversight.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ESCALATES FIGHT OVER CENSUS CITIZENSHIP QUESTION, TURNING TO SUPREME COURT

“This cover-up is being directed from the top,” Cummings said, pointing out that Trump has vowed to fight all subpoenas issued by Congress and refused to work on legislative priorities, such as infrastructure, until Congress stopped the investigations of his administration.

The House Judiciary Committee voted last month to hold Barr in contempt of Congress as part of a separate legal battle with the Trump administration over access to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election.

A vote by the full House would be needed to hold Barr and Ross in contempt on the census issue.

The Supreme Court is considering the citizenship question in a ruling expected later this year.

The committee approved the subpoenas on the census issue in April. Democrats said they wanted specific documents to try finding out why Ross added the citizenship question to the 2020 census and said the Trump administration had refused to provide the documents despite repeated requests.

Ross told the committee the decision to add the question was based on a Justice Department request to help it enforce the Voting Rights Act.

Cummings disputed that, citing documents discovered last month suggesting that the real reason the administration wanted to add the citizenship question was to help officials gerrymander legislative districts in overtly partisan and racist ways.

Democrats have claimed the citizenship question could reduce census participation in immigrant-heavy communities, which in turn would harm representation and access to federal dollars.

"VA may owe veterans millions in refunds but knowingly hasn't paid them for years, probe finds",https://www.usatoday.com,"['Donovan Slack', 'Published P.M. Et June']",06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/06/06/va-may-owe-disabled-veterans-millions-refunds-home-loan-fees/1367679001/,"CLOSE

WASHINGTON – More than 50,000 disabled veterans could be owed as much as $190 million in refunds from the Department of Veterans Affairs for home loan fees they were wrongly charged or no longer owe, an investigation has found.

Senior leaders knew about the problem for years but didn’t ensure veterans received what they are due, the investigation by the VA inspector general found.

Veterans pay the fees when they buy homes with the help of VA's Home Loan Guaranty Program, but they are supposed to be exempt if they are disabled. Fees can total up to 3.3% of a home's value.

In cases where veterans improperly paid the fees or the VA later determined they were disabled, the agency is supposed to issue refunds.

But the VA didn’t do that in thousands of cases dating back more than a decade because the veterans didn't ask for the refunds.

VA loan managers, who knew about outstanding debts to veterans since at least 2014, told investigators that they had been focused on other priorities, including processing high volumes of applications.

Investigators from the inspector general’s office said in their report released Thursday that they found it “troubling” that the managers were “aware that thousands of veterans were potentially owed more than $150 million yet did not take adequate actions to ensure refunds were issued.”

“It is the review team’s opinion that requiring a veteran to submit a claim for a refund improperly places the burden and responsibility solely upon the veteran,” investigators said.

'Internal quality improvement'

The VA issued a press release last month – as the inspector general was preparing to release the investigation results – announcing that the agency is now notifying veterans when they buy homes under the program that they are exempt from the fees if they are disabled or later determined to be disabled.

“Through an internal quality improvement effort, VA has put a plan in place to better inform veterans through key communications when the law allows VA to waive the fee for a veteran,” VA Secretary Robert Wilkie said in the release.

The release did not say what is being done to ensure veterans due refunds from loans in prior years are paid. The inspector general found the amounts owed in its review ranged from $5,000 to $20,000.

The VA said veterans who believe they are owed a refund should consult the agency’s website for more information about VA home loan funding fees.

Between 2012 and 2017, the VA collected roughly $10 billion in fees from veterans under the loan program.

The inspector general estimated disabled veterans who were wrongly charged accounted for $286 million of those fees. But the VA only refunded about $100 million, leaving an estimated $190 million that may still be due to 53,200 veterans.

The Loan Guaranty program was established in 1944 to help veterans finance home purchases. Loans are provided by private lenders, but the VA guarantees a portion of the loans for eligible buyers. The lenders collect the fees and transmit them to the VA.

If a veteran wrongly paid the fees, the VA can refund the money directly to the veteran. If the fees were included as part of a loan, the VA pays the lender, which applies it to the loan balance.

'Other priorities'

In 2014, regional VA loan officials in St. Paul, Minnesota, notified senior VA managers that an analysis found nearly $150 million may be due in refunds to disabled veterans for fees on 48,000 loans issued between 2006 and 2014.

“As of January 2019, the review team received no indication that a large-scale effort had been initiated to issue refunds to these veterans,” the inspector general said.

The director of the Loan Guaranty program since 2017, Jeffrey London, told investigators he “considered contracting out the task of issuing refunds, but never requested the award of a contract because other priorities…took precedence,” the investigators wrote.

The inspector general recommended the agency identify and pay all the veterans owed refunds. In addition, the VA should implement procedures to minimize the number of veterans who are wrongly charged fees and conduct periodic reviews to ensure those who are receive prompt refunds.

The VA told investigators some of the fees were incorrectly assessed by lenders, not the VA. But agency officials said in their response to the report that they “generally agreed” with the investigation’s findings and are consulting lawyers about complexities related to issuing refunds.

The agency “has drafted a plan with contingencies ready for implementation depending on the (legal) opinion,” the VA response said. The agency did not elaborate on what the plan is or when refunds will be issued.

""We observed spoiled and moldy food in kitchen refrigerators, as well as food past its expiration date,"" the report stated.

At one facility in New Jersey, investigators said the food was ""so substandard"" that facility managers replaced the kitchen manager in the middle of the inspection.

At two facilities in California and New Jersey, the investigators said they found ""immediate risks or egregious violations of detention standards,"" including ""nooses in detainee cells"" and ""inadequate medical care.""

Expired food and health issues were found at all four facilities mentioned in the report released this week. CNN first obtained details of the report.

Investigators conducted unannounced inspections at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in California, the LaSalle ICE Processing Center in Louisiana, the Essex County Correctional Facility in New Jersey), and the Aurora ICE Processing Center in Colorado.

ICE agreed with the inspector general’s recommendations and ensured facilities would take ""corrective action"" in response to the report’s findings.

The newly released report comes on the heels of another Homeland Security oversight investigation that found overcrowded and unsanitary conditions at migrant holding facilities along the border.

In the review of facilities run by Customs and Border Protection, the government watchdog found migrants were kept in ""standing-room-only conditions"" for days or weeks at a time.

Why Mueller’s team omitted that part of the Kilimnik narrative from its report and related court filings is not known. But the revelation of it comes as the accuracy of Mueller’s Russia conclusions face increased scrutiny.

The incomplete portrayal of Kilimnik is so important to Mueller’s overall narrative that it is raised in the opening of his report. “The FBI assesses” Kilimnik “to have ties to Russian intelligence,” Mueller’s team wrote on page 6, putting a sinister light on every contact Kilimnik had with Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman.

What it doesn’t state is that Kilimnik was a “sensitive” intelligence source for State going back to at least 2013 while he was still working for Manafort, according to FBI and State Department memos I reviewed.

Kilimnik was not just any run-of-the-mill source, either.

He interacted with the chief political officer at the U.S. Embassy in Kiev, sometimes meeting several times a week to provide information on the Ukraine government. He relayed messages back to Ukraine’s leaders and delivered written reports to U.S. officials via emails that stretched on for thousands of words, the memos show.

The FBI knew all of this, well before the Mueller investigation concluded.

Alan Purcell, the chief political officer at the Kiev embassy from 2014 to 2017, told FBI agents that State officials, including senior embassy officials Alexander Kasanof and Eric Schultz, deemed Kilimnik to be such a valuable asset that they kept his name out of cables for fear he would be compromised by leaks to WikiLeaks.

“Purcell described what he considered an unusual level of discretion that was taken with handling Kilimnik,” states one FBI interview report that I reviewed. “Normally the head of the political section would not handle sources, but Kasanof informed Purcell that KILIMNIK was a sensitive source.”

Purcell told the FBI that Kilimnik provided “detailed information about OB (Ukraine’s opposition bloc) inner workings” that sometimes was so valuable it was forwarded immediately to the ambassador. Purcell learned that other Western governments relied on Kilimnik as a source, too.

“One time, in a meeting with the Italian embassy, Purcell heard the Italian ambassador echo a talking point that was strikingly familiar to the point Kilimnik had shared with Purcell,” the FBI report states.

Kasanof, who preceded Purcell as the U.S. Embassy political officer, told the FBI he knew Kilimnik worked for Manafort’s lobbying firm and the administration of former Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovych, whose Party of Regions hired Manafort’s firm.

Kasanof described Kilimnik as one of the few reliable insiders the U.S. Embassy had informing on Yanukovych. Kilimnik began his relationship as an informant with the U.S. deputy chief of mission in 2012-13, before being handed off to the embassy’s political office, the records suggest.

“Kilimnik was one of the only people within the administration who was willing to talk to USEMB,” referring to the U.S. embassy, and he “provided information about the inner workings of Yanukovych’s administration,” Kasanof told the FBI agents.

“Kasanof met with Kilimnik at least bi-weekly and occasionally multiple times in the same week,” always outside the embassy to avoid detection, the FBI wrote. “Kasanof allowed Kilimnik to take the lead on operational security” for their meetings.

State officials told the FBI that although Kilimnik had Ukrainian and Russian residences, he did not appear to hold any allegiance to Moscow and was critical of Russia’s invasion of the Crimean territory of Ukraine.

“Most sources of information in Ukraine were slanted in one direction or another,” Kasanof told agents. “Kilimnik came across as less slanted than others.”

“Kilimnik was flabbergasted at the Russian invasion of Crimea,” the FBI added, summarizing Kasanof’s interview with agents.

Three sources with direct knowledge of the inner workings of Mueller’s office confirmed to me that the special prosecutor’s team had all of the FBI interviews with State officials, as well as Kilimnik’s intelligence reports to the U.S. Embassy, well before they portrayed him as a Russian sympathizer tied to Moscow intelligence or charged Kilimnik with participating with Manafort in a scheme to obstruct the Russia investigation.

Kasanof’s and Purcell’s interviews are corroborated by scores of State Department emails I reviewed that contain regular intelligence from Kilimnik on happenings inside the Yanukovych administration, the Crimea conflict and Ukrainian and Russian politics. For example, the memos show Kilimnik provided real-time intelligence on everything from whose star in the administration was rising or falling to efforts at stuffing ballot boxes in Ukrainian elections.

Those emails raise further doubt about the Mueller report’s portrayal of Kilimnik as a Russian agent. They show Kilimnik was allowed to visit the United States twice in 2016 to meet with State officials, a clear sign he wasn’t flagged in visa databases as a foreign intelligence threat.

The emails also show how misleading, by omission, the Mueller report’s public portrayal of Kilimnik turns out to be.

For instance, the report makes a big deal about Kilimnik’s meeting with Manafort in August 2016 at the Trump Tower in New York.

By that time, Manafort had served as Trump’s campaign chairman for several months but was about to resign because of a growing controversy about the millions of dollars Manafort accepted as a foreign lobbyist for Yanukovych’s party.

Specifically, the Mueller report flagged Kilimnik’s delivery of a peace plan to the Trump campaign for settling the two-year-old Crimea conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

“Kilimnik requested the meeting to deliver in person a peace plan for Ukraine that Manafort acknowledged to the Special Counsel’s Office was a ‘backdoor’ way for Russia to control part of eastern Ukraine,” the Mueller report stated.

But State emails showed Kilimnik first delivered a version of his peace plan in May 2016 to the Obama administration during a visit to Washington. Kasanof, his former handler at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, had been promoted to a top policy position at State, and the two met for dinner on May 5, 2016.

The day after the dinner, Kilimnik sent an email to Kasanof’s official State email address recounting the peace plan they had discussed the night before.

Russia wanted “a quick settlement” to get “Ukraine out of the way and get rid of sanctions and move to economic stuff they are interested in,” Kilimnik wrote Kasanof. The email offered eight bullet points for the peace plan — starting with a ceasefire, a law creating economic recovery zones to rebuild war-torn Ukrainian regions, and a “presidential decree on amnesty” for anyone involved in the conflict on both sides.

Kilimnik also provided a valuable piece of intelligence, stating that the old Yanukovych political party aligned with Russia was dead. “Party of Regions cannot be reincarnated. It is over,” he wrote, deriding as “stupid” a Russian-backed politician who wanted to restart the party.

Kasanof replied the next day that, although he was skeptical of some of the intelligence on Russian intentions, it was “very important for us to know.”

He thanked Kilimnik for the detailed plan and added, “I passed the info to my bosses, who are chewing it over.” Kasanof told the FBI that he believed he sent Kilimnik’s peace plan to two senior State officials, including Victoria Nuland, Obama’s assistant secretary of State for European and Eurasian affairs.

So Kilimnik’s delivery of the peace plan to the Trump campaign in August 2016 was flagged by Mueller as potentially nefarious, but its earlier delivery to the Obama administration wasn’t mentioned. That’s what many in the intelligence world might call “deception by omission.”

Lest you wonder, the documents I reviewed included evidence that Kasanof’s interview with the FBI and Kilimnik’s emails to State about the peace plan were in Mueller’s possession by early 2018, more than a year before the final report.

Officials for the State Department, the FBI, the Justice Department and Mueller’s office did not respond to requests for comment. Kilimnik did not respond to an email seeking comment but, in an email last month to The Washington Post, he slammed the Mueller report’s “made-up narrative” about him. “I have no ties to Russian or, for that matter, any intelligence operation,” he wrote.

Kilimnik holds Ukrainian and Russian citizenship, served in the Soviet military, attended a prestigious Russian language academy and had contacts with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. So it is likely he had contacts over the years with Russian intelligence figures. There also is evidence Kilimnik left the U.S.-funded International Republican Institute (IRI) in 2005 because of concerns about his past connections to Russia, though at least one IRI witness disputed that evidence to the FBI, the memos show.

Yet, omitting his extensive, trusted assistance to the State Department seems inexplicable.

If Mueller’s team can cast such a misleading portrayal of Kilimnik, however, it begs the question of what else might be incorrect or omitted in the report.

Elijah Cummings indicates he will move ahead with contempt vote against Barr and Ross,https://www.cnn.com,['Laura Jarrett'],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/06/politics/doj-2020-census-response-house-oversight/index.html,"(CNN) The chairman of the House Oversight Committee indicated Friday morning that he will proceed with a contempt vote against Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross over a dispute about documents regarding a potential citizenship question on the 2020 census.

The Department of Justice said on Thursday it was working to get the committee more documents in response to a subpoena for the information, but said some materials the panel has requested will continue to be withheld. Justice is also refusing to allow John Gore, a senior official in the civil rights division, to appear before the committee without department counsel in the room -- which the committee has thus far refused to allow.

House Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings, however, said that offer was insufficient.

""We gave Attorney General Barr and Secretary Ross every opportunity to produce the documents the Committee needs for our investigation, but rather than cooperate, they have decided that they would rather be held in contempt of Congress,"" Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, said in a statement Friday morning. ""They produced none of the documents we asked for, they made no counter-offers regarding these documents, and they seem determined to continue the Trump Administration's cover-up.""

Cummings had said Monday he would postpone the contempt vote if the Commerce and the Justice departments produced the materials the committee had previously requested.

"Civil rights groups snub Barr meeting on police reform, despite past outcry",https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/civil-rights-groups-snub-barr-meeting-on-police-reform-despite-past-outcry,"Attorney General Bill Barr got a surprise this week when he hosted a listening session for civil rights groups supposedly concerned about the Justice Department's commitment to police reform.

Hardly anybody showed up.

DOJ REVEALS DEMS ACKNOWLEDGED BARR SUBPOENA WAS 'OVERBROAD'; NADLER FIRES BACK, OFFERS TO MEET 'WITHOUT CONDITIONS'

The meeting itself stemmed from a commitment he made to Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., during his confirmation hearing. The 2020 presidential candidate had challenged Barr to host the session to discuss a memo from his predecessor Jeff Sessions limiting the use of so-called ""consent decrees"" to reform local police departments accused of rights violations.

But after Barr invited numerous groups to such a meeting on Tuesday, the only person to attend was Frederick Misilo, president of the Arc, an organization that provides advocacy for those with intellectual disabilities.

A statement from the Justice Department said the meeting between Barr and Misilo was “productive” and touted the “critical role” of partnerships between the federal government and state agencies in protecting people’s rights.

“As Attorney General Barr publicly stated in his Senate hearings, he is committed to vigorous enforcement of federal civil rights laws and has directed the Department to continue its diligent work on these matters,” the statement said.

However, a Justice Department official accused the other invited organizations of letting politics get in the way of advancing that conversation.

“The attorney general clearly spent the time to listen to this one president, and if there were more folks, we would have had more perspectives, but they kind of just wanted to play the political games,” the official told The Washington Post.

Misilo told the Post that the 40-minute discussion with Barr was “helpful,” and that Barr expressed “an openness to take our interests under advisement,” though Barr did not commit to any specific action.

The other organizations on Barr’s invite list were the American Civil Liberties Union, the NAACP, the Human Rights Campaign, the National Fair Housing Alliance, UnidosUS, and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund.

The Leadership Conference on Civil & Human Rights, a coalition of civil rights groups, sent a letter to Barr on Tuesday explaining why the above groups were not going to meet with him. They said a larger number of them had initially requested a meeting with Barr, but the attorney general only selected a portion of them. The letter was signed by the six groups who declined Barr’s invitation, as well as others who were not invited -- including The Drug Policy Alliance, Human Rights Watch, The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and the National Urban League.

""In our view, the decision not to include certain organizations severely limits the Department's ability to learn about and consider the critical civil rights and public safety issues at stake,"" the letter said.

The handling of consent decrees has long been a contentious issue.

The Obama administration had used such decrees in cities where there were concerns of unfair treatment of minorities by the police. A consent decree with the Baltimore Police Department, for example, came about after a DOJ investigation found patterns of discriminatory conduct.

Sessions’ memo said that while consent decrees are “sometimes necessary and appropriate to secure compliance with federal law,” there are federalism-based concerns with federal court decrees that govern state and local government entities. It outlined requirements for future consent decrees, including defined limits on the terms of decrees, as well as “specific and measurable actions that trigger the decree's termination,” so that a consent decree can come to an end if an agency shows that they have “come into durable compliance” with the relevant federal laws.

COMEY DENOUNCES BARR AFTER CBS INTERVIEW: 'AN AG SHOULD NOT BE ECHOING CONSPIRACY THEORIES'

The Justice Department stated that Barr is also planning a listening session with state and local law enforcement, and that ""the Department's door remains open to groups who wish to discuss these important civil and constitutional issues.""

Sessions' memo was sent out in November 2018. Since then, the DOJ has still used consent decrees, entering into one to reform the Chicago Police Department in January 2019."

The Justice and Commerce departments on Thursday rejected House Democratic demands for more documents about the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census, likely leading to contempt citations for Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.

In a letter to Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd said the documents the panel subpoenaed are protected by attorney-client privilege and therefore cannot be disclosed.

Story Continued Below

“[T]he committee’s insistence that the department immediately turn over these documents ... is improper,” Boyd wrote, adding that the Justice Department has already turned over tens of thousands of documents and made officials available for interviews.

A Commerce Department spokesperson accused the committee of trying to interfere with ongoing litigation that centers on the constitutionality of the citizenship question appearing on the census.

“In its zeal to influence the Supreme Court’s decision, the committee is poised to hold Secretary Ross in contempt,” the spokesperson said. “Holding the secretary in contempt is an empty stunt, and it shows that the committee is simply interested in playing politics.”

The Democrat-led committee gave the Justice Department and the Commerce Department until 5 p.m. on Thursday to comply with its subpoenas, threatening to initiate contempt proceedings absent compliance.

A spokeswoman for Cummings did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The committee has been investigating the decision to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census, with lawmakers accusing the Trump administration — Ross in particular — of lying about its origins.

New evidence emerged last week that the administration allegedly “concealed” the role of now-deceased Republican gerrymandering expert Thomas Hofeller, who believed that adding a citizenship question to the census would boost Republicans in future elections.

The Trump administration has said it is simply trying to enforce the Voting Rights Act, but Democrats have argued that such a question would create an undercount of ethnic and racial minorities, resulting in newly drawn congressional districts that would diminish their influence in American elections.

Cummings said this week that the Trump administration was seeking “to gerrymander congressional districts in overtly racist, partisan and unconstitutional ways,” and he accused the Trump administration of a “coverup.” Republicans on the committee have said that holding Barr and Ross in contempt is an effort to improperly interfere with ongoing court proceedings about the census question.

The subpoenas, which were first authorized in April, required the Justice and Commerce departments to turn over all communications with the White House, the Republican National Committee, and President Donald Trump’s campaign, among other entities. The subpoenas also sought memos and witness testimony.

One of those witnesses, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Gore, refused to answer lawmakers’ specific questions about his role in drafting a DOJ memo, requesting the addition of a citizenship question, and he later skipped a scheduled deposition with the committee.

In a statement, the Justice Department said Gore had “never heard of” Hofeller’s work, and added that it “played no role in the department’s December 2017 request to reinstate a citizenship question.”

Barr is expected to be formally held in contempt of Congress in a separate matter on Tuesday, when the House is scheduled to vote on a contempt citation for his refusal to turn over former special counsel Robert Mueller’s unredacted report and underlying evidence, allowing the House Judiciary Committee to enforce its subpoena in federal court.

The contempt resolution will also allow other committees to enforce their subpoenas without requiring a full House vote.

"VA owes disabled veterans refunds on home loan fees, report says",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Congress', 'Campaigns', 'Health Policy', 'Pennsylvania Politics', 'June At Pm']",06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/va-owes-disabled-veterans-refunds-on-home-loan-fees-report-says/2019/06/06/ad692cc2-8895-11e9-98c1-e945ae5db8fb_story.html,"The federal government owes at least $189 million to 53,000 disabled veterans who overpaid on their home loans, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs’ inspector general.

When veterans take out a mortgage, they pay a funding fee to the lender that usually costs several thousand dollars. The fee is waived for veterans who receive disability compensation.

A review by VA’s Office of Inspector General released Thursday found that from 2012 through 2017, more than half of the veterans entitled to this added benefit paid the fee and never received reimbursement from the government.

The Veterans Benefits Administration, in its response to the inspector general report, agreed to identify the exempt veterans who paid the fee and issue them refunds.

The VBA noted that the financial impact to the veterans was minimal over the life of the loan, the inspector general report says.

The watchdog office said it “stands by the assertion that VBA did not protect these veterans’ financial interests and any inappropriate funding fee charges, regardless of the amount, should be refunded.”

The review found that in some instances, certificates of eligibility for exemption were “outdated, incorrect or missing.” In one example cited in the report, a veteran had been receiving disability compensation since March 2011, but it wasn’t correct on his eligibility form, so when he bought a home in September 2017, he was incorrectly charged $5,800.

Currently, veterans have to file a claim if they were wrongfully charged the fee and request the refund, which the IG said “improperly places the burden and responsibility solely upon the veteran.”

The watchdog report also said the Veterans Benefits Administration knew since 2014 that tens of thousands of veterans may have been wrongfully charged the funding fee.

“OIG finds it troubling that senior VBA management was aware that thousands of veterans were potentially owed more than $150 million yet did not take adequate actions to ensure refunds were issued,” the report says.

In 2014, VA was mired in a broader scandal around long patient wait times at VA health facilities resulting in veteran deaths.

VA’s Loan Guaranty Service office, which oversees VA’s home loan program, told the IG that it, too, had an issue with long wait times and prioritized that over ensuring that veterans weren’t overcharged."
Agency Watchdog Slams Conditions at ICE Detention Facilities,https://www.snopes.com,['Associated Press'],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.snopes.com/ap/2019/06/06/agency-watchdog-slams-conditions-at-ice-detention-facilities/,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Homeland Security Department’s internal watchdog says rotting food, moldy and dilapidated bathrooms and agency practices at immigration detention facilities may violate detainees’ rights.

The Office of Inspector General made unannounced visits to four facilities in California, Louisiana, Colorado and New Jersey between May and November of last year, according to a report published Thursday. The facilities together house about 5,000 detainees.

In an Adelanto, California detention facility, inspectors found nooses in detainee cells, the segregation of certain detainees in an overly restrictive way and inadequate medical care, the report said.

It comes as the Trump administration is managing a worsening problem at the U.S.-Mexico border, with a dramatic increase in the number of Central American migrants. While most are families who cannot be easily returned to their home countries, the number of single adults is also on the rise. Immigration officials are detaining an increasing number of single adults — about 52,000 now — but are funded for only 45,000. The administration has asked for $4.5 billion more for additional bed space.

Last month, Border Patrol agents made 132,887 apprehensions, topping 100,000 for the first time since April 2007 and setting a record with 84,542 adults and children apprehended. An additional 11,507 were children traveling alone, and 36,838 were single adults.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said they are working to ensure all facilities comply with standards. They say they have already trained food service staff on food safety and they extensively cleaned and renovated housing units. They included photos of cleaned showers and bathrooms in their response.

“The safety, rights and health of detainees in ICE’s care are paramount,” the agency’s chief financial officer, Stephen Roncone, wrote to the inspector general’s office. “ICE has made substantial progress to address the findings and recommendation in the OIG’s draft report.”

Holding single adults is an administration priority; officials say detention is one of the only consequences that can be applied to those crossing illegally. But two facilities took detainees out of the general population to special units as punishment before they should have, three wrongly put detainees in restraints and one facility strip-searched detainees who were to be segregated, the watchdog found.

In a facility in Essex, New Jersey, inspectors found detainees lacked toiletries and were given uniforms that didn’t fit.

At a facility in Aurora, Colorado, detainees were not allowed visits from friends or families, even though there was room for them to do so. Managers said they were concerned about drugs or weapons being smuggled, but they acknowledged that visits should be considered.

Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., said the report confirmed what she had suspected about treatment there.

“We need to take a hard look at ICE’s use of these private prisons and, at the very least, make clear to the agency that outsourcing its responsibility to physically hold these detainees does not absolve it of its obligation to properly care for them,” she wrote.

There have been reports of poor medical care and dangerous conditions at ICE facilities for years."
"DOJ rejects call for census docs, teeing up contempt vote",https://thehill.com,[],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/homenews/house/447390-doj-rejects-call-for-census-docs-teeing-up-contempt-vote,"The Department of Justice (DOJ) informed Democrats on the House Oversight and Reform Committee that it would not be meeting their request for additional documents regarding the administration's push to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.

In a letter written to committee Chairman Elijah Cummings Elijah Eugene CummingsDOJ rejects call for census docs, teeing up contempt vote DOJ rejects call for census docs, teeing up contempt vote Pelosi privately told Democrats she wants Trump 'in prison': report MORE (D-Md.), Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd alleged the “committee's action is premature,” adding DOJ officials “are disappointed by the committee's mischaracterization of the Department's continued and ongoing efforts to accommodate the committee's oversight interests.”

Boyd argued the documents subpoenaed are protected by attorney-client privilege, adding the agency has worked to accommodate the panel’s requests by providing relevant documents and made senior officials available for transcribed interviews with committee staffers.

The DOJ and Democratic-controlled committee have been at odds over the push for certain documents and the panel’s call for John Gore, a top official in the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, to testify without a department lawyer present — a move the agency said is unprecedented.

Barr instructed Gore not to comply with the committee’s request unless the committee agrees to allow the presence of DOJ counsel.

“Despite the Department's significant and ongoing efforts to accommodate the Committee's requests, your June 3 letter alleges lack of compliance by the Attorney General based on (1) the Committee's dissatisfaction with the Department's ongoing document production; and (2) the Attorney General's instruction that Mr. Gore not appear before the Committee for a third time, for a deposition, unless the Committee allows him to be accompanied by Department counsel.

""Let us address first the Attorney General's instruction concerning Mr. Gore's appearance,” Boyd wrote.

Boyd said DOJ is amenable to working with and providing information to the panel, but argued their call for the information could interfere with the Supreme Court’s ongoing litigation on the matter.

“The Department remains willing to continue working with the Committee to find a resolution that would balance Congress's ‘legitimate need for information that will help it legislate’ and the Department's ‘legitimate, constitutionally recognized need to keep certain information confidential,"" he wrote.

“One challenge, of course, has been the Committee's desire to conduct oversight of the Commerce Department's decision to reinstate the citizenship question on the 2020 Census while the matter is being actively litigated, rather than waiting a short period of time until the matter is resolved. Nonetheless, as discussed, the Department will continue to produce documents to the Committee as appropriate.”

In addition to issuing a subpoena for Gore in April, the Oversight Committee also issued two separate subpoenas: One requesting the agency's communications on the census question with the White House, the Republican National Committee, the Trump campaign and Congressional lawmakers; and another seeking unredacted internal communications and documents on the addition of the question from Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross Wilbur Louis RossDOJ rejects call for census docs, teeing up contempt vote DOJ rejects call for census docs, teeing up contempt vote Judge says he's not ready to rule on new claims about census citizenship question MORE.

The Department of Commerce announced the addition of the question on citizenship status on the next census last year, saying it will help the Department of Justice enforce the Voting Rights Act.

The decision sparked pushback from a number of states, who launched legal challenges to the addition of the question in the courts.

Critics of the decision argue it could deter individuals from responding to the census, which could lead to the population being undercounted. The census is used, in part, to calculate how federal funding is allocated.

In a letter written to Barr on Tuesday, Cummings said he would hold off on scheduling the contempt vote if the subpoenaed information was provided by Thursday.

He also pointed to evidence filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in court last week that alleged previously undisclosed actions by a Republican redistricting strategist in getting the citizenship question added to the 2020 census, raising questions about the motivation of the addition.

The Justice Department adamantly denied the allegations, arguing the ACLU’s evidence is an ""eleventh hour"" attempt to derail the Supreme Court's consideration of the citizenship question.

""This baseless attack on the integrity of the Department and its employees is based on nothing more than fevered speculation and supposed 'new' evidence that, in reality, the plaintiffs have known for months,"" the Department said. ""The study that plaintiffs recovered from the personal belongings of a deceased private citizen played no role in the Department of Justice’s letter recommending reinstatement of a citizenship question to the Census.""

Congressional Democrats Demand State Dept. End ‘Disturbing’ Policy Denying Citizenship to Kids of LGBT Couples,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Scott Bixby'],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.thedailybeast.com/senate-democrats-demand-state-dept-reverse-disturbing-policy-denying-citizenship-to-kids-of-lgbt-couples,"Nearly one hundred members of Congress, including five presidential candidates, have added their names to a pair of letters calling on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to immediately reverse a State Department policy that withholds American citizenship from some children of U.S. citizens who are born abroad.

One letter, led by Sens. Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Kamala Harris of California and signed by 17 other Democratic members of the chamber, calls the policy “a thinly veiled attack on LGBTQ Americans whose children are conceived through the use of egg donors and gestational surrogacy.”

“Your Department’s reinterpretation of immigration law to deny the constitutional right of citizenship to the children of same-sex couples who are born outside the United States is extraordinary and deeply disturbing,” the letter states. The letter’s 19 signatories urge Pompeo to immediately drop the State Department’s appeal of a court ruling striking down the policy, “and make it clear that every U.S. married couple is entitled to the same rights under the U.S. Constitution, no matter whom they love.”

In addition to Merkley and Harris, the letter was signed by Sens. Ed Markey (D-MA), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Tom Udall (D-NM), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Chris Coons (D-DE), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Bob Casey (D-PA), Tim Kaine (D-VA), and Ron Wyden (D-OR).

Another letter, signed by the co-chairs of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus and every gay, lesbian and bisexual member of the House of Representatives, was delivered to Pompeo on Thursday afternoon. In that letter, the 80 signatories called the policy “discriminatory and cruel.”

“Welcoming a new child into a family should be a time of joy and excitement, but instead it is being met by your Department treating these couples differently than their different-sex counterparts,” the second letter, led by Reps. Deb Haaland (D-N.M.), David Cicilline (D-R.I.) and Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.), stated.

The policy in question changes the State Department’s interpretation of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), a 1952 law that codifies eligibility for U.S. birthright citizenship. Under the policy, children born abroad via assisted reproductive technology like gestational surrogacy or sperm donation are considered to have been born “out of wedlock,” even if their parents are legally married U.S. citizens.

“Out of wedlock” births abroad face a bevy of legal and logistical hurdles to gaining birthright American citizenship, and the policy has led to numerous instances of the children of U.S. citizens being effectively turned away at the border.

“They basically take our marriage, and they say ‘It doesn’t mean anything. Your child was born out of wedlock,’” Adiel Kiviti, whose three-month-old daughter was born with the help of an egg donor and a gestational surrogate in Canada, told The Daily Beast last month. “We were there when she was born, she took her first breaths in our arms. Make no mistake: We are her parents—we are her only parents on her only birth certificate.”

“This is a very clear attack on families, on American families,” his husband Roee, who married Adiel in California in 2013, said at the time. “Denying American married couples their rights to pass their citizenship, that is flat-out discrimination, and everyone should be concerned about this.”

Two same-sex couples have sued the State Department over the policy, which they say disproportionately affects LGBT families, who stick out when seeking government documents that recognize the birthright citizenship of children born abroad.

The INA makes no reference to biology in determining birthright citizenship of children born abroad to married U.S. citizens, giving the policy little textual support in law. In February, a federal judge ruled that “the basis for the State Department’s imposition of a biological requirement is its strained interpretation” of existing immigration law, and dismissed attempts to institute a biological testing standard for the children of binational married couples as “unilateral.”

But the State Department has appealed that ruling, and has fought to summarily dismiss a suit brought by another same-sex couple against the policy.

The publication of a story by The Daily Beast on the policy brought renewed national attention to the issue, prompting nearly every Democratic presidential candidate, as well as senior congressional leadership, to call for the policy’s reversal.

“Once again, the Trump administration is demonstrating just how far they are willing to go to undermine our core values and advance their hateful agenda,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a statement last month. “The State Department must uphold our laws, end this cruel and inhumane policy and treat every family with the dignity and respect that they deserve.”

In the letter from Senate Democrats, signatories called the department’s legal defense of the policy part of a larger tapestry of decisions that have hurt LGBT Americans, from its decision to not grant visas to the same-sex partners of some foreign diplomats to what they called the “muted” response to anti-LGBT persecution abroad.

“Every new American parent should focus on celebrating the birth of a child, not be consumed with fear that all members of their family may not be welcomed back home to the United States,” the signatories wrote. “The United States can best advocate for LGBTQ rights around the world by living its values at home, especially during this month of Pride.”

The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter."

Democrats lurching toward potential impeachment and ramping up their probes of President Donald Trump are becoming increasingly worried that the Justice Department will subvert their efforts.

An internal DOJ watchdog report on the origins of the Russia probe is expected to spotlight potential political bias by FBI agents at the heart of the Russia probe. The report, due out as soon as this month and as late as October, could raise pointed questions about the FBI’s decision-making at the time — handing Trump a bludgeon in his long-running campaign to accuse the bureau of mounting a “coup” against him.

Story Continued Below

They fear the report, by DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz, who is respected by lawmakers from both parties, will diminish any momentum Democrats are seeking in their efforts to convince Americans that Trump obstructed the Russia investigation, later taken over by special counsel Robert Mueller.

“Their whole point is to go on a wild goose chase and then to create a chain of implausible connections that show that the special counsel report — and what we’re doing — is somehow fruit of the poisonous tree. It’s absurd,” Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), a member of the Judiciary and Oversight committees, said in an interview.

Members of both parties largely acknowledge that the results of the inspector general’s report are likely to bode poorly for the senior FBI officials who decided to launch the investigation into Trump’s presidential campaign — in turn, giving Trump and his allies much-needed political firepower against House Democrats who are seeking to highlight the evidence laid out in Mueller’s report.

Beginning next week, Democrats are pursuing an aggressive public-relations strategy aimed at illuminating the evidence, as laid out in Mueller’s report, that Trump sought to thwart or otherwise shut down the special counsel’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. That pursuit — part of an effort by Democratic leaders to make the case to the public that Trump should be impeached — could face significant roadblocks if Republicans get their way.

And it’s not just the IG report that could disrupt Democrats’ plans. Trump recently gave Attorney General William Barr broad authority to declassify information about how the Russia probe began — an order that prompted Democrats to warn of selective declassification that wouldn’t tell the full story.

“I don’t think it will throw us off track, but it will certainly give Republicans ammunition to try to divert attention away from the specifics of the Mueller investigation,” said Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.), a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee. “It’s a profound breach of confidence that the legislative branch has in the executive branch, and a profound disruption in the intelligence apparatus worldwide.”

In particular, the inspector general’s report is likely to embolden Trump and give his allies new ammunition to discredit Democrats’ pursuit of Trump’s personal finances and additional evidence that he obstructed justice — probes that Republicans have long derided as politically motivated and an abuse of congressional authority.

“Because Inspector General Horowitz is known for calling balls and strikes, any validity that he offers in his report that substantiates some of the things that conservative members have been saying for some time … will change the narrative overnight,” Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), a top Trump ally, said in an interview.

Trump is likely to latch on to any hint of evidence that would suggest that an anti-Trump bias permeated the upper echelons of the FBI. His allies on Capitol Hill have been parroting those claims of bias, in addition to allegations that senior officials leaked information to the media and inappropriately relied upon salacious and unverified claims about Trump that were outlined in a controversial dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele.

“Just like [Democrats] waited for the Mueller report to come out, they should wait for the IG’s report to come out,” Meadows added. “Because the IG’s report will actually go at the root of improper motivations on the investigation.”

Democrats, wary of Republicans’ narrative becoming dominant, are preemptively trying to dispel those claims.

“If there’s really a ‘deep state’ within DOJ to tank Donald Trump, then they should’ve revealed in 2016 that they had a counterintelligence investigation ongoing with regard to the Trump campaign,” said Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.), who sits on the Intelligence and Oversight committees. “The fact that they reopened the Hillary Clinton investigation on the eve of the election is potent proof that there’s no deep state conspiracy at DOJ against Donald Trump.”

“There’s nothing there. It’s a big nothingburger,” Krishnamoorthi added.

The release of the IG report will mark the second time in two years that Horowitz’s work will have become a flashpoint in Congress’ efforts to get to the bottom of Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. Last year, he issued a report on the FBI’s handling of the 2016 Hillary Clinton probe, concluding that he couldn’t find evidence that political bias affected any decisions in the investigation.

His bottom-line finding heartened Democrats, but Horowitz also revealed he was continuing to probe potential bias in the opening of the FBI’s Russia probe, launched just weeks after the Clinton investigation ended in July 2016. One of the agents involved in both investigations, Peter Strzok, has become a fixture for Republicans, who unearthed thousands of text messages last year in which Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page sharply criticized Trump.

“[W]e did not have confidence that Strzok’s decision to prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on the [Clinton probe] was free from bias,” Horowitz concluded in that report.

Though Horowitz concluded that potential bias was unlikely to have affected the Clinton probe — in part because of multiple layers of decision-making at the FBI — he drew no conclusions on whether Strzok’s personal views infected his actions in the Russia probe, telling lawmakers last year that it was still under review.

Former DHS official on CBP declaring 'full-blown' border emergency: Authorities at point of 'desperation',https://www.foxnews.com,"['David Montanaro', 'David Montanaro Is An Editor With Fox News.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/cbp-declaring-full-blown-border-emergency,"The head of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) declared Wednesday a ""full-blown emergency"" at the southern border, as the number of apprehensions surged last month to levels not seen in more than a decade.

Responding on ""America's Newsroom"" Thursday, former Department of Homeland Security official Theresa Cardinal Brown said it's clear that authorities at the border are in a state of ""desperation.""

Brown said the situation is different from years past because of the number of families and children who are seeking asylum at the border and having to be detained.

OPERATION TARGETING MS-13 GANG IN TEXAS NETS NEARLY 2 DOZEN ARRESTS, OFFICIALS SAY

TRUMP SAYS MEXICO IS AN ‘ABUSER’ OF THE US, AMID TARIFF NEGOTIATIONS

In his comments to reporters, Acting CBP Commissioner John Sanders called the immigration system ""broken,"" explaining that facilities housing migrants near the border are ""well beyond capacity.""

""This ongoing crisis has placed a tremendous strain on our limited resources and operational effectiveness,"" he warned.

Brown told Bill Hemmer that Border Patrol agents and other officials feel like they're not getting enough support and resources from lawmakers in Washington, D.C.

MEXICO OFFICIALS PREPARE TO INTERCEPT ABOUT 1,000 MIGRANTS

""I hear very much the desperation of operators and people whose job it is to deal with the people they encounter at the border effectively and humanely, who feel like they're not able to do their job. ... It is a crisis,"" she said.

Brown said the White House and lawmakers from both parties need to come together and figure out how to deal with the crisis.

She said tensions are high between House Democrats and President Trump in particular, but she pointed back to Bill Clinton negotiating ""significant legislation while he was under impeachment.""

U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported nearly 133,000 arrests in May. The number surpassed 144,000 when counting migrants deemed inadmissible -- more than a 30 percent increase from the prior month and double the influx recorded at the beginning of the year.

The number of apprehensions was the highest monthly total in more than 13 years. In April, authorities recorded 99,304 arrests.

The latest figures could embolden President Trump amid tense negotiations with Mexico over the immigration crisis.

Last week, in an effort to force Mexico to do more to “stop the invasion” of migrants into the U.S., the president vowed to impose a new 5 percent tariff on all Mexican imports. The tariffs, set to go into effect on June 10 absent an agreement, would increase over time, reaching 25 percent by Oct. 1.

""These are the boys of Pointe du Hoc. These are the men who took the cliffs. These are the champions who helped free a continent. These are the heroes who helped end a war,"" Reagan said in a speech on the 40th anniversary.

Reagan’s predecessor, President Jimmy Carter, actually was the first U.S. president to visit the site, in 1978, but his visit did not coincide with the anniversary.

Many presidents since Reagan have continued the tradition of visiting on the anniversary, an act of remembrance for the lives lost that day and to celebrate their contribution to the ultimate victory of the allied forces.

Ten years after Reagan’s visit marking the 40th anniversary, President Bill Clinton also made the pilgrimage.

State Dept. Forces Out Official Who Worked on Plan That Led to Ex-Employer’s Arms Deals,https://www.wsj.com,"['Dion Nissenbaum', 'Alex Leary', 'Dion.Nissenbaum Wsj.Com', 'Alex.Leary Wsj.Com']",,,,https://www.wsj.com/articles/state-dept-forces-out-official-who-worked-on-plan-that-led-to-ex-employers-arms-deals-11559772745,"The State Department has forced out a senior official who played a role in crafting a plan that led to billions of dollars going to the defense firm he formerly represented as a lobbyist, according to current and former U.S. officials.

Charles Faulkner, who previously represented Raytheon Co., took part in an unusual Trump administration move to declare an emergency over tensions with Iran to fast-track $8 billion in arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, circumventing normal congressional review, these people said.

He resigned as a deputy assistant secretary at the State Department in early May after working on efforts leading to the emergency declaration, these people said.

Mr. Faulkner’s role in the process has raised concerns in Congress, where Democratic lawmakers want to know if Mr. Faulkner violated Trump administration ethics rules by taking part in discussions on the declaration, which cleared the way for Raytheon’s $2 billion deal to sell precision-guided missiles to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

“Should he be making decisions about arms sales he was working on before he came to government?” asked a congressional aide.

The House Foreign Affairs Committee plans a hearing on next Wednesday on the State Department decisions, according to the panel, and Mr. Faulkner’s role is expected to be a focus of the questioning.

Mr. Faulkner has been a polarizing figure, according to the current and former officials at the State Department, where he served for the last two years as both deputy assistant secretary and acting assistant secretary for legislative affairs, which manages relations with Congress.

Mr. Faulkner declined to comment, referring questions to the State Department, where officials said they couldn't comment on personnel matters.

Amid the rising tensions with Iran, the State Department sought ways to push through the stalled arms sales to the Gulf, according to the current and former U.S. officials.

Related Trump Invokes Emergency Arms Sales Authority to Counter Iran (May 24)

Under a new U.S. law, Secretary of State Pompeo had to order a suspension of some American military support to the Saudi-led coalition unless he assured Congress in writing that the Gulf nation was doing enough to minimize civilian casualties in Yemen.

At the time, Sen. Bob Menendez (D., N.J.) had placed a legislative freeze on Raytheon’s $2 billion proposal to sell 120,000 precision guided missiles to the two Gulf allies in the midst of concerns about their use of American weapons in Yemen.

In last year’s debate, Mr. Faulkner and the legislative affairs team were the only ones to urge Mr. Pompeo to certify that Saudi Arabia was doing enough to satisfy U.S. concerns, according to people familiar with the decision.

Mr. Faulkner and the legislative affairs unit said a failure to do so would jeopardize pending arms sales to the Gulf, which included the stalled Raytheon deals, these people said.

At the time, Mr. Pompeo overruled most others on his team and sided with Mr. Faulkner and the legislative team, these people said, and issued the emergency declaration certifying that Saudi Arabia satisfied U.S. concerns about civilian casualties in the conflict.

Since then, members of Congress have expressed increasing alarm about America’s support for Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen.

More than 10,000 civilians have been killed by the Saudi-led coalition, according to the U.N., and Congress recently voted to cut off all American support to the Gulf countries amid concerns that they weren’t doing enough to minimize civilian casualties in airstrikes using U.S.-manufactured missiles. Mr. Trump vetoed the measure.

Saudi Arabia’s standing in Washington has also been hit by the death of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi dissident and Washington Post writer killed last year by a Saudi hit team at the country’s consulate in Istanbul.

Mr. Trump has been a steadfast advocate of arms sales to allies in the Middle East. When he defended his close ties with Saudi Arabia after Mr. Khashoggi’s killing, he cited arms sales as a major reason.

Newsletter Sign-up

In a statement in November, he wrote, referring to the military needs of Gulf allies: “$110 billion will be spent on the purchase of military equipment from Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and many other great U.S. defense contractors. If we foolishly cancel these contracts, Russia and China would be enormous beneficiaries – and very happy to acquire all of this newfound business.”

U.S. lawmakers question Mr. Faulkner’s work on the arms sales and want to know if he violated government ethics rules by working on a decision that directly affects Raytheon.

Mr. Faulkner took part in more recent discussions over whether the department should use the emergency provisions of the arms export control laws to fast-track arms sales to Middle East allies, according to the current and former U.S. officials.

He already was preparing to leave the State Department when the discussions over the arms sales arose, the officials said. But his work on the issue contributed to his departure on May 10, the officials said.

The Trump administration required political appointees like Mr. Faulkner to sign ethics pledges that bar former lobbyists from working on issues “directly or substantially related” to former clients for two years while serving in government.

The administration has granted some limited waivers to the pledge, but Mr. Faulkner’s name does not appear on an administration waiver list.

On Wednesday, a bipartisan group of lawmakers, including Mr. Menendez, announced plans to try and halt the arms sales. The 22 senators said they would work to convince Congress to reject the deals if Mr. Pompeo doesn’t withdraw his decision, potentially setting up a new showdown with the White House.

“We have an obligation to ensure the adequate guardrails are in place and that weapons transfers to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates do not exacerbate the [Yemen] conflict,” said Sen. Todd Young, (R., Ind.). “Iran remains the world’s leading state sponsor of terror, but the current threats that have been briefed to members of Congress do not justify taking this dramatic step.”

Mr. Menendez, in a statement, said: “We will not stand idly by and allow the president or the secretary of State to further erode congressional review and oversight of arm sales.”

NYT reporter: Sources say Christopher Steele worried DOJ inspector general will 'throw him under the bus',https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/nyt-reporter-sources-say-christopher-steele-worried-doj-inspector-general-will-throw-him-under-the-bus,"Trump dossier author Christopher Steele is seemingly deeply worried about the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse investigation being carried out by the Justice Department inspector general.

Matthew Rosenberg, a correspondent for the New York Times and CNN national security analyst, said he has spoken with people in Steele's orbit who confirmed the British ex-spy is willing to meet with “investigators close to the inspector general investigation."" But Steele is also “incredibly concerned and obsessed that this investigation is going to throw him under the bus,"" Rosenberg said Tuesday on CNN.

This week a report from the Times in the United Kingdom said Steele is willing to meet with U.S. officials, but only to discuss his work for the FBI as a confidential source, and wants the United States to get permission from the U.K. government first. The report came out as President Trump was in the country for a state visit.

Quoting sources close to Steele, Rosenberg framed Steele’s thinking as, ""‘Look, I was working on this dossier other people were paying for — that the Democrats were paying for. I saw things that seemed frightening to me and alarming. And I went to old contacts at the FBI to tell them. I wasn’t a paid source in this case.’ That’s his view of it.”

Steele’s dossier, which was packed with unverified claims about President Trump's ties to Russia, formed a key part of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications that were used to justify surveillance warrants against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. Steele was working for Fusion GPS, which received funding through the Perkins Coie law firm from the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee. Steele's Democratic benefactors were not revealed to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.

Rosenberg said Steele does not think he should be blamed for any actions of the FBI or DOJ and “he was simply helping them out and what they did with it, whether they misused it in a FISA or whatever they did, he had nothing to do with that.”

Rosenberg agreed with this assessment, saying Steele wasn’t part of the FISA process, but was “simply a source of information.”

Steele worked to provide information from his dossier to over a dozen journalists and media organizations. Steele also used various government contacts, such as top DOJ official Bruce Ohr, State Department official Kathleen Kavalec, and others, in his efforts to get the dossier into the hands of U.S. officials and have it taken seriously.

“[Steele] is acutely concerned that he’s going to be thrown under the bus here,” Rosenberg noted.

Earlier this year Attorney General William Barr said he expected inspector general Michael Horowitz’s investigation to be wrapped up by the end of May or June. Fox News host Sean Hannity said this week that sources were telling him Barr may already have a copy of the inspector general's report on the FISA abuse investigation, so if Horowitz does soon speak with Steele it is unclear what that will mean for the inquiry that was thought to be winding down if not complete.

Barr also is taking a broader look into the origins of the Russia investigation and picked U.S. Attorney John Durham to lead the review."
DHS officials tell senators migrants are 'renting babies' to cross the border,https://www.politico.com,['Marianne Levine'],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/06/dhs-migrants-renting-babies-border-1356307,"A U.S. Customs and Border Protection vehicle sits near the border wall with Mexico in Calexico, Calif. | Jacquelyn Martin/AP Photo Immigration DHS officials tell senators migrants are 'renting babies' to cross the border

Department of Homeland Security officials told senators at a lunch Wednesday that migrants are “renting babies” to speed their trip across the border, according to Sen. Chuck Grassley.

“I can't believe that this actually happened, that the people down there in Central America or Mexico are renting babies to get across the border and then sending the babies back and renting them again to come back across the border,” he Iowa Republican said Thursday.

Grassley said DHS officials made the claim at the GOP’s weekly Steering Committee lunch. He said he did not request additional evidence but expressed alarm if it is true.

“I hope you guys will help advertise that, assuming that the information I heard yesterday was accurate, because that is a humanitarian crisis that we have to be concerned about,” Grassley said.

DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

This not the first time DHS officials have claimed children are being used to make border crossings, though the agency has presented little evidence of fraudulent cases.

Earlier this year, then-DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said the agency uncovered “‘recycling rings’ where innocent young people are used multiple times to help aliens gain illegal entry.”

DHS has recently begun an initiative to look into “fake families” as a way to discourage child trafficking.

Under the pilot program, federal immigration officials have requested DNA samples to help confirm parent-child relationships of migrants caught at the border.

Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Mark Morgan told reporters Tuesday that 206 fraudulent cases had been identified from mid-April through the end of May. However, he did not say how many of those cases involved children traveling with another relative who was not a biological parent or step-father or step-mother.

Grassley’s comments come amid Republican senators' growing frustration that Mexico has not done more to stem crossings at the border.

“Every carrot I know has been exhausted in terms of getting the Mexican government to be more cooperative on a sustained basis,” Sen. Marco Rubio said. “A lot of what’s driving this migration is the reality that they’re going to be assisted on that path toward the United States.”

"The President’s ‘Emergency’ Tariffs on Mexican Goods, Explained",https://www.nytimes.com,['Charlie Savage'],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/06/us/mexico-tariffs.html,"But the law does not mention tariffs, and no previous president has used it to impose them, according to the Congressional Research Service. The law has been used to impose sanctions on foreign adversaries and wrongdoers — blocking their property and prohibiting transactions with them — for things like terrorism, human rights abuses, malicious hacking, narcotics trafficking, and the proliferation weapons of mass destruction.

What can Congress do about it?

Under the National Emergencies Act of 1976, Congress can legally terminate an “emergency” that a president says exists — and turn off the special powers the president has activated — by enacting a resolution to do so. Senate Republicans apparently threatened to join Democrats in doing just that after a lunch this week in which they were briefed by administration lawyers about the tariffs proposal.

“I will yield to nobody in passion and seriousness and commitment for securing the border,” Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, told reporters afterward. “But there’s no reason for Texas farmers and ranchers and manufacturers and small businesses to pay the price of massive new taxes” — a burden he estimated would be about $30 billion in his state alone.

But Mr. Trump predicted Republican lawmakers who are openly angry at his plans would back down, saying it would be “foolish” for them to try to block him. And because he can veto such a resolution, at least two-thirds of the lawmakers in each chamber must be willing to vote to override his veto for such a resolution to prevail, meaning many Republicans would have to take the political risk of publicly breaking ranks with Mr. Trump.

What other emergency actions has Trump taken or threatened?

In February, after a standoff with House Democrats over funding for his border wall caused a record-breaking government shutdown, Mr. Trump declared that illegal migration and drug smuggling along the southern border had created a “national emergency” there, enabling him to redirect billions of dollars in Pentagon funds, which Congress had appropriated for other purposes, to border barriers.

That move is currently tied up in court. But Congress separately tried to stop it by passing a resolution to terminate his emergency declaration, with about a dozen Republican lawmakers in each chamber joining Democrats to approve it. Mr. Trump vetoed the resolution, and with most Republicans still sticking with him, an override effort failed to reach the two-thirds threshold to pass the House.

The Trump administration also declared an emergency last month to permit it to circumvent Congress and sell about $7 billion in arms to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan that had been stopped by lawmakers last year, invoking a provision of the Arms Export Control Act of 1976 for national-security exigencies. A bipartisan group of senators announced this week that they would push a set of resolutions to block that move, but their fate was unclear."

Former FBI lawyer James Baker cooperating with DOJ inspector general's FISA abuse investigation,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/former-fbi-lawyer-james-baker-cooperating-with-doj-inspector-generals-fisa-abuse-investigation,"The Justice Department watchdog's investigation into Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse might not be winding down yet.

Former top FBI lawyer James Baker said this week he is cooperating with the Justice Department inspector general's investigation.

""I have had a longstanding relationship with the inspector general's office, because I firmly believe in the appropriateness and the need for effective oversight of the FBI,"" Baker said in a CNN interview.

Baker's admission is another sign that despite what Attorney General William Barr said earlier this year, Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigation may not be completed by early June.

A focus of Horowitz's investigation is the FBI's use of an unverified dossier on President Trump's ties to Russia, written by British ex-spy Christopher Steele, to obtain warrants to surveil onetime Trump campaign official Carter Page.

Although Fox News host Sean Hannity said this week that sources were telling him Barr may already have a copy of the inspector general's report on the FISA abuse investigation, a British newspaper reported Horowitz may soon be interviewing Steele, casting into further uncertainty the status of the inquiry.

Baker took a lead role in reviewing those FISA applications before submitting them to the FISA court. He has said he took the information ""seriously"" but ""not necessarily literally,"" and also that he is ""nervous"" about Horowitz.

Baker told CNN he is also open to helping Attorney General William Barr and U.S. Attorney John Durham with their review of the origins of the Russia investigation. He stressed that it was a ""small group"" who led the FBI's counterintelligence inquiry into Trump's campaign, namely former FBI Director James Comey and former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.

Baker was appointed FBI general counsel in January 2014 and reassigned by FBI Director Christopher Wray in December 2017. Last year, it was reported that Baker was resigning, and since has written for the Lawfare blog and joined the conservative think tank R Street Institute.

He is also under criminal investigation for alleged unauthorized leaks to the media during his time at the bureau."

"DOJ reveals Dems acknowledged Barr subpoena was 'overbroad'; Nadler fires back, offers to meet 'without conditions'",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-fires-back-after-house-dems-announce-barr-contempt-vote-dubs-subpoena-unworkably-overbroad,"Hours after the Department of Justice (DOJ) slammed House Democrats for planning a contempt vote against Attorney General Bill Barr -- and charged that Democrats had privately admitted their subpoena requests were ""overbroad"" -- House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler announced late Tuesday that he is open to negotiating with the DOJ ""without conditions.""

The remarkable turn of events reopened the possibility that Barr's contempt vote may be postponed or canceled, if both sides return to the negotiating table. Nadler, however, pointedly refused to cancel the planned contempt vote prior to beginning any new negotiations, as the DOJ had demanded.

At the same time, Nadler criticized what he called DOJ ""brinksmanship,"" and blamed the Justice Department for purportedly cutting off negotiations on May 7.

The brouhaha began Tuesday morning with a DOJ letter, written by Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd, that blasted House Democrats and Nadler, D-N.Y., for announcing they would vote next week on whether to hold Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn in contempt.

CONSTITUTIONAL LAW SCHOLAR: CONGRESS HEADING INTO 'WORLD OF HURT' WITH BARR CONTEMPT VOTE

In its letter to Nadler, the DOJ publicly revealed that Democrats had acknowledged in a May 24 letter they were open to ""further negotiations"" regarding concerns that their subpoena demands were ""unworkably overbroad."" Nevertheless, Democrats announced just days later their plans to hold Barr in contempt for allegedly failing to comply with those demands.

The DOJ said it was ""prepared to resume negotiations with the committee regarding accommodation of its narrowed Subpoena"" -- as long as Democrats removed the ""threat of an imminent vote by the House of Representatives to hold the attorney general in contempt.""

""The department was disappointed by the committee's abrupt termination of ongoing negotiations aimed at reaching a reasonable accommodation that respects both sides' legitimate interests regarding the materials sought,"" Boyd wrote to Nadler. ""Further, the department is disappointed by news reports indicating that Democratic leaders have scheduled a contempt vote in the House of Representatives for June 11, 2019.""

In his response late Tuesday, Nadler took issue with the DOJ's characterization of Democrats' May 24 letter, and insisted that Democrats had ""always remained open to continuing negotiations. ... We are here and ready to negotiate as early as tomorrow morning.""

""I ... take exception to your characterization of how our prior accommodation efforts ended,"" Nadler wrote back to Boyd. ""Contrary to the account in your letter, the Committee has always remained open to continuing negotiations. We had an offer on the table late on the evening of May 7 when the Department suddenly declared an end to the accommodation process. My staff was still in their offices after the close of business hours awaiting a counteroffer when the Department broke off negotiations with a letter demanding that the contempt vote—scheduled to begin the next day— be cancelled if we wished to proceed with the accommodations process.""

Nadler continued: ""At any rate, we are ready to proceed without conditions—as shown by the initiative we took with our detailed May 24 offer. I should add that, contrary to your argument that the Committee’s continuing accommodation efforts somehow suggest that our prior requests were overbroad, our offer to compromise was intended to respond to your prior objections by seeking a middle ground. We urge the Department to do the same.""

The DOJ's letter, meanwhile, had called on the House Judiciary Committee to ""moot"" its May 8 vote to hold Barr in contempt, which the DOJ called ""premature and unnecessary."" That vote came after congressional Democrats subpoenaed Mueller's full and unredacted report on his probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 elections.

WHY DID MUELLER EDIT TRANSCRIPT OF VOICEMAIL WITH FLYNN LAWYER TO ELIMINATE KEY DISCLAIMERS?

Republicans have countered that federal law protecting secretive grand-jury information would prevent Barr from turning over the entirety of the report. The DOJ has offered Democrats the opportunity to review the report, minus those grand jury-related redactions, in a secure setting -- but those offers have been rebuffed. (In a rare public statement last week, Mueller specifically remarked, ""I certainly do not question the attorney general's good faith"" in deciding to make the report ""largely public."")

""It would hardly make sense for the full House of Representatives to act upon the committee's prior recommendation to hold the attorney general in contempt for not complying with a subpoena that even the committee now appears to acknowledge was overbroad in seeking immediate disclosure of the entirety of the special counsel's investigative files,” Boyd wrote.

That was a conspicuous reference to the previously unreported May 24 letter to the DOJ, in which the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee wrote to privately emphasize ""the Committee's willingness to engage in further negotiations to resolve this dispute"" -- only to resort to public political posturing, the DOJ charged.

The Democrat-led committee also offered to ""identify specific materials that if produced would be deemed to satisfy the subpoena"" in an effort to make the subpoena more workable, according to the DOJ, which quoted the Committee's letter verbatim.

""In your May 24, 2019, letter, the committee appears to recognize that the subpoena is unworkably overbroad and offers -- for the first time -- to narrow the subpoena's scope to cover a much more limited set of documents,"" the DOJ wrote. ""The department believes that the committee's new offer reflects a more reasonable request and could mitigate some of the legal barriers to disclosure that we have discussed.""

ANALYSIS: BARR DETERMINED TO FIND TRUTH BEHIND ORIGINS OF RUSSIA PROBE -- AND DEMS ARE WORRIED

The letter continued: ""The committee held its contempt vote only 19 days after issuing the subpoena. Traditionally, congressional committees have only proceeded with contempt votes after lengthy periods of negotiations have failed to reach an accommodation. For example, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee negotiated with the department over the Operation Fast and Furious subpoena for months, and only voted to cite Attorney General [Eric] Holder for contempt 252 days after issuing its subpoena.""

Since 1975, according to the DOJ, ""committees and subcommittees have averaged 103 days between issuing a subpoena to an executive branch official and holding a contempt vote. By any measure, the committee rushed its decision and bears responsibility for the termination of the accommodation process.”

But in his letter, Nadler took issues with those characterizations.

""We cannot agree that the House’s sense of urgency here is 'premature and unnecessary,'"" Nadler wrote. ""It has been over 100 days since we first initiated the accommodations process on February 22, 2019. The pace with which we are proceeding is consistent with the exceptional urgency of this matter: an attack on our elections that was welcomed by our President and benefitted his campaign, followed by acts of obstruction by the President designed to interfere with the investigation of that attack. All of this misconduct was documented by the Special Counsel in the documents we now seek.""

In a statement, House Judiciary Committee ranking member Doug Collins, R-Ga., highlighted the DOJ's revelation that Nadler apparently signaled a willingness to work with the DOJ.

“After racing to hold Attorney General Barr in contempt, Chairman Nadler finally seems ready to join the Justice Department at the negotiating table,"" Collins said. ""When Judiciary Democrats wield subpoena power like a sword instead of a plow, their investigations bear little fruit. The House Intelligence Committee has shown us that working with the Justice Department in good faith yields documents. Abusing subpoena and contempt authority, however, has left the Judiciary Committee with little to show for its obsessively unreasonable demands.""

As for McGahn, the White House has instructed its former top lawyer not to testify, saying he is legally immune from being compelled to testify about privileged discussions occurring in the course of his official duties. Democrats have responded that McGahn waived that privilege by agreeing to speak to Mueller.

Trump did not assert executive privilege to shield any aspect of the Mueller report itself, and has derided Democrats' efforts as politically motivated attempts to keep what he's called the ""Russia collusion hoax"" alive -- and to distract from or derail -- Barr's own ongoing probes into Justice Department and FBI misconduct.

News of the planned contempt vote came days after Barr said he has not received answers from the intelligence community that were ""at all satisfactory"" in the early stages of his review into the origins of the Russia investigation. Last month, Barr appointed the U.S. attorney from Connecticut, John Durham, to lead the investigation, which is to focus on the use of FBI informants and the alleged improper issuance of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants to monitor a variety of individuals, including former Trump aide Carter Page.

A Barr contempt vote would be historic, but not unprecedented. In 2012, the GOP-controlled House's vote to hold the attorney general at that time, Holder, in contempt for failing to comply with investigations into the Obama administration's failed gun-running sting operation, ""Fast and Furious."" Holder became the first-ever sitting Cabinet member to be held in contempt of Congress in that manner.

The resolution scheduled for a June 11 floor vote would allow the Judiciary Committee to pursue civil action to seek enforcement of its subpoenas in federal court.

Such an approach would rule out so-called ""inherent contempt,"" a process in which Congress technically can enforce contempt citations on its own -- whether by arrest or fine. In May, Barr reportedly joked about that possibility with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, asking, ""Did you bring your handcuffs?""

TSA allowing illegal migrants to fly without proper documents,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/tsa-allowing-illegal-migrants-to-fly-without-proper-documents,"EL PASO, Texas — The federal agency tasked with overseeing security at transportation hubs has been violating its own policy by allowing migrants who have been released from federal custody onto flights despite not having required documents, according to several Department of Homeland Security officials.

For the past six months, the Transportation Security Administration has allowed migrants released from the custody of other Homeland Security agencies to board flights to other parts of the country despite the passengers lacking any of the 15 documents it states are the only acceptable forms of identification.

Since early December, the agency has avoided temporarily changing federal policy and also not introduced a permanent solution to address this new phenomenon, despite no indication border apprehensions and mass releases are slowing down any time soon.

Since January, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has released from custody more than 200,000 migrants who arrived at the border as part of a family. The releases are mandatory under a 2015 court ruling that bars ICE from holding families more than 20 days.

ICE often drops people off at bus stations, where nongovernmental organizations that have been alerted to the drop-offs send volunteers to help migrants make travel arrangements to join family members in other cities. The agency then wipes its hands clean following the releases. ICE would not comment on the legal precedent for undocumented immigrants boarding flights in the U.S.

So instead, those looking to depart the border via regional airports become TSA’s burden. If TSA chose to turn away people at airports it would apply more pressure to overwhelmed bus companies like Greyhound and local motels in border towns, complicating an already dire situation for localities struggling to care for this demographic.

TSA was unaware initially which documents its security officers required for migrants to board flights.

Its website states passengers over the age of 18 who are boarding domestic or international flights out of the U.S. “must show valid identification at the airport checkpoint in order to travel.”

Those 15 acceptable forms of ID include the USCIS worker’s document, as well as a driver's licenses or state ID; U.S. passport or passport card; a DHS-trusted traveler cards; a Defense ID card; permanent resident card; a border crossing card; a DHS-designated enhanced driver's license; a federally recognized, tribal-issued photo ID; an HSPD-12 PIV card; a foreign government-issued passport; a Canadian provincial driver's license or Indian and Northern Affairs Canada card; a transportation worker identification credential; a U.S. Merchant Mariner Credential; and a USCIS Employment Authorization Card (I-766).

A TSA spokesperson initially told the Washington Examiner migrants were allowed to board flights if they could present the document they are given when they apply for asylum. The Notice To Appear, known by DHS as Form I-862, is a paper that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services will give to a person who has passed a credible fear screening and will have his or her asylum case decided by a federal judge as many as five years down the road.

TSA said the court order served as the individual’s identification because that person had already gone through a background check while in custody of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, ICE, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

However, a USCIS official said TSA’s knowledge of protocol was wrong and that the latter agency would not provide any type of travel authorization document to a person who has passed a credible fear screening. The official said the NTA has one purpose and that was to tell recipients when to show up for court.

With the pushback from USCIS, TSA said another possible document that might be used would be the USCIS employment card.

However, asylum seekers who have been released from custody cannot attain that paper until 180 days after a credible fear claim has been approved.

In its initial statement to the Washington Examiner on its own policy violation, the agency said “TSA accepts identification documentation issued by other government agencies, which is validated through the issuing agency. All passengers are then subject to appropriate screening measures.”

TSA then referred the Washington Examiner to a webpage, which still states, “You will not be allowed to enter the security checkpoint if your identity cannot be confirmed, you chose to not provide proper identification or you decline to cooperate with the identity verification process.”

TSA issued an additional statement after publication.

“All travelers are required to provide proper documentation prior to flying. CBP, ICE and TSA have been working together for years, ensuring that those who are leaving detention facilities are provided with the proper documentation, or given additional information about proper documentation at that time,"" a TSA spokesperson said in an email. ""TSA has always had protocols in place for those that are unable to produce documentation and need to travel. However, we expect the vast majority of travelers to appear with one of the documents listed on our website."""

Interior has 5 versions of the secretary's schedule -- but they don't always match,https://www.cnn.com,['Ellie Kaufman'],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/politics/david-bernhardt-conflicting-calendars-interior/index.html,"Washington (CNN) During the early days of the Trump administration, lawmakers and government watchdogs complained agencies weren't turning over Cabinet secretaries' schedules as has been practice. Now, one department has presented those groups with the opposite problem, creating new questions about a lack of consistency and transparency.

The Interior Department has released five different versions of Secretary David Bernhardt's schedule for the first five months of 2019.

The department released Google calendar entries, two versions of daily cards -- which are synopses of the secretary's calendar given to him as a reminder of upcoming events, according to Interior -- briefing book pages and secretary's schedules, which are released on the same section of the Interior website as press releases.

But many of these sources give conflicting information when compared side by side on any given day.

With none of the five sources apparently being the definitive record, it raises questions about what the secretary is actually using to schedule his days and why the public doesn't have access to it.

Conflicting schedules

Take January 10 of this year.

At 9:30 a.m., Bernhardt had a meeting titled ""deputy secretary lapse working group."" Or did he? That information comes from his Google calendar entry, a schedule page and the daily cards for that day. So, it seems clear.

But the briefing book entry for the day says Bernhardt attended a staff meeting at that time. Is that the same meeting or a different one?

Then, according to the briefing book, he had two vaguely described entries -- another staff meeting at 11 a.m. and an ""external lunch off the record"" at noon.

So, what do the Google calendar, daily cards and secretary's schedule page have at that time? No mention of an 11 a.m. meeting, but an additional 11:45 a.m. meeting with Matt Pottinger and Eric Johnson (NSC) and no mention of a 12 p.m. lunch but a 12:30 p.m. meeting with Brian Jack (OPA), according to the Google calendar and daily cards. NSC stands for the National Security Council and OPA stands for Office of Political Affairs, an office in the White House. The department schedule page seems to confirm that information in a more opaque way, listing an 11:45 a.m. meeting with NSC and a 12:30 p.m. meeting with OPA.

Depending on which calendar you pick, at 2 p.m., Bernhardt either had a meeting with ""Bremberg & Leggit (DPC)"" according to the Google calendar, daily cards and secretary's schedule page, or he had an ""external call - TRCP,"" according to the briefing book. TRCP stands for Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership. A spokesperson for the group confirmed that a member of their organization had a phone call with Bernhardt on that day and time.

At 4:15 p.m., Bernhardt was either in a staff meeting, according to his Google calendar and secretary's schedule page, or he was in an ""AS/WS Operations Meeting,"" according to two versions of the daily cards for that day.

Maybe those are the same, since an operations meeting would presumably be with staff. And that's just one day.

""Like most (if not all) of us, the Secretary of the Interior has a daily schedule that is subject to constant change,"" Interior Department spokeswoman Molly Block said.

""Appointments that were expected get canceled, unexpected appointments arise and plans get interrupted by events. The department seeks to ensure that the public has access to the secretary's activities by posting online the various tools used to plan his day by different staff members,"" Block said. ""We are constantly working to ensure that the public has a window into the work the secretary is doing on behalf of the American people.""

Five calendars, no consensus

Not all of the calendars conflict every day. On certain days, all five versions of Bernhardt's schedule line up. In some cases, external meetings that don't include meeting attendees on the daily cards have meeting attendees listed in the secretary's schedule page for the same day. Since mid-March, versions of the secretary's schedule pages have included more names of meeting participants.

But there are too many discrepancies to know what the secretary is doing other days. On February 21, there are at least three discrepancies between the name or subject of the meeting, and another 10 instances of meetings and departure times not listed on all the calendars.

And it's not just the entries themselves that don't line up. The different sources of Bernhardt's scheduling information don't cover all five months of 2019. The department posted Google calendar entries from January to May, two versions of daily cards from January to April 16, briefing book pages from January to March and webpages with the the secretary's schedule page from January to March and April 28 to May 24.

The Center for Western Priorities, a watchdog group that focuses on environmental issues and has been critical of the Trump administration, feels the deluge of contradictory information is not just a matter of sloppy record keeping, but rather a concerted effort to conceal the secretary's activities from the public.

""Despite numerous requests from the public, the press, and Congress, David Bernhardt still refuses to release his actual calendar -- the one that tells him not just where to go, but what his meetings are about,"" Center for Western Priorities Deputy Director Aaron Weiss told CNN. ""It's not just a lack of transparency. It's Bernhardt taking repeated steps to conceal his actions.""

Some of the entries include vague terms like ""external"" and ""internal"" meeting, which Bernhardt has been criticized for in the past, because it gives little insight into who he's meeting with and for what purpose they're meeting.

A CNN review found 88 entries in Bernhardt's daily cards that use the term ""external"" or ""intergovernmental"" to describe a meeting without any further details.

""No one keeps a day planner that only says 'internal briefing' and 'external meeting' with no details. You simply couldn't' function,"" Weiss said.

Calendar controversy continues

Bernhardt, a former fossil fuel lobbyist, previously came under scrutiny from watchdog groups and Democratic members of Congress for not releasing his full schedule publicly. When asked by the House Natural Resources Committee to provide his complete schedule earlier this year, Bernhardt said he had ""not personally maintained a calendar for years,"" and that he had ""no intention of doing so now,"" in a letter to the committee.

A week before his confirmation vote in the Senate, Interior published hundreds of pages of documents containing new details about some meetings that were left off of previous versions of Bernahrdt's calendars.

The House Oversight Committee and the House Natural Resources Committee requested interviews with four Interior staff members to further investigate recordkeeping practices at the department in March.

Before becoming secretary, Bernhardt served as deputy secretary to former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. When Zinke resigned amid a host of ethics scandals at the end of 2018, Bernhardt stepped in to lead the agency in an acting role and was confirmed to the post in April.

When Zinke announced his resignation in December, he referred to the allegations against him as ""false.""

""I love working for the President and am incredibly proud of all the good work we've accomplished together,"" Zinke wrote on Twitter. ""However, after 30 years of public service, I cannot justify spending thousands of dollars defending myself and my family against false allegations."""
Treasury Yields Move Higher,https://www.wsj.com,"['Sam Goldfarb', 'Sam.Goldfarb Wsj.Com']",,,,https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-government-bond-prices-climb-11559833446,"U.S. government-bond prices moved lower Thursday, led by declines in shorter-term debt, one day ahead of a much-anticipated jobs report.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note settled at 2.124%, compared with 2.119% Wednesday. Yields rise when bond prices fall.

Meanwhile, the yield on the two-year Treasury note climbed to 1.881% from 1.839%, shrinking the gap with the 10-year yield, which has been expanding recently.

Even as the 10-year yield has declined in recent sessions, the two-year yield has fallen further. That has made one part of the so-called yield curve steeper as investors grow more confident that the Federal Reserve will soon start cutting interest rates. Changes in monetary policy typically have a more direct impact on short-term Treasury notes than on longer-term bonds.

While there has been a trend toward a steeper yield curve, “you’ve definitely seen market participants willing to take the opposite side of that today,” said Michael Lorizo, a senior trader at Manulife Asset Management.

Thursday’s moves came as investors were met with a large batch of economic data that don’t typically have a major impact on the bond market.

A day after a disappointing private-sector jobs report, new Labor Department data showed that the number of Americans seeking unemployment assistance remains at historically low levels. At the same time, other government data showed the U.S. trade deficit narrowed in April, while improvement in U.S. worker productivity in the first quarter was a little less robust than initially estimated.

Friday will bring more significant data. When the Labor Department releases its employment report for May, economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal anticipate it will show the U.S. economy added 180,000 jobs in the month, compared with 263,000 in April. They also expect average hourly earnings will have increased 0.3% from the previous month, compared with a 0.2% increase in April.

Investors are paying close attention to the labor market because signs of weakness could buttress their expectations that the Fed will cut rates as soon as this month, while continued strong data could undercut that view.

Mirroring other central banks that have at least opened the door to easing monetary policies to combat weaker global growth in recent months, the European Central Bank on Thursday left interest rates unchanged, while several officials raised the prospect of rate reductions.

At a news conference, ECB President Mario Draghi said “No” when asked whether the ECB’s next move was more likely to be a rate increase than a cut. That marked a shift from the ECB’s previous efforts to prepare investors for an end to years of stimulus policies.

"Sally Yates, ex-DOJ official fired by Trump, to raise money for Georgia Democrats",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,['Steven Senne Ap'],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/sally-yates-ex-doj-official-fired-by-trump-to-raise-money-for-georgia-democrats,"Former acting Attorney General Sally Yates, a career federal prosecutor who tangled with the Trump administration but has presented herself as apolitical and nonpartisan, is scheduled to attend a Georgia Democratic Party fundraiser on Thursday.



Sally Yates (Steven Senne/AP)

Yates, 58, is slated to attend an ""Official Battleground After Party” fundraiser Thursday night in Atlanta, sponsored by Georgia Democrats. The appearance comes nearly a year and a half since she left her Justice Department position involuntarily, on Jan. 30, 2017. Yates, heading the Justice Department while President Trump's attorney general nominee, Jeff Sessions, awaited confirmation, refused to enforce the new administration's travel ban order.

Yates had been deputy attorney general during the final two years of the Obama administration. She ascended to acting attorney general once President Barack Obama's attorney general, Loretta Lynch, resigned upon Trump's inauguration.

Her 10-day tenure was dominated by her warnings about then-national security adviser Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, whose contacts with foreign government officials including Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak led her to be fear that he may be compromised.

Yates later told a Senate committee she was concerned Flynn might have violated the Logan Act, a late 19th century law prohibiting private citizens from engaging in negotiations with foreign governments.

Yates' concerns became more fleshed out with the May 2019 release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report, which suggested the FBI had been looking into Flynn even before his calls with foreign officials during the Trump transition.

Flynn was not charged with crimes related to collusion, coordination, or conspiracy with the Russian government in 2016 — indeed, no Americans were — but he did eventually plead guilty to lying to the FBI. Flynn allegedly denied to investigators that he’d spoken with Kislyak about sanctions from the U.S. in response to Russia’s election interference, even though the FBI says that a transcript of their talk says otherwise.

Yates was eventually fired on Jan. 30, 2017, not because of her involvement in the Flynn affair, but following her statement that the Justice Department under her leadership would not enforce Trump’s executive order temporarily banning any immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries.

Trump’s executive order was issued on Jan. 27, 2017, and that same day Yates said that the Justice Department would not be enforcing it. “My responsibility is to ensure that the position of the Department of Justice is not only legally defensible, but is informed by our best view of what the law is after consideration of all the facts,” Yates wrote. “At present, I am not convinced that the defense of the Executive Order is consistent with these responsibilities nor am I convinced that the Executive Order is lawful.”

“Consequently, for as long as I am the Acting Attorney General, the Department of Justice will not present arguments in defense of the Executive Order, unless and until I become convinced that it is appropriate to do so,” Yates said at the time.

Trump fired her three days later.

Yates was praised for her decision by a number of Obama holdovers inside the Justice Department at the time, including Andrew Weissman, who emailed her, “I am so proud. And in awe. Thank you so much. All my deepest respects.” Weissman would go on to be Mueller’s right-hand man when the special counsel investigation was launched in May 2017 following the firing of then-FBI Director James Comey.

Yates subsequently further explained her reasons for refusing to enforce Trump’s order, saying, “I came ultimately to the conclusion that our defending this travel ban would require me to send lawyers of the Justice Department to court to say this ban had nothing to do with religion — it was all based on national security, nothing to do with religion.”

Throughout the episode, Yates portrayed herself publicly as a nonpolitical figure. Georgia Democrats courted her to run for governor in 2018 or Senate in 2020, but she declined both times.

Yates, now in private law practice in Atlanta, did not respond to a request for comment by the Washington Examiner."
Ex-Trump aide Hicks agrees to give campaign documents to Congress,https://www.aol.com,"['Aol Staff', 'Thomson Reuters']",06-04-2019,2019,6,https://www.aol.com/article/news/2019/06/04/white-house-tells-ex-aide-hicks-not-to-cooperate-with-congress/23741651/,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former White House Communications Director Hope Hicks, once a close aide to President Donald Trump, has agreed to turn over documents related to his 2016 campaign to congressional investigators, a key lawmaker said on Tuesday.

The agreement marks a step forward for the House Judiciary Committee in its probes of Trump and his inner circle, with Democrats in the U.S. Congress digging into the campaign, Trump's turbulent presidency and his business interests.

Hicks agreed to supply the documents despite a White House directive advising her not to cooperate with the committee.

Hicks posed for Ralph Lauren and appeared on the cover of ""It Girl,"" a spin-off of the best-selling ""Gossip Girl"" book and TV series. Hicks met patriarch Trump and quickly ""earned his trust,"" Ivanka Trump told The New York Times for a June 2016 profile on the spokeswoman. In January 2015, Trump called Hicks into his office on the 26th floor of Trump Tower and told her she was joining his presidential campaign. ""I think it’s 'the year of the outsider.' It helps to have people with outsider perspective,"" Hicks said Trump told her. Hicks didn't have any political experience, but her public-relations roots run deep. Both grandfathers worked in PR, and her father, Paul, was the NFL's executive vice president for communications and public relations. He was also a town selectman from 1987 to 1991. Greenwich proclaimed April 23, 2016, as Paul B. Hicks III Day. Hicks started working on what would become Trump's campaign five months before Trump announced his presidency, after he famously rode a golden escalator down to the lobby of his tower on June 16, 2015. That makes Hicks the campaign staffer who has persisted in Trump's inner circle the longest. She outlasted his first campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, and several senior advisers. People close to her describe Hicks as a friendly, loyal fighter. Trump has called her a ""natural"" and ""outstanding."" While reporters who have worked with Hicks say she's polite, they have expressed frustration that she was often unreachable on the campaign trail, not responding to requests for comment, or denying access to the candidate. She said her mom, Caye, told her to write a book about her experience with Trump, like ""Primary Colors,"" the fictional novel depicting President Bill Clinton's first presidential campaign. ""You don't even know,"" she said she told her mother. During the campaign, Hicks spent most of her days fielding reporters' requests and questions — even reportedly taking dictation from Trump to post his tweets. During the campaign, Hicks stayed in a free apartment in a Trump building, though she'd often go home to her parents' house in Connecticut when she could. These days she's in DC. Trump named her his assistant to the president and director of strategic communications in December. She still flies below the radar, directing the spotlight back on Trump. The then president-elect called her up to the microphone to speak at a ""Thank You"" rally in December. It's been said she can act as a sort of Trump whisperer, understanding his many moods and professionally executing what needs to be done. She still only calls him ""Sir"" or ""Mr. Trump."" ""If the acting thing doesn’t work out, I could really see myself in politics,"" Hicks told Greenwich Magazine when she was 13. ""Who knows."" In June, the White House released salary info for 377 top staffers. Hicks gets paid the maximum amount that any of Trump's aides receive: $179,700. Hicks is making as much as Trump's former chief of staff Reince Priebus, chief strategist Steve Bannon, former press secretary Sean Spicer, senior counselor Kellyanne Conway, policy adviser Stephen Miller, and communications official Omarosa Manigault. Some family members and friends have expressed concern that Hicks is so closely tied to a president whose policies and statements are unpopular with a significant number of Americans, but are confident that she'll come through unscathed. ""There is just no way that a camera or an episode or a documentary could capture what has gone on. There is nothing like it,"" Hicks told Marie Claire in June 2016. ""It is the most unbelievable, awe-inspiring thing."" In August, Trump asked Hicks to be the new interim White House director of communications, a job that Michael Dubke, Sean Spicer, and Anthony Scaramucci held and left in Trump's first six months in office. The White House will announce who will serve in the job permanently ""at the appropriate time."" The 28-year-old Hicks is the youngest communications director in history.

She and former White House lawyer Annie Donaldson were subpoenaed on May 21 by the Democratic-led panel as part of its inquiry into whether Trump obstructed Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and contacts between Trump’s campaign team and Moscow.

The White House instructed Hicks not to turn over documents to the committee related to her time in the administration, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. The panel said White House officials issued similar instructions to Donaldson.

But House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler said Hicks, the Trump campaign's former press secretary, would provide ""some documents"" relating to the campaign.

""I thank her for that show of good faith,"" Nadler said in a statement that also blasted what he called Trump's ""continued obstruction of Congress.""

Nadler said: ""The president has no lawful basis for preventing these witnesses from complying with our request.""

The committee is seeking any material Hicks has on a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York City between campaign officials including the president's son Donald Trump Jr. and son-in-law Jared Kushner and Russians offering to help Trump's candidacy.

The subpoena also seeks documents relating to any payments made to former Trump attorney Michael Cohen, who allegedly provided hush money to two women who claim to have had affairs with Trump including porn star Stormy Daniels.

An attorney for Hicks did not immediately respond to inquiries from Reuters. Donaldson did not respond to a Reuters query seeking comment.

Hicks and Donaldson faced 10 a.m. EDT (1400 GMT) deadlines for turning over documents. The committee has also scheduled separate hearings with the former aides for later this month.

Hicks resigned from her White House job in February 2018.

The committee is also seeking documents from the two former aides on dozens of topics ranging from an FBI investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn to the termination of James Comey as FBI director and the appointment of Mueller.

Acting defense chief to WH: Don't politicize the military"
"Trump honors D-Day vets, discusses Vietnam deferment",https://www.pressherald.com,['Email Writer'],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.pressherald.com/2019/06/05/trump-honors-d-day-vets-discusses-vietnam-deferment/,"PORTSMOUTH, England — President Trump on Wednesday joined world leaders to praise alliances and military service ahead of the anniversary of the D-Day invasion, just hours after offering no regrets when asked about whether he wished he had been able to serve in the Vietnam War.

Trump’s comments came in a wide-ranging interview in which he also dismissed the significance of climate change, defended his choice of words about the American-born Duchess of Sussex and suggested he was looking into new gun regulations banning silencers. Later, while Europe slept, he lashed out at actress and singer Bette Midler and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., via Twitter.

The onslaught of disjointed news and commentary threatened to distract from Trump’s purpose for the visit — to pay tribute to the veterans of the battle that shifted the course of World War II 75 years ago. Ahead of his trip, some worried the unpredictable president would inject politics into the typically solemn ceremony. While Trump did not veer off script during the memorial — expressing reverence for the bravery of veterans — his comments before the event expressed none of that sensitivity concerning service in Vietnam.

In the interview with Piers Morgan that aired Tuesday, Trump was asked if he wished he had served in Vietnam. “Well, I was never a fan of that war, I’ll be honest with you. I thought it was a terrible war. I thought it was very far away,” Trump said. “At that time, nobody had ever heard of the country.”

Trump received a series of deferments to avoid serving in Vietnam, including one attained with a physician’s letter stating that he suffered from bone spurs in his feet.

Trump was then asked whether serving in the military generally was something he would have liked. Trump said he would not have minded at all and talked about how he had beefed up spending on defense as president.

“I would have been honored, but I think I make up for it right now,” Trump said. “I think I’m making up for it rapidly because we’re rebuilding our military at a level it’s never seen before.”

Trump’s first two days in the United Kingdom were all about honoring him, as Queen Elizabeth II and the British government showered him with a grand arrival ceremony, a state dinner and personal tours of Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey and the Churchill War Rooms. The next two days are meant to focus on the 75th anniversary of the D-Day invasion of Normandy, France, and the soldiers who fought and died saving Europe from Nazi Germany.

Trump did his part with a 90-second recitation of some of the prayer that President Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered to a worried nation just getting word of the fighting.

Trump, with images of an American flag and Roosevelt projected behind him, read to the crowd, “Almighty God, our sons, pride of our nation, this day, have set upon a mighty endeavor, a struggle to preserve our republic, our religion and our civilization and to set free a suffering humanity.”

The president sat in a VIP area between Queen Elizabeth II and first lady Melania Trump. Some 300 World War II veterans also attended the seaside ceremony. Trump joined in giving a standing ovation to a group of vets who appeared on stage as the commemoration began.

The queen provided the keynote address in unusually personal terms.

“When I attended the commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the D-Day landings, some thought it might be the last such event. But the wartime generation, my generation, is resilient, and I am delighted to be with you in Portsmouth today,” she said.

After the event, Trump visited with American World War II veterans who were among Allied troops on D-Day. He had lunch and met briefly with German Chancellor Angela Merkel before heading to Ireland for an airport meeting with Prime Minister Leo Varadkar and a stay at his golf course in the village of Doonbeg, his first visit to the country as president.

Trump and Merkel discussed Libya and conditions in West Africa during their roughly 10-minute meeting, said White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.

Trump used his interview with Morgan to dispute any notion that he meant insult when he used the term “nasty” in discussing the American-born Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle. The phrase generated a lot of media coverage in the United Kingdom. Trump worked diligently to explain that he was speaking specifically on her comments about him, not about her.

Trump said: “She was nasty to me. And that’s OK for her to be nasty, it’s not good for me to be nasty to her and I wasn’t.”

He said the controversy did not come up when he spoke with Markle’s husband, Prince Harry, who “couldn’t have been nicer.”

Trump was also asked about whether he would support banning silencers after a gunman in Virginia used two semi-automatic handguns, a silencer and extended ammunition magazines to slaughter 12 people at a municipal building.

Trump said a silencer ban was something “I’m going to seriously look at.” But he also was quick to emphasize his opposition to restricting access to guns. He repeated his claim that “in London, you have stabbings all over” and said he had read a story describing how “your hospital is a sea of blood, all over the floors.” Similar comments in the past have provoked anger from British doctors and legislators.

Trump said he discussed climate change at length with Prince Charles.

“We were going to have a 15-minute chat. And it turned out to be an hour and a half. And he did most of the talking,” Trump said. “He is really into climate change, and I think that’s great.”

Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, didn’t indicate he was moved by the arguments he heard. “I believe that there’s a change in weather and I think it changes both ways,” Trump told Morgan, a former contestant on Trump’s “The Celebrity Apprentice.”

Trump’s after-midnight tweets showed anew that the president has a hard time overlooking criticism, taking on an actress who has been critical of him on Twitter but who also offered an apology when she discovered a quote attributed to Trump had not occurred. Trump called her a “washed up psycho.”

Midler replied: “I want to thank everyone who came to my defense last night during my personal Battle of the Bulge with he who must not be named. Your wit and good nature really lifted my spirits; as a newly washed up psycho, I am very grateful for your thoughts and prayers.”

After catastrophic floodwaters submerged wide stretches of southern Louisiana in 2016, displaced homeowners and officials criticized the federal recovery effort as dangerously slow, leaving thousands of people homeless for months.

Auditors in the Department of Homeland Security inspector general’s office confirmed problems with the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s performance in Louisiana — and in 11 other states hit over five years by hurricanes, mudslides and other disasters.

But the auditors’ boss, John V. Kelly, instead directed them to produce what they called “feel-good reports” that airbrushed most problems and portrayed emergency responders as heroes overcoming vast challenges, according to interviews and a new internal review.

The watchdog concluded that FEMA’s response in Louisiana, where 13 people died in the disaster, was a huge success, a “remarkable,” “resilient and mission focused” effort that “provided hope and a way forward” for flooded communities.

Under pressure from Congress, the inspector general in 2017 retracted and purged from its website the Louisiana flooding report, and then followed the next year by retracting a dozen other audits of FEMA’s initial responses. The office called them “not compliant” with federal auditing standards.

Now the oversight agency, which evaluates the performance of FEMA and the rest of Homeland Security, has turned the spotlight on itself. Last month it released a 14-month internal review of how Kelly, a career government auditor who rose to acting inspector general in late 2017, chose to flatter FEMA’s staff in some reports, instead of hold them accountable.

Kelly’s staff routinely praised FEMA’s initial disaster responses from 2012 to 2017 with “superlative language,” investigators found — and they followed a formula. Each audit found the response “effective and efficient.” Some reports used fawning terms.

They identified challenges FEMA faced. But invariably they praised the agency for overcoming them. Other negative information, if it pointed to systemic problems, was removed from drafts and sometimes placed in separate “spin-off reports,” the internal review found. The audits made no recommendations for improvements.

Investigators determined that Kelly didn’t just direct his staff to remove negative findings. He potentially compromised their objectivity by praising FEMA’s work ethic to the auditors, telling them they would see “FEMA at her best” and instructing supervisors to emphasize what the agency had done right in its disaster response.

The review concluded the office had not met its own standards.

“Our prior approach resulted in unacceptable failures,” Jennifer Costello, the deputy inspector general, wrote to the head of the internal review team on May 21, calling the “retraction of publicly issued reports because they are not reliable . . . not an insignificant matter.”

The reports, Costello wrote, “represent millions of wasted taxpayer dollars and understandably cast doubt on our credibility.” She said the inspector general’s office needs to “hold ourselves to the same standards to which we hold the Department when conducting oversight of its programs and operation.” Kelly recused himself from the review.

Costello noted that the flawed audits represent a tiny fraction of the watchdog’s otherwise hard-hitting oversight of FEMA.

In an interview with The Washington Post, Kelly denied directing his staff to sanitize its initial disaster reports. “There was no motivation to make FEMA look good,” he said.

He sent his staff an apology when the internal review was made public on May 23.

“I take responsibility for failing to set a tone that all of our products need to be fully objective,” Kelly wrote. “While I did not intend to set that tone with respect to the [FEMA] reports, I obviously did.”

Kelly, 64, oversees a staff of 600 auditors and investigators charged with rooting out waste, fraud and abuse in the third-largest federal agency. He plans to retire when the Senate confirms a permanent chief. President Trump has nominated Joseph V. Cuffari, a policy adviser to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) and experienced federal investigator.

The internal review did not find that Kelly “was improperly influenced by a personal or family relationship,” spokeswoman Arlen Morales said in an email. Nor did investigators find any “deliberate effort to benefit FEMA for personal gain,” she said.

Kelly has not faced discipline for coaxing his staff to produce the flawed reports.

“Because Mr. Kelly is the senior-most official in our organization, no one within [the office] has authority to impose corrective action upon him,” Morales said.

Important oversight

Across the federal government, agencies depend on inspectors general to provide them with independent, fact-driven analysis of their performance, conducting audits and investigations to ensure that taxpayers’ money is spent wisely.

Emergency management experts said that oversight, particularly from auditors on the ground as a disaster is unfolding, is crucial to improving the response, especially in ensuring that contracts are properly administered.

“I read a couple of those [retracted reports] and realized they weren’t good enough to help me,” said W. Craig Fugate, FEMA administrator for eight years under President Barack Obama.

“We’re not that good,” Fugate said of how the reports characterized FEMA’s performance. “The whole idea of the IG going out early was to find things we could do to take corrective action then.”

Even with improvements to emergency response in the deeply flawed aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, FEMA’s performance is still closely watched by local communities and Congress, where disaster response in the Trump administration has become particularly politicized.

Congress agreed only this week to send billions of dollars in long-delayed relief to lingering recovery efforts from multiple natural disasters, including Puerto Rico’s 2017 hurricane.

[‘The colony within the colony’: Puerto Rico fumes as FEMA deliberates over remote hospital]

John Roth, who preceded Kelly as inspector general and promoted him to his second-in-command, called the flawed reports an aberration and described Kelly’s oversight of other FEMA operations as “unstinting.”

“This was not a rogue IG gone bad,” Roth said, calling Kelly as “as square and true blue as you could get.” Roth acknowledged, though, that the mistakes underscore a challenge for inspectors general, who want to maintain credibility with the agencies they oversee while they are issuing critical reports.

After Hurricane Isaac, which killed 41 people in Louisiana and caused more than $3 billion in damage in 2012, auditors found several problems and proposed fixes on the ground before Kelly intervened.

Kelly wanted to “downplay all the negatives” because he believed the agency’s “overall” response was “good,” the review found.

So the report cast the problems as “pressing challenges” for FEMA that included a shortage of experienced staff and a slow response from headquarters to requests from field staff. FEMA met the challenges, the since-retracted report said.

Auditors emphasized the good that arose from problems. Slow processing of funding requests was blamed on a byzantine process.

After Hurricane Sandy pummeled New York and New Jersey in 2012, Kelly told the staff in an email to alter their draft audits. Since “FEMA’s initial response was generally good for both disasters at all locations it would be best if all three reports were similar,” Kelly wrote, referring to both Isaac and Sandy.

'Feel-good' reports

The audits became known among the staff as “feel-good” reports.

When tornadoes struck Oklahoma in May and June of 2013, a supervisor who reported to Kelly tamped down the efforts of auditing teams that wanted to be more critical.

“Yes, we will identify some problems, but the point is — how did FEMA overcome them?” the supervisor wrote to the auditing team, copying Kelly.

“These are feel-good reports to tell the public how well FEMA initially responds to disasters,” the supervisor wrote. The reports were not to identify “systemic problems.”

Kelly did not correct or clarify any of the assertions made in the email, the internal review said. “These opportunities allow us to write quick, meaningful reports that actually help FEMA, and FEMA usually loves the reports,” the supervisor wrote.

Months later, when catastrophic flooding devastated wide swaths of Colorado, auditors again tried to include their concerns about FEMA’s shortcomings, but “those efforts were ultimately rebuffed,” investigators found.

The team wrote two spin-off reports following the flooding that found serious problems with the response. Disaster survivors who could not communicate in English or Spanish had problems finding FEMA staff to help them register for disaster aid. And the agency hired only half the workers that it needed for a proper response.

Kelly did not dispute investigators’ conclusions about the retracted reports. He defended his approach, telling them he “thought a report with a single message would be clearer and less likely to get lost or be ignored by FEMA,” the internal review said.

It was the message the inspector general conveyed after the Louisiana flooding in 2016 that caught the attention of House Republicans. As they complained that FEMA was spending too much money on mobile homes that took months to arrive, the team supervisor changed the draft report to add language that discounted their complaints, investigators found.

Instead, the audit characterized FEMA’s response in heroic terms, including “superlative language,” and said members of Congress were misguided in their criticism.

“The IG is telling us ‘everything’s fine,’ when it obviously wasn’t. It just never matched up,” recalled former congressman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), who was chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee. “I wonder how much more pain was inflicted [on disaster victims] by the fact that people weren’t being held accountable in real time.”

The committee had held two hearings on the flooding after Chaffetz’s staff and two congressmen, including Rep. Garret Graves (R-La.), who represents the flooded area, had flown to Baton Rouge to tour the damage.

An elderly man had died in a FEMA trailer with faulty air conditioning. The committee staff kept waiting for the inspector general’s team to release its audit, hoping that professionals would confirm their observations and press FEMA to do better, recalled Mike Howell, a former staffer who worked on the issue.

But when the report came out, lawmakers were shocked — and livid.

“Our jaws just dropped,” Howell recalled. “They said everything is fine. I said, ‘Did you even look at this issue, that issue and the man’s death? All of the unoccupied FEMA trailers sitting on lots? The people still not in their houses who can’t get a straight answer from FEMA?’ They had no answer and we were enraged.”

In a report issued in October 2018 that criticized FEMA’s disaster response, committee Republicans also took the inspector general to task.

A manager interviewed by the committee called the reports “useless” but said the staff “kept producing them because that was what [Deputy Inspector General] John Kelly wanted.”

The internal review has led to changes: a new practice of rotating auditors to “promote the objectivity and independence,” a reduced “reliance on testimonial evidence” and an increased “reliance on source documentation.”

The office is also training auditors to comply with auditing standards and to maintain independence from the people and agencies they are evaluating.

Costello, the deputy inspector general, said in an email, “We have all learned from this experience and are determined not to repeat these mistakes.”

US Energy Dept. Looking For A Few Good Clean Energy Women,https://cleantechnica.com,['Tina Casey'],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://cleantechnica.com/2019/06/06/us-energy-dept-looking-for-a-few-good-clean-energy-women/,"US Energy Dept. Looking For A Few Good Clean Energy Women

June 6th, 2019 by Tina Casey

Just in time for the latest wave of fetal fetishism to sweep across the US, the Department of Energy has embarked on a renewed push to recruit more women into the clean energy field. That’s going to be a little tricky considering the complications that arise for working women when lawmakers insert the cold, probing eye of unscientific public oversight into personal decisions on ubiquitous matters of health care (well, ubiquitous for women of birthing years). Nevertheless, let’s take a look and see what’s going on here.

What is the Clean Energy Education & Empowerment Technology Collaboration Program?

The Department of Energy is already proactive when it comes to recruiting women into the clean energy profession.

But, what do they mean by clean energy? Good question!

One key program that is C3E, the Clean Energy Education and Empowerment Technology Collaboration Program.

C3E comes under the umbrella of the International Energy Agency, and the key word here is clean. With that in mind don’t confuse IEA with IRENA, the International Renewable Energy Agency. IRENA is for renewables. IEA is all of the above.

If IEA is pitching a “clean” energy initiative, that’s going to cover a lot of ground including natural gas, nuclear energy, carbon capture, and energy efficiency.

As the picture comes into sharper focus, consider that the Energy Department first launched C3E during the Obama administration under the leadership of nuclear physicist Steven Chu.

The collaborative effort is now multinational in scope. The Energy Department has a leadership position at C3E, where it shepherds a smallish but interesting mix of participants amongst the fields of female recruiting. So far the members include Australia, Austria, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, Finland, Italy, and Sweden. And the US.

Yes, all 10 of these countries have women in them. That’s interesting, right?

They also represent almost one-third of the 31 members of the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.

That’s even more interesting! NEA concerns itself with issues of uranium supply and waste disposal, to name a few.

In the latest development involving the Energy Department’s support for C3E, a Senior Advisor from the agency’s Office of Nuclear Energy has been tapped for the position of Vice Chair at C3E.

There, fixed it for you. As far as the Energy Department is concerned, nuclear energy is clean energy.

Not All Clean Energy Is All That Clean

Setting aside that little thing about risks and hazards (Fukushima, much?), the nuclear energy field is a fascinating one from a science and technology perspective.

With deep roots in the history of both energy and warfare in the US, the nuclear field is all but guaranteed to maintain a favored position in US energy policy, which translates into job security for those who choose to invest in such a career.

That circles back around to the female recruitment issue. The energy field is one among many sectors competing in the rough-and-tumble race to attract top talent from around the world, which explains the drive for gender diversity as well as diversity in general. If the nuclear industry is going to survive, it’s going to need to attract top female talent.

That’s a tough row to hoe. The burgeoning wind energy and solar energy fields are competing for talent, too, and without the extra baggage of waste disposal and high-impact accidents that burden the nuclear field.

Nevertheless, it’s do or die. Take the US fossil fuel industry, for example. Researchers are beginning to note a collision course between the up-and-coming diversified workforce of tomorrow, and the tsunami of retirements as the existing male-dominated workforce ages out.

In other words, it’s a double whammy for coal, oil and gas: renewables are beating out fossil fuel for a share of the power generation sector, and they’re also nailing down the next generation of innovators, too.

The nuclear energy field could find itself facing a lethal brain drain as well.

If you have any thoughts about that, drop us a note in the comment thread.

Meanwhile, CleanTechnica reached out to IEA for some insights into the Energy Department’s recruitment efforts and they referred us to the Energy Department, so stay tuned for more on that.

State Department suspends funding of anti-Iran Group which targeted journalists and activists,https://www.cnn.com,['Alex Marquardt'],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/politics/us-suspends-funding-anti-iran-group/index.html,"(CNN) The US State Department has suspended funding for an organization whose hardline stance against the Iranian regime saw it targeting American journalists, activists and academics whom they didn't consider tough enough on Tehran, according to a State Department spokesperson.

The Iran Disinformation Project claims it ""exposes and counters the nefarious influence of one of the world's few remaining totalitarian regimes."" It has been funded through the State Department's Global Engagement Center which combats foreign propaganda and disinformation.

But the organization was so aggressive that social media accounts linked to it went after people it perceived to be too soft on Iran, at a time when the Trump administration is exerting what it calls ""maximum pressure,"" ratcheting up military and economic pressure on Iran after pulling out of the landmark nuclear deal known as the JCPOA.

The Guardian was first to report that the State Department had suspended funding.

Jason Rezaian, a Washington Post columnist and CNN contributor, told CNN Wednesday that an account associated with the organization was ""attacking me, other journalists, human rights advocates and others who have taken a more nuanced approach to US Iran relations and are opposed to war and crippling sanctions on that country.""

Rezaian, who is Iranian-American, spent 18 months in prison in Tehran and is a firm and frequent critic of the regime of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. In a column Wednesday, he highlighted the organization's ""slander and libel"" against American citizens.

""For these thought crimes, we are branded by @IranDisinfo and similar social media accounts as Tehran's 'mouthpieces,' 'apologists,' 'collaborators,' and 'lobbyists' in the West,"" he wrote.

Another target was Human Rights Watch's Tara Sepehri Far who researches human rights abuses in Iran. She recently wrote that American sanctions are ""collectively punishing"" ordinary Iranians and limiting their access to medicine.

In an April 25 tweet, the IranDisinfo account called Far a ""supporter of so-called Moderates within the regime"" and accused her of ""working hard to prove [Foreign Minister Javad Zarif's] claims.""

On Friday, Far tweeted: ""Many of us accepted that toxic slandering is part of the cost of being an analyst or doing human rights work in a very polarized climate of the US government's maximum pressure campaign, but now we realize that part of the slandering is actually being funded by US taxpayers.""

The State Department says it suspended the organization's funding on May 31, until it ""takes necessary steps to ensure that any future activity remains within the agreed scope of work.""

""The bulk of the work by @IranDisinfo has been in line with the scope of a project with the Department of State. We have, however, identified recent tweets that fall outside the scope of the project to counter foreign state propaganda or disinformation,"" a State Department spokesperson said.

The Global Engagement Center was set up in April 2016 under President Barack Obama and refocused after the presidential election primarily to combat Russian disinformation campaigns in the wake of their meddling in the campaign. Brett Bruen, who served as director of global engagement under Obama, said it was funded with $80 million.

""The problem was the Trump administration didn't really want to spend it because that meant recognizing that what Russia was doing on information warfare was a real threat,"" Bruen told CNN on Wednesday in an appearance alongside Rezaian.

""Instead what they have chosen to do is to spend that money and threaten American activists, threaten American journalists like Jason who don't agree with the Trump administration's stand on Iran. That's rather alarming and its quite dangerous,"" he added.

CORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect that the Global Engagement Center was refocused to combat Russian disinformation after the 2016 election and that Brett Bruen was Director of Global Engagement under President Obama."
US Commerce Department offers solution for obtaining minerals critical to the military,https://www.defensenews.com,"['Kelsey Reichmann', 'Kelsey Reichmann Is A General Assignment Editorial Fellow Supporting Defense News', 'Fifth Domain', 'Federal Times.

The report was released Tuesday amid a trade war between the United States and China.

“The United States is heavily dependent on critical mineral imports. If China or Russia were to stop exports to the United States and its allies for a prolonged period — similar to China’s rare earths embargo in 2010 — an extended supply disruption could cause significant shocks throughout U.S. and foreign critical mineral supply chains,” the report states.

The report also notes that the U.S. is import-reliant on 31 of the 35 minerals designated as critical by the Department of the Interior. Furthermore, the U.S. completely relies on imports for 14 of these minerals.

The report also says the country’s imports of “critical mineral commodities” exceed 50 percent of its annual consumption. These rare earth minerals are often used in the production of aircraft, computers and GPS systems.

Last year China produced 78 percent of the world’s rare earth minerals, according to researchers at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

“These critical minerals are often overlooked but modern life without them would be impossible,” Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said in a news release. “Through the recommendations detailed in this report, the Federal government will take unprecedented action to ensure that the United States will not be cut off from these vital minerals.”

One solution to this problem is to enhance international trade and cooperation in relation to rare earth minerals, according to the report.

However, the Government Accountability Office in April found that the U.S. is reliant on China for several critical minerals. And China has noted that it could cut off the U.S. from some rare earth minerals should the trade war continue.

The report from the Department of Commerce proposes a continued expansion of rare earth minerals trading with Canada, Australia, the European Union, Japan and South Korea. It notably does not include China.

The report does, however, mention China as an area to which American production companies relocated, and it called for more investment in the National Defense Stockpile program.

The NDS program, which would provide critical materials to support industrial investments to help civilian needs in an emergency, is not financially sustainable, according to the report."
Department of Energy Redefines Nuclear Waste to Make It Easier to Dispose of,https://www.thestranger.com,"['More Articles', 'Katie Herzog']",06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.thestranger.com/slog/2019/06/06/40409900/department-of-energy-redefines-nuclear-waste-to-make-it-easier-to-dispose-of,"Department of Energy Redefines Nuclear Waste to Make It Easier to Dispose of

JEFF T. GREEN/GETTY IMAGES

If you've got a problem with radioactive waste, you could clean it up, a costly and onerous process, or you could just change the definition of it. Guess which one the Trump administration has decided to do?

This week, the Department of Energy announced that it is revising the classification of radioactive waste at Hanford, the decommissioned nuclear bomb-making site in Benton County, Washington. This isn't because Hanford has actually been cleaned up or anything like that. Nope! It's still considered by many to be The Most Toxic Place in America, which is pretty damn impressive considering the toxic dump in the White House.

In a statement Wednesday, the DOE said that by reclassifying waste at Hanford, as well as two sites in South Carolina and Idaho, they will have more flexibility in how some of that waste is disposed of. There are currently 56 million gallons of radioactive waste and other hazardous chemicals stored in underground tanks at Hanford, and all that waste has been considered ""high level,"" meaning that it requires strict standards for disposal. That, however, will change under the DOE's new rule.

Environmentalists and Washington state leaders, however, are not pleased. In a joint statement, Gov. Jay Inslee and Attorney General Bob Ferguson said, ""The Trump Administration is showing disdain and disregard for state authority with these actions. Washington will not be sidelined in our efforts to clean up Hanford and protect the Columbia River and the health and safety of our state and our people.

“By taking this action, the administration seeks to cut out state input and move towards disposal options of their choosing, including those already deemed to be unsafe by their own assessments and in violation of the existing legally binding agreement. We will consider all options to stop this reckless and dangerous action.”

Hanford has been a radioactive thorn in America's side for decades. In a brilliant Vanity Fair article from 2018, journalist Michael Lewis (who also has a fantastic new podcast on the impacts of deregulation that you should all listen to immediately), wrote of the decades-long Hanford cleanup:



The Department of Energy wires 10 percent of its annual budget, or $3 billion a year, into this tiny place and intends to do so until the radioactive mess is cleaned up. And even though what is now called the Tri-Cities area is well populated and amazingly prosperous—yachts on the river, $300 bottles of wine in the bistros—the absolute worst thing that could happen to it is probably not a nuclear accident. The worst thing that could happen is that the federal government loses interest in it and slashes the D.O.E.’s budget—as President Trump has proposed to do. And yet Trump won the county in which Hanford resides by 25 points.

This change, Richland Mayor Bob Thompson, told the Tri-City Herald, could save the DOE $40 billion. The question is, at what cost?"
Does VA have a secret wait list for health care? Key members of Congress want to know.,https://www.houstonchronicle.com,"['Joe Davidson', 'The Washington Post', 'Melanie Hauser', 'Katherine Feser', 'Staff Writer', 'Erin Douglas', 'Bob Levitus']",06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/article/Does-VA-have-a-secret-wait-list-for-health-care-13938065.php,"WASHINGTON - Key members of Congress want the Trump administration to address charges of a ""secret"" Veterans Affairs wait list that has a higher number of patients seeking medical care than information publicly available.

Allegations about significantly different data regarding veterans awaiting treatment on internal and public records were made by Jereme P. Whiteman, VA's national director of clinic practice management, in a Washington Post Federal Insider column published online Monday.

The article reported on a letter he sent to VA Secretary Robert Wilkie last week that said, ""In September last year I discovered a secret VA wait list. I disclosed this wait list within my VHA chain of command. Since that date I have been retaliated against by officials within my chain of command. Furthermore, the agency has taken steps to conceal this wait list from the public.""

The monthly number of veterans awaiting care on the internal list is about three times greater than the numbers on the public list.

A VA spokesman said Whiteman's allegations are false. ""VA's electronic wait list (EWL) has two components - one administrative and one clinical,"" said Curt Cashour, the department's press secretary.

The clinical number is public and shows the number of veterans waiting for medical care. ""The administrative component of the EWL has nothing to do with waits for medical treatment,"" he added, ""and tracks routine actions, such as facility and provider transfer requests.""

Top Democrats on the House and Senate veterans' affairs committees are not satisfied with that response.

In a letter sent Tuesday to Wilkie, Rep. Mark Takano, D-Calif., chairman of the House committee, and Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, the ranking Democrat on the Senate panel, said Cashour's explanation ""is, at best, confusing.""

""We, therefore, ask VA to provide - by the end of this week - a more thorough explanation for the existence of two sets of reports on wait time for veterans' health care. In fulfilling this request, VA should provide the House and Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs with the reports described by the article and the appropriate VA officials should make themselves available for a briefing to the Committees.""

A statement from the office of Rep. Phil Roe of Tennessee, the top Republican on the House panel, said, ""Dr. Roe has asked VA about these allegations and will continue looking into them.""

Rep. Gerald Connolly, D-Va., chairman of the House Oversight and Reform subcommittee on government operations, said the ""allegations of a secret internal wait list for veterans - that exceeds the public wait list by three-fold - are deeply disturbing. . . . Congress must get to the bottom of these claims by verifying the accuracy of these internal VA documents and ensuring transparency and accountability for our nation's veterans and the American people.""

Connolly praised whistleblowers and said they ""must be protected"" against reprisals by managers. In addition to reporting his charges about the dual wait lists with VA's Office of the Medical Inspector and the department's Office of Inspector General, Whiteman has filed retaliation complaints with the VA whistleblower protection office and the Office of Special Counsel, which protects whistleblowers across the government.

Inspector General Michael Missal said his office received Whiteman's information and is considering the next steps for his office.

In one example of retaliation, Whiteman said he led a team that implemented a text messaging system to remind patients of their appointments. It cut the number of missed sessions and saved the department millions of dollars. Although he was the team leader, he was the only member who did not get a performance award for the project.

Whiteman's allegations come five years after a national uproar over phony wait lists rocked the VA. That scandal pushed then-VA Secretary Eric Shinseki from office and led to a series of agency reforms. Robert McDonald, who followed Shinseki in office, apologized to veterans in September 2014 congressional testimony and promised to rebuild trust.

He said the VA increased primary care staffing, developed an automated system for tracking new patients and contacted 266,000 veterans ""to get them off wait lists and into clinics.""

On Tuesday, Cashour said the VA now is ""seeing more patients than ever before, more quickly than before."" According to Cashour:

- VA completed more than 58 million internal appointments in fiscal 2018, 623,000 more than the previous year.

- All VA health care facilities now provide same-day services in primary and mental health.

- VA is posting online wait times for every one of its medical centers across the country, and they are updated weekly.

- Regularly updated access data are available online for all VA medical centers and community-based outpatient clinics.

""Veterans are more satisfied with wait times,"" Cashour said, ""than they have been previously."""
"Homeland Security watchdog whitewashed FEMA disaster audits, including for Louisiana",https://www.nola.com,"['The Washington', 'The Washington Post']",06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.nola.com/environment/2019/06/homeland-security-watchdog-whitewashed-fema-disaster-audits-including-for-louisiana.html,"After catastrophic floodwaters submerged wide stretches of southern Louisiana in 2016, displaced homeowners and officials criticized the federal recovery effort as dangerously slow, leaving thousands of people homeless for months.

Auditors in the Department of Homeland Security inspector general’s office confirmed the concerns with the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s performance in Louisiana - and 11 other states hit over five years by hurricanes, mudslides and other disasters.

Instead, the auditors' boss, John V. Kelly, directed them to produce what they called ""feel good reports"" that airbrushed most problems and portrayed emergency responders as heroes overcoming vast challenges, according to interviews and a new internal review.

Department of Homeland Security Acting Inspector General John V. Kelly

The watchdog concluded that FEMA's response in Louisiana, where 13 people died in the disaster, was a huge success, a ""remarkable,"" ""resilient and mission focused"" effort that ""provided hope and a way forward"" for flooded communities.

Under pressure from Congress, the inspector general in 2017 retracted and purged from its website the Louisiana flooding report, followed the next year with a dozen other audits of FEMA's initial responses. The office called them ""not compliant"" with federal auditing standards.

Now the oversight agency, which evaluates the performance of FEMA and the rest of Homeland Security, has turned the spotlight on itself. Last month it released a 14-month internal review of how Kelly, a career government auditor who rose to acting inspector general in late 2017, chose to flatter FEMA's staff in some reports, instead of hold them accountable.

Kelly's staff routinely praised FEMA's initial disaster responses from 2012 to 2017 with ""superlative language,"" investigators found - and they followed a formula. Each audit found the response ""effective and efficient."" Some reports used fawning terms.

They identified challenges FEMA faced. But invariably they praised the agency for overcoming them. Other negative information, if it pointed to systemic problems, was removed from drafts and sometimes placed in separate ""spin-off reports,"" the internal review found. The audits made no recommendations for improvements.

Investigators determined that Kelly didn't just direct his staff to remove negative findings. He potentially compromised their objectivity by praising FEMA's work ethic to the auditors, telling them they would see ""FEMA at her best"" and instructing supervisors to emphasize what the agency had done right in its disaster response.

The review concluded the office had not met its own standards.

""Our prior approach resulted in unacceptable failures,"" Jennifer Costello, the deputy inspector general, wrote to the head of the internal review team on May 21, calling the ""retraction of publicly issued reports because they are not reliable . . . not an insignificant matter.""

The reports, Costello wrote, ""represent millions of wasted taxpayer dollars and understandably cast doubt on our credibility."" She said the inspector general's office needs to ""hold ourselves to the same standards to which we hold the Department when conducting oversight of its programs and operation."" Kelly recused himself from the review.

Costello noted that the flawed audits represent a tiny fraction of the watchdog's otherwise hard-hitting oversight of FEMA.

In an interview with The Washington Post, Kelly denied directing his staff to sanitize its initial disaster reports. ""There was no motivation to make FEMA look good,"" he said.

He sent his staff an apology when the internal review was made public on May 23.

""I take responsibility for failing to set a tone that all of our products need to be fully objective,"" Kelly wrote. ""While I did not intend to set that tone with respect to the [FEMA] reports, I obviously did.""

Kelly, 64, oversees a staff of 600 auditors and investigators charged with rooting out waste, fraud and abuse in the third-largest federal agency. He plans to retire when the Senate confirms a permanent chief. President Trump has nominated Joseph V. Cuffari, a policy adviser to Arizona Republican Gov. Doug Ducey and experienced federal investigator.

The internal review did not find that Kelly ""was improperly influenced by a personal or family relationship,"" spokeswoman Arlen Morales said in an email. Nor did investigators find any ""deliberate effort to benefit FEMA for personal gain,"" she said.

Kelly has not faced discipline for coaxing his staff to produce the flawed reports.

""Because Mr. Kelly is the senior-most official in our organization, no one within [the office] has authority to impose corrective action upon him,"" Morales said.

Across the federal government, agencies depend on inspectors general to provide them with independent, fact-driven analysis of their performance, conducting audits and investigations to ensure that taxpayers' money is spent wisely.

Emergency management experts said that oversight, particularly from auditors on the ground as a disaster is unfolding, is crucial to improving the response, especially in ensuring that contracts are properly administered.

""I read a couple of those [retracted reports] and realized they weren't good enough to help me,"" said W. Craig Fugate, FEMA administrator for eight years under President Barack Obama.

""We're not that good,"" Fugate said of how the reports characterized FEMA's performance. ""The whole idea of the IG going out early was to find things we could do to take corrective action then.""

Even with improvements to emergency response in the deeply flawed aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, FEMA's performance still is closely watched by local communities and Congress, where disaster response in the Trump administration has become particularly politicized.

Congress agreed only this week to send billions of dollars in long-delayed relief to lingering recovery efforts from multiple natural disasters, including Puerto Rico's 2017 hurricane.

John Roth, who preceded Kelly as inspector general and promoted him to his second-in-command, called the flawed reports an aberration and described Kelly's oversight of other FEMA operations ""unstinting.""

""This was not a rogue IG gone bad,"" Roth said, calling Kelly as ""as square and true blue as you could get."" Roth acknowledged, though, that the mistakes underscore a challenge for inspectors general, who want to maintain credibility with the agencies they oversee while they are issuing critical reports.

After Hurricane Isaac, which killed 41 people in Louisiana and caused more than $3 billion in damage in 2012, auditors found several problems and proposed fixes on the ground before Kelly intervened.

Kelly wanted to ""downplay all the negatives"" because he believed the agency's ""overall"" response was ""good,"" the review found.

So the report cast the problems as ""pressing challenges"" for FEMA that included a shortage of experienced staff and a slow response from headquarters to requests from field staff. FEMA met the challenges, the since-retracted report said.

Auditors emphasized the good that arose from problems. Slow processing of funding requests were blamed on a byzantine process.

After Hurricane Sandy pummeled New York and New Jersey in 2012, Kelly told the staff in an email to alter their draft audits. Since ""FEMA's initial response was generally good for both disasters at all locations it would be best if all three reports were similar,"" Kelly wrote, referring to both Isaac and Sandy.

The audits became known among the staff as ""feel good"" reports.

When tornadoes struck Oklahoma in May and June of 2013, a supervisor who reported to Kelly tamped down the efforts of auditing teams that wanted to be more critical.

""Yes, we will identify some problems, but the point is - how did FEMA overcome them?"" the supervisor wrote to the auditing team, copying Kelly.

""These are feel-good reports to tell the public how well FEMA initially responds to disasters,"" the supervisor wrote. The reports were not to identify ""systemic problems.""

Kelly did not correct or clarify any of the assertions made in the email, the internal review said. ""These opportunities allow us to write quick, meaningful reports that actually help FEMA, and FEMA usually loves the reports,"" the supervisor wrote.

Months later, when catastrophic flooding devastated wide swaths of Colorado, auditors again tried to include their concerns about FEMA's shortcomings, but ""those efforts were ultimately rebuffed,"" investigators found.

The team wrote two spin-off reports following the flooding that found serious problems with the response. Disaster survivors who could not communicate in English or Spanish had problems finding FEMA staff to help them register for disaster aid. And the agency hired only half the workers that it needed for a proper response.

Kelly did not dispute investigators' conclusions about the retracted reports. He defended his approach, telling them he ""thought a report with a single message would be clearer and less likely to get lost or be ignored by FEMA,"" the internal review said.

It was the message the inspector general conveyed after the Louisiana flooding in 2016 that caught the attention of House Republicans. As they complained that FEMA was spending too much money on mobile homes that took months to arrive, the team supervisor changed the draft report to add language that discounted their complaints, investigators found.

Instead, the audit characterized FEMA's response in heroic terms, including ""superlative language,"" and said members of Congress were misguided in their criticism.

""The IG is telling us 'everything's fine,' when it obviously wasn't. It just never matched up,"" recalled former Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who was chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee. ""I wonder how much more pain was inflicted [on disaster victims] by the fact that people weren't being held accountable in real time.""

The committee had held two hearings on the flooding after Chaffetz's staff and two congressmen, including Rep. Garret Graves, R-La., who represents the flooded area, had flown to Baton Rouge to tour the damage.

An elderly man had died in a FEMA trailer with faulty air conditioning. The committee staff kept waiting for the inspector general's team to release its audit, hoping that professionals would confirm their observations and press FEMA to do better, recalled Mike Howell, a former staffer who worked on the issue.

But when the report came out, lawmakers were shocked - and livid.

""Our jaws just dropped,"" Howell recalled. ""They said everything is fine. I said, 'Did you even look at this issue, that issue and the man's death? All of the unoccupied FEMA trailers sitting on lots? The people still not in their houses who can't get a straight answer from FEMA?' They had no answer and we were enraged.""

In a report issued in October 2018 that criticized FEMA's disaster response, committee Republicans also took the inspector general to task.

A manager interviewed by the committee called the reports ""useless"" but said the staff ""kept producing them because that was what [Deputy Inspector General] John Kelly wanted.""

The internal review has led to changes: a new practice of rotating auditors to ""promote the objectivity and independence,"" a reduced ""reliance on testimonial evidence"" and an increased ""reliance on source documentation.""

The office is also training auditors to comply with auditing standards and ways to maintain independence from the people and agencies they are evaluating.

Costello, the deputy inspector general, said in an email, “We have all learned from this experience and are determined not to repeat these mistakes.”

"Mallinckrodt paid 'kickbacks' to keep drug price high, and stuck taxpayers with bill, DOJ lawsuit says",https://www.cnn.com,['Wayne Drash'],06-05-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/health/mallinckrodt-lawsuit-doj/index.html,"(CNN) The pharmaceutical company responsible for one of the largest drug price increases in US history ""knowingly paid illegal kickbacks"" as part of an elaborate scheme to make millions and stick the American taxpayer with the bill, the US Department of Justice said Wednesday in a lawsuit filed against Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals.

In its complaint, the government demanded a jury trial that would put front and center the actions of the company at the heart of a 97,000% drug price hike. The price of Mallinckrodt's anti-inflammatory drug Acthar -- best known for treating babies with a debilitating seizure disorder -- has gone from $40 a vial in 2000 to nearly $39,000 today.

The complaint was filed in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by US Attorney William McSwain. Mallinckrodt could face fines of nearly $240 million if found liable.

The government alleged Mallinckrodt used a foundation, called the Chronic Disease Fund, as a conduit to pay kickbacks as part of the scheme to maintain the high price of Acthar.

""The scheme allowed the Company to continually raise Acthar's price yet market it as 'free' to patients and doctors, shifting the drug's ever-increasing cost to Medicare,"" the government said in its complaint. ""As a result of its conduct, Mallinckrodt caused the submission of millions of dollars in false Medicare claims for Acthar.""

Before we ever touched a rifle, we received instruction on topics like rifle mechanisms, cleaning, and safety. Then we learned how to aim, including how to control our breathing and adjust for distance and wind. Once our instruction was mastered, we were cleared for the rifle range. After making the sight adjustments and aiming, then and only then did we fire our rifles.

We all know about “ready, aim, fire” but the moral of my story is also the importance of the initial preparation. The approach Secretary Perdue has taken to ensuring our country is fed and nourished well into the future is to skip the preparation and reverse the order. He “fired” last summer when he made his surprise announcement. His “aim” does not include fixing a problem or making improvements, and the rationale has been vague, unfounded, or disingenuous. The subsequent “ready” phase involved the Agriculture Department scrambling to figure out how to make a site decision, develop site criteria, and consult Congress and stakeholders. The “ready” phase has yet to produce a public cost benefit analysis.

The preparation phase was omitted altogether, unless one counts the Agriculture Department preemptively removing someone standing in the way, who is the only affected official not in an acting capacity. With any new administration, preparation should have included a thorough process to understand the Agriculture Department research arm, its strengths and weaknesses, and its stakeholders, not to mention the major agricultural challenges being addressed. This would have included discussions with current and former leaders, the external agricultural community, and the previous administration, none of which happened. Why should anyone care what the Agriculture Department does with its research units?

For the same reason the federal government has strong research programs in health, defense, and energy, we need strong research programs for our $1 trillion food and agriculture industry. Whether we are talking peaches in Georgia, rice in Louisiana, potatoes in Idaho, wheat in the Dakotas, blueberries in Maine, or swine in the Carolinas, our many commodities are constantly under threat from pests and diseases, highly competitive markets, and extreme weather. It is essential that we maintain the vitality and competitiveness of our commodities, which in turn will keep our farms and rural economies vibrant and flourishing.

Agriculture Department research programs support our health, nutrition, and rural development. They keep us apprised of farming income and estimate commodity projections to inform the long term planning of farmers. They also assess the effectiveness of our nutrition assistance programs, which account for the majority of the agency budget, to help us keep those federal programs running efficiently and effectively.

The research programs inform us about food deserts and new trends in agriculture. These are all initiatives that are much too important to let slip away or become less relevant as they would under current plans by the Agriculture Department. It is true we will still be able to buy groceries at our local stores, however, we need to be concerned about the long term challenges of feeding and nourishing 40 percent to 50 percent more people in the world in the next 30 years on the same amount of land.

Through decades of public service in both government and universities, including as former dean of agriculture at the University of Georgia and former chief scientist and undersecretary of research at the Agriculture Department under President George Bush, I have devoted my career to helping ensure the nation will be fed, nourished, and prosperous. I also worked hard to ensure agricultural research was well administered.

I see little in current plans by the Agriculture Department to help our nation in any of these areas. In fact, I see the opposite. My resistance and that of the rest of the vocal opposition is not fear of change. Change is a given for Agriculture Department research as it adapts to new challenges, modernizes techniques, and makes administrative improvements. Past changes, however, have always been made after careful study and input from a broad sector of voices within the agricultural community.

The backwards “fire, aim, ready” without preparation approach under Secretary Perdue is not good government. To ensure the success of our farmers, our food supply and safety, and rural areas, the Agriculture Department should heed a common sense approach by withdrawing its plans and fully preparing. What do we want? Why? How? At the very least, we should make sure the rifle sights are clean and focused, know what we are aiming for, and know that firing will make the system stronger.

Global Opinions writer

Even after spending a year and a half in prison in Tehran, I knew that if I wanted to go on writing about Iran, I would be a target for plenty of public attacks despite the abuse I had suffered at the hands of the Islamic Republic. And so it has been.

But I never imagined the U.S. State Department would be funding my attackers.

Last week, several astute Iran watchers drew attention to a series of inflammatory tweets associated with the Iran Disinformation Project, a State Department-funded initiative that its website claims “brings to light disinformation emanating from the Islamic Republic of Iran via official rhetoric, state propaganda outlets, social media manipulation and more.”

So the @StateDept uses taxpayer money to fund online attacks on @HRW because the organization is researching the human cost of US sanctions in #Iran.



Is this even legal? https://t.co/PGVuizRq93 — Negar Mortazavi (@NegarMortazavi) May 30, 2019

What other @StateDept funded organizations claiming to promote democracy in #Iran are using taxpayer money to harass, intimidate, threaten and slander American journalists & academics?

Follow the money folks. — Farnaz Fassihi (@farnazfassihi) May 31, 2019

On Friday, in response to the complaints, the State Department suspended the initiative’s funding “until the implementer takes necessary steps to ensure that any future activity remains within the agreed scope of work,” a department official said.

One of the “steps” thus far has been to delete many of the tweets in question. But that is hardly sufficient.

Ironically, the Iran Disinformation Project was funded by the State Department’s Global Engagement Center, which was begun to combat online extremism and propaganda.

The targets of the tweets included think-tank analysts, human rights activists and journalists (including me). The common thread is that we are all perceived by regime change proponents and supporters of the Trump administration’s so-called maximum pressure policy to be soft on Iran because we are critical of crushing economic sanctions and the threat of the use of military force against it.

For these thought crimes, we are branded by @IranDisinfo and similar social media accounts as Tehran’s “mouthpieces,” “apologists,” “collaborators,” and “lobbyists” in the West.

I won’t speak for others who have been attacked, and my own views are irrelevant to this situation. From what I can see, though, we all appear to share the view that Iran should be secular and democratic. The main difference between us and those spreading these falsehoods against us is how we envision that change in Iranian politics coming about.

As a matter of principle, I try to avoid impeding anyone else’s right to free expression — even when it’s used to attack me. If a claim against me is demonstrably false, I will state it clearly and openly. Yet, I believe it’s important to allow others — even faceless ones hiding behind anonymous social media accounts — the opportunity to criticize me, my work and my credentials. It’s part of what you sign up for when you take this job.

I also openly acknowledge that others who have been abused by Iran (such as me) have the right to hold whatever political positions they choose and the right to defend and promote them passionately. Yes, even if it means they advocate war or sanctions directed at the people of that country. They have their views and I have mine.

Slander and libel are a different story, however, and @IranDisinfo may have crossed the line.

What Bahman Kalbasi, one of the #IranDisinfo mouthpieces in @BBC doesn't tell you, is that the number of Jews in #Iran before the Islamic Revolution was around 100K. After the mass executions, assassinations, and confiscation of properties, now the number is less than 10K. https://t.co/rfhb6kwFk1 — IranDisinfo (@IranDisinfo) May 28, 2019

In the past 16 months, thousands of protestors have been arrested in #Iran, and most are anonymous. @sepehrifar of @hrw, a supporter of so-called Moderates within the regime, instead of documenting+proving these human rights violations, is working hard to prove @JZarif's claims. https://t.co/CvWzqULihT — IranDisinfo (@IranDisinfo) April 25, 2019

So we’re faced with the irony that an initiative aimed at combating Tehran’s disinformation campaigns is resorting to disinformation campaigns of its own, using taxpayer funds to spread lies about U.S. citizens. We need programs that fight the spread of falsehoods and propaganda, but such efforts shouldn’t combat lies with other lies — and certainly not with public funding.

This is just one more small incident in the long moment of reckoning our democracy is facing. It will pass quickly, but it’s an important stress test.

How can individuals who are not willing to adhere to the norms of American civil society be entrusted with resources to promote civil society in other countries?

The State Department can easily fix the problem. It needs to perform a transparent assessment of who received the funding and why. Once the facts are clear, the grant should be terminated.

Transparency and accountability are fundamental to the rule of law. Anyone who claims otherwise cannot be entrusted with taxpayer money to promote American ideals — at home or abroad.

At the heart of the matter lies a fundamental question: Do we support our long-cherished ideals of democratic fair play or the “by any means necessary” approach that is becoming more prevalent in the current political climate?

Put personal politics aside for a moment and look back through history. Do peddlers of disinformation contribute or detract from our health as a society? The answer is obvious, and the State Department should take a clear stance on the side of honest and responsible discourse.

If the State Department declines to address the issue, Congress should investigate.
