Trump asserts executive privilege to block access to census documents,https://www.politico.com,['Andrew Desiderio'],06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/12/trump-asserts-executive-privilege-to-block-access-to-census-documents-1361784,"President Donald Trump on Wednesday claimed executive privilege over subpoenaed documents at the urging of the Justice Department. | Mark Wilson/Getty Images Congress Trump asserts executive privilege to block access to census documents The president took the aggressive step as the House Oversight panel began proceedings to hold William Barr and Wilbur Ross in contempt.

President Donald Trump on Wednesday moved to block Congress’ access to documents about how a citizenship question was added to the 2020 census.

Trump claimed executive privilege over subpoenaed documents at the urging of the Justice Department, as the House Oversight and Reform Committee was beginning proceedings Wednesday morning to hold Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt of Congress for failing to comply with the panel’s subpoenas, which the committee issued in April.

“These documents are protected from disclosure by the deliberative process, attorney-client communications, or attorney work product components of executive privilege,” Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd wrote in a letter to House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.).

“Regrettably, you have made these assertions necessary by your insistence upon scheduling a premature contempt vote,” Boyd added.

Boyd’s letter came just minutes before the committee convened to vote on civil and criminal contempt citations for Barr and Ross. Talks between the Justice Department and the committee broke down late Tuesday night after both sides exchanged last-minute offers that would have staved off the contempt votes.

“This begs the question: what is being hidden?” Cummings said. “This does not appear to be an effort to engage in good faith negotiations or accommodations. Instead, it appears to be another example of the administration’s blanket defiance of Congress’s constitutionally mandated responsibilities.”

Cummings offered to postpone Wednesday’s votes if the Justice and Commerce departments agreed to turn over a small batch of specific documents. But a spokeswoman for Cummings said the Trump administration did not accept that offer, adding: “Despite more than two months since we issued the subpoenas and more than a week since we told the agencies we were moving to contempt, the agencies have made no commitment or counter-offer regarding any of the critical documents in our subpoenas.”

Last month, the Justice Department moved to block the House Judiciary Committee’s access to special counsel Robert Mueller’s unredacted report and all of its underlying evidence, urging Trump to assert executive privilege over the report just before the committee was voting to hold Barr in contempt for defying the panel’s subpoena.

The contempt votes against Barr and Ross came a day after the full House voted to empower committee chairs to sue the Trump administration in federal court to enforce their subpoenas. Democrats are expected to take the administration to court on several matters, including the census, Mueller’s grand-jury evidence, and Trump’s personal and business tax returns.

The committee launched an investigation earlier this year into the origins of the citizenship question, with Democrats claiming that it was added to the census in order to boost Republicans in future elections.

Democrats have accused Ross of lying about how the citizenship question was added to the census, in particular after new evidence emerged recently that highlighted the role of a now-deceased Republican gerrymandering expert who argued that adding such a question to the census would cause congressional districts to be redrawn in ways that help Republicans.

“I want to know why this question was magically added after we have seen that a political operative knew and detailed an intent to intimidate racial and immigrant communities for a partisan purpose,"" said Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).

The Trump administration has said it made the decision in order to better enforce the Voting Rights Act. Republicans have said the contempt proceedings are premature while the Supreme Court is considering the issue.

White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said Ross has been “harassed” by Democrats.

“I understand the oversight responsibility, but this looks like overreach to Americans,” Conway added.

"Kamala Harris: If elected, my DOJ would have 'no choice' but to prosecute Trump",https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-if-president-doj-would-have-no-choice-but-to-charge-trump,"2020 candidate Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., has issued a stunning warning to President Trump that seems to echo controversial recent comments from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, saying her Justice Department would likely charge him with obstruction of justice if she wins the White House.

Harris, in a newly released interview, said she believes the only reason former Special Counsel Robert Mueller did not recommend prosecuting Trump was because of the Justice Department’s policy against indicting a sitting president. Once out of office, Trump would be subject to charges -- and Harris was emphatic in saying the DOJ should pursue them.

DEMS' LONG GAME? PELOSI RAISES PROSPECT OF PROSECUTING TRUMP ONCE HE LEAVES OFFICE

“I believe that they would have no choice and that they should, yes,” Harris said on this week’s NPR Politics Podcast.

The former California attorney general and San Francisco district attorney cited the importance of holding everyone accountable for their actions.

“I mean look, people might, you know, question why I became a prosecutor,” Harris said. “Well, I’ll tell you one of the reasons – I believe there should be accountability. Everyone should be held accountable, and the president is not above the law.”

Harris is not the first high-profile Democrat to suggest that not only should Congress pursue impeachment against Trump -- but he should face criminal charges once out of office.

Pelosi, D-Calif., reportedly told colleagues last week: “I don’t want to see him impeached, I want to see him in prison.”

REP. WARREN DAVIDSON: PELOSI MENTIONED TRUMP IMPRISONMENT TO ‘KEEP IMPEACHMENT ZEALOTS IN LINE’

Trump reacted to this by calling Pelosi ""a nasty, vindictive, horrible person.""

Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., however, had no problem with Pelosi's remarks.

""I don’t have any difficulty with those words,"" Cicilline told ""Fox News Sunday,"" comparing them to when then-candidate Trump inspired ""lock her up"" chants when he ran against Hillary Clinton. A 2018 New York Times report also said that Trump looked into prosecuting Clinton, as well as former FBI Director James Comey.

Joining the chorus of Democrats hinting that prosecuting Trump might be appropriate was another 2020 candidate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. The progressive Democrat said recently that Trump would be ""carried out in handcuffs"" if he were anyone else, though she did not openly advocate charges against him.

Asked Wednesday if he would advocate Trump's prosecution, fellow candidate Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., said “no one is above the law” while leaving the question open.

“To be very blunt, if my attorney general at the Department of Justice finds that there is probable cause that a law has been broken by anyone, I expect him to hold the alleged offender accountable no matter who they are or what title they’ve held in the past,” he said. “I’m not going to be a president that undermines the independence of the DOJ or the judiciary in a way that I’ve seen this administration do.”

Trump looks to squash Justin Amash,https://www.politico.com,"['Alex Isenstadt', 'John F. Harris']",06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/12/trump-amash-1361452,"Rep. Justin Amash is so far the only Republican in the House to call for President Donald Trump's impeachment. | Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call congress Trump looks to squash Justin Amash The president has discussed with aides backing a primary challenge against the lone Republican impeachment supporter.

Donald Trump and his top allies are moving to make Justin Amash pay for becoming the sole Republican congressman to call for the president’s impeachment.

Trump and his top advisers have discussed the prospect of backing a primary challenge to the Michigan lawmaker — a highly unusual move for a president against a member of his own party that would effectively amount to a warning shot to other Republicans thinking of crossing him. The conversations come as the billionaire DeVos family, which has deep ties to the administration and remains one of Michigan’s most powerful families, has announced it will cut off the congressman. That move could send a signal to other conservative donors deciding whether to invest in Amash.

Story Continued Below

Trump has raised the primary challenge idea with Vice President Mike Pence and North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows, a close Trump ally who co-founded the conservative House Freedom Caucus with Amash. Trump has also addressed the subject with Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, a former Michigan GOP leader who remains influential in the state.

Those who’ve spoken with the president say he’s made no firm decision about taking on Amash, who’s accused the president of engaging in “impeachable conduct” and left the door open to a third-party campaign for president. Trump, they point out, is mostly focused on his own reelection and often cools down after he has time to process a slight. There are also potential risks: Trying to unseat Amash could elevate him or turn him into a martyr.

Others in the president’s inner circle are skeptical that Amash, whose office did not respond to a request for comment, will even seek reelection.

Yet in some of the conversations, the president has been adamant that the White House take a forceful stand against the congressman. The deliberations underscore Trump’s penchant for exacting political retribution against those who’ve wronged him — something he executed with devastating precision against former Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake and former South Carolina Rep. Mark Sanford.

White House spokespersons declined to comment, as did spokespersons for Pence and Meadows. McDaniel, who under party rules is prohibited from supporting primary candidates, declined to address her conversations with Trump but said in a statement that it’s “sad to see Congressman Amash parroting the Democrats’ talking points on Russia.”

“The only people still fixated on the Russia collusion hoax are political foes of President Trump hoping to defeat him in 2020 by any desperate means possible,” she said. “Voters in Amash’s district strongly support this president and would rather their congressman work to support the president's policies that have brought jobs, increased wages and made life better for Americans.""

Amash is not the only sitting Republican incumbent that the Trump team has its eye on. Trump advisers are growing increasingly annoyed by Texas Rep. Will Hurd, a frequent critic of the president’s immigration policies. Last week, Trump's reelection campaign took the rare step of sending a tweet taking the swing-district congressman to task over one of his cable news appearances.

The president also met recently with Rep. Mark Walker, a North Carolina Republican who is weighing a primary challenge to Sen. Thom Tillis. Last year, Tillis co-sponsored legislation to protect then-special counsel Robert Mueller, and he initially opposed the president’s emergency declaration to build a border wall before ultimately voting for it.

The discussions about Amash come as primary opponents have begun to circle. Jim Lower, a 30-year-old state legislator who’s aligned himself with the president, recently announced his candidacy for the Grand Rapids-area seat. A poll released on Tuesday by MIRS News, a political news service in the state, showed Amash trailing Lower by 16 points.

Lower, who is set to travel to Washington next week to meet with senior Republicans, said he was hopeful the president would endorse him. Doing so, he said, would deter other primary candidates from running — which could dilute the anti-Amash vote and potentially pave the way for the congressman's re-nomination.

“If they were to get involved early I think it would help make sure that it was just me versus Amash in the August primary — and if that’s the case we’re definitely going to win,” Lower said.

“Obviously Trump is a huge component of our campaign, so it will probably go without saying that we’d love to have his endorsement,” he added.

Focus on the president's potential involvement in the contest is likely to intensify over the summer. In September, national and state GOP leaders are slated to gather on Mackinac Island for the Republican Leadership Conference, a biennial confab that's expected to draw administration officials and where Amash is certain to come up.

There is growing speculation in Michigan political circles, meanwhile, that the west Michigan-based DeVos family may engage in the primary. Lower has been in touch with representatives for the family. And last week Jase Bolger, a DeVos confidant and former state House speaker, traveled to Washington for meetings with senior Republican officials where Amash was discussed.

A DeVos spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. The mega-donor family, which has bankrolled a host of prominent Republicans including Pence, has broad influence in GOP money circles and their decision could resonate with other donors.

The Amash team has remained tight-lipped about the congressman’s 2020 plans. Yet there are indications the 39-year-old congressman, who was first elected in 2010, recognizes the political toll his support for impeachment has taken.

On Monday evening, Amash announced his departure from the Freedom Caucus, telling CNN that he “didn’t want to be a further distraction for the group.”"
Donald Trump Jr. says 'nothing to correct' as he returns for Senate committee testimony,https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/donald-trump-jr-says-nothing-to-correct-as-he-goes-before-senate-committee,"Donald Trump Jr. said Wednesday he has ""nothing to correct"" as he returned to testify behind closed doors before the Senate Intelligence Committee, following a subpoena from the committee's Republican chairman, North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr.

The president's son is expected to field questions related to the committee's Russia investigation.

Among other things, queries could address Trump Jr.'s knowledge of negotiations for a Trump Tower in Moscow before the 2016 election. During an earlier 2017 interview on Capitol Hill, Trump said he had only been ""peripherally aware"" of the possible deal. But President Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen, who is currently serving a prison sentence for offenses including lying to Congress, said he spoke to Trump Jr. about the deal multiple times.

When asked Wednesday morning if he was going to correct any of his past testimony, Trump Jr. said there was ""nothing to correct.""

Also a potential subject of questioning is the 2016 Trump Tower meeting that Trump Jr. set up between a Russian attorney and senior Trump campaign members. The campaign hoped that the meeting would result in them getting incriminating information about Hillary Clinton, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.

DONALD TRUMP JR. BASHES MICHAEL COHEN'S MOTIVES DURING HOUSE TESTIMONY

Wednesday's closed-door hearing comes after Trump Jr. already testified for more than 20 hours and provided thousands of documents to Congress. Last month, President Trump supported his son, questioning the need for the additional testimony.

""I don't know why. I have no idea why. But it seems very unfair to me,"" the president said.

Some Republicans even said Trump Jr. should not comply with the subpoena, which is believed to be the first subpoena targeting a member of the president's family.

Burr's home state colleague, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., tweeted, ""It's time to move on & start focusing on issues that matter to Americans."" Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, a GOP member of the panel, said he understood Trump Jr.'s frustration. Cornyn's Texas colleague, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, said there was ""no need"" for the subpoena.

Seriously, who does that?

But that’s the initiative Trump has embarked upon of late — an industrial policy to revive all the dirty industries of the past and to undermine the clean industries of the future.

It is a policy initiative that is not only perverse on its face, but that utterly fails to connect so many dots that are right now harming our national security, economy, weather and competition with China."
Newt Gingrich: Trump vs. Pelosi – Why the 2020 election may turn out completely differently than you expect,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Newt Gingrich', 'Former Speaker Of The U.S. House Of Representatives Newt Gingrich Is The Host Of The']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/newt-gingrich-president-trump-nancy-pelosi,"Over the last few weeks, the stature gap between President Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has grown dramatically.

While the president became the first foreign leader to meet with the new emperor of Japan, Pelosi announced she would like to see Trump in prison.

The president then had a widely watched dinner with Queen Elizabeth at Buckingham Palace.

NANCY PELOSI GETS FED UP WITH CNN REPORTER'S LITANY OF TRUMP QUESTIONS: 'I'M DONE WITH HIM'

The president seemed entirely at home as a world leader dining with the royals. The following day, the president had an interview with Piers Morgan, which was the most controlled and nuanced interview I have seen him give. He was truly presidential.

The meetings with Prime Minister Theresa May and other British government leaders also went well.

As President Trump grows in stature as a genuine world leader and the Democrats continue to shrink, the election of 2020 may be vastly different than the so-called experts think.

The anti-Trump crowds in London were tiny compared to the massive crowds that used to oppose President Ronald Reagan (of course Russian President Vladimir Putin is not spending the kind of money the Soviet Union used to spend on the so-called peace movement).

The president’s recitation at Portsmouth of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s prayer on D-Day was stunning and widely replayed in the news.

Then the president went to Normandy and gave one of the most powerful and moving speeches of his career. When even liberals and anti-Trumpers were comparing his speech to President Reagan’s historic 1984 oration, you know President Trump had achieved an extraordinary impact.

Shortly after the speech, the president met with French President Emmanuel Macron, who told the news media he and Trump are good friends.

A brief stop in Ireland to meet with the Irish Prime Minister (and play a little golf) wrapped up the most successful trip so far in the Trump presidency.

While the president was overseas, he was also orchestrating the first really tough negotiation with Mexico over immigration. Largely because Congress has consistently failed to take control of the border and deal with illegal immigration, the president decided to focus on a strategy of getting Mexico to help control the illegal immigration that pours across its territory.

The president's threat to impose harsh tariffs brought Mexico to make historic changes in its approach to controlling illegal immigration. Some 6,000 Mexican troops are being sent to Mexico's southern border in a first step toward getting control of illegal immigration.

While there was widespread criticism and opposition to Trump’s threats when he first announced them, within a few days they achieved more progress with Mexico than we had made in years.

While the president was proving he was a world leader in Japan, Britain, France, Ireland and Mexico, Pelosi’s House Democrats were ineffectually talking about subpoenas and investigations – and asserting that there is no border problem.

The stature gap just kept growing.

Pelosi’s shrinking stature is more than matched by the decay of the Democratic presidential field.

The only Democratic candidate with real national stature is former Vice President Joe Biden. Biden’s 36 years in the Senate and eight years as vice president serving with President Obama give him both name identity and acceptability. Unfortunately for Biden, three things are undermining his candidacy.

First, his own record since he entered the Senate in 1972 makes him vulnerable on issue after issue. From apologizing to Anita Hill to explaining votes and statements that offend modern radicals, Biden’s record has kept him on defense.

Second, the dynamic, militant elements of the Democratic Party are all on the left. A recent uprising forced Biden to repudiate a decades-long commitment of support for the 1976 Hyde Amendment – which prevents taxpayer money from being used to pay for most abortions. After a few days of pressure, Biden caved to the left. A lifetime career of citing his Catholicism was washed away by the radical left in less than a week.

On the environment and other issues, Biden is going to be driven to the left. The heart of his candidacy – the stable, seasoned centrist – is being crushed by the energy and vitriol of the left.

Third, Biden has always been a weak, self-destructive candidate and he is still a weak, self-destructive candidate. From defending the Chinese, to sniffing people’s hair, to plagiarizing others, there is a “Bidenness” that plagued his first two campaigns for president and will probably destroy this one.

If Biden does fade – and recent Iowa polls certainly make this possible – the Democrats will have no national candidate.

Sen. Bernie Sanders’ past as a pro-Soviet, pro-Castro, genuinely hard-left socialist is beginning to limit his appeal.

Behind Sanders is a wave of left-wing radicals who will be more alien to most Americans than Sen. George McGovern, D-S.D., was in 1972. He only carried Massachusetts and the District of Columbia and lost to President Richard Nixon in the larges popular vote landslide in modern history (60.7 percent to 37.5 percent).

"DHS chief reveals startling stat on asylum seekers who skip hearings, disappear",https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dhs-secretary-reveals-startling-stat-on-asylum-seekers-who-skip-hearings-disappear,"The acting Homeland Security secretary gave lawmakers a glimpse Tuesday into just how many asylum seekers skip their hearings after being released into the United States -- telling a Senate panel that a recent program found 90 percent miss their court dates.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., asked Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan how many asylum seekers coming across the southern border show up for their hearings.

BORDER ARRESTS SKYROCKET IN MAY, AS OFFICIALS DECLARE 'FULL-BLOWN EMERGENCY'

“It depends on demographic, the court, but we see too many cases where people are not showing up,” he said, telling Graham that DHS recently conducted a pilot program with family units.

“Out of those 7,000 cases, 90 received final orders of removal in absentia, 90 percent,” he said.

“90 percent did not show up?” Graham asked.

“Correct, that is a recent sample from families crossing the border,” McAleenan clarified.

McAleenan’s testimony also painted a grim portrait of a border crisis that shows no signs of easing, with Border Patrol overwhelmed and underfunded. The secretary described authorities as hamstrung by laws that limit how long they can keep migrants in custody.

“Currently due to a single district court order, we cannot obtain effective immigration enforcement results for the families arriving at our border -- they cannot be held for longer than 21 days and do not receive rulings from immigration courts for years,” he said.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported that it encountered 144,000 migrants at the border in May, a level not seen in decades, describing the situation as a “full-blown emergency.” McAleenan said that 60,000 children have entered into DHS custody in just the last 40 days.

McAleenan told lawmakers they also suffer due to “misaligned” asylum standards, meaning many of those who demonstrate “credible fear” of returning home -- the initial bar for claiming asylum -- are later judged not to have a valid asylum claim.

PELOSI HITS TRUMP'S DEAL WITH MEXICO, ACCUSES HIM OF 'THREATS AND TEMPER TANTRUMS'

He also said the restrictions on how long family units can be held mean that a child is now seen as a passport to the U.S. -- a perception he said is based in reality. He testified that only 30 percent of those coming to the border are actually trying to avoid being captured.

“Unless you’re a single adult, it is very unlikely you’ll be repatriated,” he said.

McAleenan urged Congress to act to end those loopholes and to grant requested DHS funding, and suggested that moves to make asylum seekers claim asylum in their home countries or designated third-countries could help solve the crisis.

Graham’s “Secure and Protect Act of 2019,” being discussed at the hearing, would include a provision to establish refugee processing centers in Mexico and Central America, and the senator asked the DHS chief if such an approach would work.

“First of all, it would break the back of the smuggling organizations, they’re profiting from this cycle.” McAleenan said. ""It would provide access to asylum in country in a much safer manner than taking this dangerous journey and it would stop this flow immediately.”

“I believe the vast majority [of the migrant flow] would stop,” he said.

Democrats, meanwhile, suggested that the administration bears some of the blame for the situation at the border, with Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., pointing to McAleenan's recent appointment as an example of dysfunction at the department.

“In less than two and a half years, there have already been four heads of this department, we have before us an acting secretary who has been on the job for more than two months,"" he said. ""We cannot face this crisis effectively with a revolving door policy in the leadership at the Department of Homeland Security.”

McAleenan’s testimony comes amid continued negotiations between the Trump administration and Mexico on immigration. The U.S. announced on Friday that it had reached a deal with Mexico to drop threatened tariffs on Mexican imports in exchange for Mexico increasing efforts to limit U.S.-bound migration flows from Central America.

An administration source told Fox News Tuesday that a new deal for Mexico becoming a safe third country for asylum seekers was completed, but not yet announced.

Barr, saying it would sour what cooperation there has been.

Assistant Attorney General Stephen E. Boyd said the department has turned over thousands of pages of documents to the Oversight Committee but Chairman Elijah Cummings‘ quick trigger finger on the contempt vote is ruining that.

“Should the committee take the unnecessary and counterproductive step of proceeding with a contempt vote, the department will be forced to reevaluate its current production efforts in ongoing matters,” Mr. Boyd wrote.

He also warned that Mr. Cummings‘ vote won’t end up getting the congressman what he wants.

If the committee does pursue contempt, President Trump will assert a protective executive privilege over the documents Mr. Cummings is trying to get. That would effectively shield them all, while government lawyers look them over, Mr. Boyd suggested.

Mr. Cummings, in a reply letter Tuesday, said Republicans were making demands and issuing threats without offering any accommodations or promises that they will turn over documents if the committee delays its action.

“The committee cannot accept these terms,” he said. “The committee has a responsibility under the Constitution to conduct rigorous oversight of the census, and we will not continue to delay our efforts due to your ongoing obstruction.”

Mr. Cummings suspects shenanigans behind the move to add the citizenship question to the 2020 census — a contention several federal judges have backed up with their findings in several court cases.

The legality of the citizenship question is now pending before the Supreme Court.

Republicans argue Mr. Cummings is trying to sway the justices by orchestrating the contempt vote.

Mr. Boyd said that when Congress demands documents from the administration there is supposed to be an accommodation, where both sides work through privileges and other issues that arise.

He said that didn’t happen in this case.

In particular, he said, Mr. Cummings refused to allow a Justice Department lawyer to attend a deposition of a top department official — leading Mr. Barr to order the official not to testify.

The department released a legal opinion last month justifying Mr. Barr’s stance, saying the Obama administration held the same position.

3 Republican former EPA chiefs accuse Trump of 'undermining of science',https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/republican-epa-chiefs-accuse-trump-undermining-science/story?id=63631502,"Three Republican former heads of the Environmental Protection Agency accuse the agency's current leadership of supporting the ""undermining of science"" and a potentially ""catastrophic"" approach to climate change.

In an exclusive interview with ABC News Live, before a rare joint appearance on Capitol Hill, former EPA administrators William Reilly, Lee Thomas and Christine Whitman warned that recent gains in cleaner air and water in the U.S. are beginning to ""backslide.""

""If we continue business as usual, it's catastrophic,"" said Reilly, who led the agency under President George H.W. Bush. ""We're the number two emitter in the world after China.""

Whitman, a former New Jersey governor who ran the EPA under President George W. Bush, raised concerns about ""the disrespecting of science in the administration and the undermining of science and the importance of science.""

Thomas said his old boss, President Ronald Reagan, would have wanted the agency to recommit to its central purpose.

""Change the direction, change the management and go back to the mission of the agency. That's what I think President Reagan would say, 'That's not how I want this agency to operate,'"" Thomas said.

The trio spoke with ABC News before a House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee hearing Tuesday on the direction of the EPA, which was created in 1970 by Republican President Richard Nixon to protect the human health and the environment. Former Obama administration EPA chief Gina McCarthy also testified.

Asked to grade the performance of the current EPA leadership, led by Administrator Andrew Wheeler, the three Republicans agreed on ""D"" or ""a little lower.""

""You need an agency that is credible, has consistency in its rule making and is science-based,"" said Thomas, who lamented a steady exodus of career employees from the EPA because of disillusionment with its current direction.

ABC News

When ABC News Live spoke with Wheeler earlier this year, he insisted that the agency remains focused on its core purpose but is balancing other economic priorities. He said he does not believe climate change is a ""hoax,"" as President Donald Trump has insisted, but also does not think it's the ""crisis"" many environmentalists make it out to be.

""That's an unfair characterization,"" said Reilly of Wheeler's position, noting that the agency's own National Climate Assessment has painted a dire picture of the situation.

""The Green New Deal did something really wonderful,"" he said. ""I am told by so many Republican members of Congress that they are never asked about climate when they go on the stump. And now, they're asked. That is marvelous. It's put it on the agenda.""

Whitman agreed.

""For the first time in my memory, an environmental issue is going to be a major part of a political campaign for the presidency,"" she said. ""I haven't seen that before, and it's not going to go away, and that's good.""

The most unpopular president could win again in 2020,https://www.salon.com,[],06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.salon.com/2019/06/12/the-most-unpopular-president-could-win-again-in-2020_partner/,"Donald Trump is the first president to ever be elected while being actively disliked by the majority of Americans. Trump was also the first person elected president who was significantly less popular than his counterpart.

Most Americans have heard of presidents losing the popular vote but winning the election. But to win while the majority of Americans oppose you? How is that possible?

At the time of the election, Trump had the highest unfavorability rating in history, with over 61% of Americans having an “unfavorable” view or “disapproving” of Trump. (There’s also an “undecided” option.)

Luckily for Trump, he faced a historically unpopular opponent. Before 2016, no losing presidential candidate had had an unfavorable rating above 47%. But on election eve, Hillary Clinton’s was 52%, an unprecedented election in American history.

Pretty soon, Americans will start to hear nothing but polls, predictions and political forecasts in the news cycle for the 2020 elections. But, as a statistician and political polling expert, we think that there is one polling prediction device that will be overlooked and misunderstood: approval ratings.

Winning without the popular vote

History has been rather kind to presidents who didn’t win the popular vote. Trump is the fifth U.S. president to lose the popular vote and win the Electoral College.

All presidents have experienced a bump in popularity between election and Inauguration Day. But only Trump still found his approval rating — the percent of Americans who approve of the way the president is handling his job — below 50% upon entering office.

According to FiveThirtyEight, the day Trump stepped into the White House, he had only a 45.5% approval rating. This stands in stark contrast to Barack Obama, for example, who took office with a 68% approval rating.

Moreover, Trump has the lowest approval average in history, at only 40%. The next lowest is Harry Truman at 45.4%.

These data clearly show that Trump is the least-liked president in American history. With such unpopularity, how could he possibly win again?

Approval ratings and reelection

While election forecasting has become increasingly complex with new prediction models and techniques, there is an unsung hero of polling predictions: the approval ratings.

Introduced by George Gallup in the late 1920s, presidential approval ratings aimed to gauge the level of public support for the sitting president at any given time during his presidency.

Every single reelected president since approval rating polls began has had over a 50% approval rating when reelected, or been on an upward approval rating trend over 30 days before the election. If neither of those is satisfied, the incumbent loses.

It has been that simple.

As with any statistical analysis, the trends are more important than the raw numbers. The 2016 election was historically unprecedented in terms of favorability of the candidates, as is the political polarization of the U.S.

Look at the spread

We think that pollsters, and the general public, shouldn’t compare Trump’s approval ratings to past presidents.

What can be compared? The difference of highs and lows.

According to historical Gallup polls, Trump’s spread — the difference between the highest recorded and lowest recorded approval rating poll — has never been more than 13%.

Advertisement:

Not a single president since this type of robust polling began, back to Franklin D. Roosevelt, has ever shown this level of consistency in approval ratings. In fact, the next-smallest spread was 27%, for John F. Kennedy.

Trump’s approval ratings show that he has the strongest base in historical times.

2020 by the numbers

There are still nine months to go until the first ballots will be cast in the race to the White House for 2020, and the Democratic nominee’s identity will most likely not be known for almost a year. Still, Trump’s chances of reelection are being discussed daily.

Trump’s approval ratings are unlikely to go over 50%, given his lackluster starting point. So what does he actually need to win?

A simple statistical model applied to recorded approval ratings shows Trump has been garnering higher and higher approval ratings since taking office. Put simply, his base is staying strong and even growing. This is in direct contrast to all presidents except Bill Clinton.

Past incumbent presidents followed the rule that 49% approval and above means winning reelection, and anything below meant no second term. But Trump did not start at, nor will most likely ever reach, that level of approval.

Americans may again see something that, statistically speaking, has never been seen before. Approval ratings have high correlations with predicting the next president, but with Trump, the numbers are outside any historical trends.

The most unpopular winner ever may very likely win again.

"IRS regulations nix attempts to evade $10,000 cap on SALT deductions",https://www.lohud.com,"['David Mckay Wilson', 'Published P.M. Et June']",06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.lohud.com/story/money/personal-finance/taxes/david-mckay-wilson/2019/06/11/salt-tax-cap-deductions-nixed/1426013001/,"CLOSE Gov. Phil Murphy said the new federal cap on the deduction for state and local taxes was an attack on the middle class. State data show otherwise. Herb Jackson, Washington Correspondent, @HerbNJDC

Tax Watch columnist David McKay Wilson reports on the IRS ruling on the deductibility of state and local taxes.

The IRS on Tuesday squashed attempts by New York and New Jersey to circumvent the federal cap on the deductibility of state and local taxes, issuing final regulations that barred governments from giving substantial tax credits in exchange for charitable contributions.

These charitable funds, which many local governments set up to provide relief to the $10,000 cap, were seen as a way to help taxpayers in high-tax states. New York’s law allowed counties and municipalities to set up charitable reserve funds that would give tax credits equal to 95% of a contribution.

The regulations would allow tax credits equal to just 15% of the contribution, making them an unappealing way to get around the cap, which was imposed to help pay for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

At the same time, the IRS published proposed regulation that would allow a “safe harbor” for those who itemize their deductions and have participated in certain state or local programs that allow tax credits for contributions to certain nonprofit organizations.

It was uncertain Tuesday how the proposed “safe harbor” regulations would impact programs in New York and New Jersey.

OPINION: Tax law requires more than ‘SALT Cap’ workarounds

Decision panned in NJ, NY

The decision was assailed political leaders in both states.

New York's Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the ruling was an attack on the state.

""By finalizing this rule, the federal government is continuing its politically motivated economic assault on New York — an assault that started with President Trump and his allies in Congress and is now being advanced by the IRS,"" he said. ""The IRS should not be used as a political weapon.""

In New Jersey, Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-Wyckoff, said the ruling would favor less wealthy states that typically receive more in federal aid than they provide tax revenue.

""This seems to be a massive giveaway to the Moocher States and another whack at states like New Jersey,"" he said. ""This is the ultimate politically-motivated giveaway to red states. It doesn't even pass the laugh test and will face tough legal scrutiny.

New York Assemblywoman Amy Paulin, D-Scarsdale, on behalf of the Coalition for the Charitable Contribution Deduction, a New York coalition representing counties, cities, towns, villages, school districts, and professional organizations, said the ruling could have far-reaching impact.

State Assembly member Amy Paulin, D-Scarsdale, co-sponsored a new law to help Temporary Assistance for Needy Families recipients in a variety of ways to prepare for a more stable life without government assistance. Contributed photo State Assembly member Amy Paulin, D-Scarsdale, says she opposes the education-tax credit programn for public and private schools. (Photo: Contributed photo., Contributed photo.)

“We are shocked at the IRS final regulations, issued today, that would overturn decades of precedent and IRS guidance to disallow a federal deduction for a charitable contribution if it is accompanied with a state or local tax credit to incentivize charitable giving,” she said. “This move puts at risk charitable funds in red states and blue states, from Arkansas to New York, to support worthy public issues like education, health care, the environment, and delivering high quality public services.”

Paulin said the programs set up in New York used the same structure as 70 tax credit programs in 24 states.

She said the coalition will now look to the federal courts to overturn the IRS regulation.

“We fully plan to turn to the courts to continue to press the case that his regulation is arbitrary, capricious, and unfair, and should not be allowed to stand.”

Sen.Bob Menendez, D-New Jersey, said the IRS ruling was an attack on New Jersey taxpayers.

“Not surprisingly, the Trump Administration is once again taking a swipe at New Jersey’s middle class taxpayers,"" he said. ""The IRS has allowed these charitable funds for decades and is only now banning them because states like New Jersey sought to utilize them and establish its own.""

Homeland Security official describes widespread 'fraudulent' families at border,https://thehill.com,[],06-11-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/447919-homeland-security-official-describes-widespread-fraudulent-families-at-border,"Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan told Congress Tuesday that 15 percent of migrant families screened at the border were found to be misrepresenting minors as their own children in order to bolster their asylum claims.

Families with minors are released from detention to shelters more quickly because minors are not allowed to be held in custody for more than 20 days under a 1997 court settlement.

Dick Durbin Richard (Dick) Joseph DurbinHomeland Security official describes widespread 'fraudulent' families at border Homeland Security official describes widespread 'fraudulent' families at border Senate GOP to vote on Trump's .5 billion border request next week MORE (D-Ill.) that a DNA-testing pilot program found that 17 out of 109 people tested were found to be misrepresenting a minor they were detained with as a blood relation.

“Seventeen admitted or were tested out as fraudulent,” McAleenan testified. “This is a 15 percent return.”

McAleenan also said that special agents with forensic interview skills interviewed 1,568 family unites and found that 242 families “were fraudulent.”

“I don’t think we can ignore these numbers,” he said.

McAleenan clarified that the statistics don’t necessarily mean that 15 percent of all families trying to cross the border are misrepresenting unrelated minors as blood-related offspring.

He said the families tested were targeted referrals by border patrol agents who were suspicious about certain migrants borrowing or renting children to get into the United States more easily.

Durbin, an outspoken advocate for immigrant rights, acknowledged there was “no excuse” for misrepresenting children to fraudulently gain asylum.

“We should not ignore them. There is no excuse, none, for mispresenting a child as your own in an effort to defraud anyone in our country or any other place,” Durbin said. “But this notion that we can somehow dismiss the 85 percent of children because some are abusing that representation of parental responsibility troubles me greatly.”

Earlier in the hearing, McAleenan said border investigators found a 51-year-old migrant paid $80 to rent a 6-month-old child to get across the border.

“We’re very concerned about the incidents of fraud. We think it’s a huge part of this cycle, and it’s caused by the fact that they know if they come as a family they’ll get special treatment at the border,” he testified.

Bill Barr's brazen new dodge: He hopes to blackmail Congress over census info,https://www.salon.com,[],06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.salon.com/2019/06/12/bill-barrs-brazen-new-dodge-he-hopes-to-blackmail-congress-over-census-info/,"Several Cabinet department heads in the Trump administration have fought against efforts of congressional oversight in recent weeks. Perhaps none have been so brazen, or so seemingly corrupt, as Attorney General William Barr’s latest move to avoid scrutiny.

On Tuesday, House Democrats passed a civil enforcement resolution that effectively holds Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn in contempt of Congress. The vote came 24 hours after House Judiciary Committee chair Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., reversed his planned contempt vote against Barr after reaching a last-minute deal with the Department of Justice to hand over some underlying materials from special counsel Robert Mueller’s report. With Tuesday’s vote, congressional committee chairs can now enforce subpoenas in court if their requests go ignored.

Barr responded to Tuesday’s vote by again threatening to withhold documents requested by Congress — but in a totally unrelated case.

The House Oversight Committee is scheduled to vote Wednesday to hold Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt of Congress for refusing to provide documents related to the 2020 census in response to congressional subpoenas. In a blatant attempt to stop this oversight effort, the Justice Department on Tuesday threatened to withhold the documents on its efforts to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, by fair means or foul, unless House Democrats abandon their vote to hold Barr and Ross in contempt.

In a Tuesday letter to Oversight Committee chair Elijah Cummings, D-Md., Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd demanded that the committee halt the issuing of the subpoenas and delay its contempt vote until Trump makes a determination on the materials the committee wants. Boyd argued that the requested documents are covered by either deliberative process privilege, attorney-client privilege or by the ""attorney work product"" component of executive privilege.

""The Committee has failed to abide by the constitutionally mandated accommodation process by declining to negotiate over the scope of the subpoenaed materials or to recognize legitimate executive branch interest, as well as by its premature decision to schedule a contempt vote,"" Boyd wrote in the letter. In other words, the DOJ’s claim of privilege appears to depend on Cummings' behavior, not on objective questions of law or fact.

According to Tuesday’s letter, Barr intends to seek a privilege assertion not just for the DOJ documents, but also for Commerce Department documents covered by the committee’s subpoena.

The requested documents are related to the Trump administration’s decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, which Democrats argue was added to trigger newly drawn congressional districts that would boost Republicans electorally. A report released last week found that the census could undercount more than 4 million people, particularly in Latino and African American communities.

""We gave Attorney General Barr and Secretary Ross every opportunity to produce the documents the Committee needs for our investigation, but rather than cooperate, they have decided that they would rather be held in contempt of Congress,"" Cummings said in a statement announcing the planned contempt vote.

""They produced none of the documents we asked for, they made no counter-offers regarding these documents, and they seem determined to continue the Trump administration’s cover-up,"" he added.

The DOJ’s threat is nothing more than a delay tactic — as evidenced by a similar move Barr pulled with Nadler’s committee — but ironically, the attorney general's contempt for Congress is shown in his tactics to avoid being formally accused of contempt of Congress.

Barr’s DOJ is no longer even pretending to be an independent, non-political department; still less pretending to respect Congress' role as a co-equal branch of government with an oversight role.

Barr's defense against Congress asking him to do his job is to threaten to do even less of his job. His argument against oversight essentially amounts to: “If the House continues to ponder holding me in contempt, I will continue to obstruct justice and perform more contemptuous acts.”

Executive privilege has a role. It is meant to protect the intimate conversations of the president with his advisers and top-level cabinet officials. The Trump administration, with its latest request, is attempting to apply privilege to documents written before Trump even took office. The Supreme Court's unanimous decision in the 1974 U.S. v. Nixon case — which led directly to a president's resignation — supposedly settled this issue. Assertions of executive privilege beyond the scope of that decision would seem to be blatant obstruction of justice. That's exactly where we are."

The hearing, which will feature R. Clarke Cooper, assistant secretary of state for political-military affairs, as its only witness, is the House’s first official action to scrutinize and condemn the administration’s emergency declaration, which enabled the move. Members are expected to follow up on the hearing by pursuing a set of disapproval resolutions to try to block the arms deals from going forward.

[Trump’s arms deals benefiting Saudi Arabia to face their first test in Congress]

A bipartisan group in the Senate is also pushing for a vote on 22 disapproval resolutions — one for each of the arms deals totaling over $8 billion in sales — and is expected to demand a vote on the measure early next week.

President Trump has received bipartisan criticism for his continued support for Saudi Arabia, despite its controversial military engagement in Yemen’s civil war and its leaders’ role in the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. A majority of lawmakers voted earlier this year to end U.S. participation in the war in Yemen, and they have condemned the killing of Khashoggi, a Washington Post contributing columnist who was slain in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul in October.

Against that backdrop, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s emergency order to complete the arms deals last month struck many lawmakers as surprising and offensive, not simply for supplying Saudi Arabia and its allies with weapons at a time when most lawmakers in Congress are advocating holding such materiel back, but also for the breadth of the order.

Lawmakers have traditionally been able to register their objections to arms deals before they proceed; the declaration of an emergency effectively cuts them out of that process, unless a disapproval resolution to block the deals is able to gain enough support in Congress to overcome a presidential veto."

But that ethics pledge expires in August. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo energy & environment Colorado mine’s ties to Interior secretary unsettle tourist town The mine’s array of powerful allies is inspiring deep unease among leaders in Glenwood Springs.

The Mid-Continent quarry has sat for decades in the hills of western Colorado, where kayakers paddle the Roaring Fork River and tourists soak in the natural hot springs. But now a proposed expansion of the 16-acre limestone mine has kicked off a battle that stretches to the office of Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, whose former employer is lobbying for the project.

The mine's owner, Rocky Mountain Resources, is led by CEO Chad Brownstein, whose father chairs the major lobbying firm where Bernhardt worked for a decade. Bernhardt’s old firm is pushing the mining proposal on two fronts, according to interviews and POLITICO’s review of public records — pressing local government leaders to endorse the project, while meeting in D.C. with Interior staff who could decide the expansion’s fate.

Story Continued Below

Bernhardt promised nearly two years ago to recuse himself from decisions involving his former firm’s clients. But that ethics pledge expires in August, freeing him to work on those issues. An Interior spokesperson would only refer to that pledge when asked whether he’d recused himself from the mine's proposal, and declined to say what action he may take when the pledge expires.



The hilltop mine leases land owned by Interior’s Bureau of Land Management.

The mine’s array of powerful allies is inspiring deep unease among leaders in Glenwood Springs, a community of 10,000 people whose outdoor tourist attractions include hot springs, whitewater rafting, fly fishing and scenic mountain trails. Residents worry that the expansion, which would allow the mine to spread across 440 acres, would bring a surge of truck traffic, dust and noise — as well as the scarring on the mountain ridge that would become visible from the town. And they say the mine is already violating its permits.

The dispute also follows months of questions from House Democrats and Interior’s internal watchdog about whether the department is taking actions that benefit Bernhardt’s former employer, Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck.

“We’re acutely aware of Chad Brownstein and the relationship to David Bernhardt,” said Jeff Peterson, executive director of Glenwood Springs Citizens Alliance, a group formed to oppose the mine expansion. “It’s something unfortunately we can’t control. But there’s a real concern that this will get essentially rubber stamped and it doesn’t matter what it will do to our community.”

Glenwood Springs Mayor Jonathan Godes agreed.

“Our concern is that there is going to be one of the largest mines in Colorado directly abutting our city,” Godes said. “And when you have a former lobbyist for one of the largest legal lobbying firms in the extractive industry running DOI ... and Norm Brownstein the father of the CEO of Rocky Mountain Resources, it doesn't take a huge leap of faith to say something ain’t right here.”

Just the sheer lobbying firepower Rocky Mountain Resources is bringing to the project may be enough to pressure Interior employees, said Daniel Stevens, executive director at the watchdog group Campaign for Accountability.

Brownstein Hyatt “has a lot of pull, and when it asks Interior to jump, Interior jumps,” Daniels said. “Does every other small firm applying for a mining permit run to the top lobbying firm in the country to work on their behalf? Seems a little disproportionate here.”

RMR defended its corporate track record and its project, but the company and its executives did not respond to detailed questions about its lobbying efforts and ties to Bernhardt. Jon Hrobsky, one of the Brownstein lobbyists working on behalf of RMR, has known Bernhardt since they were both staffers for former Republican Colorado Rep. Scott McInnis and worked with him at Interior during the George W. Bush administration. Hrobsky and another Brownstein lobbyist, Luke Johnson, have both met with Interior officials to discuss ""natural resources"" on behalf of the company, according to the disclosure forms.

The Brownstein firm registered as lobbying for RMR as of April 30, according to its disclosure form. But two of its employees, Michael Stratton and Christine Jochim, have been assisting RMR since at least February, according to emails POLITICO received via public information requests. On April 5, Stratton sent a message to Glenwood Springs City Manager Debra Figueroa saying he was “hoping to make progress on behalf of RMR relative to making a presentation about their quarry proposal,” according to one of the emails.

Stratton and Jochim provided legal work for RMR but did not lobby before April 30, a Brownstein spokesperson said.



When asked if Bernhardt had recused himself from the matter, an Interior spokesperson referred to his ethics pledge.

Bernhardt also has personal ties to the area: He grew up in Rifle, Colo., about a half-an-hour drive from Glenwood Springs.

The mine has been in operation since 1982. Glenwood Springs residents who have spoken up at county board meetings overwhelmingly opposed the expansion and said the noise, traffic and sheer size of the project would all but destroy their tourism-based economy.

Garfield County inspectors earlier this year found a range of violations at the mine: It has spread outside its currently permitted acreage, is selling products it wasn’t permitted to and is operating during months it had promised the county it would shut down, the inspectors wrote in a report.

In interviews, residents said the BLM’s office has refused to respond to their complaints, forcing them to turn to the agency’s D.C. headquarters. But the bureau has allowed the mine to keep operating despite its violations.

“We issued a letter [to BLM] saying we don’t think RMR is compliance,” Peterson said. “We’ve heard absolutely nothing from the BLM. It’s been crickets on that front.”

RMR, a holding company based in Beverly Hills, Calif., acquired the Mid-Continent mine in October 2016. CEO Chad Brownstein's father is Norm Brownstein, who founded and still chairs Brownstein Hyatt, where Bernhardt spent most of his professional life.

The fight between the company and the community reached a new level of antipathy in May, when RMR sued the county board and its members. The lawsuit contends that the county agreement the board is trying to enforce should take a back seat to the company’s permit from BLM.

Records indicate that board members have reached out to Bernhardt directly: They called him on Sept. 17 and met with him in his D.C. office on March 5, according to Bernhardt’s official schedules. Neither of those conversations involved the Mid-Continent mine issue, according to an Interior spokesperson and others who attended the meeting, although an initial meeting request form said the commissioners had asked to speak to Bernhardt about topics including BLM.

The board members are unable to speak about the matter, a county spokesperson said after POLITICO tried to ask them questions about the mining permit. But a month after meeting with Bernhardt, the board heard county inspectors list the mine’s violations and gave Rocky Mountain Resources until June 1 to comply.

Bernhardt has already come under fire for making policy decisions that could benefit Brownstein clients. Interior’s inspector general is reviewing Bernhardt’s role in blocking a department report analyzing how a controversial pesticide affected federally protected wildlife, and examining whether he improperly pushed to remove a species of small fish from the endangered species list to benefit a former client.

The House Committee On Oversight and Reform and the National Archives and Records Administration are also probing whether Bernhardt is suppressing the release of his meeting schedules.

Craig Holman, a lobbyist at the government watchdog group Public Citizen, said Bernhardt should allay these concerns by continuing to recuse himself from matters involving his former firm even after his ethics pledge ends in two months.

“Unfortunately, as we have seen over and over again with Bernhardt, the conflicts of interest are so widespread that they keep popping up and Bernhardt seems unable to divorce himself effectively from his former clients and employers,” Holman said.

The Brownstein firm has been actively working on the ground in Colorado to promote the project. Stratton, one of the Brownstein lobbyists, has advised Chad Brownstein on the mine since RMR acquired it in 2016, an RMR spokesperson said. He attended at least one Monday night county board hearing and has met with city officials seeking to persuade them that expanding the mine is in the community’s interests, according to interviews and documents obtained by POLITICO.



“Mike Stratton has advised Chad Brownstein for over two decades on corporate matters,” the spokesperson said. “Mike and Chad have equal to that a close personal friendship since Chad was 21.”

He has also participated in meetings and conference calls in which BLM discussed the limestone mine with RMR, said David Boyd, a spokesperson for the bureaus Northwest Colorado District. Boyd said he was “not aware” whether Chad Brownstein was involved in any of the discussions.

Stratton also represents the American Petroleum Association, the country's largest petroleum trade association.



The other Brownstein lawyer, Jochim, has worked on the mine proposal since at least February, according to emails POLITICO obtained. Jochim, a former Nuclear Regulatory Commission attorney and former Justice Department law clerk, requested in April that the city hand over all communications pertaining to the mine, according to documents POLITICO obtained through Colorado public record access laws.

Stratton declined to answer questions, saying he was not the company spokesperson. Jochim did not respond to questions.





A Rocky Mountain Resources spokesperson did not answer questions about whether Chad Brownstein or anyone in his father’s lobbying firm has discussed the project with either Bernhardt or other senior Interior staff. Company executives declined requests for an interview.

Residents and city officials said they don’t recall having any complaints about the mine before RMR bought it. The site has become the focus of numerous complaints since the new owner took over, however.



The mine’s operations have crept well outside the 16 acres originally stipulated in its county agreement and BLM permit, according to a March memo by Garfield County inspectors. Inspectors also found that RMR had not been paying royalties to the bureau for all the materials it had been extracting and selling from the mine.

Residents also complained that RMR was operating the mine year-round, violating its agreement with the county to shut operations every December to April to minimize harm to wildlife.

David McConaughy, a Glenwood Springs attorney representing the company, told the county board at its April public meeting that BLM has approved RMR’s requests for exemptions to the seasonal shutdowns since 2016. But neither BLM nor the company alerted the county at the time, board members responded.

""We’re trying to be transparent with the county ... to reconcile conflicts in the various permits,” McConaughy said at the hearing.

McConaughy declined to speak to POLITICO, referring questions to RMR.

BLM returned Rocky Mountain Resources’ March expansion proposal to the company within the required 30-day review period, saying the plan didn’t contain enough information. The local BLM office is “currently determining how to address the existing mining operations as well as any future proposal,” the bureau’s Boyd said.

“As would typically be the case for controversial topics in a field office, the BLM Washington Office and DOI have been briefed on the potential expansion proposal for the Mid-Continent Quarry,” Boyd added.

A Rocky Mountain Resources spokesperson defended the company’s record, saying the violations of the county agreement stemmed from problems inherited from the previous owner. The company also said the expansion would diversify the economy of a town that depends on tourists arriving to hike and ski the nearby mountains.

“Currently, many Glenwood Springs’ employers are unable or unwilling to provide their employees adequate wages to afford the town’s high cost of living, including affordable housing for teachers and developing professionals,” the company said in a statement to POLITICO. “RMR believes a community should embrace opportunities to improve the lives of its constituents, not just those who can afford to influence local politics.”

Residents who spoke to POLITICO said RMR’s economic arguments ring hollow.

Besides expanding the mining pit area, RMR also proposed increasing truck traffic from around 20 round trips a day to as many as 450, according to a proposal it submitted to the BLM in March. The dramatic increase in traffic — plus the sight of the expanded mine in the hills above the town — would all but cripple Glenwood Springs’ tourist economy, said former Mayor Michael Gamba, a Republican civil engineer.

“We had lived harmoniously with that mine for the past 20-plus years,” Gamba said in an interview. “Had nothing changed, we would have had no objections to them having it. But the proposed expansion is an existential threat to our community.”"

“Mr. Dean has made a cottage industry out of accusing presidents of acting like Richard Nixon,” Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., said.

Dean, the ex-White House counsel in President Richard Nixon's administration, was convicted of obstruction of justice after striking a deal to cooperate with the Watergate investigation. He has spent decades critical of the GOP and wrote a book in 2004 accusing President George H.W. Bush of acts “worse than Watergate.”

He frequently appears on CNN as a paid contributor, in which he's usually criticizing Trump.

Democrats invited him to serve as their lead witness in a hearing meant to scrutinize the special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into alleged Russian collusion with the 2016 Trump campaign.

But Republicans ridiculed his appearance.

“You are functionally here as a prop because they can’t impeach the president,” Gaetz said, referring to the public polling against impeachment and resistance from Speaker Nancy Pelosi to allow an impeachment inquiry.

Dean declined to tell Gaetz how much money he has earned through his GOP criticisms in books and on television. Dean said he didn’t know.

“It’s not by choice I’ve done a lot of this,” Dean said. “I’ve been dragged into this.”

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., and other Democrats praised Dean as a key figure in helping the Watergate prosecutors and whose testimony was deemed truthful.

And Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., recalled his father, left-wing social critic Marcus Raskin, being placed on Nixon’s enemies list. Rep. Raskin on Monday called Dean “a man of honor, a man of integrity, and a man who stands up to the truth.”

But Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., pointed out 19 discrepancies were discovered in Dean’s statements back during the Watergate investigation.

Democrats called on Dean to use his Watergate past to assess Trump’s actions to obstruct the Mueller investigation.

Nadler introduced Dean without mentioning either his criminal conviction or that his law license was revoked.

“He is most well known as a principal witness during the Senate Watergate hearing,” Nadler said. “Where his testimony was later fully corroborated as to its truthfulness by the revelations in President Nixon’s White House tapes.”

Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, read through a litany of negative comments Dean has made about Trump, including one in which he describes discussing Trump’s impeachment with Pelosi, D-Calif.

Biggs called Dean a convicted felon offering “conjecture and legal posturing,” offering dubious testimony.

“You are not the fall guy in the Watergate scandal,” Biggs told Dean. “The FBI referred to you as the master manipulator of the cover-up. The U.S. attorney’s office said you were at the center of the criminality.”

Biggs called the hearing a farce.

“So much of what you say seems very difficult to accept at face value quite frankly,” Biggs said."

(Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images)

John V. Kelly, the acting inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security, announced his retirement Monday following revelations that he directed his staff to whitewash audits of the agency’s performance after federal disasters.

Kelly, 64, a career auditor who rose to the top job in 2017, announced his retirement in a brief email Monday morning to hundreds of DHS employees and contractors.

“It has been an honor and privilege to serve the American citizens for over 40 years,” he wrote. “However, it is time for me to retire.”

Kelly, who had planned to retire after the confirmation of President Trump’s nominee for the position, wrote in an email to The Washington Post that he “accelerated my retirement because I feel it’s in the best interest of the organization and its employees.”

“As I told the staff, I have truly enjoyed my 11-year tenure with the DHS OIG, an organization with a very important mission and extraordinary staff and managers that successfully execute that mission on a daily basis,” Kelly wrote. “Nobody in DHS leadership or any member of Congress asked me retire.”

Kelly’s announcement follows The Post’s report last week that an internal review found that Kelly overrode auditors who had found problems with the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s response to various disasters.

When teams of auditors flew to local communities to assess how well FEMA was helping residents recover, Kelly — then in charge of the emergency management auditing staff — directed them to ignore most problems, according to the internal review and interviews. Instead, he told them to produce what the staff dubbed “feel-good reports.”

[How the DHS watchdog whitewashed audits of FEMA’s disaster response]

The practice was repeated over five years after hurricanes, floods, wildfires and other disasters, including Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and catastrophic flooding in Louisiana in 2016, the review found.

Under pressure from House Republicans, the inspector general’s office retracted 13 faulty reports and purged them from its website in 2017 and 2018. Officials acknowledged they did not comply with federal auditing standards.

The inspector general’s office then spent 14 months examining what occurred. Kelly was recused from the review.

Investigators found that Kelly had praised FEMA’s work ethic to his auditors, telling them they would see “FEMA at her best” and instructing supervisors to emphasize what the agency had done right in its disaster response

Kelly joined the inspector general’s office in 2008 from the Government Accountability Office, where his long career covered performance and financial audits and program evaluations at numerous federal agencies.

A graduate of the University of Scranton, he quickly rose through the ranks in the DHS inspector general’s office, which provides independent, fact-driven audits and investigations of the performance of the sprawling agency.

The flawed audits on his watch represented a tiny fraction of the watchdog’s oversight of FEMA. The internal review did not find that Kelly was influenced by a personal relationship with anyone at the emergency response agency.

However, Jennifer Costello, the deputy inspector general, told the head of the internal review team that the “retraction of publicly issued reports because they are not reliable” was “not an insignificant matter.”

The reports, Costello wrote, “represent millions of wasted taxpayer dollars and understandably cast doubt on our credibility.” She said the inspector general’s office needs to hold itself to “the same standards to which we hold the Department when conducting oversight of its programs and operation.”

When the internal review was made public on May 23, Kelly sent his staff an email of apology, writing, “I take responsibility for failing to set a tone that all of our products need to be fully objective.”

The office has agreed to an outside review of its performance by another federal inspector general’s office to ensure that it has improved its overall operations and oversight of FEMA.

Trump this spring nominated Joseph V. Cuffari, a policy adviser to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R), to lead the office. His nomination has not yet been voted on by the Senate.

Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, said that the situation underscored the need for Cuffari to be promptly confirmed. “Ensuring a department has an independent inspector general is vital to maintaining transparency and holding government agencies accountable,” Johnson said in a statement."
House Intelligence panel requests documents after reports WH blocked climate change testimony,https://www.cnn.com,['Eli Watkins'],06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/11/politics/house-intelligence-state-department-climate-change/index.html,"Washington (CNN) House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff has requested documents from a State Department agency on the heels of reports that the White House blocked an official from submitting testimony on climate change.

Schiff, a California Democrat, said in a letter dated Tuesday to Ellen McCarthy, the assistant secretary for the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, that his committee was left with ""deep concern"" that the Trump administration recently sought to bar the submission of written testimony from Rod Schoonover ""for political reasons."" Schoonover, an analyst with the State Department agency, testified before the House panel last week.

The Washington Post, citing several administration sources, reported that officials from several different White House offices took issue with Schoonover's prepared testimony in which he was going to warn Congress about wide-ranging and ""possibly catastrophic"" national security concerns as a result of human-caused climate change.

In his letter, Schiff said the administration ""repeatedly confirmed"" ahead of the June 5 hearing that Schoonover would submit written testimony, but that the evening before the hearing, the State Department informed the committee ""without explanation"" that the agency would not submit a written statement.

He said the House Intelligence Committee, ""in light of these reports of undue White House interference in testimony before the Committee,"" now requests testimony from McCarthy or ""an appropriate senior representative"" to address: Schoonover's testimony; communications with the White House about that written testimony; the prepared written testimony itself; and other documents relevant to the hearing and blocked testimony.

Veteran 'literally body-slammed' by VA police: Lawmakers grill VA on use of force,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Donovan Slack', 'Published P.M. Et June']",06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/06/11/veterans-affairs-officials-grilled-va-police-vet-injuries-death/1425552001/,"CLOSE A USA TODAY investigation into VA Medical Centers shows that veterans are enduring longer emergency room wait times than those at non-VA facilities. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – One described a Veterans Affairs police officer throwing a New York veteran seeking therapy to the ground. Another said a California veteran died after receiving similar treatment at the hands of VA police there. A third noted that a VA officer training to be an instructor at the national VA police academy threatened employees with a gun at a Massachusetts car dealership.

The underlying question from lawmakers to VA officials Tuesday: What is going on with VA police?

“I mean really what are they doing over there?” asked Rep. Gilbert Cisneros, Jr, D-Calif., who questioned training in particular. “Why are we having these situations where individuals are being injured or hurt or killed?”

An investigation of the VA police force by the agency’s inspector general concluded in December that systemic management failures had resulted in short-staffing and millions in overtime charged to taxpayers, as well as missed opportunities to ensure staff and veteran patients were protected.

USA TODAY reported in December on a case in Missouri where a veteran died after being tackled and detained by VA police in Kansas City.

Senior VA executives told lawmakers at the hearing Tuesday that the agency has hired a new security manager and appointed police supervisors in every VA region to improve management. They said officer training has been extended in recent years and includes a focus on de-escalating situations rather than confrontation.

“It’s really troubling, it’s hard for me to sit here and answer questions after hearing the stories that you’re talking about, and certainly anytime anything like this occurs, we have to go back and question whether or not the things that we are doing are being effective,” said Renee Oshinski, acting deputy under secretary for health for operations and management.

Kevin Hanretta, the principal deputy assistant secretary for operations, security and preparedness, said the incidents in New York and California described by lawmakers are “very unfortunate.” But he said they are not representative of “the VA police in the field serving our nation’s veterans.” Hanretta said the job offer for the instructor-trainee at the academy, since rescinded, is under investigation.

The VA employs nearly 4,000 officers at 139 medical centers who play a critical role in securing property, preventing and investigating crimes and often intervening to help patients or staff during potentially dangerous incidents.

'Literally body-slammed'

Rep. Kathleen Rice, D-N.Y., said Tuesday that mission went awry when one of her constituents went last June to the VA in Northport, N.Y. Jean Telefort, a veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder, was seeking therapy after spinal surgery.

She said the VA had allowed him to see a non-VA therapist after the procedure, but then cut that off and sent him to a VA facility instead. That facility, however, didn’t offer therapy. So the VA sent him to the VA in Northport. When he became frustrated, a scheduling clerk there called VA police.

“He was literally body slammed onto the ground, with his arms twisted behind his back,” Rice said. “This is someone who was post spinal surgery – he informed them of that, ‘I can’t breathe, I just had spinal surgery.’”

But VA officers kept him on the ground, and refused to take his handcuffs off, even after a physical therapist who had treated him before said Telefort was not a danger.

Rice said he later received summonses to appear in federal court for charges that have since been deferred. She said a VA employee later accessed his medical records and entered false information.

“This incident keeps going on and on and on,” Rice said. “The questions that I have are many.”

The director of the VA’s office of security and law enforcement, Frederick Jackson, said an investigation after the incident, which included statements from witnesses, concluded the VA officers acted appropriately.

Veterans die after VA police run-ins

In Loma Linda, California, a 65-year-old veteran became frustrated after waiting four hours for a procedure in 2011. He tried to leave and go to a VA in Long Beach instead, but VA officers wouldn’t let him.

“They pretty much took him, slammed him to the ground, hit his head and he ended up dying,” Cisneros said.

The family won a $500,000 settlement from the VA in 2015, according to the lawyer who filed the case, although the agency maintained he had died from an unrelated stroke.

Family members of the veteran who died in Kansas City after an altercation with VA police also have filed suit. USA TODAY reported in December that a veteran tackled by VA officers outside the VA medical center was found by emergency medical workers to be “non-verbal, moaning with a decreased level of consciousness,” according to internal documents.

They said he had a gash in his scalp and “multiple” cuts and bruises on his face. A CT scan of his head showed areas of bleeding around his brain. The veteran, identified as Dale Farhner in the lawsuit, died soon afterward.

In response to inquiries from USA TODAY at the time, VA spokesman Curt Cashour said the incident was under investigation.

An instructor trainee

In January, a VA police employee who had recently won a post as an instructor trainee at the national VA police academy stumbled into a car dealership in Massachusetts, flashed a gun and demanded gas for his car, The Boston Globe reported.

Police arrested him and put him in a cell, where he stuffed the toilet with paper and banged his head against the door. He had previously been dismissed from the Massachusetts State Police, faced allegations of sexual harassment and, in 2017, had his permit to carry a weapon revoked.

“Can you just help me understand how that would happen – how this man of all people would be sent to the elite VA police academy?” Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., asked VA officials Tuesday.

Hanretta, the deputy assistant secretary overseeing security, said the VA immediately launched an investigation and the academy job offer was rescinded.

“In this particular case, at the time of his selection, we were not aware of all of the background circumstances,” he said.

Jackson, the director of law enforcement noted that while he did “go down to the law enforcement training center, he was never an instructor” because he hadn’t completed training yet.

“I have no idea why this man would wear the uniform period,” Moulton said.

DOJ supports lawsuit demanding religious tuition payments,https://www.foxnews.com,[],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/doj-supports-lawsuit-demanding-religious-tuition-payments,"The U.S. Department of Justice is backing three families who are suing to force the state of Maine to pay tuition for some students to attend religious high schools.

The ""Statement of Interest"" filed Monday supports a lawsuit that targets the state's longstanding tuition policy for students in districts that don't have a high school. In those cases, the state will pay for tuition to a private school, but not a religious school.

Over the years, state and federal courts have consistently upheld the Maine's exclusion of religious-backed private schools from the tuition program.

But the Department of Justice contends that the state has failed to justify its ""discrimination"" against religious schools, citing a U.S. Supreme Court decision in a case in which the Missouri Department of Natural Resources denied a grant to a church-affiliated preschool.

The DOJ filing reflects how the U.S. Supreme Court ""seems to be leaning our way on this issue,"" said Steven Whiting, an attorney who filed a friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of an Orthodox Jewish organization.

""The law has changed over time and now it's time for the court to look at this thing as a constitutional right. School choice shouldn't depend on whether you're religious or not,"" he said.

But Zachary Heiden from the ACLU of Maine said he didn't see many similarities with the Supreme Court case that dealt with state grants for a playground surface made from recycled rubber tires in Missouri.

""This is a case about whether the state is going to be required to fund religious school education, which I think is very different than shredded rubber tires,"" he said Tuesday.

Maine Assistant Attorney General Sarah Forster and Christopher Taub wrote that the U.S. Supreme Court ruling was intended to be interpreted narrowly, and that Maine's tuition system ""is fully constitutional.""

Three families in Glenburn and Palermo are suing in U.S. District Court to force the state to pay for their kids to attend Bangor Christian Schools and Temple Academy.

The lawsuit contends that denying religious schools, while allowing tuition payments for other private schools, violates the families' constitutional rights.

Maine's attorney general advised in 1980 that it's unconstitutional to use public funds to send students to schools ""characterized by a pervasively religious atmosphere."" Lawmakers enacted legislation in 1982 to prevent religious schools from receiving such tuition payments.

The U.S. Department of Justice has filed several similar actions around the country following an executive order promoting ""Free Speech and Religious Liberty"" by President Donald Trump. Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions followed up with guidance for federal agencies in October 2017.

Last month, DOJ weighed in with support of students who are suing Vermont. The lawsuit targets the state's refusal to pay college tuition under a dual enrollment program for students attending religious high schools. The program helps students at public or secular private schools obtain college credits while attending high school.

“We will work with this group of employees just as we work with all USDA employees,” Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement Tuesday. (Erik S. Lesser/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock) (Erik S Lesser/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)

For the second time this year, workers at a science division of the Agriculture Department voted overwhelmingly to unionize in apparent revolt against the administration’s plan to relocate them from Washington, D.C., to a yet-to-be-announced location.

On Tuesday, employees at the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which distributes $400 million in competitive grants to researchers around the country each year, voted 137 to 2 to be represented by the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employees union. In May, the Economic Research Service, a federal statistical agency also included in the relocation, voted 138 to 4 to unionize with AFGE.

“We will work with this group of employees just as we work with all USDA employees,” Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement distributed to reporters before the votes were counted. In August, Perdue announced the relocation as a cost-saving measure that would move scientists closer to those they serve, a claim critics dispute.

In early May, USDA announced that Kansas City, the Research Triangle in North Carolina and the state of Indiana had been selected as the leading candidates for relocation sites. The department has not said when it would make a final decision. “I truly believe that the relocation of ERS and NIFA will help to fulfill USDA’s commitment to be the most effective, most efficient and most customer-focused agency in the federal government,” Perdue said in the statement.

But former USDA officials and leaders in the agricultural community argue the relocation will paralyze the agencies, and have also warned that this proposal is an attempt to weaken the influence of scientists under the Trump administration.

Members of Congress were divided largely along partisan lines. At an Agriculture Committee hearing last week, Rep. Neal Dunn (R-Fla.) said the secretary “has broad support to move forward with this decision.” But Democrats in both chambers have introduced legislation to block the move, and they dispute whether the secretary has the authority to relocate the offices without congressional approval.

Peter Winch, a union organizer for AFGE, said that the newly formed union would ask the department to allow employees to visit the proposed relocation site and to give them more than 30 days to respond to reassignment letters.

The unionization vote comes as the Trump administration has taken a confrontational approach toward federal employees and their unions with executive orders, new policies creating a faster path to firing and tough stances at the bargaining table.

At a rally on Tuesday morning, about a dozen NIFA and ERS employees waved American flags and handed out pro-union stickers. Unionization would “delay changes to working conditions” and offer “protection from political interference,” according to the fliers they distributed. Those who spoke to The Washington Post did so on the condition of anonymity because they said they feared professional repercussions. Many employees are applying for new jobs in the District, and few said that they would consider relocating.

A senior NIFA employee said that the push to unionize “would never have happened without the secretary of agriculture.” Another lamented the absence of a USDA chief scientist, who in previous administrations had been the voice of scientists in the department.

A third employee said the workload — the number of grant awards to be processed — has quadrupled due to high attrition and the lasting effects of the federal government shutdown this winter. NIFA’s $1.7 billion budget supports cutting-edge research as well as rural communities and programs like 4-H. “The mission still has to be done,” the person said, but the “morale is not great.”

Inside the NIFA office building, workers waited for up to an hour to vote. Three-quarters of NIFA employees eligible to cast a ballot did so. About 30 people watched as an official from the Federal Labor Relations Authority counted the votes. NIFA employees cheered when the final tally was announced.

“Waiting for the department to give us a voice was not going to happen,” the senior NIFA employee said. The relocation process, which has “generated considerable frustration,” the person said, “provided a lot of motivation for employees to form a union in order to have a voice.”

The administration has argued that its pro-management policies are an effort to make government and its employees more efficient and able to serve the public. But the actions have created anxiety in federal offices and resulted in court challenges.

Last year, a federal judge shot down the bulk of three White House executive orders that were designed to bring a pro-management atmosphere to federal offices.

Among the toughest provisions was a drastic cut to what is known as official time, legally mandated spans that union officials spend on the clock representing their members in grievances and other disputes. The executive orders also sought to make it easier for managers to fire poor performers.

The judge’s ruling is on appeal, and a decision is expected in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, the administration has worked around the constraints of the court ruling at the bargaining table.

State Dept. pushes back on Friedman comments about Israel's 'right' to annex West Bank,https://www.cnn.com,"['Nicole Gaouette', 'Jennifer Hansler']",06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/11/politics/david-friedman-us-israel-west-bank/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The State Department pushed back on comments by the US ambassador to Israel suggesting that Israel has a right to annex part of the West Bank.

State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said the administration's position on the West Bank has not changed, despite Ambassador David Friedman's comments to The New York Times that ""Israel has the right to retain some, but unlikely all, of the West Bank.""

Speaking to reporters Monday, Ortagus said that ""the administration's position on the settlements has not changed. Our policy on the West Bank has not changed.""

Asked what the US position on settlement activity is, a State Department official cited President Donald Trump, saying that ""as the President has said, while the existence of settlements is not in itself an impediment to peace, further unrestrained settlement activity doesn't help advance peace.""

International law

Israeli settlement activity in the Palestinian territories is illegal under international law, though Israel has always sought to dispute this. The State Department official said they had nothing further to add when asked if the US considers Israeli settlement construction to be illegal.

Ortagus on Monday said there was no plan for any sort of disciplinary action against Friedman.

""The ambassador, the secretary and everyone who is involved in the Middle East peace plan, in this entire administration, is working towards a comprehensive and lasting peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians,"" she continued.

The State Department has been a junior partner in the administration's efforts to forge a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That initiative has been led out of the White House by Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, along with Friedman and a former lawyer for the Trump organization, Jason Greenblatt.

'A significant change'

The trio has been promoting the economic aspects of their plan, saying they want to improve Palestinian quality of life, but downplaying the prospect of finding a political solution and playing down the long-standing formula of a two-state solution with both sides having a capital in Jerusalem.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu raised the prospect of annexing some parts of the West Bank in the final days of the recent election campaign in an effort to rally conservative voters. Asked if that move might hurt the chances of peace, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Jake Tapper in April, ""I think that the vision that we'll lay out is going to represent a significant change from the model that's been used.""

Aaron David Miller, a vice president at the Wilson Center and a CNN contributor, said that in previous administrations, Israeli settlement policy was ""on the radar screen"" as an issue.

Not on the radar

""It is now not on the radar screen and there is what I would describe as a willful acquiescence to the settlement enterprise,"" Miller said. ""When no one challenges statements about annexation, including the secretary of state ... you can't help reach the conclusion that this is a fundamental reorientation in policy to basically undermine the traditional US approach"" of a two-state solution and ""some reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians.""

Other analysts raised the security implications of annexation.

The Israeli Policy Forum, a group that advocates for a two-state solution, said while Friedman's annexation remarks ""are not surprising, given his long publicized pro-settlement and anti-two-state outlook, they are disturbing nonetheless."" The Israeli security establishment, most major American Jewish organizations and pro-Israel members of Congress support the idea of two states, the forum said.

Annexation would be ""deeply harmful to Israel's long-term future as a Jewish, democratic, and secure state,"" the forum said in a statement, adding that it would create an uncertain security and diplomatic environment for Israel, risk the collapse of the Palestinian Authority and ""be a disaster for Israelis and Palestinians."""

Just One Tiny Industry May Emit More Methane Than EPA Had Estimated for All of Them,https://earther.gizmodo.com,"['Yessenia Funes', 'About The Author', 'I Mostly Write About How Environmental Policy', 'Climate Change Intersect With Race', 'Class Though I Occasionally Write About Animals', 'Science', 'Art', 'Too.

People tend to equate methane with cow farts (though their burps are worse), but we may be pointing our fingers in all the wrong places, according to a new study. The production of ammonia for fertilizer may result in up to 100 times more emissions than has been previously estimated for this sector. And that alone is more than what the Environmental Protection Agency estimates all industries emit across the U.S.

The study, published May 28 in the journal Elementa, zooms into the ammonia fertilizer industry because it relies heavily on natural gas to run its production plants. Ammonia is a compound made of nitrogen, which is used across the agriculture sector to fuel the growth of crops. While the ammonia fertilizer industry’s emissions of carbon dioxide are better understood, emissions of methane—which has 25 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide over a century—were a huge question mark. Until now.

The team of authors from Cornell University and the Environmental Defense Fund had two sampling adventures in June 2015 and September 2016 that took them to six ammonia fertilizer plants in the Midwest, including Oklahoma, Kansas, and Iowa. They used their findings to estimate industry-wide emissions throughout the U.S. The team found that the fertilizer industry results in 29 gigagrams of methane emissions a year. The EPA, however, reports this industry emitted only 0.2 gigagrams of methane a year between 2015 and 2016. As for all industries (like waste, chemical, and metals production), the EPA estimates 8 gigagrams, which is still much smaller than this single industry’s.

A worst case scenario—where other plants are consuming more natural gas than the ones analyzed—resulted in methane emissions that reached 139 gigagrams a year. For context, that’s equivalent to the carbon emissions from 669,314 passenger vehicles driven in a year. Or more than the carbon emitted from 3 billion pounds of coal burned. Best case scenario, the emissions are just 2 gigagrams of methane a year, which is still a lot more than what the EPA currently estimates for this industry.

That is pretty wild, but this is an estimate based only on six plants. They make up more than 25 percent of the 23 plants operating in 2016 and are also of varying sizes to represent the different facilities throughout the U.S., so the six are a pretty good sample. But the authors would like to examine more plants to be sure.

The researchers drove downwind from the facilities in a Google Street View car decked out with a killer methane analyzer that recorded the methane levels in the air. That way, the team was able to capture the methane emissions near the facility in the areas where wind was likely to push it. This poses some limitations, though, because not every plant had the best road access. The authors recommend looking at airborne measurements next time, too. The team looked at samples over just a few days in a single month over these two years. Capturing a longer timeline of data could further verify (or disprove!) their analysis.

Methane emissions feel especially relevant these days. The Trump administration has been attempting to roll back methane regulations since President Awful took office. (The Department of Energy actually called natural gas “freedom gas” the other day.) A coalition of states and environmental groups like the Sierra Club pressed a judge Friday to stop Trump from rolling back these protections, reports E&E News.

Methane isn’t just dangerous for our planet because it’s worsening climate change; its emissions are often coupled with particulate matter and other air pollutants that pose threats to the health of communities closest to the facilities where it’s being emitted.

USDA Cuts Projections for Corn Production to Four-Year Low After Wet Planting Season,https://www.wsj.com,['Kirk Maltais'],,,,https://www.wsj.com/articles/usda-cuts-projections-for-corn-production-to-four-year-low-after-wet-planting-season-11560278067,"A key monthly report by the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed Tuesday the damage done by heavy rainfall in the Corn Belt, reducing expected corn production to its lowest in four years.

The wet weather this year prevented farmers from planting the crop on time, and the Agriculture Department cut its corn-production estimate to 13.68 billion bushels, down 9% from its May forecast.

DOJ investigating 'non-governmental organizations and individuals' as part of 'broad' probe into surveillance abuses,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/durham-investigating-non-governmental-organizations-and-individuals-potentially-including-fusion-gps,"As part of its ongoing ""multifaceted"" and ""broad"" review into potential misconduct by U.S. intelligence agencies during the 2016 presidential campaign, the Justice Department revealed Monday it is also investigating the activities of several ""non-governmental organizations and individuals.""

Additionally, the DOJ announced that the probe, let by Connecticut U.S. Attorney John Durham, was looking into the involvement of ""foreign intelligence services."" Former Trump aide George Papadopoulos told Fox News last month that an informant who was likely ""CIA and affiliated with Turkish intel"" had posed as a Cambridge University research assistant in September 2016 and tried to ""seduce him"" to obtain information linking the Trump team to Russia.

The information was contained in a letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., who had inquired as to the scope of Durham's investigation. The letter could indicate that the DOJ is looking closely at work done during the campaign by Fusion GPS, the firm retained by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee (DNC) to conduct opposition research against the Trump campaign.

Fusion GPS, in turn, hired British ex-spy Christopher Steele to produce an unverified and largely discredited dossier that the FBI went on to cite in secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court applications to surveil former Trump aide Carter Page.

CARTER PAGE: FBI INFORMANT 'INTENSIFIED' COMMUNICATIONS JUST BEFORE FISA WARRANT OBTAINED

Last week, reports indicated Steele had agreed to talk with Durham if certain preconditions were met. Multiple sources familiar with the matter told Fox News, meanwhile, that Durham is “very dialed in” and “asking all the right questions."" Separately, sources within the Justice Department confirmed to Fox News that Barr has met “on multiple occasions in recent weeks” with Durham in Washington, D.C.

Numerous problems with the Steele dossier's reliability have surfaced, including several issues that were brought to the FBI's attention before it cited the dossier in its FISA application and subsequent renewals. Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report made plain, for example, that then-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen did not travel to Prague to conspire with Russian hackers seeking to access Democrat files, as the dossier alleged.

Mueller also was unable to substantiate the dossier's claims that Page had received a large payment relating to the sale of a share of Rosneft, a Russian oil giant.

FMR TRUMP AIDE ALLEGES BOMBSHELL INFORMANT TRIED TO 'SEDUCE' HIM IN 'BIZARRE' EPISODE FOR RUSSIA DIRT ON TRUMP

North Carolina GOP Rep. Mark Meadows told Fox News on Sunday he has seen ""additional documents"" that demonstrate that “prior to the first FISA application, Peter Strzok, Andy McCabe, and others at the FBI knew that Christopher Steele's dossier was not credible.” Internal FBI text messages obtained by Fox News in March showed FBI brass scrambling to respond to a concern from a senior DOJ official about the potential ""bias"" of a key FISA source.

Meadows, speaking to ""Fox News Sunday,"" pointed specifically to a report from The Hill's John Solomon, who found that Ukrainian businessman Konstantin Kilimnik, a key figure in Mueller's report, was actually a U.S. informant. In his report, Mueller linked Kilimnik to Russian intelligence, and did not mention Kilimnik's secretive ties to the U.S. in the report other court filings -- even as Mueller suggested former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's ties to Kilimnik were nefarious.

""The deeper the dive we take into the Mueller report, we're starting to find out some of the conclusions, and actually some of the facts they put forth in there, are a misrepresentation of what we actually know,"" Meadows said.

Meadows added that he expected DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigation into potential FBI and DOJ surveillance misconduct to come out later than June, when it was originally expected. Meadows said more information has come to light that might necessitate the delay.

Solomon, reporting for the Hill, also recently unearthed a documented conversation Steele had with a State Department contact -- which were relayed to the FBI -- in which Steele claimed the Russians were running a “technical/human operation run out of Moscow targeting the election"" and that ""payments to those recruited are made out of the Russian Consulate in Miami.""

There is no Russian consulate in Miami, a fact the State Department official, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec, emphasized in her notes. Additionally, Steele had suggested his client was ""keen"" to see his information come to light prior to Election Day. Kavalec forwarded her notes to the FBI and other government officials several days before the FISA warrant was issued for Page. Fox News has confirmed The Hill's reporting.

RUSSIAN-BORN UK ACADEMIC SAYS SHE'S BEING USED TO 'SMEAR' MICHAEL FLYNN

Further, in its original FISA application and subequent renewals, the FBI told the FISA court that it ""did not believe"" Steele was the direct source for a Yahoo News article implicating Page in Russian collusion. Instead, the FBI suggested to the court, the September 2016 article by Michael Isikoff was independent corroboration of the dossier.

But London court records show that contrary to the FBI's assessments, Steele briefed Yahoo News and other reporters in the fall of 2016 at the direction of Fusion GPS.

Carter Page has not been charged with any wrongdoing, even though the FBI called him an ""agent of a foreign power"" in its October 2016 FISA application. On Sunday, Page told Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that his actions had been ""completely spun in the fake Mueller"" report to help advance what he characterized as Democrats' ""ridiculous"" goal of impeachment.

Lawmakers try to save DHS lab that prepares first responders for terror threats,https://www.cnn.com,['Geneva Sands'],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/10/politics/dhs-lab-first-responders-funding-house/index.html,"(CNN) Lawmakers are again attempting to keep a Department of Homeland Security laboratory that specializes in first-responder technology and assistance from shutting its doors.

The House overwhelmingly passed a bill Monday evening that would permanently authorize the New York City-based National Urban Security Technology Laboratory, which has been at risk of losing funding over the past couple of years and was not included in the administration's latest DHS funding request.

The lab ""is constantly developing and testing new tools for our brave first responders to use in the event of a terrorist attack, industrial accident or natural disaster and closely collaborates with law enforcement agencies like the FDNY, NYPD and the Nassau County Police Department in my district,"" Rep. Kathleen Rice, a New York Democrat who cosponsored the bill, said Monday on the House floor, urging her colleagues to pass the legislation. The final vote was 395-3.

She said the administration has proposed closing the lab in each of the last two federal budgets.

The potential funding cut comes amid budget battles between the White House and Democrats on Capitol Hill, as the administration has shifted its funding and influence to the department's immigration missions.

U.S. refiner group sues Trump EPA over high-ethanol gasoline,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-ethanol-lawsuit/u-s-refiner-group-sues-trump-epa-over-high-ethanol-gasoline-idUSKCN1TB2HP,"FILE PHOTO: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sign is seen on the podium at EPA headquarters in Washington, U.S., July 11, 2018. REUTERS/Ting Shen

(Reuters) - The main U.S. refining industry association said on Monday it sued to block the Trump administration’s effort to expand sales of higher ethanol blends of gasoline, arguing the move exceeded the administration’s authority.

The legal challenge from the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) association escalated a battle between the oil and corn industries over the nation’s biofuel policy, which requires refiners to blend biofuels like corn-based ethanol into their gasoline, often at great expense.

President Donald Trump had directed the Environmental Protection Agency to lift a summertime ban on the sale of gasoline containing 15 percent ethanol, called E15, in an effort to help farmers suffering from the U.S. trade war with China. The EPA unveiled its rule doing so on May 31.

The summertime E15 ban had been implemented during the Obama administration to reduce smog emissions, but Trump’s EPA said E15’s impact on air quality was similar to that of E10, which could already be sold year-round.

The tension over the policy move reflects how Trump has struggled to please both Big Oil and Big Agriculture, two critical constituencies in the Republican president’s 2020 re-election bid.

AFPM asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to review the EPA’s rule, in papers filed on Monday, said Diana Cronan, a spokeswoman for the group.

AFPM has one month to provide the court with the outline of its case, she said."
'Dangerous Proposal': USDA Seeking to Replace Government Inspectors at Beef Slaughter Plants With Private Employees,https://www.ecowatch.com,"['Common Dreams', 'Madison Dapcevich', 'Climate Nexus', 'Deutsche Welle', 'Olivia Rosane']",06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.ecowatch.com/usda-inspectors-deregulation-2638771530.html,"By Julia Conley

In an apparent effort to boost profits for meat manufacturers despite potential harms to food safety, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is reportedly planning to privatize inspections of beef slaughter plants.

""This dangerous proposal could rid beef slaughter plants of most government inspectors,"" Food and Water Watch said in a statement.

The group released an application from beef, pork, and poultry manufacturer Tyson Foods, in which the company requested a waiver to allow Tyson employees to conduct more inspections at its beef plant in Holcolm, Kansas, instead of relying on USDA food safety inspectors.

Food and Water Watch reported Monday that the USDA is pursuing deregulation of the food inspection system that has been used for years at beef slaughterhouses. The information came from documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act.

BREAKING: We have obtained documents that confirm the USDA is seeking to privatize inspections of beef slaughterhouses. This dangerous proposal could rid beef slaughter plants of most government inspectors. https://t.co/jNospAvLYn pic.twitter.com/cbx4fo6lHy

The documents were uncovered after many recent denials by USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) that it plans to privatize inspections of mass-produced beef, Food and Water Watch stated.

Tyson's proposal comes 21 years after FSIS first launched a pilot program in more than two dozen poultry and pork plants in which government food safety inspectors were replaced by the manufacturers' own inspectors, allowing the companies to regulate themselves.

In 2013, the USDA's inspector general found that the agency ""did not critically assess whether the new inspection process had measurably improved food safety at each plant"" that produced pork.

The following year, FSIS expanded the program to the entire poultry industry. The agency will not conduct an assessment of the new system's effects on food safety until 2022.

""The previous attempts at privatized inspection have led to weaker food safety performance and are a ploy by the industry to increase line speeds,"" said Tony Corbo, a senior lobbyist with Food and Water Watch.

Despite a lack of evidence that the privatized food safety inspection system is making food safer — and CDC data showing that foodborne illnesses from foods including chicken have been on the rise since 2015 — FSIS is weakening standards in order to increase the speed with which meat is processed, allowing for greater manufacturing profits.

""The Tyson plant in Holcomb, Kansas is approved to operate at the current maximum line speed allowable"" said Corbo. ""FSIS management has had difficulty meeting its inspection staffing requirements in the past in western Kansas, which has contributed to beef slaughter plants not being able to maintain maximum line speeds. Tyson's solution seems to be to get rid of the government inspectors."""
State Department praises release of US resident from Iran,https://www.cnn.com,['Jennifer Hansler'],06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/11/politics/state-department-nizar-zakka/index.html,"(CNN) The US State Department on Tuesday praised the release of Nizar Zakka after nearly four years of detention in Iran, expressing ""hope"" that it could be ""a positive sign for American detainees"" in that country.

Zakka, a Lebanese citizen with permanent US residency, was released after being held in Tehran for ""espionage"" since 2015. The 52-year-old was arrested in September of that year ""while attending a conference on women and sustainable development,"" according to Iran's semi-official state news agency Tasnim. He was convicted on espionage charges and sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2016.

Zakka, speaking with Al Arabiya following his release, said he was ""subjected to all kinds of torture from the Iranians"" when he was first arrested. He told the news outlet that the torture became psychological.

""I can't describe it. It's very hard to describe,"" he said of his detention in Iran's Evin prison.

In a statement, a State Department spokesperson hailed Zakka's release as ""without a doubt a great day for Mr. Zakka, his family, and all those who have supported him during his unlawful imprisonment.""

Ed Markey: Customs data breach ‘raises serious concerns’,https://www.bostonherald.com,['Marie Szaniszlo'],06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.bostonherald.com/2019/06/11/u-s-sen-markey-dhs-data-breach-raises-serious-concerns/,"U.S. Sen. Edward Markey on Tuesday called on the Department of Homeland Security to halt its use of facial recognition technology after the U.S. Customs and Border Protection confirmed that a recent data breach exposed images of travelers and vehicles.

The department and CBP did not respond to inquiries about when, where and how the breach occurred, and whether they are taking steps to ensure that it does not happen again.

But in a statement Tuesday, Markey (D-Mass.) said the breach “raises serious concerns about the Department of Homeland Security’s ability to effectively safeguard the sensitive information it is collecting.

“It only underscores the urgent need for the Department of Homeland Security to pause its deployment of facial recognition technology until it has instituted enforceable rules prioritizing cyber security and protecting travelers’ privacy,” Markey said.

“Malicious actors’ thirst for information about U.S. identities is unquenchable, and DHS must keep pace with emerging threats,” he added. “It should starts (sic) with formalizing guidelines for exactly who has access to the data DHS collects, how long this data will be maintained, how that information will be safeguarded and how we can say no to this collection in the first place.”

In December 2017 and May 2018, Markey and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) called on DHS to halt the expansion of its biometric program until there were safeguards in place.

“The head of DHS promised this to both senators,” said Giselle Barry, a spokeswoman for Markey. ” … but they have gone back on that personal promise.”

Kade Crockford, director of the Technology for Liberty Program at the ACLU of Massachusetts, said the breach underscores the need for both federal and state moratoriums on government use of the technology.

“Once your face is leaked in a data breach like this, it can be weaponized against you for the rest of your life,” Crockford said. “Increasingly, consumer-facing technology companies and even banks are using face recognition as an identifier to unlock private information. If the attackers can mock up a fake image of you based on these leaked data, they can impersonate you and potentially break into your private accounts. If your password is hacked in a data breach, you can change it. But you can’t change your face.”"
"DOJ: Strawberry Farm to Pay Civil Penalties, Back Pay to Settle Claim of Discrimination Against U.S. Workers",https://www.cnsnews.com,['Craig Bannister'],06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnsnews.com/blog/craig-bannister/doj-strawberry-farm-pay-civil-penalties-back-pay-settle-claim-discrimination,"(Getty Images/Yawar Nazir)

A Florida strawberry farm has agreed to pay civil penalties and back pay to qualified U.S. workers to settle a claim it discriminated against American workers by employing temporary visa workers, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced Tuesday.

The settlement is the seventh achieved through its “Protecting U.S. Workers Initiative,” DOJ explains in a press release detailing the agreement:

“The Department of Justice today announced that it has reached a settlement agreement with Sam Williamson Farms Inc. (SWF), a strawberry farm in Dover, Florida. The settlement resolves the Department’s investigation into whether SWF violated the anti-discrimination provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) by preferring to hire H-2A visa holders to harvest its strawberry crop instead of U.S. workers. This is the seventh settlement under the Civil Rights Division’s Protecting U.S. Workers Initiative, which is aimed at targeting, investigating, and taking enforcement actions against companies that discriminate against U.S. workers in favor of temporary visa workers.

“The Department of Justice’s independent investigation concluded that at the end of the 2016-2017 strawberry picking season, SWF informed its existing U.S. workers that it would rely instead on H-2A workers from a farm labor contractor to harvest its strawberries for the next season, and retained a farm labor contractor for the express purpose of obtaining workers with H-2A visas. Ultimately, the strawberry picking positions were filled by more than 300 H-2A workers and no U.S. workers.

“Refusing to recruit or hire available and qualified U.S. workers because of their citizenship status violates the INA.”

Under the settlement, the strawberry farm agrees to:"
WASDE: Corn Production Trimmed by 1.4 Billion Bushels,https://www.agweb.com,[],,,,https://www.agweb.com/article/wasde-corn-production-trimmed-by-14-billion-bushels/,"WASDE - 589

WHEAT: U.S. 2019/20 wheat supplies are down with lower beginning stocks partly offset by slightly higher production. Beginning stocks are down 25 million bushels on increased 2018/19 exports. Winter wheat production is forecast up 6 million bushels to 1,274 million with an increase to Hard Red Winter more than offsetting decreases for Soft Red Winter and White Winter. Total wheat production is now forecast at 1,903 million bushels, up 5.8 million bushels from the May forecast. Exports for 2019/20 are unchanged at 900 million bushels but feed and residual use is raised 50 million bushels to 140 million on reduced projected corn supplies. Ending stocks are lowered 69 million bushels to 1,072 million, and the season-average farm price is raised $0.40 per bushel to $5.10. The price increase reflects sharply higher wheat futures prices and reduced 2019/20 corn supplies.

World 2019/20 wheat supplies are raised 4.9 million tons on a 1.6-million-ton increase in beginning stocks and a 3.3-million-ton increase in global production. India’s wheat crop is raised 1.2 million tons on updated government data. Production in Russia and Ukraine are each raised 1.0 million tons reflecting favorable weather to date. Projected 2019/20 global trade is expanded 0.8 million tons with a 1.0-million-ton increase for Russia and a 0.5-million-ton increase for Ukraine, both due to larger crops. Russian exports are now projected at 37.0 million tons and Ukraine exports are projected at a record 19.5 million. Partly offsetting is a 0.5-million-ton decrease for EU exports with greater competition from Black Sea origins. Projected 2019/20 world consumption is raised 3.6 million tons on both higher food and feed and residual use. With supplies rising more than use, ending stocks are projected up 1.3 million tons to a record 294.3 million.

COARSE GRAINS: This month’s 2019/20 U.S. corn outlook is for increased beginning stocks and imports, sharply lower production, reduced feed and residual use and exports, and smaller ending stocks. Beginning stocks are up reflecting a 100-million-bushel decline in projected exports for 2018/19 to 2.2 billion bushels, based on current outstanding sales and reduced U.S. price competitiveness. Corn production for 2019/20 is forecast to decline 1.4 billion bushels to 13.7 billion, which if realized would be the lowest since 2015/16. Unprecedented planting delays observed through early June are expected to prevent some plantings and reduce yield prospects. USDA will release its Acreage report on June 28, which will provide survey-based indications of planted and harvested area. With sharply lower supplies, use is projected to decline 425 million bushels to 14.3 billion, based on reductions to feed and residual use and exports. With supplies falling more than use, ending stocks are projected to decline 810 million bushels to 1.7 billion, which if realized would be the lowest since 2013/14. The season-average farm price is raised 50 cents to $3.80 per bushel.

This month’s 2019/20 foreign coarse grain outlook is for lower production, increased trade and lower stocks relative to last month. Argentina corn production is raised on increased area with higher prices. Canada corn production is lowered on reductions to both area and yield with planting delays in Ontario. Russia corn production is higher based on government data indicating larger-than-expected planted area. Barley production is lowered for the EU reflecting a reduction for Spain. For 2018/19, Brazil corn production is raised based on the latest government statistics.

Major global trade changes for 2019/20 include larger forecast corn exports for Argentina and Russia, with a partly offsetting reduction for Zambia. For 2018/19, exports are raised for Brazil and Argentina for the local marketing year beginning in March 2019 based on higher-than-expected shipments during May. Foreign corn ending stocks are lowered from last month mostly reflecting reductions for Argentina, Brazil, Canada, and the EU.

RICE: The outlook for 2019/20 U.S. rice this month is for lower supplies, reduced domestic use and exports, and lower ending stocks. Projected U.S. all rice production is lowered 20.1 million cwt or 9 percent to 198.1 million with all of the decrease in long-grain, primarily on a reduction in planted area. The excessive spring precipitation in the Delta is expected to result in lower rice area in this region compared to the NASS Prospective Plantings intended acreage, issued March 29. Partially offsetting the smaller production are higher projected imports, which are raised by 1.2 million cwt to a record large 29.2 million with increases for both long-grain and medium- and short-grain. All rice projected domestic and residual use is lowered 7.0 million cwt to 133.0 million, mainly the result of reduced long-grain supplies. Projected all rice exports are reduced 1.0 million cwt to 100.0 million. The reduction in long-grain exports on higher projected prices is partially offset by increased medium- and short-grain exports as a portion of outstanding sales from the 2018/19 market year are expected to be shifted to 2019/20. Projected 2019/20 all rice ending stocks are lowered 7.2 million cwt to 51.6 million with long-grain accounting for all of the reduction. The projected 2019/20 all rice season-average farm price (SAFP) is raised by $0.50 per cwt to $11.70 with increases in the projected SAFPs of all rice classes this month.

Global 2019/20 rice supplies are decreased by 0.5 million tons to 667.8 million as higher carryin stocks are more than offset by lower production. Global production is down as reductions for the United States, North Korea, and Thailand are not completely offset by higher projected production for Madagascar, Egypt, and the EU. World 2019/20 consumption is lowered fractionally to 496.0 million tons on reduced expected use in China, North Korea, and the United States more than offsetting higher use in Madagascar, Bangladesh, Burma, and Egypt. Global 2019/20 trade is lowered 0.4 million tons to 47.2 million as reduced exports by India, Burma, and the United States are not completely offset by higher exports by China. Projected world ending stocks are adjusted lower this month to 171.9 million tons but remain record large.

OILSEEDS: This month’s U.S. soybean supply and use projections for 2019/20 include higher beginning and ending stocks. Beginning stocks are raised reflecting a 75-million-bushel reduction in projected exports for 2018/19 based on lower-than-expected shipments in May and a lower import forecast for China. Although adverse weather has significantly slowed soybean planting progress this year, area and production forecasts are unchanged with several weeks remaining in the planting season. With soybean use unchanged, 2019/20 ending stocks are projected at 1,045 million bushels, down 25 million from the revised 2018/19 projection. Other changes for 2018/19 include increased soybean meal imports and exports, reduced soybean oil used for biodiesel production, and higher soybean oil ending stocks.

The 2019/20 season-average price for soybeans is forecast at $8.25 per bushel, up 15 cents reflecting the impact of higher corn prices. Soybean meal prices are forecast at $295 per short ton, up 5 dollars. The soybean oil price forecast is unchanged at 29.5 cents per pound.

The 2019/20 global soybean supply and use projections include lower production and stocks compared to last month. Global production is down 0.3 million tons to 355.4 million due to lower crops for Ukraine and Zambia. The 2019/20 soybean ending stocks are lowered 0.4 million tons mainly reflecting lower carryin due to revisions to 2018/19 balance sheets. Beginning stocks for 2019/20 are reduced for Argentina and China offsetting higher stocks for the United States. For Argentina, stocks are lowered on a 1.5-million-ton increase to exports to 7.8 million for 2018/19 based on the recent pace of shipments. Beginning stocks are lowered for China due to a 1-million-ton decrease to imports to 85 million for 2018/19.

SUGAR: U.S. sugarbeet production for 2019/20 is projected at 33.916 million tons, up 1 percent from last month. Overall planting progress in the United States advanced beyond the pace indicated last month to move the yield forecast to 30.8 tons/acre, up from 30.5. Based on average levels of beet pile shrink and slicing recovery, beet sugar production from this crop is projected at 4.992 million short tons, raw value (STRV) with production occurring in August and September at 511,111. This results in fiscal 2018/19 beet sugar production at 4.920 million STRV, a gain of 9,509 STRV. This increase is largely offset by lower 2018/19 Florida cane sugar production reported by processors. High-tier tariff imports for 2018/19 are increased by 20,000 STRV to 90,000 based on the pace of entries to date. These supply changes result in ending stocks for 2018/19 residually increasing to 1.526 million STRV, implying a stocks-to-use ratio of 12.40 percent, up marginally over last month.

Beet sugar production for 2019/20 is projected at 5.154 million STRV based on the larger sugarbeet crop. This increase is partially offset by lower cane sugar production in Texas due to weather-related area reductions for the 2019/20 crop as reported by the processor. With no changes to imports or use, the combination of higher beginning stocks of 20,469 STRV and a net production increase of 23,457 STRV implies ending stocks of 1.528 million and a stocks-to-use ratio of 12.37 percent.

Mexico sugar production for 2018/19 is estimated at 6.400 million metric tons (MT) based on CONADESUCA-estimated area of 796,770 hectares (ha) and USDA estimates of yield at 71.08 MT/ha and sucrose recovery of 11.30 percent. Mexico sugar production for 2019/20 is projected at 6.183 million MT assuming the same area as in 2018/19 and 5-year averages of sugarcane yield and sucrose recovery. With no other changes, the changes to production result in exports to non-U.S. destinations of 1.386 million MT in 2018/19 and 263,100 MT in 2019/20, based on CONADESUCA targets for ending stocks.

LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY: The forecast for 2019 red meat and poultry production is reduced from last month as lower forecast beef, pork, and turkey production more than offset higher broiler production. The decline in beef production largely reflects lower steer and heifer slaughter in the second half of the year. Forecast pork production is lowered from last month primarily as the pace of slaughter to date has been slower than expected. The broiler production forecast is raised on recent hatchery data and expected heavier bird weights. Turkey production is lowered slightly on production data to date.

The 2020 red meat and poultry production forecast is lowered from the previous month. Production growth for livestock and poultry is expected to be slower as producers respond to higher feed costs. The beef production forecast is reduced on lower expected steer and heifer slaughter as incentives to add weight on pasture slows the pace of feedlot placements.

The beef import forecast is raised for 2019 on recent trade data, but the export forecast is reduced from the previous month on the current pace of beef exports to a number of trading partners. No change is made to the 2020 beef trade forecasts. Pork export forecasts for 2019 and 2020 are raised from the previous month, largely reflecting the removal of Mexico’s tariffs on U.S. pork products in late May. The 2019 broiler export forecast is reduced slightly on recent trade data; no change is made to the 2020 broiler export forecast. The turkey export forecast is unchanged for 2019 and 2020.

For 2019, the cattle, hog, and broiler price forecasts are reduced from last month, reflecting current price weakness. The 2019 turkey price forecast is raised slightly on higher second-quarter prices. For 2020, cattle, broiler, and egg price forecasts are reduced on continued demand weakness. The 2020 hog price forecast remains unchanged as slower production growth and stronger exports support prices. The 2020 turkey price forecast is unchanged.

Milk production for 2019 is lowered from last month on slower-than-anticipated growth in milk per cow and lower expected cow numbers. The 2020 milk production forecast is reduced from last month as higher expected feed costs are expected to weaken producer margins, limiting growth in the dairy cow herd and milk per cow next year.

The 2019 and 2020 fat basis import forecasts are unchanged from the previous month. The 2019 fat basis export forecast is reduced from the previous month, as gains in cheese exports due to the elimination of tariffs by Mexico only partly offset weakness in butterfat exports to other markets. The 2020 fat basis export forecast is unchanged.

The gutting of EPA must stop,https://thehill.com,[],06-11-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/448026-the-gutting-of-epa-must-stop,"gutted (v) - to destroy the interior of; disembowel

gutted (adj) - bitterly disappointed

“Gutted” can mean to remove the internal parts. It can also mean “bitterly disappointed.” The Trump administration has left employees at the Environmental Protection Agency gutted in both ways: eliminating as many workers as it can, and bitterly disappointing those who remain by silencing our voices and curbing our ability to protect public health and the environment. The two go hand in hand.

President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump judicial nominee withdraws amid Republican opposition: report Trump judicial nominee withdraws amid Republican opposition: report Cummings offers to delay contempt vote for Wednesday deadline on subpoenaed census docs MORE has proposed cutting EPA’s budget by 31 percent next year, which would decimate our staff and cripple our environmental enforcement efforts. Already, he has forced out some of EPA’s most valued engineers and scientists and driven out experts from scientific boards and panels.

Even as new threats emerge to our nation’s drinking water supply, and a new climate assessment paints a dire picture of the rest of this century, the Trump administration has doubled down on attacking EPA. By replacing expert scientists with political hacks and robbing EPA of the scientific tools and authorities to act, the most dire environmental threats facing our nation and the world will go unaddressed for years to come, long after President Trump has left office.

One new threat comes from a group of chemicals known as PFAS, or Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances. Linked to a variety of health problems — cancer, immune deficiencies, and thyroid and liver problems — they can be found in the bodies of 99 percent of Americans. For decades, PFAS have been widely used on nonstick pans, carpets, pizza boxes, fast food wrappers, firefighting foam, and more. They linger and accumulate in the environment and our bodies for a long time.

There is widespread contamination of our drinking water from PFAS, affecting every region of the country. But scientists and government agencies like EPA are just now beginning to understand the scope of the problem and scale of response that will be required. EPA is the only federal agency with the mission and the tools to lead a comprehensive effort to clean up PFAS. But how much of EPA will be left after President Trump finishes burning it to the ground? How will EPA lead the response to this threat if the workforce is gutted and stripped of its most experienced scientists and responders? You cannot respond to a problem without responders. The EPA staffing crisis was manufactured by the Trump administration, but we will all pay the price for it.

Since taking office in 2017, the president has called for reducing EPA staffing levels by 40 percent. Yet the hollowing out of EPA is already occurring. The agency lost (and did not replace) more than 1,000 employees in just the first full fiscal year of the Trump presidency. At this pace, EPA will lose 25 percent of its staff by 2020.

Anyone who thinks that the environmental threats we face can be solved by slashing staff at the main agency responsible for tackling these challenges is kidding themselves. Take climate change, the most acute environmental threat of them all. We need effective federal policy to achieve deep, long-term reductions in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in the next 10 years or we will face catastrophic and extremely expensive effects from warming. Through the Clean Air Act, EPA was poised to take action before President Trump took office. Trump has rolled back that authority. But it is one thing to cripple the EPA’s legal authority to act, and quite another to debilitate the agency for years to come by robbing it of the specialized scientists, engineers, and other experts who have dedicated their careers to this mission. You don’t disband an army when there are battles still to fight, much less when the biggest of battles is on the horizon.

Our drinking water contamination, air problems, and emerging threats like PFAS and climate change all require EPA’s immediate and extensive efforts to protect our public health and the environment. Yet instead of investing in the resources that will be necessary to tackle these critical problems, the Trump administration is laser-focused on crippling EPA by gutting our staff. Stewardship and leadership are both in short supply, and Congress must fill the breach. With more funding and support for the vital work we do, EPA can begin to replenish its staff and soon, hopefully, get back to doing the work that lies ahead. The health of our planet depends on it.

Annapolis Housing Authority's 2018 inspections score low by Housing and Urban Development,https://www.capitalgazette.com,['Naomi Harris'],06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.capitalgazette.com/news/annapolis/ac-cn-housing-authority-inspections-20190611-story.html,"The most recent federal inspections of Housing Authority of the City of Annapolis properties from 2018 showed poor scores of most properties with some, including Newtowne 20 and Morris H. Blum, showing no improvement from prior inspections.

According to the physical inspections conducted by Housing and Urban Development, the housing authority received scores below 60 out of 100 in 2018 with a 39 for Newtowne 20, a 51 for Morris H. Blum and a 41 for Robinwood. HUD, which distributes funding to the housing authority, did not provide scores for Harbor House Apartments/Eastport Terrace and Bloomsbury Square for 2018. Bloomsbury Square did not require an inspection last year because of a high score the prior year, at 81.

Residents from Annapolis public housing properties filed a lawsuit last month against the city and the housing authority stating the city failed to inspect and license properties. Residents in the lawsuit claim they lived in deplorable conditions and cited issues like water damage, sewage leaks and mold.

Through a random sampling of apartment units, federal inspectors review a property site including the building exterior, common area, units and the building system. The weight of the scoring comes down to what is called the “exigent health and safety” (EHS).

“Examples of EHS deficiencies include blocking of emergency fire exits, exposed wires and missing or inoperable smoke detectors,” HUD regional public affairs officer Nika Edwards said via email.

For properties that have one of those deficiencies, the public housing agency must address issues HUD identifies immediately and notify HUD they have been addressed within 72 hours, according to Edwards. HUD identified those deficiencies at Newtowne 20, Morris H. Blum and Robinwood.

According to physical inspection report by HUD, Morris H. Blum has declined in score each year since 2015. In 2015, the property received a high score of 87 but two years later dropped to 66 and even lower with a 51 in 2018.

Harbor House went from a score of 62 in 2015 to 46 in 2016 and an increase to 54 by 2017. Other properties have ranked relatively low as well.

Robinwood went from 63 in 2015 to 30 by 2017 and 50 later that year. Newtowne 20 saw an extreme decline that has not gotten substantially better. In 2015, the property earned an 81 but in 2017 HUD inspectors gave Newtowne a 29 in January and then a 34 in October.

Housing authority officials did not respond for comment regarding the scores.

When a public housing property scores less than 80 it must be inspected every year. If the score is between 80 and 89, properties are inspected every two years and from 90 to 100, it is inspected every three.

As part of the physical inspections of public housing properties, HUD inspectors look at factors like overgrown vegetation, water leaks, health and safety, and the state of apartments or units to determine if the condition is decent, sanitary and safe, according to guidance regulation documents.

According to Edwards, the public housing team in Baltimore has worked with the housing authority by providing technical assistance to “think through other options,” when it comes to preserving affordable housing.

“Ultimately, we need to be thinking of what is best for the residents and the quality of life. What can we do to preserve it and what long terms strategies can we look to -- to make a significant impact,” Edwards said.

The inspection routine is also undergoing changes after the federal agency realized housing authorities and private owners of HUD-subsidized housing have become used to the inspection process. One of the changes will be a shift from a 90 to 120 notification of inspection to 14 days.

Executive director of the housing authority and others are looking for ways to fund redevelopment of Newtowne 20. In May, Beverly Wilbourn and her agency applied for two programs through HUD for Section 18 federal subsidies, which can be used for obsolete properties, and 4% tax credits.

The agency hopes to start relocation in August or September, according to Wilbourn. The goal is to demolish and rebuild the property, which is made up of 78 aged units, in early 2020.

VA owes $190 million to disabled veterans improperly charged home loan fees,https://www.foxnews.com,['Robert Gearty'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/va-owes-190-million-to-disabled-veterans-improperly-charged-home-loan-fees,"The Department of Veterans Affairs owes about $189 million to 53,000 disabled veterans who were charged home loan fees they were exempt from having to pay, an investigation has found.

These veterans were charged the fees under the VA’s Home Loan Guaranty Program and now may be entitled to refunds ranging from $5,000 to $20,000, a VA Inspector General audit released Thursday found.

VA loan managers knew disabled vets were being charged the fees improperly since 2014 but never did anything about it, VA IG auditors determined.

“OIG finds it troubling that senior (Veterans Benefits Administration) management was aware that thousands of veterans were potentially owed more than $150 million yet did not take adequate actions to ensure refunds were issued,” the IG report says.

DOZENS OF ATTORNEYS GENERAL ASK BETSY DEVOS TO FORGIVE DISABLED VETS STUDENTS LOANS

The loan managers told the IG they were focused on other priorities, including processing high volumes of applications, USA Today reported.

The report faulted the Veterans Benefits Administration for placing the burden on a disabled vet to submit a claim for a refund.

The VA announced last month that it was notifying veterans when they buy homes through the Home Loan program that they are exempt from the fees if they are disabled or later determined to be disabled, the paper reported.

“Through an internal quality improvement effort, VA has put a plan in place to better inform veterans through key communications when the law allows VA to waive the fee for a veteran,” the announcement quoted VA Secretary Robert Wilkie as saying.

The Veterans Benefits Administration told the IG that it would identify exempt veterans who paid the fees and issue them refunds and that the financial impact to the veterans was minimal over the life of the loan, The Washington Post reported.

Auditors looked at the period 2012 to 2017.



They determined nearly $300 million in home loan origination fees had been collected from 73,000 exempt disabled vets during that time.

Former U.S. Interior Secretary and REI board member Sally Jewell has been tapped as interim CEO of The Nature Conservancy, after resignations of top brass and a law firm's critical report on its work environment for women.

Jewell will take her post on Sept. 3. The appointment follows the resignation Friday of Nature Conservancy CEO Mark Tercek, a week after he asked for the resignation of Conservancy president Brian McPeek. Its Caribbean director exited last week.

The Nature Conservancy is the world's largest environmental organization, with $1.3 billion in revenues for 2018.

RELATED: Sally Jewell: UW will hear from and honor one of its own

It has been a shaping force for conservation in Washington, with acquisitions small (Yellow Island in the San Juans) and large (restoration of Ellsworth Creek in Southwest Washington). It has undertaken ambitious projects such as preserving Moses Coulee in Central Washington.

The Nature Conservancy was a major supporter of Initiative 1631, the carbon fee on last fall's Washington ballot.

""Our strength has always been in our people, and we recognize this comes with great responsibility to provide this team a supportive, open and inclusive work environment so everyone can thrive,"" Jewell said in accepting her new post.

The new chair of The Nature Conservancy will be former Alaska Gov. Fran Ulmer, current chair of the Arctic Research Commission.

Jewell was promoted for the interior job, in Obama's second term, by Seattle super lawyer Gerry Grinstein, and won Senate confirmation on a bipartisan 87-11 vote. She started on a hesitant note, but became a Cabinet star as Obama made multiple national monument designations.

The designations included monuments in the California desert and the ""Lost Coast"" of Northern California, expansion of the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument on the Oregon-California border, and the big Organ Mountains Desert Peaks National Monument in New Mexico.

President Donald Trump has set out to eviscerate the Bears Ears National Monument in southeast Utah, designated just before Obama left office. The Trump administration is seeking to reduce its size from 1.3 million acres to just 201,000 acres.

It is the largest reduction in public land protection in American history. A major court fight is shaking up.

Sally Jewell has been on The Nature Conservancy's board of directors.

She was known, at the Interior Department, for getting around, and took Obama as far afield as Alaska's Kenai Fjords National Park.

USDA Set to Adjust U.S. Soy Numbers in July Report - Chief Economist,https://www.agriculture.com,[],06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.agriculture.com/markets/newswire/usda-set-to-adjust-us-soy-numbers-in-july-report-chief-economist,"By Nigel Hunt

LONDON, June 12 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Agriculture is set to revise its U.S. soybean forecasts next month after leaving area and yield projections unchanged in a monthly report issued on Tuesday, USDA chief economist Robert Johansson said.

USDA's monthly World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) report cut corn area and yields following severe delays to plantings this season.

""I think conventional wisdom is that some of the corn acres would translate into bean acres and that translates into lower soybean prices,"" Johansson said on the sidelines of a reception organised by the International Grains Council.

The U.S. soybean area was kept at 84.6 million acres and yield at 49.5 bushels an acre.

""I think we didn't have information to go on right now to change those soybean numbers. I think we will see adjustments being made to the soybean crop in the July WASDE,"" he said, adding it was a later planted crop than corn.

USDA on Tuesday raised its forecast for the average soybean farm price to $8.25 a bushel from $8.10.

The U.S. corn area was cut to 89.8 million acres from a previous forecast of 92.8 million, while the corn yield was downwardly revised to 166 bushels per acre from 176 bushels.

Johansson noted that the planting and emergence of the corn crop had been delayed.

""That is going to push the main grain filling period for corn into the hottest part of the summer,"" he said, adding that typically could affect overall yield.

Johansson said an expected reduction in soybean demand from China linked to an outbreak of African swine fever in the world's biggest hog herd was now ""built into the market"".

Soybean meal is a major feed ingredient for hogs.

He noted that Rabobank had forecast China's pork output would fall by 30 percent, which would dampen soybean prices. [nL3N21T33L}

Soybean crush numbers in China have, however, so far remained relatively constant, he added.

""We haven't seen the crush numbers down as much in China as you might expect (if pork production was falling so sharply),"" Johansson said, adding that might partly reflect increased demand from the poultry sector as Chinese consumers eat more chicken.

Johansson said there was ""no question"" the United States would like to have a trade agreement with Britain if the UK leaves the European Union.

He said there could be challenges similar to those faced in negotiations between Washington and the European Union to try to agree a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.

Differing views on food safety proved a stumbling block in those negotiations.

""There are some pretty hard decisions there,"" he said, while adding he had faith in the ability of negotiators to bridge the gap. (Reporting by Nigel Hunt; Editing by Dale Hudson)

State Department silent on harm to Guatemala and U.S. interests,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Steve Hecht']",06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jun/11/state-department-silent-on-harm-to-guatemala-and-u/,"ANALYSIS/OPINION:

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has deployed personnel to Guatemala to stop human smuggling and better understand the root causes of irregular migration. They need not go so far. A 15-minute drive to the Department of State would put DHS at the core of the problem.

Acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan recently cited a study saying almost a quarter of Guatemalans, about 4 million people, plan to migrate to the United States. The secretary visited Guatemala the week of May 27 and finalized an agreement with its government. DHS will provide “law enforcement training and collaboration,” and its agents will deploy to Guatemala’s border with Mexico.

Guatemala “is a geographic ‘chokepoint’ for migration from the south up through Mexico,” according to Mr. McAleenan. I am aware of this as an American living in Guatemala for 46 years, only a short drive from where caravans pass en route to the United States via Mexico.

DHS agents will likely fail because the Guatemalan police and army have been degraded by Obama-Biden administration policy, continued under President Donald Trump by permanent State Department bureaucrats. These U.S. officials have exacerbated the lack of state presence in the border areas with Mexico, assuring the free flow of illegal migrants and drugs en route to the United States.

Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, Texas Democrat, wrote to Mr. Trump encouraging him to consider Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales’s offer to welcome U.S. troops to Guatemala’s northern border. U.S. troops are unnecessary. Guatemalans are capable of doing this themselves with political support from Mr. Trump and the release of already-earmarked foreign aid.

Guatemala uses U.S.-trained elite security forces — police, military and prosecutors — for counter-narcotics operations. Now that DHS has recognized the key role of Guatemala in illegal immigration, the Trump administration should work with Mr. Morales to use existing Guatemalan elite forces to address lawlessness in the border regions.

Mr. Obama helped the successors to the Fidel Castro-supported guerrillas from Guatemala’s internal armed conflict (196096) in their quest to control the country. Through pressure and corrupt deals, the State Department placed its allies in Guatemala’s government, critically in the public prosecutor’s office and judiciary. They protected guerrilla successor groups from criminal prosecution and persecuted legitimate authorities who attempted to enforce the law on the illegal groups.

Former Vice President Joe Biden traveled to Guatemala three times in 12 months to pressure the government to extend the U.N. International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG). U.S. pressure as the largest funder turned the CICIG into a battering ram for the U.S. ambassador. Judicial Watch and The Wall Street Journal reported CICIG criminality. With control of the judiciary and criminal prosecution, the ambassador could jail opponents without evidence and regard for law.

The guerrilla successors, called human-rights groups by the State Department and protected by the embassy cabal, force local inhabitants to participate in criminal activities. This includes destroying businesses and invading private property, which has resulted in less opportunity and increased violence and emigration.

Pursuant to an injunction request by a person associated with a guerrilla successor group, Guatemala’s Constitutional Court (CC) suspended the operations of two hydroelectric plants for failure to consult local communities. The American Chamber of Commerce in Guatemala (Amcham) issued a statement: “As a direct result of the CC’s rulings, more than 445,000 jobs and more than $780 million in annual tax revenues are at risk.” This is huge for a country of about 18 million people and GDP of about $75 billion.

The inhabitants of the communities testified they did not know the plaintiff and had been consulted and support the plants. Amcham said “We are in a period of radical ideological movements by social-conflict groups, with distortions and open opposition to any investment project, that do not show they legitimately or democratically represent the communities.”

In contrast to condemning illegitimacy in other places, such as Venezuela, the State Department remains silent on this harm to Guatemala and to U.S. interests.

Rural inhabitants who live under the cruel and arbitrary rule of the guerrilla successors yearn to be free. They have made hundreds of unheeded requests for army presence.

Mr. Morales should apply the law in these areas, for which he can use his elite security forces with Mr. Trump’s backing. Mr. Morales also needs to act, with support from Mr. Trump, against the criminal Constitutional Court magistrates to encourage the rest of the judiciary to properly apply the law. Mr. Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo likewise have to neutralize the permanent State Department bureaucrats.

A grateful rural population, with physical and legal security, would not only have less incentive to emigrate but would be willing partners with security forces to identify suspicious activity. This would significantly reduce the flow of illegal migrants and drugs from and through Guatemala without the need for U.S. forces and with little additional expense.

Former EPA Leaders Blast Trump Administration,https://www.usnews.com,[],06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2019-06-11/former-epa-leaders-blast-trump-administration,"Former EPA Administrators Gina McCarthy (left), Christine Todd Whitman, William Reilly and Lee Thomas swear in during the EPA Management and Policy Challenges House Energy and Commerce hearing, June 11, 2019, in Washington, DC. (Caroline Brehman/CQ Roll Call/Getty Images)

Four previous leaders of the Environmental Protection Agency who served under both Republican and Democratic administrations on Tuesday criticized the new direction of the agency under President Donald Trump and urged Congress to exercise its oversight responsibility of the agency's actions.

Speaking to members of a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee, former EPA administrator Gina McCarthy said she found it ""disconcerting"" that ""this collection of past EPA administrators feel obligated to testify together and individually to make the case that what is happening at EPA today is simply put, not normal and to solicit your help to get it on a more productive path.""

""In my opinion, our beloved EPA is in serious trouble and if I am right, it means that American families are facing increasing risks to their health and well-being, especially the very young, the elderly and those living in poverty that are most vulnerable to the impacts of pollution,"" McCarthy, who served under President Obama, said in her testimony.

She added that the administration's rollback of regulations the agency put into place under her leadership is beginning to tick her off ""a bit, maybe even more than just a bit.""

""But this is not the real message from me this morning,"" McCarthy told members of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee. ""I'm here to remind the political leadership at EPA that what they do matters.""

McCarthy was joined by Chrstine Todd Whitman, who served under President George W. Bush, William Reilly, who served under President George H. W. Bush and Lee Thomas, who served under President Ronald Reagan.

Whitman criticized the EPA for being too friendly to the industries it regulates and too lax on climate change action.

""There is no doubt in my mind that under the current administration, the EPA is retreating from its historic mission to protect our environment and the health of the public from environmental hazards,"" Whitman said.

Republican lawmakers on the subcommittee weren't as quick to criticize the agency under Trump.

""We're trying to put a lot on this administration, saying they don't follow a disciplined process,"" Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Texas, said. ""Unfortunately, that has been some of the track record of the Environmental Protection Agency.""

Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., said that the EPA might need to modernize its approach, adding that ""under nearly every EPA's watch, there's been a failure to update legally mandated programs by Congress."""
Quad Acquisition of LSC Communications: Latest on Status of DOJ Antitrust Ruling,https://www.piworld.com,['Mark Michelson'],06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.piworld.com/article/quad-acquisition-lsc-communications-latest-status-doj-antitrust-ruling/,"The proposed $1.4 billion acquisition of Chicago-based LSC Communications by Sussex, Wis.-based Quad still faces one last hurdle: approval from the U.S. Department of Justice's (DOJ) antitrust division. All along, Quad Chairman, President and CEO Joel Quadracci has remained upbeat that the deal — which would make the combined commercial printing conglomerate the largest in North America with approximately $8.1 billion in sales — will close some time around mid-year.

Quad is expected to report its second quarter earnings in the July 29-30 timeframe, so one can assume his organization is pushing hard behind the scenes to have the framework of the deal approved by then, in order to give him and Quad CFO Dave Honan more favorable talking points to relay to analysts during the earnings call than just its quarterly results and current guidance.

The pending DOJ decision about the coupling of the two publicly-held entities has also received a lot of attention both in, and outside, of the printing industry. I've received an ongoing stream of calls from Wall Street analysts and researchers at hedge funds (some pondering intentions whether or not to buy or, even more so, short the stock) seeking my opinion on the matter as a long-time industry watcher. Similarly, I've also been in continued contact with some fellow journalists who specialize in covering and investigating the antitrust implications for various proposed M&A transactions.

One such writer is Diane Alter, of CTFN. Her article filed Friday, June 7, cited an ""unnamed source close to the situation"" who indicated that Quad and the DOJ are in the midst of negotiating a settlement, which will likely be submitted to the DOJ ""front office"" by the end of June, and then finalized around mid-summer. Alter also reported that her source was unsure whether or not the DOJ would require Quad or LSC to divest any of their holdings in order to pass the DOJ's antitrust requirements. LSC, for example, divested its European operations to the Walstead Group in July 2018, most likely as a preemptive move prior to the Oct. 31, 2018, announcement of its intention to be acquired by Quad.

The DOJ is likely scrutinizing how the proposed coupling would potentially monopolize the long-run publication gravure printing market, as well as the U.S. magazine distribution and logistics network, including co-mail advantages. Perhaps a bit surprisingly, major publishers have remained eerily quiet about how the deal would impact their print vendor options and, in theory, give Quad the upper hand when it comes to pricing power.

The only public complaint came from The Authors Guild and PEN America — two authors organizations — in conjunction with the Open Markets Institute, which collectively sent a letter to the DOJ imploring it to require the two printing companies to divest their magazine distribution operations.

They cited industry data showing that a combined Quad/LSC would have 15 times the magazine printing sales of its nearest competitor in that market and 10 times the book printing revenue of its nearest competitor in the book market.

Quad/LSC Dominate Magazine, Book Printing Markets

According to the 2018 Printing Impressions 400 list of the largest printers in the U.S. and Canada ranked by annual sales (click here to access the complete list), Quad and LSC collectively generated approximately $2.31 billion in publication printing segment sales and $1.26 billion in book printing sales in their most recent fiscal years. This makes them the two largest industry players in those markets — not counting the CJK Group, a privately-held national book manufacturer and industry consolidator that won't divulge its annual revenues or segment sales by product.

I've argued all along (including what I wrote when the proposed Quad/LSC deal was first announced) that the M&A transaction will ultimately receive the DOJ's blessing, albeit with the regulatory agency potentially requiring the combined entity to make some adjustments or divestitures. Two main reasons: 1) the printing industry still remains fragmented in comparison to many other manufacturing sectors and 2) it's not a high-profile industry from the standpoint of the public at large or for having a direct impact on consumers. (One stark comparison, for example, is the proposed merger between Sprint and T-Mobile that is currently facing DOJ antitrust scrutiny.)

Mainstream Media Weighs in on Proposed Deal

Ike Brannon, president of Capital Policy Analytics and a contributor to Forbes, recently penned an article that also favors DOJ approval of the merger and which minimizes the deal's impact on long-run magazine publishers. He pointed out there are currently about 77 publications with a print run of more than one million copies, also noting that figure will undoubtedly decline in the years ahead due to continued pressures from electronic media.

""Making a merger decision that looks at today’s economic realities and does not consider the incipient decline of the print environment has the potential to stifle the cost reductions needed for the print industry to compete against digital publications,"" Brannon argued in his commentary.

He also noted how large publishers often split their magazine print runs between multiple printers to get the best price for their press runs. ""The print industry has hundreds of competitors fighting over a shrinking share of business, and exerting market power is difficult for any one of them to do,"" Brannon wrote.

Some privately-held publication and book printers I've talked to actually favor the Quad/LSC deal, noting that many publication and book publishers will prefer to work with smaller print providers like them, which will be able to provide more personalized service and greater deadline and print order run-length flexibility.

As the summer heats up, so too will anticipation over the DOJ's final decision. From my perch, it's not a matter of if the DOJ will allow the acquisition to proceed or not, but rather what stipulations — if any, and how major — the agency may impose in conjunction with its final blessing."

When he came home after the war, King used the G.I. Bill to earn a degree from American International College. He went on to become a seventh-grade teacher at Ludlow Junior High School and worked in community action programs.

He was introduced to politics by his father, Edward King.

“My grandfather worked at Chapman Valve in Indian Orchard. He was the union treasurer and got involved in John F. Kennedy’s 1958 Senate reelection campaign early on and he got my father involved in the campaign working with Kennedy’s younger brother Edward,"" said King’s son Sean King. ""My grandfather ended up working for JFK’s presidential campaign and as the Indiana state director in 1960 and became the international border commissioner to Canada in the Kennedy administration. So it was my grandfather that really brought my father into politics and then he blossomed on his own.”

In the years that followed, James King worked on more than 100 political campaigns nationally and internationally.

“Jim King was one of the best Democratic political operatives in the business,” said U.S. Rep. Richard E. Neal, D-Springfield. “He was a legendary figure in local, state and national politics for more than a half century.”

In the 1970s King became the director of community affairs and marketing for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, a position he left in 1977 to enter the White House as a special assistant to Carter. Later that year he was appointed to the National Transportation Safety Board and later became its chair, a post he held until 1982. He served as a senior adviser to the late Sen. Edward Kennedy and as chief of staff to then-Sen. John Kerry.

A graduate of the Harvard School of Business Administration’s program for senior government managers, King also became a fellow of Harvard’s Institute of Politics.

“When Jim King appeared on a political convention floor, you absolutely knew that he was the one to listen to and follow,” said Anthony L. Cignoli, a local business and political strategist who remembers King as a kind and compassionate man. “He was one of the very best political organizers and political advance professionals in this business. If he told a candidate or staff where to go or what to do, they did it — even if they were president of the United States.”

Cignoli met King when he was young and knew little about politics. “It was Jim King who kindly took me under his wing with advice I needed then and still cherish to this day,” he said.

King’s nomination by Clinton to serve as director of the Office of Personnel Management in Washington was confirmed by the Senate in 1993. He asked that the swearing-in ceremony be held at AIC.

As OMP director, King set policies for 2.1 million federal employees, as well as administering pay, life and health insurance, and hiring and firing rules for the government. The agency administers the multibillion-dollar retirement system for federal and postal employees, retirees and survivors.

Neal said King always remembered where he came from.

“He took his work seriously but remained fiercely proud of his western Massachusetts roots,” Neal said. “I valued his sound political advice for many years and enjoyed his well-known sense of humor.”

Sean King said his father was larger than life not only in stature — he was 6 feet, 5 inches tall — but in personality too.

“In politics people say information is power, and it is,” he said. “But my father also knew that people who hold on to the information and don’t teach it are only doing it for their own benefit.”

Sean King said his dad would always come home with duffel bags full of presents and stories from his trips around the world.

“He would come home with wood flutes from Baghdad, frankincense and myrrh from Jordan,” he said. “Everything was learned through an allegory that happened to be at least loosely based on the truth and there was always a moral, and it was a great way to be both entertained and educated.”

King died at his home in Rockport on June 9 at the age of 84. He is survived by his wife Eleanor (Whitney), his five children and their families and his sister Dr. Almeda King Ambrulevich. For online condolences, visit www.greelyfuneralhome.com."
How a Missouri senator may have been president for one day,https://wtvr.com,['Tribune Media Wire'],06-11-2019,2019,6,https://wtvr.com/2019/06/11/how-a-missouri-senator-may-have-been-president-for-one-day/,"Please enable Javascript to watch this video

ATCHISON, Kan. - Most history classes teach Zachary Taylor was the 12th U.S. president and Harry Truman was the only president from Missouri.

But a pair of historical markers in Plattsburg, Missouri, and a museum in Atchison, Kansas, tell a different story.

People pass by the towering statue outside the Clinton County Courthouse every day. Few people recognize it as David Rice Atchison, and likely fewer understand the plaque below that declares him ""President of the United States for one day.""

""He was this vital important pre-Civil War person that pretty much vanished off the pages of history,"" said Chris Taylor, Atchison County Historical Society executive director.

But on March 4, 1849, Atchison was the nation`s highest ranking elected official sworn into office.

The nation's 11th president, James Polk's term had expired, and the President-elect, Zachary Taylor, refused to be inaugurated on a Sunday.

Atchison of Missouri had just been named president pro tempore of the U.S. Senate.

""In 1849, there was no pressing thing that would happen. Today, if we didn't have a president for 24 hours, the whole world would be in total chaos,"" Taylor said.

The Atchison County Historical Society Museu boasts ""The World's Smallest Presidential Library.""

In its Hall of Presidents, Atchison is placed between Polk and Taylor and proclaimed ""The Real 12th President."" It features an 1849 newspaper article from Washington D.C.'s National Intelligencer that explained how Atchison may have accidentally become president for a day.

The museum asks visitors to vote in an 1850s Kansas ballot box what they'd do if they were president for a day.

So how did Atchison spend it? After being up for hours signing final presidential orders that had to pass through the Senate from the previous term, he mostly slept.

""His friends started showing up to wake him up to be appointed as ministers to different countries or part of his 24-hour cabinet, so people realized this odd thing was happening,"" Taylor said.

Atchison never gained the official title of vice president either, but would serve in the de-facto capacity under two presidents because of deaths in office. He'd retire from politics shortly after Atchison, Kansas, was named for him, on the losing side of the debate whether Kansas should be admitted as a slave or free state.

A marker next to his Plattsburg, Missouri, grave declares him ""President for a Day."" Memoirs say he'd often boast after his odd attachment to history that he had ""the honestest administration in the U.S.""

Since 1849, whenever Inauguration Day has fallen on a Sunday, the president has been sworn in privately, and then had a formal public ceremony the following day."
