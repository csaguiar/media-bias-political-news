Trump administration scores win over challenge to asylum restriction,https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-admin-scores-win-over-move-to-limit-asylum-claims,"A federal judge decided Wednesday to leave in place a Trump administration rule that imposes restrictions on individuals seeking asylum in the United States if they passed through a third country on their way to the border between the U.S. and Mexico, potentially leading to a sharp reduction in Central American migrants entering the country.

The rule, published in the Federal Register last week, requires people seeking asylum to first apply in one of the countries they pass through on their way to the U.S., with certain exceptions. The rule was quickly met with a legal challenge from advocacy groups, who moved for a temporary restraining order blocking the rule. After a hearing in Washington, D.C. federal court, District Judge Timothy J. Kelly denied the motion. The rule will remain in place for the duration of the case, unless the decision is successfully appealed.

LINDSEY GRAHAM CLAIMS BORDER FRAUD SO PREVALENT 'A TERRORIST COULD EASILY GET IN'

""We are disappointed in the court's decision today,"" said Claudia Cubas, litigation direction for the Capital Area Immigrants' Rights Coalition.

Kelly, who was appointed to the bench by President Trump said the immigrant advocate groups who filed the lawsuit did not show that their work would be irreparably harmed if the policy moved forward.

With certain exceptions, the rule requires individuals to apply for and be denied asylum in another country in order to apply in the U.S. That means that migrants from Central American nations who travel through Mexico – who make up a significant portion of recent asylum seekers – will not be eligible for asylum in America unless they previously applied for asylum in Mexico or any other country they traversed and were turned down.

The new rule’s exceptions include certain cases of human trafficking.

The rule is meant to crack down on asylum seekers coming to the U.S. more for economic reasons than to escape persecution in their home countries. Administration officials say this could help close the gap between the initial asylum screening that most people pass and the final decision on asylum that most people do not win. The goal in part is to allow quicker determinations in these cases.

The policy follows the Trump administration's Migrant Protection Protocols, commonly referred to as the ""remain in Mexico"" policy. Under that policy, asylum seekers were often told to go back to Mexico to await hearings, rather than be allowed to remain in the U.S.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AIMS TO EXPAND FAST-TRACK DEPORTATIONS ACROSS US, LEGAL FIGHT EXPECTED

Democrats railed against that policy, with 2020 hopeful Beto O'Rourke calling it ""inhumane.""

A reduction in asylum seekers would ease the burden on federal agencies currently overwhelmed by the volume of individuals seeking entry into the U.S.

Detention facilities have been notoriously stretched for resources, resulting in outcries against the government. The criticism has particularly been strong when it comes to the conditions in which migrant children have been kept.

Major Moments of Robert Mueller’s Testimony to Congress,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Julie Hirschfeld Davis', 'Mark Mazzetti']",07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/us/politics/mueller-testimony.html,"Mueller corrected the record on indicting Trump.

Mr. Mueller used his opening statement before the House Intelligence Committee to correct his earlier testimony before the Judiciary panel, in which he appeared to suggest that he believed that Mr. Trump should have been indicted.

In the earlier hearing during an exchange with Representative Ted Lieu, Democrat of California and an early proponent of impeachment, Mr. Mueller seemed to say that the reason he did not indict Mr. Trump for obstruction of justice was because of a Justice Department opinion stating that a sitting president cannot be indicted. It was unclear what he meant, or whether he understood the question.

“I believe a reasonable person looking at these facts could conclude that all three elements of the crime of obstruction of justice have been met,” Mr. Lieu said, referring to the Mueller report’s lengthy description of actions the president took to try to interfere with his investigation.

“I’d like to ask you the reason, again, that you did not indict Donald Trump is because of the O.L.C. opinion stating that you cannot indict a sitting president, correct?” he asked, referring to the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel.

“That is correct,” Mr. Mueller said.

That assertion directly contradicted the report itself and Mr. Mueller’s statement in May describing it, in which he said that he and his team had decided not to decide whether to charge the president because of the O.L.C. opinions. The exchange referred to a pair of opinions from the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel, drafted during the Nixon era and reaffirmed under Bill Clinton, that a sitting president could not be indicted.

By afternoon, Mr. Mueller walked back the inconsistency, saying that Mr. Lieu had incorrectly described his decision."

Mueller flubs on which president appointed him to prosecutor post in Massachusetts,https://www.foxnews.com,"[""Andrew O'Reilly""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mueller-flubs-on-which-president-appointed-him-to-prosecutor-post-in-massachusetts,"Former Special Counsel Robert Mueller confused which president appointed him the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts back in the 1980s during his congressional appearance Wednesday.

Answering a question during a lengthy hearing before the House Judiciary Committee, Mueller said he thought President George H. W. Bush appointed him to the post in Massachusetts, but was quickly corrected by Rep. Greg Stanton, D-Ariz., who noted that Mueller was appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1986.

Bush appointed Mueller as United States Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division in 1990.

EX-SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER TESTIFIES TO CONGRESS -- LIVE BLOG

Stanton’s questioning was meant to emphasize Mueller’s long history in government and the respect he garnered from both Democratic and Republican presidents. The former special counsel also served as deputy attorney general under President George W. Bush and later as his FBI director – a post he continued under President Barack Obama.

Mueller’s flub on who appointed him in Massachusetts came after hours of questioning in which Mueller appeared confused or befuddled by questions or references. He was also unwilling or unable to offer crisp sound bites that could reshape already-entrenched public opinions.

He frequently gave terse, one-word answers to lawmakers' questions, even when given opportunities to crystallize allegations of obstruction of justice against the president. He referred time and again to the wording in his report or asked for questions to be repeated. He declined to read aloud hard-hitting statements in the report when prodded by Democrats to do so.

MUELLER REFUSES TO DISCUSS RUSSIA PROBE ORIGINS, STEELE DOSSIER IN TESTIMONY

Although Mueller declared at the outset that he would be limited in what he would say, the hearings nonetheless carried the extraordinary spectacle of a prosecutor discussing in public a criminal investigation he conducted into a sitting U.S. president.

Mueller, known for his taciturn nature, warned that he would not stray beyond what had already been revealed in his report. The Justice Department had instructed him to stay strictly within those parameters, giving him a formal directive to point to if he faced questions he did not want to answer.

US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin Thinks Outlook for Bitcoin Is Bleak,https://www.coindesk.com,[],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.coindesk.com/ius-treasury-secretary-mnuchin-thinks-outlook-for-bitcoin-is-bleak,"U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin commented on cryptocurrency’s future viability, in an interview on Wednesday.

“I can assure you I will personally not be loaded up on bitcoin in 10 years,” Mnuchin said on CNBC’s Squawk Box. “I would bet even in five to six years I won’t even be talking about bitcoin as Treasury Secretary.”

While Mnuchin’s comments today do not elucidate his specific regulatory policies, he said previously that cryptocurrencies pose “risk to the financial system” if misused like Swiss bank accounts.

To prevent financial crime or monetary distortion, the Secretary has called upon the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to design guidance that will hold cryptocurrencies to the highest standards.

Today he added, “We’re going to make sure we have a unified approach and my guess is that there are going to be more regulations that come out from all these agencies.”

On July 18, Mnuchin erroneously claimed that fiat currencies are not vehicles for money laundering, while “there are billions of dollars of transactions going on in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for illicit purposes.”

Several media outlets – including Squawk Box anchor Joe Kernan, at the time – responded with incredulity. Tom Robinson, CEO of research firm Elliptic, wrote an OpEd for VentureBeat claiming, “Less than 0.5 percent of bitcoin transactions are used for illicit purchases.”

While Mnuchin seems to think crypto’s future is bleak, he continues to bat for the U.S. dollar.

Mnuchin added later in today’s interview, “I think the dollar is the reserve currency in the world. It’s in our interest. We want to maintain it.”

Justice Department launches antitrust probe into big tech,https://arstechnica.com,['Kate Cox'],,,,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/07/justice-department-launches-antitrust-probe-into-big-tech/,"The Department of Justice is launching an antitrust probe into some of the world's biggest and most influential tech companies, the agency announced Tuesday.

The department's Antitrust Division, which is responsible for reviewing and enforcing issues relating to mergers, monopolies, competition, and price-fixing, said its review would ""consider the widespread concerns that consumers, businesses, and entrepreneurs have expressed about search, social media, and some retail services online.""

“Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands,” Makan Delrahim, head of the Antitrust Division, said. “The Department’s antitrust review will explore these important issues.”

The DOJ didn't name any names, but the list of ""market-leading online platforms"" accused of stifling competition through dishonest tactics, or simply of being too big for competitors to exist against, generally has Amazon, Facebook, and Google at the top; all three companies' stocks immediately tanked following the announcement.

Reports by several media outlets earlier this year, citing the ever-popular ""sources familiar with the matter,"" indicated the DOJ and Federal Trade Commission were planning something of a divide-and-conquer approach to tech sector regulation, with the DOJ digging into Apple and Google, and the FTC handling Amazon and Facebook.

Widespread scrutiny

The Justice Department is just the latest, not the first, body to take a hard look at what the tech sector has gotten up to in the past decade.

Congress kicked off its own probe into big tech's behavior last month, when the House Antitrust Subcommittee launched a bipartisan investigation into ""competition in digital markets."" The subcommittee chair, Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) at the time called the growth of monopolies in the US economy ""one of the most pressing economic and political challenges we face today.""

Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat who is one of the party's leading candidates in the 2020 presidential primary race, in March issued a call to use existing antitrust law to break up Amazon, Google, and Facebook.

Traditional bricks-and-mortar retailers have also been asking regulators to update antitrust policy in order to rein in Google and Amazon, which dominate the online marketplace through what the retailers say are anticompetitive practices.

The DOJ is also lagging behind its international peers. Germany, Austria, Italy, and the European Union have all launched separate antitrust investigations into Amazon's behavior with third-party merchants on its marketplace since November, and the EU has fined Google billions of dollars four separate times in recent years for violations of European monopoly law."
Gay U.S. Couple Sues State Dept. for Denying Their Baby Citizenship,https://www.nytimes.com,['Sarah Mervosh'],07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/23/us/state-department-assisted-reproductive-citizenship.html,"The State Department’s focus on biological parentage means that if the source of the sperm and egg do not match married parents, the case can be treated as “out of wedlock,” a designation that comes with a higher bar to transmit citizenship.

Mr. Gregg, who moved to the United States to be with his husband, did not meet a five-year residency requirement. His lawyers say that requirement would not have applied if they had been treated as the married couple they are.

For two married United States citizens, “all the law requires is that one of them lived in America for at least one day,” said Aaron Morris, the executive director of Immigration Equality, which has worked on all three lawsuits.

“Marriage is so fundamental to how you define a family,” he said. “To disenfranchise a little girl of citizenship because she has two dads is invidious discrimination that has been struck down time and time again.”

The State Department declined to comment on Tuesday, citing pending litigation. In court documents, the department has argued that the policy does not discriminate and applies to opposite-sex and same-sex couples alike.

But gay couples argue that they are far more likely to be questioned about their conception methods when applying for citizenship. Immigration Equality said that it had heard from at least three dozen families in similar situations since mid-2017; by the organization’s account, most were same-sex couples.

In court documents, the State Department has said that rules for passing down citizenship for children born abroad are important for preventing fraud and ensuring that children born abroad have a sufficient connection to the United States to warrant citizenship."
Op-Ed: Congress should take Mueller’s testimony as a call to action,https://www.latimes.com,"['Corey Dukes', 'Justin Vail']",07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2019-07-23/mueller-testimony-congress-legislation,"Wednesday’s congressional hearings with former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III are unlikely to reveal many new facts, since Mueller has vowed to use only the contents of his report as his “testimony.” But that doesn’t mean his appearance will serve no purpose.

Few members of the public have had the time to study the 448-page Mueller report. Think of Wednesday’s testimony, then, as a sort-of audio book for the rest of us.

The hearings are likely to provide an opportunity for many Americans to learn about details of the Mueller’s investigation they haven’t fully grasped before — about how the Trump campaign welcomed the assistance of a foreign adversary and how the president himself obstructed the government’s probe.

What will matter even more, however, is how Congress responds to the hearings. Mueller’s testimony should set the stage for bipartisan legislative action aimed at securing elections, restoring the rule of law and preventing future abuses of presidential power. The facts of the Mueller report make clear that lawmakers have a job to do, and they should commit to legislative reforms that will get it done.

For practically every offense Mueller uncovered in his investigation, there is a potential legislative remedy. Take, for example, the numerous instances in the report of President Trump’s attempts to interfere with the fair administration of justice to serve his own corrupt purposes.

He asked his FBI director to shut down the investigation of former national security advisor Michael Flynn, saying, “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.” He directed White House counsel Don McGahn to fire Mueller. And he asked his former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, to tell Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions to limit the Justice Department’s investigation only to future election interference, insulating Trump and his campaign.

Each of these actions violated the Department of Justice’s independence — a norm that past presidents have generally recognized. Trump’s behavior has made clear that we can’t rely on such norms any longer. We need the department’s independence to be codified. One proposal already under discussion is the Security from Political Interference in Justice Act, which would require White House and Department of Justice staff to report their interactions with each other about specific cases or investigations to department watchdogs and Congress. Logging such communications and subjecting them to review would help deter inappropriate contact between the two offices in the future.

Here’s another example of the kind of legislation the Mueller’s testimony is likely to make clear is needed. His report described several occasions in which Trump dangled pardons that might influence witnesses to testify falsely or refuse to cooperate with Mueller’s investigation. During the prosecution of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, Trump publicly and repeatedly praised Manafort and refused to rule out a pardon. Trump also told his former lawyer Michael Cohen to “stay strong,” and Cohen discussed the possibility of a pardon with Trump’s personal counsel.

Presidents have wide discretion to grant pardons, with the Constitution broadly stating that they may do so “for offenses against the United States.” But there need to be limits, as the investigation makes clear.

Floating a pardon as a reward for not cooperating with an independent law enforcement probe is obviously corrupt, and not in keeping with the president’s job “to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” Congress members should take Mueller’s testimony as a reminder they need to act. The Abuse of the Pardon Prevention Act, introduced in 2018, would provide both houses with underlying investigative materials to conduct oversight if a pardon is corrupt or abusive. Congress should pass the law.

These ideas are only part of what should be a broader set of bills to restore the rule of law and strengthen democratic institutions. The House leadership declared recently it intends to pursue legislation to secure elections, which is another crucial issue.

The groundwork for strengthening our democracy has begun to be laid, and Mueller’s testimony on Wednesday can only underscore the need for action. Republicans and Democrats alike must now commit to comprehensive legislation that will ensure the abuses of presidential power uncovered by Mueller and his investigators never happen again.

"U.S., China to hold trade talks early next week: U.S. Treasury chief",https://www.investing.com,[],,,,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/us-china-to-hold-trade-talks-early-next-week-us-treasury-chief-1932877,"© Reuters. FILE PHOTO: Treasuy Secretary Mnuchin gives a briefing on cryptocurrency at the White House in Washington

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top U.S. and Chinese negotiators will meet face-to-face next week for the first time since the countries' leaders agreed in June to revive talks aimed at ending a yearlong trade war between the world's two largest economies.

The United States and China have been embroiled in a tit-for-tat tariff battle, roiling global supply chains and upending financial markets, as Washington presses Beijing to address what it sees as decades of unfair and illegal trading practices.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer will lead a team of American officials in discussions in Shanghai on Tuesday, July 30, ""aimed at improving the trade relationship between the United States and China,"" the White House said in a statement on Wednesday. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will lead negotiations for China.

Global stocks held their gains on guarded optimism following the news of the first in-person meeting between the lead negotiating teams since U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met at the Group of 20 summit in Osaka, Japan. The countries had appeared headed toward a deal before talks abruptly fell apart in early May, leading to months of impasse.

Mnuchin earlier told CNBC on Wednesday he was hopeful progress could be made toward a deal and that more talks were likely to follow later in Washington.

""There'll be a few more meetings before we get a deal done,"" Mnuchin later told reporters at the White House. ""I wouldn't expect that we'll resolve all the issues. But the fact that we're back at the table at the direction of the two presidents is important.""

The United States still has a long list of big items to tackle as talks resume after being sidelined in May, he said.

The White House said ""the discussions will cover a range of issues, including intellectual property, forced technology transfer, non-tariff barriers, agriculture, services, the trade deficit, and enforcement.""

At the G20 in late June, Trump agreed to suspend a new round of tariffs on $300 billion worth of imported Chinese consumer goods while the two sides resumed negotiations. He said at that time the United States would ease restrictions on Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] and that China had agreed to make unspecified purchases of U.S. farm products.

No major Chinese purchasing has resumed, though White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow on Tuesday said he hoped that would change soon.

The countries' top negotiators have spoken by phone since the G20 meeting.

China has said that any deal needs to be fair and equitable, leaving the two sides apparently still far apart from an agreement to end a trade war that has worried investors over macroeconomic growth.

The International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for global growth on Tuesday amid concerns over various trade and tariff issues, including the U.S.-China trade dispute."

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on U.S. regulation of technology companies (all times local):

6:25 p.m.

The Justice Department says its new review of Big Tech's market power will delve into competition ""in an objective and fair-minded manner.""

The agency says it wants to ensure that Americans have access to free markets and that companies compete on merits. The Justice Department says it will take into account the ""widespread concerns"" about social media, search engines and online retail services expressed by consumers, businesses and entrepreneurs. Its antitrust division is seeking information from the public, including those in the tech industry.

In a statement Tuesday, top antitrust official Makan Delrahim worries that without meaningful competition, ""digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands.""

The focus of the investigation closely mirrors a bipartisan probe of Big Tech undertaken by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust. Its chairman, Democrat David Cicilline of Rhode Island, has sharply criticized the conduct of Silicon Valley giants and said legislative or regulatory changes may be needed. He has called breaking up the companies a last resort.

The Justice Department didn't name any companies, but the targets are most likely Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook. All four were the subject of congressional hearings last week.

6:15 p.m.

A longtime digital advertising executive and antitrust expert says American consumers and news publishers need competitive tech markets.

Dina Srinivasan spoke Tuesday after the Department of Justice announced a broad antitrust investigation into big tech companies. She says increased competition could help solve wide-ranging privacy concerns in tech.

But Blair Levin, a former leading Federal Communications Commission staffer, says it's not clear that antitrust regulations would solve all, or even any, of the other concerns.

Tech companies are facing scrutiny that ranges widely from privacy concerns to protection of children to political interference. Levin says regulators need to carefully line up which institutions can address which issues — and antitrust likely won't take care of all of them.

6:05 p.m.

One Wall Street analyst believes the Justice Department's announced review of technology companies will lead to business model tweaks and fines rather than broader structural changes such as breaking up the companies.

Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities says any resulting probe would likely take many years, and that the government would ultimately fail to break up the companies without changes to antitrust laws. He says that's unlikely.

The Justice Department says it is opening an investigation into whether big online companies have hurt competition or innovation.

The Justice Department didn't name any companies, but the targets are most likely Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook. All four were the subject of congressional hearings last week.

Shares of Facebook, Amazon and Apple are down slightly in after-hours trading, while Google's stock is unchanged. All four had closed up for the day.

5:55 p.m.

A Harvard professor who worked in the Obama administration says one challenge with the Justice Department's announced probe of big tech companies is to avoid politicizing it.

Jason Furman, who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama, says the antitrust scrutiny on the companies is long overdue. He just hopes it's ""fast and effective enough that it can actually improve the functioning of the market.""

As for whether any outcome could be expected before next year's presidential elections, Furman says these cases take a long time to investigate, let alone litigate.

The probe announced Tuesday will include an examination into whether powerful companies such as Apple, Facebook, Google and Amazon have been stifling innovation and competition.

5:45 p.m.

An antitrust expert believes a Justice Department investigation into whether major technology companies are abusing their market power may prompt regulators to interpret the law in new ways.

The probe announced Tuesday will include an examination into whether powerful companies such as Apple, Facebook, Google and Amazon have been stifling innovation and competition.

University of Pennsylvania law professor Herbert Hovenkamp says one possible way the companies have been doing that is by collectively buying hundreds of startups in recent years to devour their technology and prevent them from growing into formidable rivals.

Traditionally, antitrust regulators have only sought to block acquisitions involving two big companies. But Hovenkamp says U.S. antitrust law is broad enough for regulators to consider the potential damage wrought by relatively small deals too.

5:30 p.m.

Major tech companies facing congressional antitrust scrutiny have no comment on the Justice Department's just announced probe.

The department says it is opening sweeping antitrust investigation of Big Tech and whether the online platforms have hurt competition, suppressed innovation or otherwise harmed consumers. It did not name any specific companies in its announcement.

Amazon had no comment. Facebook also did not have an immediate comment.

Google directed requests for comments to the testimony its director of economic policy, Adam Cohen, made to the House Judiciary Committee last week. Cohen reiterated the company's benefits to consumers.

Apple referred to comments from CEO Tim Cook, who told CBS last month he doesn't think ""anybody reasonable"" would call Apple a monopoly.

5:15 p.m.

The U.S. Justice Department says it is opening a sweeping antitrust investigation of big technology companies and whether their online platforms have hurt competition, suppressed innovation or otherwise harmed consumers.

It comes as a growing number of lawmakers have called for stricter regulation or even breaking up of the big tech companies, which have come under intense scrutiny following a series of scandals that compromised users' privacy. President Donald Trump also has relentlessly criticized the big tech companies by name in recent months.

4:50 p.m.

The Washington Post is reporting that the Federal Trade Commission will allege that Facebook misled users about its privacy practices as part of an expected settlement.

The federal business watchdog will reportedly find that Facebook deceived users about how it handled phone numbers it asked for as part of a security feature and provided insufficient information about how to turn off a facial recognition tool for photos.

Advertisers were reportedly able to target users who provided their phone number as part of a two-factor authentication security feature.

The FTC didn't respond immediately to a request for comment. Facebook had no comment.

The complaints will reportedly be detailed in a settlement on Wednesday. Facebook won't be required to admit guilt but will have to submit to federal oversight, the newspaper reported."

Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/brooklyn-man-accused-of-immigration-fraud-submitting-hundreds-of-faked-applications-doj,"A New York City man was arrested Tuesday for allegedly running an immigration fraud scheme that involved filing over 1,800 fake immigration applications over the past four years, according to a press release from the Department of Justice’s office in Vermont.

Brooklyn resident Arleigh Louison, 53, was arrested by Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) agents who executed a federal search warrant at his office, the press release said.

Louison’s arrest comes less than a week after a federal grand jury returned a 12-count indictment, charging him with presenting false adjustment of status petitions to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services Service Center in St. Albans, Vt.

The Office of the United States Attorney for the District of Vermont, which conducted the probe, said Louison made false statements in connection with Form I-360 petitions for status adjustments under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), a law that enables immigrants to become lawful permanent residents (LPRs) of the U.S. if they were abused by a relative who is a U.S. citizen or LPR.

Louison allegedly submitted false information in the VAWA petitions so petitioners could secure work authorization permits. Last week’s indictment charged that the petitioners – who paid Louison for his services – were not abused as described in the petitions and never discussed abuse with Louison.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Vermont said that Louison filed false statements with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, including more than 1,800 fraudulent applications for over 1,000 petitioners in the last four years.

The Antitrust Division will work to determine whether companies such as Facebook, Google, and Apple have “reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers” as they’ve grown dramatically in recent years and begun expanding into various industries by acquiring smaller potential competitors. The Federal Trade Commission is conducting a separate, more limited investigation into potential monopolistic abuses by Facebook and Amazon.

The newly announced probe serves as the latest indication that the Trump administration has begun to take seriously the mounting Republican opposition to the nation’s largest tech companies. Led by Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, a number of populist Republicans have railed in recent months against Google and other dominant Silicon Valley firms over privacy abuses and the alleged censorship of socially conservative voices on their platforms.

During his Senate confirmation hearing in January, Attorney General William Barr hinted that he had begun to consider whether the largest tech firms posed a threat to competition.

“I don’t think big is necessarily bad, but I think a lot of people wonder how such huge behemoths that now exist in Silicon Valley have taken shape under the nose of the anti-trust enforcers,” Barr told lawmakers. “You can win that place in the marketplace without violating the anti-trust laws, but I want to find out more about that dynamic.”

The FTC fined Facebook $5 billion over the sale of user data to Cambridge Analytica during the 2016 campaign. It remains unclear what actions the DOJ is prepared to take should it identify clear abuses."

"DOJ opens sweeping antitrust review of big tech giants, saying they may work against consumers",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-opens-sweeping-antitrust-review-of-big-tech-giants-saying-they-may-work-against-consumers,"In a shot across the bow of online titans like Facebook, Google and Amazon, the Justice Department announced Tuesday it has opened a wide-ranging antitrust investigation of big technology companies and whether their online platforms have hurt competition, suppressed innovation or otherwise harmed consumers.

President Trump has relentlessly criticized the big tech companies by name in recent months. He and other top Republicans frequently assert that companies such as Facebook and Google are biased against him and conservative politicians.

“Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands,” DOJ antitrust head Makan Delrahim said in a statement. “The department’s antitrust review will explore these important issues.”

BIG TECH'S MOMENT OF RECKONING HAS ARRIVED

Antitrust law generally prohibits corporations from abusing monopoly power to harm consumers, and also prohibits companies from conspiring to fix prices or suppress competition through other anti-competitive activity.

In 2018, The Daily Caller published an article asserting that Google almost exclusively targets conservative sites for fact-checking -- and, in the process, often erroneously attributes statements to the conservative sites. Others blamed a software bug for the problem.

Some researchers have alleged anti-conservative bias in Google's search results. A leaked video of top Google executives conducting a company-wide meeting after the 2016 election showed them tearfully lamenting the results of the race, which would send Trump to the White House.

The DOJ's move comes as a growing number of lawmakers have called for stricter regulation or even breaking up of the big tech companies, which have come under intense scrutiny following a series of scandals that compromised users' privacy.

The Justice Department did not name specific companies in its announcement. But the DOJ did say it would look into ""widespread concerns that consumers, businesses, and entrepreneurs have expressed about search, social media and some retail services online.""

Additionally, the ""department’s Antitrust Division is conferring with and seeking information from the public, including industry participants who have direct insight into competition in online platforms, as well as others,"" the DOJ said.

“Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands,” said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the Antitrust Division. “The department’s antitrust review will explore these important issues.”

The DOJ said it will seek to assess ""the competitive conditions in the online marketplace in an objective and fair-minded manner and to ensure Americans have access to free markets in which companies compete on the merits to provide services that users want.

""If violations of law are identified, the department will proceed appropriately to seek redress,"" the statement concluded.

Google directed requests for comments to the testimony its director of economic policy, Adam Cohen, made to the House Judiciary Committee last week. Cohen reiterated the company's benefits to consumers.

“Google’s control over what people hear, watch, read, and say is unprecedented,” Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said at the hearing. “Google can, and often does, control our discourse.”

Cruz added: “The American people are subject to overt censorship and covert manipulation” by Google’s algorithm.

But Google’s vice president of global government affairs and public policy, Karan Bhatia, defended the tech giant – arguing that the company has no political bias and does not monitor content posted on its platforms. Bhatia noted that the company does censor or take down some content, but denied that there was any political motivation behind that.

“We work hard to fix our mistakes,” Bhatia said. “But these mistakes have affected both parties and are not a product of bias.”

He added: “We are not censoring speech on our platforms... We do have community guidelines against uploading, for example, videos that have violent imagery.”

Apple referred to comments from CEO Tim Cook, who told CBS last month he doesn't think ""anybody reasonable"" would call Apple a monopoly.

Earlier, the Washington Post reported that the FTC will allege that Facebook misled users about its privacy practices as part of an expected settlement of its 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal.

The federal business watchdog will reportedly find that Facebook deceived users about how it handled phone numbers it asked for as part of a security feature and provided insufficient information about how to turn off a facial recognition tool for photos.

Ethics Office Examines Allegations That Interior Dept. Officials Violated Transparency Laws,https://www.nytimes.com,['Coral Davenport'],07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/23/climate/interior-department-freedom-of-information.html,"Mr. Trump’s first appointee to head the E.P.A., Scott Pruitt, and his first appointee to head the Interior Department, Ryan Zinke, resigned last year after thousands of pages of documents released under Freedom of Information Act requests raised questions about matters such Mr. Pruitt’s alleged spending abuses, first-class travel and relationships with lobbyists, and Mr. Zinke’s efforts to secure taxpayer-funded perks for his wife.

Both men have said that the criticism of their actions was politically and personally motivated, and that they did nothing wrong.

Last year, the Interior Department implemented a new “awareness policy” regarding requests for information and public records under the Freedom of Information Act. The new policy requires career staff reviewing such requests to notify politically appointed officials if their names or email addresses appear in documents that have been designated to be released.

That policy, watchdog groups say, has allowed top officials appointed by President Trump to then withhold or delay the release of such information. “The upshot is that, in practice, the policy has morphed from a procedure that provides awareness to political appointees to one that allows political appointees to unlawfully withhold and delay documents,” said Travis Annatoyn, senior counsel at Democracy Forward, a watchdog group that has requested an Interior Department investigation into the matter.

A spokeswoman for the Interior Department, Molly Block, declined to comment and referred to the Interior Department’s website, which includes a document describing the policy. The page says the policy is intended to streamline the process of the agency’s response to increased Freedom of Information Act requests."

The Justice Department is finally set to being its long-rumored review of monopoly concerns in the areas of online search, ecommerce, and social media, specifically targeting big tech companies such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple. An exceptionally broad probe, the agency announced this afternoon it would seek to learn if such companies had “reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers.”

The FTC and DOJ, which both possess antitrust powers, have been prepping for action against these mega-corporations for months, divvying up which agency would pursue which tech giant. Some of the companies being probed by the DOJ, like Amazon, were initially believed to fall under the purview of the FTC alone, lending heightened seriousness to the review. The full extent of actions from either agency, however, remains largely open-ended, and it’s possible both agencies may pursue separate probes into the same companies.

News of the DOJ’s move comes less than two weeks after the FTC fined Facebook for $5 billion over its handling of the Cambridge Analytica scandal—a wrist slap congressional Democrats found woefully inadequate—and hours after the Washington Post reported the agency had approved unprecedented oversight measure over Facebook’s privacy policies.

According to the Wall Street Journal, the DOJ has already held closed-door hearings to receive testimony from critics of Facebook.

“If violations of law are identified,” the DOJ wrote this afternoon, “the Department will proceed appropriately to seek redress,” which would include issues outside the scope of antitrust that are nonetheless discovered during the process of their research.

‘It’s a disaster over there’: Commerce reaches new heights of dysfunction,https://www.politico.com,['Daniel Lippman'],07-22-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/22/wilbur-ross-commerce-department-dysfunction-1424427,"Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross doesn’t hold routine meetings with senior staffers, according to a person familiar with the department’s inner workings, ""Because he tends to fall asleep in meetings."" | Win McNamee/Getty Images Finance & Tax ‘It’s a disaster over there’: Commerce reaches new heights of dysfunction Under Secretary Wilbur Ross, the department is chaotic and adrift.

Constant infighting among top officials. Sudden departures of senior staffers without explanation. A leader who is disengaged and prone to falling asleep in meetings.

The Commerce Department has reached its apex of dysfunction under Wilbur Ross, according to four people with knowledge of the inner workings of the department. The 81-year-old Commerce secretary, who has for months endured whispers that he is on the outs, spends much of his time at the White House to try to retain President Donald Trump’s favor, the sources said, leaving his department adrift.

Story Continued Below

He’s hardly the only top Trump official to seek the president’s approval. But department insiders say they’ve rarely seen Commerce so rudderless — and they say Ross’ penchant for managing upward at the expense of his staff is leading to what one plugged-in observer described as “a disaster over there.”

“With our ongoing trade wars and the census looming, Commerce needs functional leadership to be effective, and right now they just don’t have it,” said Theo LeCompte, a former top Commerce official in the Obama administration who speaks often with former colleagues.

One common complaint: Ross, a successful investor before Trump tapped him as secretary of Commerce, isn’t frequently seen in the building talking to employees or rallying them to do good work.

“He’s sort of seen as kind of irrelevant. The morale is very low there because there’s not a lot of confidence in the secretary,” said a former outside adviser to Commerce who is still in touch with many employees at the department. “He’s not respected in the building.”

Ross doesn’t hold routine meetings with senior staffers, according to a person familiar with the department’s inner workings and a former outside adviser — a departure from past practice that one source attributed to the secretary’s lack of stamina.

“Because he tends to fall asleep in meetings, they try not to put him in a position where that could happen so they’re very careful and conscious about how they schedule certain meetings,” said the former outside adviser. “There’s a small window where he’s able to focus and pay attention and not fall asleep.”

A Commerce official disputed that criticsm, saying that Ross has frequent afternoon meetings, including “long” meetings on the census.

“Secretary Ross is a tireless worker who is the sole decision-maker at the department,"" said Commerce press secretary Kevin Manning. ""He routinely works 12-hour days and travels often, with visits to seven countries and eight states in the last three months to advance the president’s agenda.""

Yet top Commerce officials have pushed to not have Ross called to testify at congressional oversight hearings, according to two sources close to the department, because they fear he isn’t up to the task. “There’s a great deal of effort to shield him from testifying ever again,” said one of the sources.

A Commerce official disputed that and said, “He’s obviously going to have to testify again. … You can’t get through the rest of [congressional appropriations] season without testifying again.”

Ross did testify at an oversight hearing on the census for nearly seven hours in March, and emerged through the ordeal generally unscathed. But according to one person familiar with the department, the consensus among the top ranks of the administration was that it would be best to avoid a repeat appearance.

“There was a great deal of concern to not have him testify expressed from the White House,” this person said, characterizing the instructions as: “‘Don’t do this, people. Don’t do this, he’s probably not the right guy to go there.’”

Ross certainly has other reasons to avoid Congress — namely, the heated dispute between Hill Democrats and the administration over adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201906/3704/1155968404_6052147728001_6051795407001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

In April, Ross offered to send aides to testify on his behalf before a House Appropriations subcommittee, an offer the panel’s Democratic chairman, José Serrano, said showed “stunning disrespect.” Serrano’s Republican counterpart, Robert Aderholt, told Reuters that Ross refused to testify out of “concern that this hearing might focus more on political or legal issues than the budget itself.”

“His relationship with the Hill has deteriorated more and more, and he’s just not interested in dealing with the Hill if he can avoid it,” said a person familiar with the department’s internal discussions.

A Commerce official noted that Ross talked to Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) two weeks ago, and held a party two months ago that a number of senators attended. Another Commerce employee observed, “This administration is very hesitant to do oversight in general or to comply with oversight requests in general.”

There are public signs, however, of apparent unease with Ross as a spokesperson for the administration. At an appearance at the White House in mid-July on an announcement on abandoning the citizenship question in the census, the Commerce secretary stood next to Trump the entire time and was one of three people who didn’t speak. Attorney General Bill Barr, on the other hand, spoke at length.

Ross’ relationship with the White House and with Trump was also damaged by stories that came out in the past 18 months showing that he wasn’t as rich as he had claimed and hadn’t fully divested some stock as he had promised, according to the former outside adviser. (The Commerce official disputed that, arguing that the White House has not cared about these issues.)

Ross’s deputies, meanwhile, are coming under fire of their own as tensions rise withini the department.

Political appointees sometimes close doors right in front of career employees to keep them out of meetings, one former Commerce official in touch with former colleagues said.

Meanwhile, “it’s totally infighting among the politicals,” said another person familiar with the department. “It’s just everybody fighting everybody.” In particular, the relationship between Ross’ office and the legislative affairs team is “clearly broken,” this person said.

Charles “Kolo” Rathburn, who had been acting head of legislative affairs, “was unceremoniously let go” and abruptly left earlier in July, according to a person familiar with Commerce and the outside adviser, who said it had to do with issues of professional conduct in the workplace. Another person familiar with Commerce also confirmed his departure.

“He wasn’t allowed to clean out his office,” said one of the people. Rathburn had replaced Mike Platt, who had left in early May.

A Commerce official said Rathburn, who didn’t respond to requests for comment, is working to pass the bar exam and has an offer for a higher-paying position at a law firm if he does.

Ross Branson, who had been deputy assistant secretary of legislative affairs and was Platt’s deputy, also left Commerce on Friday, according to two people familiar with his departure. He had become “collateral damage,” according to one of the people, and was told that he had to look for a new job. He starts on Monday as head of legislative affairs at the Export-Import Bank, a position that a Commerce official described as “definitely a promotion.” Branson and the Ex-Im Bank did not respond to a request for comment.

Much of the tension inside the building has centered on Earl Comstock, who shepherded Ross’ confirmation on Capitol Hill and is one of the secretary’s top lieutenants as the department's policy director.

The disarray inside Commerce is drawing an intervention from chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and other White House officials, who are trying to figure out how to wrest control from Comstock, who increasingly seems to be involved in everything that happens inside the department.

“Things come to a screeching halt because he demands to be the final decision on everything whether it’s an email that goes out to the Hill or a letter to respond to X, Y and Z,” said a person familiar with Commerce.

Comstock, who didn’t respond to requests for comment, has also been at the center of many of the spectrum battles between the Federal Communications Commission and the departments of Transportation, Education, Commerce and NASA and NOAA, according to an administration official. He has “literally been seeding bad intel and bad information to get other people agitated,” said the official.

He also tried to scuttle a joint White House-FCC summit on 5G, the wireless technology, in April by “calling everyone he could 24 hours before the event trying to get it to be canceled,” this person said. Comstock clashed in particular with former National Telecommunications and Information Administration chief David Redl, who left his post abruptly in May.

Critics of Ross’ leadership at Commerce also have a new target of concern: chief of staff Michael Walsh, who is described by some as inexperienced on policy and difficult to work with.

Walsh didn’t respond to a request for comment, but the Commerce official said that he has good relationships throughout the administration and on the Hill and visits the White House frequently. A second person familiar with Commerce also claimed, “People want his job so they’re spreading bad stuff on him.”

The chaos inside the department has had consequences for some employees.

“There’s great frustration among people who really want to use their skills and talents to help this country and are being marginalized by a White House who doesn’t need to ask any questions because it already thinks it has the answers,” said Roger Fisk, a Commerce official in the Obama administration. “All of that expertise is just lying dormant hiding in plain sight.""

Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.) managed to get a compelling answer out of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller with a very direct question: ""Why didn't you subpoena the president?""

Mueller in response to Maloney's question about the lack of a subpoena during this House Intelligence Committee hearing explained that his team spent a year attempting to secure an interview with Trump to no avail.

""We decided that we did not want to exercise the subpoena powers because of the necessity of expediting the end of the investigation,"" Mueller said. ""The expectation was if we did subpoena the president, he would fight the subpoena, and we would be in the midst of the investigation for a substantial period of time.""

Trump ultimately answered some questions for Mueller in writing, but the former special counsel admitted during his testimony that these written responses were ""certainly not as useful as the interview would be.""

Maloney seemed critical of this decision by Mueller, suggesting either that he ""flinched"" or that he ""didn't think you needed it"" because there was already a ""substantial body of evidence"" against Trump without an interview. But Mueller, clearly, would directly not comment on this, only saying they had to balance ""how much evidence"" they had with ""how much time"" they were ""willing to spend in the courts.""

Later, when asked by Val Demings (D-Fla.) if it's ""fair to say that the president's written answers ... showed that he wasn't always being truthful,"" Mueller said that it ""generally"" is. Brendan Morrow"
"The Justice Department’s new Big Tech investigation was announced with unusual fanfare, and some antitrust experts say it might not herald as big of a crackdown as it seems",https://www.businessinsider.com,['Troy Wolverton'],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.businessinsider.com/doj-unusual-antitrust-announcement-could-be-good-for-big-tech-2019-7,"The US Department of Justice's surprise press release Tuesday of its Big Tech investigation was designed to send a signal to a lot of groups — but tech companies were not really one of them.

The announcement was an unusually public performance by a federal regulator which typically prizes confidentiality in such matters. That's because it was basically a notice, intended particularly to a key figure in Congress, that the Justice Department will now be spearheading the antitrust investigations into the big tech companies, said David Balto, an antitrust lawyer in Washington D.C. with decades of experience working for and with competition regulators officials there.

For tech companies, the DOJs' announcement was if anything, a subtle indication that the government may not come down as hard on them as it might seem, he said.

""This is good news for the companies,"" Balto said.

That may seem a bit ironic, given the substance of the announcement. In its statement, the Justice Department said it would review the market power of the ""leading online platforms"" to see if they have thwarted competition or harmed consumers. The agency vowed to ""seek redress"" if it found violations, essentially threatening to sue the companies.

Read this: The Department of Justice just launched a broad probe into whether big tech companies like Amazon, Facebook, and others illegally harm competition

The announcement came as something of a surprise. Numerous reports have indicated that the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission were starting to look into the competitive practices of the big tech companies. But the agencies had declined to comment on the record for those reports. In fact, federal enforcement agencies rarely acknowledge ongoing investigations into particular people or companies.

The agency is likely responding to political pressure

Unusual as it was, the Justice Department's move didn't come out of nowhere. Political figures on the left and right, including senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders and President Donald Trump, have been calling for increased scrutiny of the market power of the big tech companies and even, in many cases, for breaking them up.

""There is enormous political pressure on the agencies in Washington to be seen as doing something about big tech,"" said Daniel Crane, a professor at the University of Michigan's law school who focuses on antitrust issues. He continued: ""This is their way of responding to the political pressure.""

But Balto thinks there something more going on. Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported that the FTC and the Justice Department had divvied up oversight over the tech giants. Under the agreement, the FTC was to get authority over Facebook and Amazon, while the Department of Justice would oversee Apple and Google parent Alphabet.

The problem with that arrangement was that Mike Lee, who serves as chairman of Senate Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on antitrust, competition policy and consumer rights, objected to it, Balto noted. In an opinion piece published by the Washington Examiner last month, Lee lambasted the idea that the agencies would split oversight duties over the big tech companies. The two agencies risked duplicating efforts and causing a divergence in enforcement, he said.

""These investigations will clearly cover much of the same ground,"" Lee said in his op-ed. ""Splitting antitrust investigations of these firms between two agencies,"" he continued, ""is just analytically inefficient.""

The Justice Department is saying it's in charge

Lee's subcommittee was scheduled to hold a hearing on Tuesday with top antitrust regulators in the Trump administration at which he was expected to question them over the decision to split up oversight of the tech companies. That hearing ended up being postponed, but, in Balto's view, the Justice Department's announcement was its way of responding to Lee's concerns by staking out its turf.

""This is really the (Justice Department) saying, 'thank you, it's my football, and I plan to play with it,'"" he said.

The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the Justice Department's review would not pre-empt the investigations already underway by the FTC into the companies under its purview.

Balto says that while the Justice Department may leave some issues to the FTC, Tuesday's announcement indicates that the DOJ is laying claim to all inquiries involving online platform and marketplace issues — the core of the antitrust charges made against the big tech companies. Senator Elizabeth Warren and others have raised concerns about how those companies use their control over their platforms and marketplaces to give their own products and services a leg up over rivals.

""These issues are incredibly complex, time consuming, and really difficult, and to have two agencies looking at the same conduct really didn't make sense,"" Balto said.

Lee's office did not respond to calls or an email seeking comment. Likewise, the Justice Department did not respond to an email seeking comment.

The move could be good news for the tech giants

The news that the Justice Department was opening up its review was seen as a negative sign on Wall Street Tuesday. The big four companies' stock prices all fell following the announcement.

But having the Justice Department take point on antitrust review is actually a good thing for the tech companies, Balto said. The Department of Justice hasn't filed a major suit under the Sherman Antitrust Act since the Microsoft case two decades ago. And the agency actually has fewer legal options when it comes to policing competition than does the FTC, he said.

""I don't think anybody's going to lose any more sleep that this is all with the Justice Department,"" Balto said. ""If anything, they'll feel more comfortable in their legal position.""

For his part, Crane is dubious that anything much will come of the investigations in the near future, regardless of which agency is leading the charge. When it comes to antitrust enforcement, the FTC's track record is not much better than the Department of Justice in recent decades, despite theoretically having enhanced enforcement powers, he said.

The courts have made it difficult for regulators to win antitrust cases, and even when such cases are successful, they tend to take many years to play out. Because of that, there's little chance the big tech companies will be broken up anytime soon, despite the political pressure on them, he said.

""The kind of blockbuster, 'let's break them up' case that is being trumpeted politically, I just don't see that being in the offing,"" Crane said.

White House nixed DHS chief McAleenan Refugee Day border welcome for migrants,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/dhs-chief-mcaleenan-wanted-to-visit-border-and-welcome-migrants-for-refugee-day-white-house-said-no,"The White House communications team and the Department of Homeland Security's acting secretary office engaged in a tense argument last month after acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan proposed traveling down to the U.S.-Mexico border on World Refugee Day to celebrate and welcome migrants, including those who entered illegally, two senior administration officials told the Washington Examiner.

A senior public affairs official at DHS asked the White House in early June for permission to go down to the southern border with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar on June 20. One person identified the official as acting DHS Assistant Secretary of Public Affairs Andrew Meehan.

""The wildly off base proposal was met with immediate concern as not being thought through,"" one official told the Washington Examiner Monday evening.

A second official said the White House was concerned about the ""optics"" if two Cabinet officials were welcoming people who had illegally crossed into the country when President Trump has taken a hard stance against any type of illegal immigration, including against those who are seeking asylum on the southern border.

The DHS official trying to advance McAleenan's proposal refused to accept the White House's decision and ""sparred with"" several members of the White House strategic communications team, including then-director Mercedes Schlapp, over ""multiple contentious phone calls,"" the first source said. The second official said the fight lasted ""weeks.""

""The obvious glaring concern was that the border crisis was about migrants and asylums, not refugees, DHS disagreed,"" the first official wrote in a text, suggesting the the appearance would seem supportive of the people abusing the system instead of legitimate refugees.

The same official said Azar was not supportive of McAleenan's idea and was not planning to go along for the trip. The second official said Azar was on board, but added neither secretary ""understood the ramifications"" of such a trip.

The June 20 World Refugee Day celebration may not have been greenlighted but McAleenan did go to the border on that date. He flew with a Washington Post reporter on Thursday. It's not clear if Azar traveled down separately. An HHS spokeswoman would only say: ""In the past year and a half, Secretary Azar has visited numerous Office of Refugee Resettlement facilities and seen the quality of care provided to unaccompanied alien children.

DHS did not deny that McAleenan's office requested a trip on World Refugee Day and instead shared a schedule of events he took part in while on the border that day.

""On June 20, 2019, Acting Secretary McAleenan hosted the first ladies of Guatemala and Honduras for a tour of the Rio Grande Valley Border Patrol Sector,"" a DHS official wrote in an email Thursday. ""The trip included an overview of how transnational criminal and human smuggling organizations pair adult aliens with children they are not related to with the intent of posing as family units to help secure release into the U.S.""

The day after, June 21, the Washington Post published a story leaking confidential details of a nationwide Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation, which five current and former senior administration officials charged to the Washington Examiner that McAleenan leaked because he did not approve of the raids and sought to sabotage them.

""This is a DHS leadership team who has been at odds with the administration from the beginning. It’s a difference of world view,"" the first official said Monday.

The DHS Office of Inspector General has taken up the formal investigation into the leak of government information in late June, which forced ICE to call off a nationwide operation, the Washington Examiner was first to report.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

The Agriculture Department acknowledged Tuesday that its latest push to cut back on who is eligible for food stamp benefits may worsen food insecurity in the U.S.

The Trump administration has just released a proposed rule seeking to rein in what's known as broad-based categorical eligibility. That policy has allowed 43 states to expand the number of low-income people who qualify for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps.

Story Continued Below

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said the policy is a ""loophole"" that needs to be closed because it's allowed states to bypass ""important eligibility guidelines.""

In a cost-benefit analysis, USDA estimates that tightening the policy would cut 3.1 million people from the program, saving taxpayers about $1.9 billion a year. The department also clearly states that the proposed change ""may also negatively impact food security.""

According to USDA, nearly 12 percent of U.S. households are already food insecure, which means they do not always have access to enough food as a result of a lack of resources.

The proposal is part of a broader Trump administration bid to cut federal aid programs, something conservatives have long argued is necessary as the federal deficit grows.

Broad-based categorical eligibility allows states to confer SNAP eligibility to households if they're receiving some kind of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF. The option allows states to get around the typical asset limits and expands the income limits for SNAP in some cases.

For example, the typical gross income limit for SNAP is 130 percent of the federal poverty level. That comes out to be about $27,000 for a family of three.

By using broad-based categorical eligibility, many states are able to offer SNAP benefits to households with gross income of up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level, which is about $42,000 for a family of three.

""Too often, states have misused this flexibility without restraint,” Perdue said in a statement released as part of the announcement. “The American people expect their government to be fair, efficient, and to have integrity — just as they do in their own homes, businesses, and communities.""

The department now wants to have the expanded eligibility option for states only if the household is receiving a TANF benefit such as subsidized employment, work supports or child care benefits.

USDA acknowledges that millions could lose assistance if the eligibility rule is changed, potentially worsening hunger among many low-income households.

""The proposed rule may also negatively impact food security and reduce the savings rates among those individuals who do not meet the income and resource eligibility requirements for SNAP or the substantial and ongoing requirements for expanded categorical eligibility,"" the department says in its impact analysis.

USDA estimates that about 9 percent of SNAP households would no longer qualify for the program.

The department also estimates that more than 13 percent of all SNAP households with elderly members would lose benefits.

""The proposed rule is relatively less likely to affect households with children — only 7.4 percent are expected to no longer meet eligibility requirements,"" the department said.

The plan would also hurt grocery retailers, according to USDA. The total loss in SNAP benefits would be $3 billion per year, which would be a hit to business at large and small retailers alike, the department said.

For a small retailer, the potential benefit loss might make up less than 5 percent of their typical SNAP business, USDA said.

House Republicans had sought a similar crackdown on broad-based categorical eligibility during the 2018 farm bill debate, but the changes were rejected in the final bipartisan deal.

Anti-hunger advocates and Democrats on Capitol Hill blasted the administration on Tuesday over the proposal, arguing that USDA is essentially going around Congress to enact a policy lawmakers already rejected.

""It is yet another attack on hungry Americans that ignores the clearly stated will of Congress,"" said Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio), chairwoman of the House Agriculture Nutrition Subcommittee.

""The ugly truth no one in this administration wants to admit is this: The economy isn’t working for our most vulnerable,"" Fudge added. ""They still need a hand up, not a heartless, mean-spirited policy.”"
State Department yanks data on U.S. tourists harmed in Jamaica,https://www.freep.com,"['Tresa Baldas', 'Published A.M. Et July']",07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2019/07/23/state-department-american-tourists-jamaica/1796973001/,"CLOSE

At a time when tourism fears have escalated in the Caribbean, the State Department has stopped publishing crime data involving Americans harmed in Jamaica — but it won't say why.

For the first time in seven years, the State Department did not list how many Americans were sexually assaulted, robbed, murdered or kidnapped in Jamaica in its 2019 Crime and Safety Report. That information was previously published in reports that were cited in a 2018 Free Press investigation, which found that sexual assaults of U.S. tourists in Jamaica is an historic and unchecked problem, with an estimated one American raped a month.

That's according to State Department data that was publicly available for seven straight years — until now.

The Free Press, which interviewed numerous U.S. victims who said they were sexually assaulted in Jamaica, including four Michigan tourists, asked the State Department multiple times why the 2019 report omits data involving American crime victims in Jamaica. The agency wouldn't explain, beyond saying: “We do not have any other information to share at this time.""

These are the choke marks that an 18-year-old South African au pair says she suffered after being drugged and raped at a Sandals-owned beaches resort in Jamaica on July 4, 2018. She says Sandals paid her American host family $25,000 and silenced them with a non-disclosure agreement (Photo: South African au pair)

But the State Department did warn in its 2019 report that ""rape and sexual assault are serious problems throughout Jamaica, including at resorts and hotels. The use of date rape drugs is possible, even at private parties and resorts.""

The Jamaica 2019 Crime and Safety Report was released in the wake of a tourism scare involving the Dominican Republic, where 10 American tourist deaths have been reported since May. Several more U.S. tourists have reported becoming severely ill while on vacation there, including a Detroit man who landed in Harper Hospital's ICU following his May vacation to the DR.

Jamaica and the Dominican Republic are among nine Caribbean and Central American destinations that the U.S. State Department has issued Level 2 travel advisories for, citing violence and crime. Level 2 means “Exercise Increased Caution.” The other countries on the Level 2 travel advisory list are: The Bahamas, Belize, Colombia, Cuba, Turks and Caicos, Mexico and Guatemala.

There are four categories of travel advisories: “Level 1: Exercise Normal Precautions”; “Level Two: Exercise Increased Caution”; “Level 3: Reconsider Travel” and “Level 4: Do Not Travel.”

Caribbean destinations that are currently deemed safe for travel — they have no travel advisory — include:

Anguilla, Antigua, Aruba, Barbados, Bonaire

British Virgin Islands

Cayman Islands

Costa Rica, Curaçao, Grenada

French West Indies, which include Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Saint Martin, and Saint Barthélemy.

Saint Kitts and Nevis

Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines

Countries on the “Level 3, Reconsider Travel” list are:

El Salvador

Honduras

Nicaragua

Haiti

Countries on the “Level 4, Do Not Travel” list are:

Venezuela

While the FBI investigates the Dominican Republic deaths, tourism officials there are working feverishly to dispel concerns about travel safety. So are officials in Jamaica, where an island-wide security audit of resorts was ordered in the wake of the Free Press investigation, which detailed the rapes of two Detroit women who were attacked at gunpoint by a Jamaican resort employee last fall.

Jamaica's Minister of Tourism Edmund Bartlett said in early July that the months-long security audit is complete and that his office is reviewing it. Findings have not yet been released.

“The issue of safety and security is very central to us. We will have further discussions with the (Jamaica Hotel and Tourist Association) as it relates to the recommendations, and together we will craft the new architecture in Jamaica,” Bartlett said at a June tourism meeting.

The audit sought to uncover, among other things, non-compliance by resorts regarding safety incidents. It focused on building safety, personnel, security measures, communication devices and security incident history.

Meanwhile, State Department warnings about sexual violence against women tourists in Jamaica continue.

""If you are a victim of a sexual assault, contact the police and the U.S. Embassy in Kingston as soon as possible,"" the State Department states in its 2019 report, reminding victims that Jamaican hotels and resorts ""should assist you with these communications.""

That message highlighted a key finding in the Free Press investigation.

Numerous victims told the Free Press the resorts ignored or downplayed their fears, discouraged them from going to the police, and in some cases silenced them with free travel in exchange for them signing non-disclosure agreements.

The 2019 State Department report also highlighted this finding by the Free Press: tourists who are sexually assaulted in Jamaica feel justice is out of reach. As one mother told the Free Press three years after her daughter was allegedly raped in a laundry room by a resort lifeguard: ""My daughter will never have justice.""

CLOSE The rapes of two Detroit women at a Jamaican resort has highlighted a pervasive problem on the island getaway: sexual assaults are ignored. Tresa Baldas, Detroit Free Press

Four and a half years after the alleged rapes of the girl and her friend, the case is finally going to trial in Jamaica in December. The victims will testify from a location in the U.S.

The State Department warns about such delays.

""Victims of sexual assault in Jamaica should not expect the same assistance routinely offered in the United States,"" the State Department writes in its 2019 report. ""Rape kits are not always available, and victims must often ask for medication to avoid STD transmission and reduce the chances of pregnancy. An offer of counseling is unlikely.""

Police resources are also limited, the government says.

""Law enforcement shortcomings exist in collection of evidence. Prosecution of rape cases moves very slowly,"" the State Department states, adding: ""Victims may need to return to Jamaica during the legal process.""

Lindsey Graham says his 'deep dive' investigation of DOJ and FBI will include Papadopoulos testimony,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/lindsey-graham-says-his-deep-dive-investigation-of-doj-and-fbi-will-include-papadopoulos-testimony,"Republican South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said Tuesday that his “deep dive” into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation would include testimony from former Trump campaign associate George Papadopoulos, whose interactions with the mysterious Joseph Mifsud allegedly led to the FBI opening an inquiry into Trump in July 2016.

Papadopoulos was swept up in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, and he ultimately pleaded guilty about lying to investigators.

Graham, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said his committee “will be looking at the counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign.”

“We will call Papadopoulos and we will find out what happened,” Graham promised.

Graham said he would wait until the completion of the investigation by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz into possible abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The allegations of abuse are related to the Justice Department and the FBI using a salacious and unverified dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele to surveil a member of the Trump campaign.

Steele had been hired by the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which itself had been hired by the Clinton campaign and the DNC through the Perkins Come law firm, facts which were not revealed to the FISA Court.

Trump granted Attorney General William Barr broad declassification authority, and Barr selected U.S. Attorney John Durham to be his right-hand man in a separate inquiry into why and how the Justice Department and the FBI launched an investigation into Trump.

“We’ll wait on Mr. Horowitz to do his report about the FISA warrant abuse,” Graham said. “But we’ll take a deep dive into the 2016 surveillance by the FBI and other organizations and campaigns to make sure we know what we’re doing and that there are protocols in place to ensure that we don’t play politics with the law.”

In recent days, Graham has been shedding more light on what his own follow-up investigation is going to look like, saying last week that he had questions for former FBI Director James Comey about his handling of the dossier, for former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe about the importance of the dossier in the FISA applications, and for Papadopoulos about whether he was really trying to make inroads with the Russians.

Papadopoulos pleaded guilty in October 2017 to making false statements to the FBI about his contacts with Mifsud and served just 12 days in federal prison late last year. He is now on supervised release.

""I’m going to deep-dive into how this stuff started,” Graham said last weekend. “How could it go so far if there was no collusion?” Graham said that the probe by the Justice Department and the FBI into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia that began under President Obama was a “politicized investigation.”"
Facebook and Other Big Tech Stocks Are Barely Moving on the DoJ’s New Probe. Here’s Why.,https://www.barrons.com,['Eric J. Savitz'],,,,https://www.barrons.com/articles/doj-investigation-tech-stocks-51563989279,"Text size

Large-cap tech shares are mostly shrugging off the news that the U.S. Department of Justice plans to review “the practices of market-leading online platforms.” Indeed, today’s news is brimming with reports on regulatory actions against tech businesses—but the real market moving news on tech this week will be financial.

Facebook (ticker: FB) reports earnings Wednesday; Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) report Thursday. On Tuesday, Snap (SNAP) reported huge user growth, and the stock is on fire. Investors don’t believe that Washington’s investigations will have a material impact on big tech’s financial results, so they are largely ignoring them for now.

It’s a busy day on the regulatory front, even aside from the DoJ story.

Facebook (FB) reached an agreement with the Federal Trade Commission to pay a $5 billion fine over the company’s data privacy practices. In announcing the penalty, the FTC said the agreement also “requires Facebook to restructure its approach to privacy from the corporate board-level down, and establishes strong new mechanisms to ensure that Facebook executives are accountable for the decisions they make about privacy, and that those decisions are subject to meaningful oversight.”

Facebook said the agreement “provides a comprehensive new framework for protecting people’s privacy and the information they give us.”

But Democrats on the Commission observed that the penalties were more or less meaningless in the larger scheme of things—something investors had already figured out.

“The proposed settlement does little to change [Facebook’s] business model or practices,” writes Commissioner Rohit Chopra in a dissenting opinion. “The settlement imposes no meaningful changes to the company’s structure or financial incentives, which led to these violations. Nor does it include any restrictions on the company’s mass surveillance or advertising tactics. Instead, the order allows Facebook to decide for itself how much information it can harvest from users and what it can do with that information, as long as it creates a paper trail.”

Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter writes in her own dissent that in the interest of shedding a spotlight on Facebook’s behavior, the FTC should have litigated the matter. “The Commission would better serve the public interest and be more likely to effectively change Facebook by fighting for the right outcome in a public court of law,” she writes.

Meanwhile, Facebook yesterday also reached a deal with the Securities and Exchange Commission to pay a $100 million fine “for making misleading disclosures regarding the risk of misuse of Facebook user data,” a case tied to the Cambridge Analytica scandal. (On Wednesday, Netflix happened to unveil a new documentary on Facebook and the Cambridge Analytica story called The Great Hack.)

Additionally, The Wall Street Journal reports that Apple (APPL) appears to be favoring its own apps in App Store searches. The Journal writes that “the company’s apps ranked first in more than 60% of basic searches, such as for ‘maps,’ the analysis showed. Apple apps that generate revenue through subscriptions or sales, like Music or Books, showed up first in 95% of searches related to those apps.”

While the DoJ announcement Tuesday didn’t name names, there’s little mystery about which companies the government has in mind.

“The Department’s review will consider the widespread concerns that consumers, businesses, and entrepreneurs have expressed about search, social media, and some retail services online,” the government said in a press release.

“The goal of the Department’s review is to assess the competitive conditions in the online marketplace in an objective and fair-minded manner and to ensure Americans have access to free markets in which companies compete on the merits to provide services that users want. If violations of law are identified, the Department will proceed appropriately to seek redress.”

The language suggests they are going after four of the world’s largest companies by market cap—Alphabet’s Google unit dominates search, Facebook rules social media, and Amazon.com is synonymous with online retail. Apple likely falls under the online retail rubric, as well, given its dominant App Store platform.

A spokesman for Google declined to comment on the DoJ announcement directly, and instead pointed to testimony last week by Adam Cohen, Google’s director of economic policy, during a House subcommittee hearing on online platforms. “In the face of intense competition, we are proud of our record of continued innovation,” he said. “We have helped reduce prices and expand choice for consumers and merchants in the U.S. and around the world. We have created new competition in many sectors, and new competitive pressures often lead to concerns from rivals. We have consistently shown how our business is designed and operated to benefit our customers.”

Apple declined to comment on the DoJ announcement, while Facebook and Amazon didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

Microsoft (MSFT), largely a cloud play now and the world’s most valuable public company, was once the government’s favorite tech target. It appears to have avoided the investigators this time around.

It’s not entirely clear how the DoJ announcement relates to previous news that the FTC and the Justice Department had agreed to divvy up their investigatory responsibilities, with Justice taking on Apple and Google, and the FTC focusing on Amazon and Facebook. But the overall intent seems the same—to curb the behavior of tech giants.

So how is this likely to play out?

Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a research note Wednesday that any push to break up the companies is likely to fail. Current antitrust law is intended to protect consumers against predatory pricing, not punish companies for being big and successful.

In the cases of Google and Facebook, the companies don’t charge for their primary products—so there’s no pricing, let alone predatory pricing. To assess the market effect of the companies on other measures isn’t impossible, but, Ives notes, it would likely require changes in antitrust law, and in the current political mood in Washington, that seems “exceedingly unlikely.”

Legislation could have a more immediate impact, though, particularly the pending California Consumer Privacy Act, which Barron’srecently covered. The law goes into effect in January and is intended to force changes in the way companies collect and sell personal information. For Google and Facebook, and increasingly for Apple and Amazon, the ability to sell targeted ads is of huge value. Federal legislation to do the same could be the route to real change in the tech business, with a higher probability of success than antitrust enforcement.

Ives predicts that Congress and the DoJ will investigate, and find “no harm, no foul.” He thinks investors should buy all of the big four stocks on any weakness relating to the investigations.

In afternoon trading, Facebook is down 0.4% to $201.51; Alphabet is down 1.2%, to $1,134.75; Apple is down 0.4%, to $208.03; and Amazon is 0.3%, to $1988.95. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is up 0.4%.

"Some Alabama sheriffs give concealed gun permits without full background checks, DOJ says",https://www.al.com,"['Carol Robinson', 'Crobinson Al.Com']",07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.al.com/news/birmingham/2019/07/some-alabama-sheriffs-give-concealed-gun-permits-without-full-background-checks-doj-says.html,"Some Alabama sheriffs have been issuing concealed carry permits to people without full background checks or even when the National Instant Criminal Background Check System denied the application, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives announced this week.

As a result, federally-licensed gun shops across Alabama can no longer accept a concealed carry permit as proof that a criminal background check has been done on a buyer.

Federal officials did not name the sheriffs who issued the permits.

As a result of the practice, authorities said, guns have been transferred to convicted felons and other prohibited buyers in violation of federal law, thereby creating “a substantial public safety concern.” They have not said how many guns may have been transferred to prohibited buyers.

The Brady Act, which took effect in November 1998, requires federal firearms licensees to conduct the NICS background check before selling a gun to an unlicensed person. The Brady Act, however, has exceptions to the NIC check requirement, including an exception for holders of certain state permits to possess, carry or acquire firearms.

In 2016, ATF informed all Alabama federal firearms licensees that under Alabama law, the states concealed carry permits issued on or after Aug. 1, 2013 qualified as an alternative to a NICS. ATF’s determination, authorities said, was based on the understanding that full NICS check would be conducted by the government agencies issued the concealed carry permits and that if the background check showed the person was prohibited form possession a firearm under federal or state law, the applicant would be denied a permit.

“Based on recent information received from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Criminal Justice Information Services Division Audit Unit, and upon results of inspections conducted by ATF field offices, ATF has determined that...CCP permits have been, and continue to be, issued to individuals without completion of a NICS check, or after a NICS denial,’’ according to the DOJ press release. “At least some of these permits were issued to felons and other federally prohibited persons who used them purchase firearms from Alabama FFLs without a NICS check.”

Additionally, ATF officials said, the determined that some Alabama counties – again they have not released the names of those counties – have not been requiring non-U.S. citizen concealed carry permit applicants to submit the necessary information for authorities to conduct an Immigration Alien Query.

The audit, authorities said, was done in 2018 and all Alabama gun shops have been notified of the change. “The concealed carry permit is still needed but is no longer accepted as a background check,’’ said ATF spokesman Michael Knight. “That’s the way it used to be and the way it is in most states.”

He said the threshold used by sheriff’s offices is different and not as extensive as the checks done by federal firearms licensees.

“The gun shops took the concealed carry permit (as proof of a background check) in a good faith,’’ Knight said. “In reality, the gun shops always had the option to run their own anyway.”

Knight said they don’t know the full extent of the lapse because “We don’t know how many guns out there that have not been recovered yet.”

Jefferson County sheriff’s spokesman Capt. David Agee said they do a complete background check on all permit applicants. ""Our process is complete,'' he said.

ATF officials, as well as Shane Thomas, general manager at Birmingham Pistol Wholesale, say the only change the buyers will see is perhaps a longer wait. “They may have to wait up to five days,’’ Thomas said. “There will be people who don’t understand but we’ll obey (the mandate) and move on.”

He said for the most part, using the concealed carry permit as a background check alternative was working but said the new mandate, “takes the guess work out of it.”

“It really doesn’t matter what we think,’’ Thomas said. “We’re going to do what we’re told to do.”"

Justice Department opens antitrust review of big US tech companies,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice-department-opens-antitrust-review-of-big-us-tech-companies,"The Department of Justice is opening a sweeping antitrust review into online platforms, potentially threatening some of Silicon Valley's most powerful companies.

The probe will examine how the platforms have gained market power and whether they are engaging in practices that stifle competition or hurt consumers in violation of federal law. The antitrust review, the Justice Department said, “will consider the widespread concerns that consumers, businesses and entrepreneurs have expressed about search, social media, and some retail services online.”

The agency intends to seek information from the public and key industry stakeholders and will “seek redress” if it finds any “market-leading online platforms” have violated antitrust laws.

“Without the discipline of market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands,” Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, who leads the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division, said in a statement.

The Justice Department said the aim of its probe is to “assess the competitive conditions in the online marketplace in an objective and fair-minded manner and to ensure Americans have access to free markets.”

While the companies targeted by the probe are not named, tech giants including Amazon, Google, and Facebook may be among those reviewed. Democratic presidential contender Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts senator, has said both Facebook and Amazon should be split up, in part because they compete against their own customers.

Republicans, too, have raised concerns that major online companies have gained too much power, and Europe has grown increasingly strict in regulating them.

In 2018, the European Commission fined Google $5.1 billion for anticompetitive practices, an amount that appears large until compared with the $103 billion in available funds the Mountain View, California-based company had at the time. It also ordered the company to halt problematic behavior that included forcing phonemakers who used the company's open-source Android operating system to install the Google Search and Google Chrome apps on devices in order to connect to the Google Play app store.

Amazon, founded by billionaire Jezz Bezos, now faces similar risks. Europe has started investigating Amazon's practice of selling some of the same merchandise as the retailers who use its e-commerce platform and might take steps from fining the company to forcing changes in its operations.

""There is something going on in terms of monopoly,"" President Trump told CNBC in an interview just weeks earlier, citing the number of European regulatory actions against large American tech companies including Amazon and Apple. ""We should be doing what they're doing.""

Amazon, for its part, has rejected claims that it exploits customers or competes unfairly. An Amazon executive underscored that position earlier this month, when he joined representatives of Facebook, Apple, and Google to field questions from the House antitrust committee about their compliance with U.S. competition laws.

Democrats, who say Amazon and others have benefited from lax regulation intended to fuel the growth of the internet and related businesses in the mid-1990s, were unconvinced.

""There's a growing consensus among venture capitalists and startups that there's a kill zone around Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple that prevents new startups from entering the market,"" said Rep. David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat who is chairman of the subcommittee. ""The combination of high network effects, high switching costs and the self-reinforcing advantage of data can result in a 'winner take all' market that shields the dominant firms."""
"DOJ Probing Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon",https://www.investopedia.com,['Mark Kolakowski'],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.investopedia.com/doj-antitrust-probe-of-big-tech-4694494,"The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has announced that it is ""reviewing the practices of market-leading online platforms,"" with a view towards determining whether they have ""reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers."" The DOJ press release indicates that they are responding to ""widespread concerns that consumers, businesses, and entrepreneurs have expressed about search, social media, and some retail services online.""

Goal of the Review

The goal of this review is to ""assess the competitive conditions in the online marketplace...and to ensure that Americans have access to free markets in which companies compete on the merits to provide services that users want.""

Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the Antitrust Division provided this quote for the press release: ""Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands.""

The DOJ says that it will ""seek redress"" for any violations of law, without offering any further specifics.

Likely Targets

The DOJ press release does not mention specific companies, but its language suggests that the key targets of this review are likely to be among the mega cap FAANG members. Facebook Inc. (FB) is the leader in social media, Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) is the preeminent online retailer, and the Google division of Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) is by far the dominant search engine. Apple Inc. (AAPL), meanwhile, has been mentioned in various press reports as another likely target.

Double Trouble

The DOJ already has been partnering with Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in reviewing competitive practices in the tech industry, with an eye towards possible antitrust violations, per an earlier report in Barron's. According to that article, the FTC is taking the lead on Amazon.com and Facebook, while the DOJ leads on Apple and Alphabet.

However, the current announcement from the DOJ seems to be ratcheting up the pressure on the tech giants, The Wall Street Journal reports. It now seems possible that a given company may face antitrust actions launched by both the DOJ and the FTC, greatly increasing the potential penalties. Meanwhile, executives from these same tech giants testified last week before a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee on antitrust matters.

Calls For Breakup

All four FAANG members mentioned above have been under fire from various quarters for allegedly monopolistic practices. In a recent ""private presentation"" to the DOJ, critics of Facebook, including some academics, reportedly argued that the company should be broken up, per the Journal. Google and Amazon also have faced calls for breakup at various times in recent years, from various constituencies."

WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency’s inspector general will investigate allegations that William L. Wehrum, the agency’s former air quality chief, violated ethics rules when he met with former clients from his days as a lawyer and lobbyist for the oil, gas and coal industries.

The inquiry will look into whether Mr. Wehrum’s efforts at the E.P.A. to weaken climate change and air pollution standards improperly benefited those former clients, a congressional aide said .

At issue are Mr. Wehrum’s ties to the Utility Air Regulatory Group, a coalition of utilities and trade groups that lobbies on behalf of coal-fired power plants, which he represented as a lawyer at his former firm, Hunton & Williams.

That relationship first drew scrutiny last year after Politico reported that the 25 power companies and six trade groups that make up the coalition paid the firm more than $8 million in 2017 just before President Trump appointed Mr. Wehrum.

DOJ opens antitrust inquiry into top tech companies,https://thehill.com,[],07-23-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/technology/454392-doj-opens-antitrust-inquiry-into-top-tech-companies,"The Department of Justice (DOJ) on Tuesday announced it is launching an investigation into whether the country's largest tech companies have stifled competition or harmed consumers, marking the department's widest-ranging inquiry into potential tech antitrust violations yet.

The DOJ's antitrust division is leading the probe, surveying ""whether and how market-leading online platforms have achieved market power and are engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers,"" the DOJ said in a statement.

The inquiry emerges as Silicon Valley is facing intensifying scrutiny from Washington, including looming record penalties from federal regulators and a separate antitrust investigation by bipartisan House lawmakers.

Facebook, Google and Amazon — some of the largest and most powerful tech companies in the world — could all be implicated in the DOJ's probe.

The department will ""consider the widespread concerns that consumers, businesses, and entrepreneurs have expressed about search, social media, and some retail services online,"" according to the statement.

Google dominates global search services, Facebook owns three of the top social media platforms, and Amazon is a leading player in online retail.

“Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands,” Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, who helms the antitrust division, said in a statement. “The Department’s antitrust review will explore these important issues.”

Delrahim, who will head the investigation, lobbied on Google's behalf in 2007 when it was facing antitrust scrutiny over its acquisition of DoubleClick, a top online advertising company that has boosted the company's dominance in digital ads. Delrahim reported a $100,000 paycheck from Google that year.

He also lobbied on behalf of Apple in 2006 and 2007 on patent reform.

Delrahim's former lobbying credentials have prompted some Democratic lawmakers, including 2020 contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann Warren Ocasio-Cortez about as well known as top Democrats: poll Warren presses Pelosi on impeachment: 'Some things are above politics' Overnight Defense: Esper sworn in as Pentagon chief | Confirmed in 90-8 vote | Takes helm as Trump juggles foreign policy challenges | Senators meet with woman accusing defense nominee of sexual assault MORE (D-Mass.), to call for him to recuse himself from any tech probes.

Reports over the past several months have indicated the DOJ and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) divvied up oversight of the country's largest tech giants in preparation for potential investigations into the companies' enormous market power.

Amazon declined to comment on the DOJ antitrust probe.

A Google spokesperson pointed The Hill to recent testimony by Adam Cohen, Google's director of economic policy.

Testifying before the House Judiciary Committee earlier this month, Cohen argued that Google has helped create competition. ""In the face of intense competition, we are proud of our record of continued innovation,"" Cohen told lawmakers. ""We have created new competition in many sectors, and new competitive pressures often lead to concerns from rivals.""

Google dominates online search, holding about 92 percent of the world's search engine market share, according to some estimates.

Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

According to the DOJ, if investigators identify ""violations of law ... the Department will proceed appropriately to seek redress.""

A growing chorus of critics, including some lawmakers on Capitol Hill, have started to question whether the country's antitrust laws need to be updated to align with the changing online landscape.

It comes as a growing number of lawmakers have called for stricter regulation or even breaking up of the big tech companies, which have come under intense scrutiny following a series of scandals that compromised users' privacy.

President Donald Trump also has relentlessly criticized the big tech companies by name in recent months. He frequently asserts, without evidence, that companies such as Facebook and Google are biased against him and conservative politicians.

The Justice Department did not name specific companies in its announcement.

Major tech companies that are already facing congressional antitrust scrutiny declined to comment on the Justice Department's probe.

Amazon had no comment. Facebook also did not have an immediate comment.

Google directed requests for comments to the testimony its director of economic policy, Adam Cohen, made to the House Judiciary Committee last week. Cohen reiterated the company's benefits to consumers.

Apple referred to comments from CEO Tim Cook, who told CBS last month he doesn't think ""anybody reasonable"" would call Apple a monopoly.

Earlier, the Washington Post reported that the Federal Trade Commission will allege that Facebook misled users about its privacy practices as part of an expected settlement of its 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal.

The federal business watchdog will reportedly find that Facebook deceived users about how it handled phone numbers it asked for as part of a security feature and provided insufficient information about how to turn off a facial recognition tool for photos.

Advertisers were reportedly able to target users who provided their phone number as part of a two-factor authentication security feature.

The FTC didn't respond immediately to a request for comment. Facebook had no comment.

Tech giants targeted by Justice Department antitrust review,https://www.mercurynews.com,"['Levi Sumagaysay', 'Levi Sumagaysay Is A Tech Reporter', 'Editor For The Mercury News. She Has Written Or Edited Technology News Since The First Dot-Com Boom', 'Is A Good Morning Silicon Valley Alum.']",07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/07/23/tech-giants-targeted-by-doj-antitrust-review/,"The Justice Department confirmed Tuesday that it has opened a wide-ranging antitrust review of tech giants and whether they are thwarting competition, raising the stakes for Silicon Valley just days after congressional hearings into the industry’s influence.

Although the government did not name names in its announcement, the “market-leading online platforms” in search, social media and retail that it referred to are widely understood to be Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon.

The DOJ said it will review whether the big online platforms have engaged in practices that have harmed consumers, reduced competition or stifled innovation. It will seek input from consumers and the companies’ rivals.

“Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands,” Makan Delrahim, assistant attorney general of the DOJ’s antitrust division, said in a statement Tuesday. “The Department’s antitrust review will explore these important issues.”

The announcement came as no surprise. The tech giants have faced growing backlash and increased scrutiny from regulators, lawmakers, consumer advocates, and even current and former employees over their collection and use of consumer data, failing to police content and exploitation by Russian agents of their platforms during the 2016 election. Last month, some publications reported that the DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission had divided up the work of scrutinizing the companies, with the FTC supposedly handling Facebook and Amazon, and the DOJ getting Google and Apple.

Confirmation of the Justice Department’s review comes just before the FTC’s expected announcement Wednesday of a settlement with Facebook over its handling of user data, an agreement that is expected to include a record-setting $5 billion fine against the company. The FTC this week may also announce a settlement with YouTube, the video-sharing site owned by Google, over its collection of data from children.

Jeff Chester, executive director of The Center for Digital Democracy, an advocacy group that has pushed to rein in big tech, said the U.S. has “a terrible track record when it comes to curtailing the clout of the major digital companies.”

But Chester added: “This is a unique moment, however, where critics from both sides of the aisle, such as Sens. (Elizabeth) Warren and (Josh) Hawley, are leading a charge to break up or tightly regulate” the companies. Warren was the first Democratic presidential candidate to call for breaking up big tech. Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, has been vocal about tech issues from privacy to conservatives’ allegations that the platforms are biased against them, a view President Trump has also expressed.

Both House and Senate subcommittees have also been focused on the big tech companies. The House Judiciary Committee last month announced its own investigation of digital competition. Meanwhile, the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee has scheduled an oversight hearing with the FTC and the Justice Department for Sept. 17 at which it is expected to question the regulators about tech’s power, Politico reported Tuesday. Members of that committee have been critical of the agencies’ oversight of tech companies.

Some experts have said it may be tough for the government to go after big tech under existing antitrust laws because it would have to prove that consumers are being harmed. Donald Polden, emeritus professor of law at Santa Clara University, points out, for example, that the tech giants’ customers aren’t paying higher prices.

In addition, antitrust reviews can take a long time. When the U.S. government brought its antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft in 1998, a judge issued a decision the following year and ordered a breakup of the company in 2000. Microsoft appealed, and the case ended in 2001 with the DOJ seeking a lesser penalty that fell short of breaking up the software giant.

Shares of Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple, all based in Silicon Valley except Amazon, fell in after-hours trading.

Tech Giants Go Under Antitrust Microscope In Department Of Justice Review,https://deadline.com,['Dade Hayes'],07-23-2019,2019,7,https://deadline.com/2019/07/tech-giants-go-under-antitrust-microscope-in-department-of-justice-review-1202651859/,"Makan Delrahim, the Donald Trump appointee at the U.S. Department of Justice, who heads the antitrust division and led the lawsuit seeking to block AT&T’s Time Warner acquisition, has a new target: tech giants.

Delrahim’s boss, Attorney General William Barr, has increased rhetoric questioning tech company methods in recent months, reflecting President Trump’s regular complaints about alleged bias and other behavior.

The DOJ plans to review companies including four of the FAANG companies: , Amazon, Apple and Google. The DOJ will be looking to see “whether and how market-leading online platforms have achieved market power and are engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers,” the agency said in a press release.

Among the areas of focus will be concerns that regulators say they have fielded from consumers, businesses, and entrepreneurs about search, social media, and some online retail services.

“Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands,” Delrahim said. “The Department’s antitrust review will explore these important issues.”

Business ramifications, including regulatory restriction or even breakups of the companies, could be the outcome of the probe, and shares in the major issues were all trading lower after hours on Tuesday. Many media companies have long complained about what they have labeled a “duopoly” in digital advertising, with Facebook and Google grabbing nearly 80 cents of every dollar in ad spending. Far tougher regulation of tech firms has also been a plank in the 2020 presidential platforms of many left-wing Democrats, including Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.

The Federal Trade Commission is conducting its own review, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal, which was the first to report on the DOJ probe.

Trump, a businessman who has championed the elimination of regulation across many industries during his presidency, has frequently railed against tech companies. Earlier this summer, the White House convened a “social media summit” that did not include representatives of any of the major platforms, including Google-owned YouTube, Facebook or Twitter."
Green groups sue EPA over 'sweeping overhaul' of public records policy,https://thehill.com,[],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/454545-green-groups-sue-epa-over-sweeping-overhaul-of-public-records,"Two separate environmental lawsuits were filed Wednesday challenging the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) changes to its public records policy.

The two suits, filed separately by four environmental groups in the Federal District Court of Northern California and the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, each argue that EPA’s newly implemented Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) rule, submitted at the end of June without a public comment period, was intended to prevent the public from receiving requested public information and to hide information from requesters.

ADVERTISEMENT

The suit brought by the Center for Biological Diversity and Environmental Integrity Project in the Washington court alleges that EPA’s final FOIA rule was “a sweeping overhaul of

the agency’s rules governing its process for responding to records requests.”

Specifically, it challenges provisions included in the new EPA rule, saying that it gives the agency the authority to deny FOIA requests on the basis of a records’ “responsiveness,” and therefore delays record releases. The suit also challenges the fact that the final rule was submitted to the federal register without a public comment period.

“These secretly adopted FOIA directives institutionalize procedures and practices that serve to delay and often frustrate public access to public records by allowing EPA political appointees to oversee what information is made available to the public, and what information never sees the light of day,” the suit reads.

The second suit launched by two California based environmental groups, Ecological Rights Foundation and Our Children's Earth Foundation, argues that EPA’s FOIA policies “violate the letter and spirit of FOIA and represent the latest example of EPA’s ongoing attack on government transparency and accountability.” It also argues that the rule was “illegal procedurally” because it failed to include public feedback under a comment period.

Additionally, the suit takes issue with the agency’s “awareness review” process, which allows political appointees the chance to review the requested documents pertaining to them before release, and in some instances withhold documents.

“EPA’s decision to allow the Administrator to make initial determinations on FOIA requests and to bar requesters from appealing those determinations is arbitrary, capricious, and otherwise not in accordance with law,” the suit reads.

Both lawsuits follow a long line of challenges to the EPA’s FOIA policy, both by environmental groups and lawmakers.

Yesterday a group of bipartisan senators introduced a FOIA reform bill designed to mitigate some of the new policies included in EPA’s FOIA rule.

Also today, the Interior Department Inspector General said it is investigating Interior’s similar FOIA policy that allows political appointees to review and potentially withhold public documents from being released."
