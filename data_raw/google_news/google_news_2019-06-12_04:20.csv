"GOP Rep clashes with House Dem after she reads letter calling Trump supporters 'racist,' 'dumb'",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Sam Dorman', 'Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News. You Can Follow Him On Facebook']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-rep-clashes-with-house-dem-after-she-reads-letter-calling-trump-supporters-racist-dumb,"Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, appeared to get a reprimand on Tuesday after she read a constituent letter attacking President Trump and his supporters.

After Fudge read the letter, which described Trump as a ""gangster"" and ""sexually condescending to women,"" presiding officer Rep. Marc Veasey, D-Texas, reminded her that she couldn't read other people's remarks attacking the president.

“The chair will remind members that remarks and debate may not engage in personalities towards the president, including by repeating remarks made elsewhere that would be improper if spoken in the members own words,” Veasy said.

Fudge seemed indignant and appeared to ask what Veasy meant by ""personalities."" As she stayed near the front of the chamber, Rep. Larry Bucshon, R-Ind., called her out by asking, ""Are we in order or what are we doing?"" After Fudge responded to him, Bucschon shot back, ""No, you're out of order.""

Fudge's letter came from Ronald S. Williams, senior pastor and chief executive officer of Mount Zion Fellowship in Ohio. Williams' letter denounced Trump, calling him a ""proven liar"" among other things.

His supporters, Williams said, were ""either racist, steeped in racist religious beliefs, ignorant, or as my mother used to say, just plain dumb.” Fudge tweeted a video of her reading but didn't include the exchange with Buschon.

“They have chosen to support a president who has a proven record of being sexually condescending to women, will not oppose the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan and other hate organizations, is indecisive, condescending to anyone who challenges him, and hides behind his Twitter account rather than dealing with the real issues in our country and around the world,” he said, according to Fudge's reading.

The letter also criticized House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's, D-Calif., reluctance to pursue impeachment proceedings related to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.

“Nancy Pelosi is a woman who I respect. However, I do believe her hesitancy to impeach this president is her opinion based upon polls and her belief that it would further polarize the country,"" he said. ""However, the country is already divided and polarized.”

His comments echoed those of progressives like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who argued that the need for impeachment transcended political concerns.

House Democrats on Tuesday voted to effectively hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress -- an attempt to censure him for his refusal to comply with Congressional subpoenas. The approved resolution gave Congress the power to enforce subpoenas in court as well as unilaterally initiate judicial proceedings.

I mean, what president would try to weaken emission standards so American-made cars could pollute more, so our kids could breathe dirtier air in the age of climate change, when clean energy systems are becoming the next great global industry and China is focused on dominating it?

Seriously, who does that?

But that’s the initiative Trump has embarked upon of late — an industrial policy to revive all the dirty industries of the past and to undermine the clean industries of the future.

It is a policy initiative that is not only perverse on its face, but that utterly fails to connect so many dots that are right now harming our national security, economy, weather and competition with China."

Moral and religious objections to providing health care sometimes arise in medicine: A medical assistant might not agree with blood transfusions. A nurse might not want to assist in sex reassignment surgery.

Last month, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services put out a new rule that ""implements full and robust enforcement"" of existing laws that protect what the administration calls ""conscience rights"" for health care workers. The rule is set to go into effect on July 22.

As NPR has previously reported, the new rule expands the kinds of workers who are covered by those laws — to include, for example, reception and billing staff. Even though relatively few of these complaints get submitted to HHS each year, this emphasis on religious freedom has been a hallmark of the department under the Trump administration.

HHS was sued right away over the expansiveness of its new rule — by the states of New York and California and by physician groups, clinics and others.

Santa Clara County in California is asking a federal judge in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California this week to put the Trump rule on hold while the legal process plays out — San Francisco and the state of California filed separate motions for preliminary injunctions last week.

To succeed in putting a temporary stop on the rule, at least one of the plaintiffs will need to convince a judge that implementing the rule would cause ""irreparable harm.""

So what's the harm of a rule designed to affirm health workers' right to exclude themselves from providing medical care that they say violates their religious or moral beliefs?

""If the rule goes through as it's written, patients will die,"" says Santa Clara's county executive, Jeff Smith, who is a physician as well as an attorney by training.

""We will have a guaranteed situation where a woman has had a complication of an abortion, where she's bleeding out and needs to have the services of some employee who has moral objections,"" Smith predicts. ""That patient will die because the employee is not providing the services that are needed.""

Santa Clara has 2 million residents — it is more populous than 14 states, according to 2017 census data. The county runs three hospitals, including a Level 1 trauma center, clinics and pharmacies, all of which rely in part on federal funding to operate.

The issue is not whether employees who have moral objections to providing certain kinds of care should have a way to opt out, according to James Williams, county counsel for Santa Clara. The county already has a policy to deal with that, but it differs from the federal rule in two key ways.

""One: Health care providers need to notify us in advance,"" Williams says. ""It can't just be an on-the-fly objection. And that makes sense because, how are you supposed to run a hospital if you don't know what your staff has a concern about until the actual procedure needs to happen? And second: There's an exception for dealing with an emergency situation.""

HHS declined to offer comment for this story, because litigation regarding its rule is ongoing. But the department summarized and responded to nearly a quarter-million comments that were submitted during the 60-day public comment period after the rule was first proposed in January 2018.

In response to commenters who raised the emergency issue, HHS said its final rule does not explicitly conflict with federal laws that require health workers to provide emergency treatment for any and all patients.

To this, Santa Clara County counsel Williams responds, ""What the [federal] rule doesn't do is actually say that it doesn't apply in emergencies.""

If the conscience rule does go into effect, and Santa Clara does not comply with it, the federal funding the county relies on to operate its public health system could be withheld or subject to ""funding claw-backs to the extent permitted by law,"" according to the HHS rule.

On the other hand, Williams says, if the county attempted to comply with the rule, it would have another problem — figuring out how.

""HHS didn't explain or consider how this rule would actually be implemented in practice,"" Williams says. ""The rule kind of suggests that, basically, you need to have extra staffing to accommodate the fact that there may be people who have objections. That would be very costly.""

County officials worry more broadly about the direct impact of the federal rule on patients. In the lawsuit, Santa Clara argues that the rule could delay care, which could, among other things, open the county up to malpractice suits.

And, county officials add, posting notice about the ""conscience rights"" policy, as the HHS rule instructs, in ""a prominent and conspicuous physical location"" within hospitals and clinics that receive federal funding could scare away vulnerable patients — including women seeking abortions or transgender patients.

To this last point, HHS wrote in its rule: ""The Department disagrees that a notice of federal conscience and anti-discrimination laws would in any way discourage a patient seeking emergency treatment.""

This is not the first time Santa Clara County has sued the Trump administration — the county also sued over Trump's attempts to undermine DACA and over the administration's legal threats against sanctuary cities.

The county has had its eye on the conscience rights issue since the rule was proposed in 2018. When the final rule came down in May 2019, Santa Clara was ready to go.

""We have, as a county, more flexibility to litigate because we have a county Board of Supervisors that's very supportive of patients' rights,"" says Smith, the county executive. ""But every county, every public health system, will have the same concerns.""

Trump administration officials say the federal rule is necessary to protect health workers' religious freedom. As NPR has reported, Roger Severino, the director of HHS's Office for Civil Rights, has made the right of health workers to refuse to offer care for religious reasons to some patients his signature issue. In a statement sent to NPR, Severino vowed to ""defend the rule vigorously.""

The next step: A judge in U.S. District Court will decide whether any of the California plaintiffs pass the test for preliminary injunctive relief — that if the rule goes into effect, they will suffer ""irreparable harm.""

If any or all plaintiffs pass that test, the judge could put the rule on hold while the lawsuits play out. Currently, challenges to the rule in New York and San Francisco are both scheduled for hearings on July 12 — just days before the federal rule is set to go into effect."
"Justice Dept. to Congress: Back off contempt process, or Barr will ask Trump to shield census documents",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Matt Zapotosky', 'National Security Reporter Covering The Justice Department', 'June At Pm']",06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/barr-will-ask-trump-to-assert-executive-privilege-over-materials-on-added-census-question-if-lawmakers-dont-back-off-contempt/2019/06/11/ce4fd3dc-8c7d-11e9-8f69-a2795fca3343_story.html,"Attorney General William P. Barr will ask President Trump to assert executive privilege to shield documents from the administration’s decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census if Democratic lawmakers on the House Oversight Committee proceed toward holding Barr in contempt, the Justice Department revealed in a letter Tuesday.

The revelation came on the eve of an expected Oversight Committee vote to hold Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt for failing to turn over documents that lawmakers had subpoenaed, as well as stopping a witness from testifying without a Justice Department lawyer. Assistant Attorney General Stephen E. Boyd wrote that the decision to schedule the vote was “premature” and accused lawmakers of refusing to negotiate with the department to get at least some of what they wanted.

[House committee to vote on holding Barr and Ross in contempt for failing to provide documents related to 2020 Census citizenship question]

“In the face of this threatened contempt vote, the Attorney General is now compelled to request that the President invoke executive privilege with respect to the materials subject to the subpoena to the Attorney General and the subpoena to the Secretary of the Department of Commerce,” Boyd wrote. “I hereby request that the Committee hold the subpoenas in abeyance and delay any vote on whether to recommend a citation of contempt for noncompliance with the subpoenas, pending the President’s determination of this question.”

Boyd added that if the committee rejected the request, the department would “be forced to reevaluate its current production efforts in ongoing matters.” He requested that the committee respond by 5 p.m. Tuesday and noted that the president had not yet asserted executive privilege to protect the documents from disclosure.

Later Tuesday, Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) responded in a letter that because the department had made “no commitments to provide any portion of the critical documents required by the subpoena,” he would not postpone the contempt vote.

“The Committee cannot accept these terms,” Cummings wrote, adding that he was still willing to delay if the department turned over certain materials. “The Committee has a responsibility under the Constitution to conduct rigorous oversight of the Census, and we will not delay our efforts due to your ongoing obstruction.”

If lawmakers and the committee do not reach a deal, the Justice Department’s latest posture puts it on a collision course almost identical to that which it faced last month with the House Judiciary Committee.

In that instance, the department had resisted a Judiciary Committee subpoena for access to the unredacted report from special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation, as well as its underlying materials. At Barr’s request — soon before a contempt vote — Trump asserted executive privilege to protect the documents from disclosure. The committee then voted to hold the attorney general in contempt, though recently, it declared the effort on hold after reaching a deal with the Justice Department to get at least some materials.

[Trump asserts executive privilege over Mueller report; House panel holds Barr in contempt]

In the census case, lawmakers are seeking to understand the administration’s decision to add a citizenship question — which they allege could scare immigrants away from responding to the survey.

The results of the census are used in congressional redistricting and calculating the number of representatives each state gets in Congress. Depressed immigrant response rates could be important and potentially give an advantage to white and Republican voters. States, cities and civil rights groups have sued over the added question, and federal judges have ruled against it — though the dispute is now with the Supreme Court.

Cummings has accused the administration of not complying with a subpoena for documents about the matter, as well as blocking Justice Department official John Gore from testifying. Committee Democrats wrote on Twitter on Tuesday that there was “a broad, coordinated campaign to stonewall investigations across the board — and it is being directed from the top.”

Boyd wrote that the committee had already turned over 17,000 pages and that some of what lawmakers wanted was protected by attorney-client privilege or because it involves internal executive branch deliberations. He also wrote that Gore was only blocked from testifying because lawmakers would not let him do so with the aid of a Justice Department lawyer.

Boyd attached to his letter a recently authored opinion from the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel declaring that Congress may not prohibit government employees from appearing with a lawyer. The opinion noted that any subpoenas requiring employees do so would be “legally invalid” and “not subject to civil or criminal enforcement.”

The opinion, along with a potential executive privilege assertion, are meant to undercut the legitimacy of a contempt finding. Such a finding already would be largely symbolic. Those found in criminal contempt are normally referred to the Justice Department for prosecution; in this instance, the Justice Department would not prosecute itself.

The finding, though, can also be one step in a process that allows lawmakers to go to court and sue for the materials they want. The House voted Tuesday to authorize seeking court enforcement of subpoenas for Barr and former White House counsel Donald McGahn, if necessary.

The committee’s hearing on contempt is scheduled for 10 a.m. Wednesday."
"Trump Brags About Mexico Deal, but Reveals No Details",https://www.nytimes.com,['Michael D. Shear'],06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/us/politics/trump-mexico-deal.html,"Asked by reporters to reveal what the agreement requires Mexico to do, Mr. Trump refused to do so, adding that “the reason is Mexico wants to handle that.”

A close-up photograph taken by a Washington Post reporter of the paper that Mr. Trump waved shows what appears to be a one-page letter signed on June 7 by two people whose names are unclear.

The final paragraph of the letter seems to refer to the agreement announced on Friday, called a “joint declaration,” and describes what will happen if the United States is not satisfied that the flow of migration to the southwestern border has slowed sufficiently.

“If the United States determines at its discretion and after consultation with Mexico, after 45 calendar days from the date of the issuance of the Joint Declaration, that the measures adopted by the Government of Mexico pursuant to the Joint Declaration have not sufficiently achieved results in addressing the flow of migrants to the southern border of the United States, the Government of Mexico will take all necessary steps under domestic law to bring the agreement into force with a view to ensuring that the agreement will enter into force within 45 days,” the letter says.

The president offered a series of confusing and contradictory statements, saying repeatedly that Mexico would have to submit the agreement to “their congress” while simultaneously saying that he has the power to impose it unilaterally if he wants to.

“If they bring the numbers way down, we won’t have to, but this is my option,” Mr. Trump said. “It goes into effect when I want it to, but I have a lot of respect for the president of Mexico. I have a lot of respect for the people we dealt with, so I don’t want to do that, and they have to go back to congress to get that approved.”

Moments later, he said that “it will go into effect when Mexico tells me it’s O.K. to release it.”

Mr. Trump and his aides have repeatedly referred to a “secret agreement” since Sunday morning when he first said on Twitter that a yet-to-be-revealed deal was reached with Mexico and would be “announced at the appropriate time.”"

"DHS chief reveals startling stat on asylum seekers who skip hearings, disappear",https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dhs-secretary-reveals-startling-stat-on-asylum-seekers-who-skip-hearings-disappear,"The acting Homeland Security secretary gave lawmakers a glimpse Tuesday into just how many asylum seekers skip their hearings after being released into the United States -- telling a Senate panel that a recent program found 90 percent miss their court dates.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., asked Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan how many asylum seekers coming across the southern border show up for their hearings.

BORDER ARRESTS SKYROCKET IN MAY, AS OFFICIALS DECLARE 'FULL-BLOWN EMERGENCY'

“It depends on demographic, the court, but we see too many cases where people are not showing up,” he said, telling Graham that DHS recently conducted a pilot program with family units.

“Out of those 7,000 cases, 90 received final orders of removal in absentia, 90 percent,” he said.

“90 percent did not show up?” Graham asked.

“Correct, that is a recent sample from families crossing the border,” McAleenan clarified.

McAleenan’s testimony also painted a grim portrait of a border crisis that shows no signs of easing, with Border Patrol overwhelmed and underfunded. The secretary described authorities as hamstrung by laws that limit how long they can keep migrants in custody.

“Currently due to a single district court order, we cannot obtain effective immigration enforcement results for the families arriving at our border -- they cannot be held for longer than 21 days and do not receive rulings from immigration courts for years,” he said.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported that it encountered 144,000 migrants at the border in May, a level not seen in decades, describing the situation as a “full-blown emergency.” McAleenan said that 60,000 children have entered into DHS custody in just the last 40 days.

McAleenan told lawmakers they also suffer due to “misaligned” asylum standards, meaning many of those who demonstrate “credible fear” of returning home -- the initial bar for claiming asylum -- are later judged not to have a valid asylum claim.

PELOSI HITS TRUMP'S DEAL WITH MEXICO, ACCUSES HIM OF 'THREATS AND TEMPER TANTRUMS'

He also said the restrictions on how long family units can be held mean that a child is now seen as a passport to the U.S. -- a perception he said is based in reality. He testified that only 30 percent of those coming to the border are actually trying to avoid being captured.

“Unless you’re a single adult, it is very unlikely you’ll be repatriated,” he said.

McAleenan urged Congress to act to end those loopholes and to grant requested DHS funding, and suggested that moves to make asylum seekers claim asylum in their home countries or designated third-countries could help solve the crisis.

Graham’s “Secure and Protect Act of 2019,” being discussed at the hearing, would include a provision to establish refugee processing centers in Mexico and Central America, and the senator asked the DHS chief if such an approach would work.

“First of all, it would break the back of the smuggling organizations, they’re profiting from this cycle.” McAleenan said. ""It would provide access to asylum in country in a much safer manner than taking this dangerous journey and it would stop this flow immediately.”

“I believe the vast majority [of the migrant flow] would stop,” he said.

Democrats, meanwhile, suggested that the administration bears some of the blame for the situation at the border, with Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., pointing to McAleenan's recent appointment as an example of dysfunction at the department.

“In less than two and a half years, there have already been four heads of this department, we have before us an acting secretary who has been on the job for more than two months,"" he said. ""We cannot face this crisis effectively with a revolving door policy in the leadership at the Department of Homeland Security.”

McAleenan’s testimony comes amid continued negotiations between the Trump administration and Mexico on immigration. The U.S. announced on Friday that it had reached a deal with Mexico to drop threatened tariffs on Mexican imports in exchange for Mexico increasing efforts to limit U.S.-bound migration flows from Central America.

An administration source told Fox News Tuesday that a new deal for Mexico becoming a safe third country for asylum seekers was completed, but not yet announced.

Elizabeth Warren Demands DOJ Antitrust Chief Recuse Himself From Google and Apple Probes,https://gizmodo.com,"['Victoria Song', 'About The Author', 'Consumer Tech Reporter Day', 'Danger Noodle Night. No', ""I'M Not The K-Pop Star.""]",,,,https://gizmodo.com/elizabeth-warren-demands-doj-antitrust-chief-recuse-him-1835411938,"Photo: Getty Images

The U.S. Justice Department recently signaled it was exploring possible antitrust investigations into Google and Apple. Leading those investigations—assuming they actually happen—would be none other than Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, a former lobbyist that presidential hopeful and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says should recuse himself due to his history with both companies.

In a letter to Delrahim, Warren notes Google paid Delrahim about $100,000 in 2007 to lobby federal antitrust officials for the company’s acquisition of DoubleClick Inc, an online ad company. That gig paid off, as it eventually culminated in a $3.1 billion merger. As for Delrahim’s ties to Apple, Warren notes he also lobbied on behalf of the Cupertino giant regarding patent reforms. The letter further emphasizes that Delrahim worked as a corporate lobbyist until 2016, and counted Anthem, Pfizer, Qualcomm, and Caesars among his clients.

“Your past work as a lobbyist for two of the largest and most scrutinized tech companies in the world creates the appearance of conflict of interest,” writes Warren. “As the head of the antitrust division at the DOJ, you should not be supervising investigations into former clients who paid you tens of thousands of dollars to lobby the federal government.”

Warren also sent a similarly worded letter to DOJ ethics officials, urging Delrahim’s recusal. She also asked for a response from both Delrahim and the DOJ by June 14.

While Big Tech has been under greater overall scrutiny in Washington, it’s fair to say Warren deserves some of the credit for pushing the issue into the national political conversation. Back in March, the Democratic presidential candidate proposed a plan to break up Amazon, Google, and Facebook at a rally in New York. On the issue of lobbying, Warren also introduced a bill in 2018 that would prohibit corporate lobbyists like Delrahim from taking government positions for six years.

Meanwhile, potential antitrust probes of the tech giants are gaining steam. While the DOJ has claimed jurisdiction over Apple and Google, the Federal Trade Commission called dibs on Facebook and Amazon. Meanwhile, the House Judiciary Committee announced it’s launching an all-out antitrust probe into the tech industry, and it’s holding its first hearing on the issue today."

In an exclusive interview with ABC News Live, before a rare joint appearance on Capitol Hill, former EPA administrators William Reilly, Lee Thomas and Christine Whitman warned that recent gains in cleaner air and water in the U.S. are beginning to ""backslide.""

""If we continue business as usual, it's catastrophic,"" said Reilly, who led the agency under President George H.W. Bush. ""We're the number two emitter in the world after China.""

Whitman, a former New Jersey governor who ran the EPA under President George W. Bush, raised concerns about ""the disrespecting of science in the administration and the undermining of science and the importance of science.""

Thomas said his old boss, President Ronald Reagan, would have wanted the agency to recommit to its central purpose.

""Change the direction, change the management and go back to the mission of the agency. That's what I think President Reagan would say, 'That's not how I want this agency to operate,'"" Thomas said.

The trio spoke with ABC News before a House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee hearing Tuesday on the direction of the EPA, which was created in 1970 by Republican President Richard Nixon to protect the human health and the environment. Former Obama administration EPA chief Gina McCarthy also testified.

Asked to grade the performance of the current EPA leadership, led by Administrator Andrew Wheeler, the three Republicans agreed on ""D"" or ""a little lower.""

""You need an agency that is credible, has consistency in its rule making and is science-based,"" said Thomas, who lamented a steady exodus of career employees from the EPA because of disillusionment with its current direction.

When ABC News Live spoke with Wheeler earlier this year, he insisted that the agency remains focused on its core purpose but is balancing other economic priorities. He said he does not believe climate change is a ""hoax,"" as President Donald Trump has insisted, but also does not think it's the ""crisis"" many environmentalists make it out to be.

""That's an unfair characterization,"" said Reilly of Wheeler's position, noting that the agency's own National Climate Assessment has painted a dire picture of the situation.

""The Green New Deal did something really wonderful,"" he said. ""I am told by so many Republican members of Congress that they are never asked about climate when they go on the stump. And now, they're asked. That is marvelous. It's put it on the agenda.""

Whitman agreed.

""For the first time in my memory, an environmental issue is going to be a major part of a political campaign for the presidency,"" she said. ""I haven't seen that before, and it's not going to go away, and that's good.""

"DOJ slams latest committee contempt vote, warns of retaliation",https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Stephen Dinan']",06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jun/11/doj-slams-latest-committee-contempt-vote/,"The Justice Department warned Tuesday that it could retaliate against the House Oversight Committee should the panel vote this week to pursue contempt of Congress proceedings against Attorney General William P. Barr, saying it would sour what cooperation there has been.

Assistant Attorney General Stephen E. Boyd said the department has turned over thousands of pages of documents to the Oversight Committee but Chairman Elijah Cummings‘ quick trigger finger on the contempt vote is ruining that.

“Should the committee take the unnecessary and counterproductive step of proceeding with a contempt vote, the department will be forced to reevaluate its current production efforts in ongoing matters,” Mr. Boyd wrote.

He also warned that Mr. Cummings‘ vote won’t end up getting the congressman what he wants.

If the committee does pursue contempt, President Trump will assert a protective executive privilege over the documents Mr. Cummings is trying to get. That would effectively shield them all, while government lawyers look them over, Mr. Boyd suggested.

Mr. Cummings, in a reply letter Tuesday, said Republicans were making demands and issuing threats without offering any accommodations or promises that they will turn over documents if the committee delays its action.

“The committee cannot accept these terms,” he said. “The committee has a responsibility under the Constitution to conduct rigorous oversight of the census, and we will not continue to delay our efforts due to your ongoing obstruction.”

Mr. Cummings suspects shenanigans behind the move to add the citizenship question to the 2020 census — a contention several federal judges have backed up with their findings in several court cases.

The legality of the citizenship question is now pending before the Supreme Court.

Republicans argue Mr. Cummings is trying to sway the justices by orchestrating the contempt vote.

Mr. Boyd said that when Congress demands documents from the administration there is supposed to be an accommodation, where both sides work through privileges and other issues that arise.

He said that didn’t happen in this case.

In particular, he said, Mr. Cummings refused to allow a Justice Department lawyer to attend a deposition of a top department official — leading Mr. Barr to order the official not to testify.

The department released a legal opinion last month justifying Mr. Barr’s stance, saying the Obama administration held the same position.

Scott Applewhite/AP Photo energy & environment Colorado mine’s ties to Interior secretary unsettle tourist town The mine’s array of powerful allies is inspiring deep unease among leaders in Glenwood Springs.

The Mid-Continent quarry has sat for decades in the hills of western Colorado, where kayakers paddle the Roaring Fork River and tourists soak in the natural hot springs. But now a proposed expansion of the 16-acre limestone mine has kicked off a battle that stretches to the office of Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, whose former employer is lobbying for the project.

The mine's owner, Rocky Mountain Resources, is led by CEO Chad Brownstein, whose father chairs the major lobbying firm where Bernhardt worked for a decade. Bernhardt’s old firm is pushing the mining proposal on two fronts, according to interviews and POLITICO’s review of public records — pressing local government leaders to endorse the project, while meeting in D.C. with Interior staff who could decide the expansion’s fate.

Bernhardt promised nearly two years ago to recuse himself from decisions involving his former firm’s clients. But that ethics pledge expires in August, freeing him to work on those issues. An Interior spokesperson would only refer to that pledge when asked whether he’d recused himself from the mine's proposal, and declined to say what action he may take when the pledge expires.



The hilltop mine leases land owned by Interior’s Bureau of Land Management.

The mine’s array of powerful allies is inspiring deep unease among leaders in Glenwood Springs, a community of 10,000 people whose outdoor tourist attractions include hot springs, whitewater rafting, fly fishing and scenic mountain trails. Residents worry that the expansion, which would allow the mine to spread across 440 acres, would bring a surge of truck traffic, dust and noise — as well as the scarring on the mountain ridge that would become visible from the town. And they say the mine is already violating its permits.

The dispute also follows months of questions from House Democrats and Interior’s internal watchdog about whether the department is taking actions that benefit Bernhardt’s former employer, Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck.

“We’re acutely aware of Chad Brownstein and the relationship to David Bernhardt,” said Jeff Peterson, executive director of Glenwood Springs Citizens Alliance, a group formed to oppose the mine expansion. “It’s something unfortunately we can’t control. But there’s a real concern that this will get essentially rubber stamped and it doesn’t matter what it will do to our community.”

Glenwood Springs Mayor Jonathan Godes agreed.

“Our concern is that there is going to be one of the largest mines in Colorado directly abutting our city,” Godes said. “And when you have a former lobbyist for one of the largest legal lobbying firms in the extractive industry running DOI ... and Norm Brownstein the father of the CEO of Rocky Mountain Resources, it doesn't take a huge leap of faith to say something ain’t right here.”

Just the sheer lobbying firepower Rocky Mountain Resources is bringing to the project may be enough to pressure Interior employees, said Daniel Stevens, executive director at the watchdog group Campaign for Accountability.

Brownstein Hyatt “has a lot of pull, and when it asks Interior to jump, Interior jumps,” Daniels said. “Does every other small firm applying for a mining permit run to the top lobbying firm in the country to work on their behalf? Seems a little disproportionate here.”

RMR defended its corporate track record and its project, but the company and its executives did not respond to detailed questions about its lobbying efforts and ties to Bernhardt. Jon Hrobsky, one of the Brownstein lobbyists working on behalf of RMR, has known Bernhardt since they were both staffers for former Republican Colorado Rep. Scott McInnis and worked with him at Interior during the George W. Bush administration. Hrobsky and another Brownstein lobbyist, Luke Johnson, have both met with Interior officials to discuss ""natural resources"" on behalf of the company, according to the disclosure forms.

The Brownstein firm registered as lobbying for RMR as of April 30, according to its disclosure form. But two of its employees, Michael Stratton and Christine Jochim, have been assisting RMR since at least February, according to emails POLITICO received via public information requests. On April 5, Stratton sent a message to Glenwood Springs City Manager Debra Figueroa saying he was “hoping to make progress on behalf of RMR relative to making a presentation about their quarry proposal,” according to one of the emails.

Stratton and Jochim provided legal work for RMR but did not lobby before April 30, a Brownstein spokesperson said.



When asked if Bernhardt had recused himself from the matter, an Interior spokesperson referred to his ethics pledge.

Bernhardt also has personal ties to the area: He grew up in Rifle, Colo., about a half-an-hour drive from Glenwood Springs.

The mine has been in operation since 1982. Glenwood Springs residents who have spoken up at county board meetings overwhelmingly opposed the expansion and said the noise, traffic and sheer size of the project would all but destroy their tourism-based economy.

Garfield County inspectors earlier this year found a range of violations at the mine: It has spread outside its currently permitted acreage, is selling products it wasn’t permitted to and is operating during months it had promised the county it would shut down, the inspectors wrote in a report.

In interviews, residents said the BLM’s office has refused to respond to their complaints, forcing them to turn to the agency’s D.C. headquarters. But the bureau has allowed the mine to keep operating despite its violations.

“We issued a letter [to BLM] saying we don’t think RMR is compliance,” Peterson said. “We’ve heard absolutely nothing from the BLM. It’s been crickets on that front.”

RMR, a holding company based in Beverly Hills, Calif., acquired the Mid-Continent mine in October 2016. CEO Chad Brownstein's father is Norm Brownstein, who founded and still chairs Brownstein Hyatt, where Bernhardt spent most of his professional life.

The fight between the company and the community reached a new level of antipathy in May, when RMR sued the county board and its members. The lawsuit contends that the county agreement the board is trying to enforce should take a back seat to the company’s permit from BLM.

Records indicate that board members have reached out to Bernhardt directly: They called him on Sept. 17 and met with him in his D.C. office on March 5, according to Bernhardt’s official schedules. Neither of those conversations involved the Mid-Continent mine issue, according to an Interior spokesperson and others who attended the meeting, although an initial meeting request form said the commissioners had asked to speak to Bernhardt about topics including BLM.

The board members are unable to speak about the matter, a county spokesperson said after POLITICO tried to ask them questions about the mining permit. But a month after meeting with Bernhardt, the board heard county inspectors list the mine’s violations and gave Rocky Mountain Resources until June 1 to comply.

Bernhardt has already come under fire for making policy decisions that could benefit Brownstein clients. Interior’s inspector general is reviewing Bernhardt’s role in blocking a department report analyzing how a controversial pesticide affected federally protected wildlife, and examining whether he improperly pushed to remove a species of small fish from the endangered species list to benefit a former client.

The House Committee On Oversight and Reform and the National Archives and Records Administration are also probing whether Bernhardt is suppressing the release of his meeting schedules.

Craig Holman, a lobbyist at the government watchdog group Public Citizen, said Bernhardt should allay these concerns by continuing to recuse himself from matters involving his former firm even after his ethics pledge ends in two months.

“Unfortunately, as we have seen over and over again with Bernhardt, the conflicts of interest are so widespread that they keep popping up and Bernhardt seems unable to divorce himself effectively from his former clients and employers,” Holman said.

The Brownstein firm has been actively working on the ground in Colorado to promote the project. Stratton, one of the Brownstein lobbyists, has advised Chad Brownstein on the mine since RMR acquired it in 2016, an RMR spokesperson said. He attended at least one Monday night county board hearing and has met with city officials seeking to persuade them that expanding the mine is in the community’s interests, according to interviews and documents obtained by POLITICO.



“Mike Stratton has advised Chad Brownstein for over two decades on corporate matters,” the spokesperson said. “Mike and Chad have equal to that a close personal friendship since Chad was 21.”

He has also participated in meetings and conference calls in which BLM discussed the limestone mine with RMR, said David Boyd, a spokesperson for the bureaus Northwest Colorado District. Boyd said he was “not aware” whether Chad Brownstein was involved in any of the discussions.

Stratton also represents the American Petroleum Association, the country's largest petroleum trade association.



The other Brownstein lawyer, Jochim, has worked on the mine proposal since at least February, according to emails POLITICO obtained. Jochim, a former Nuclear Regulatory Commission attorney and former Justice Department law clerk, requested in April that the city hand over all communications pertaining to the mine, according to documents POLITICO obtained through Colorado public record access laws.

Stratton declined to answer questions, saying he was not the company spokesperson. Jochim did not respond to questions.





A Rocky Mountain Resources spokesperson did not answer questions about whether Chad Brownstein or anyone in his father’s lobbying firm has discussed the project with either Bernhardt or other senior Interior staff. Company executives declined requests for an interview.

Residents and city officials said they don’t recall having any complaints about the mine before RMR bought it. The site has become the focus of numerous complaints since the new owner took over, however.



The mine’s operations have crept well outside the 16 acres originally stipulated in its county agreement and BLM permit, according to a March memo by Garfield County inspectors. Inspectors also found that RMR had not been paying royalties to the bureau for all the materials it had been extracting and selling from the mine.

Residents also complained that RMR was operating the mine year-round, violating its agreement with the county to shut operations every December to April to minimize harm to wildlife.

David McConaughy, a Glenwood Springs attorney representing the company, told the county board at its April public meeting that BLM has approved RMR’s requests for exemptions to the seasonal shutdowns since 2016. But neither BLM nor the company alerted the county at the time, board members responded.

""We’re trying to be transparent with the county ... to reconcile conflicts in the various permits,” McConaughy said at the hearing.

McConaughy declined to speak to POLITICO, referring questions to RMR.

BLM returned Rocky Mountain Resources’ March expansion proposal to the company within the required 30-day review period, saying the plan didn’t contain enough information. The local BLM office is “currently determining how to address the existing mining operations as well as any future proposal,” the bureau’s Boyd said.

“As would typically be the case for controversial topics in a field office, the BLM Washington Office and DOI have been briefed on the potential expansion proposal for the Mid-Continent Quarry,” Boyd added.

A Rocky Mountain Resources spokesperson defended the company’s record, saying the violations of the county agreement stemmed from problems inherited from the previous owner. The company also said the expansion would diversify the economy of a town that depends on tourists arriving to hike and ski the nearby mountains.

“Currently, many Glenwood Springs’ employers are unable or unwilling to provide their employees adequate wages to afford the town’s high cost of living, including affordable housing for teachers and developing professionals,” the company said in a statement to POLITICO. “RMR believes a community should embrace opportunities to improve the lives of its constituents, not just those who can afford to influence local politics.”

Residents who spoke to POLITICO said RMR’s economic arguments ring hollow.

Besides expanding the mining pit area, RMR also proposed increasing truck traffic from around 20 round trips a day to as many as 450, according to a proposal it submitted to the BLM in March. The dramatic increase in traffic — plus the sight of the expanded mine in the hills above the town — would all but cripple Glenwood Springs’ tourist economy, said former Mayor Michael Gamba, a Republican civil engineer.

“We had lived harmoniously with that mine for the past 20-plus years,” Gamba said in an interview. “Had nothing changed, we would have had no objections to them having it. But the proposed expansion is an existential threat to our community.”"
The gutting of EPA must stop,https://thehill.com,[],06-11-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/448026-the-gutting-of-epa-must-stop,"gutted (v) - to destroy the interior of; disembowel

gutted (adj) - bitterly disappointed

“Gutted” can mean to remove the internal parts. It can also mean “bitterly disappointed.” The Trump administration has left employees at the Environmental Protection Agency gutted in both ways: eliminating as many workers as it can, and bitterly disappointing those who remain by silencing our voices and curbing our ability to protect public health and the environment. The two go hand in hand.

President Trump Donald John TrumpTop Armed Services Republican plots push for 0B defense budget Amash exits House Freedom Caucus in wake of Trump impeachment stance Amash exits House Freedom Caucus in wake of Trump impeachment stance MORE has proposed cutting EPA’s budget by 31 percent next year, which would decimate our staff and cripple our environmental enforcement efforts. Already, he has forced out some of EPA’s most valued engineers and scientists and driven out experts from scientific boards and panels.

Even as new threats emerge to our nation’s drinking water supply, and a new climate assessment paints a dire picture of the rest of this century, the Trump administration has doubled down on attacking EPA. By replacing expert scientists with political hacks and robbing EPA of the scientific tools and authorities to act, the most dire environmental threats facing our nation and the world will go unaddressed for years to come, long after President Trump has left office.

One new threat comes from a group of chemicals known as PFAS, or Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances. Linked to a variety of health problems — cancer, immune deficiencies, and thyroid and liver problems — they can be found in the bodies of 99 percent of Americans. For decades, PFAS have been widely used on nonstick pans, carpets, pizza boxes, fast food wrappers, firefighting foam, and more. They linger and accumulate in the environment and our bodies for a long time.

There is widespread contamination of our drinking water from PFAS, affecting every region of the country. But scientists and government agencies like EPA are just now beginning to understand the scope of the problem and scale of response that will be required. EPA is the only federal agency with the mission and the tools to lead a comprehensive effort to clean up PFAS. But how much of EPA will be left after President Trump finishes burning it to the ground? How will EPA lead the response to this threat if the workforce is gutted and stripped of its most experienced scientists and responders? You cannot respond to a problem without responders. The EPA staffing crisis was manufactured by the Trump administration, but we will all pay the price for it.

Since taking office in 2017, the president has called for reducing EPA staffing levels by 40 percent. Yet the hollowing out of EPA is already occurring. The agency lost (and did not replace) more than 1,000 employees in just the first full fiscal year of the Trump presidency. At this pace, EPA will lose 25 percent of its staff by 2020.

Anyone who thinks that the environmental threats we face can be solved by slashing staff at the main agency responsible for tackling these challenges is kidding themselves. Take climate change, the most acute environmental threat of them all. We need effective federal policy to achieve deep, long-term reductions in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in the next 10 years or we will face catastrophic and extremely expensive effects from warming. Through the Clean Air Act, EPA was poised to take action before President Trump took office. Trump has rolled back that authority. But it is one thing to cripple the EPA’s legal authority to act, and quite another to debilitate the agency for years to come by robbing it of the specialized scientists, engineers, and other experts who have dedicated their careers to this mission. You don’t disband an army when there are battles still to fight, much less when the biggest of battles is on the horizon.

Our drinking water contamination, air problems, and emerging threats like PFAS and climate change all require EPA’s immediate and extensive efforts to protect our public health and the environment. Yet instead of investing in the resources that will be necessary to tackle these critical problems, the Trump administration is laser-focused on crippling EPA by gutting our staff. Stewardship and leadership are both in short supply, and Congress must fill the breach. With more funding and support for the vital work we do, EPA can begin to replenish its staff and soon, hopefully, get back to doing the work that lies ahead. The health of our planet depends on it.

Gary Morton is president of American Federation of Government Employees Council 238, which represents more than 9,000 EPA workers nationwide."

DOJ outlines to Congress its investigation of the investigators,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-outlines-to-congress-its-investigation-of-the-investigators,"The Justice Department's investigation of the investigators involved in the Trump-Russia probe will look at actions both by the U.S. government and by foreigners.

That's what the agency said Monday, telling Congress its review is “broad in scope and multifaceted” in a letter from Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y.

The DOJ said the wide-ranging inquiry led by Attorney General William Barr, along with his right-hand man U.S. Attorney John Durham, would seek to “illuminate open questions regarding the activities of U.S. and foreign intelligence services as well as non-governmental organizations and individuals.”

The letter made it clear that DOJ’s review is not limited just to their specific agency, but would also scrutinize the intelligence community as a whole. The letter stated that the DOJ review team had already asked certain intelligence community agencies to preserve records, make witnesses available, and start putting together documents that the DOJ would need to carry out its inquiry.

And the DOJ made it clear that they weren’t just looking to see if policies were violated — they’ll be looking at whether any laws were broken, too.

In 2016, the DOJ and FBI launched an investigation into any links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign. Special counsel Robert Mueller took over the ongoing effort in May 2017 after FBI Director James Comey was fired, and Mueller’s probe culminated in a 448-page report in April 2019. Mueller found that the Russians had interfered in the 2016 election through cyberattacks and social media disinformation campaigns, but did not establish that anyone associated with Trump criminally colluded with Russia. Mueller left the door open on obstruction of justice by Trump, but Barr and then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein determined that he had not.

Barr believes “there remain open questions relating to the origins of this counter-intelligence investigation and the U.S. and foreign intelligence activities that took place prior to and during that investigation,” the letter states, and the DOJ review will look at “the efficacy and propriety“ of the steps that the DOJ, the FBI, the broader U.S. intelligence community, and foreign governments and actors took before and during the course of the probe — and to answer those questions “to the satisfaction of the Attorney General.”

The letter said Barr is coordinating with members of the U.S. intelligence community and ""certain foreign actors"" on the “collaborative” and “ongoing effort.""

Trump recently gave Barr “full and complete authority to declassify information"" during his review, a move that has been harshly criticized by many Democrats. Nadler called the move part of a “plot to dirty up the intelligence community, to pretend that there's something wrong with the beginning of the Mueller investigation and to persecute and bring into line the intelligence agencies."" And former FBI General Counsel Jim Baker called the move a ""slap in the face"" to Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats.

Apparently to push back against such concerns, DOJ said Monday it would work hard to make sure that U.S. intelligence agents as well as foreign partners were protected during the probe, along with sensitive methods, techniques, and materials that could compromise national security.

This broad probe by DOJ is separate from the investigation by DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz into alleged Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse by the Justice Department and the FBI. That inquiry includes a focus on the FBI’s handling of the unverified dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele and its extensive use in the FBI's FISA applications and renewals to surveil former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

Barr has previously said, however, that Horowitz’s “ability to get information from former officials or from other agencies outside the Department [of Justice] is very limited.” Thus, Barr picked Durham to carry out a beefed-up inquiry.

Durham will continue serving as Connecticut’s U.S. attorney, the DOJ said, but his review is already “being conducted primarily in the Washington D.C. area” and his DOJ team will operate out of “existing office space.”"
"DOJ, Cummings trade last-minute offers amid contempt impasse",https://www.politico.com,"['Andrew Desiderio', 'Darren Samuelsohn']",06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/11/justice-executive-privilege-census-1360582,"The Department of Justice advised President Donald Trump around providing documents related to a citizenship question on the 2020 census. | Yasin Ozturk/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images legal DOJ, Cummings trade last-minute offers amid contempt impasse

House Democrats and the Justice Department traded last-minute offers late Tuesday night in an effort to stave off contempt proceedings against Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross — but those talks appeared to lead to yet another impasse ahead of a Wednesday morning committee vote.

The two sides exchanged fiery letters after the Justice Department said Tuesday afternoon that it would advise President Donald Trump to invoke executive privilege to block the House Oversight and Reform Committee’s access to documents about efforts to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.

Story Continued Below

In a letter to Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the panel’s chairman, Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd threatened a blanket assertion of privilege if the committee proceeds with a scheduled vote on Wednesday to hold Barr and Ross in contempt of Congress for failing to turn over subpoenaed documents, calling such proceedings “premature.”

“In the face of this threatened contempt vote, the attorney general is now compelled to request that the president invoke executive privilege with respect to the materials subject to the subpoena to the attorney general and the subpoena to the secretary of the department of commerce,” Boyd wrote.

Later Tuesday night, Cummings declared in a letter to Barr that he “cannot accept” the terms outlined by the Justice Department, adding: “The committee has a responsibility under the Constitution to conduct rigorous oversight of the Census, and we will not continue to delay our efforts due to your ongoing obstruction.”

Cummings said he would postpone Wednesday’s contempt votes for Barr and Ross if they agreed to provide specific documents by 9 p.m. Tuesday night. But a committee spokeswoman said after the deadline that the Justice Department “received the letter but can’t respond tonight.”

The war of words escalated last week after the Justice and Commerce departments rejected the committee’s subpoenas for additional documents about the addition of a citizenship question, prompting Cummings to schedule a full committee vote to hold Barr and Ross in criminal contempt of Congress. The Trump administration has maintained that it cannot legally turn over those documents.

The Justice Department’s eleventh-hour threat over executive privilege was nothing new. The department employed a similar tactic on the eve of the House Judiciary Committee’s vote to hold Barr in contempt of Congress for defying that panel’s subpoena for special counsel Robert Mueller’s unredacted report and all underlying evidence. The Judiciary Committee proceeded with its contempt vote against Barr, prompting Trump to assert executive privilege over the full Mueller report and all of its contents.

“If the committee decides to proceed in spite of this request, however, the department will be obliged to advise that the president assert executive privilege with respect to certain of the subpoenaed documents, and to make a protective assertion of executive privilege over the remainder of the documents,” Boyd wrote on Tuesday, adding that the subpoenaed information is already protected by attorney-client privilege.

The committee has been investigating the Trump administration’s decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, with Democrats arguing that the question was added to trigger newly drawn congressional districts that would boost Republicans electorally.

Republicans have said the contempt proceedings against Barr and Ross are premature, citing ongoing Supreme Court litigation over the census issue.

DOJ supports lawsuit demanding religious tuition payments,https://www.foxnews.com,[],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/doj-supports-lawsuit-demanding-religious-tuition-payments,"The U.S. Department of Justice is backing three families who are suing to force the state of Maine to pay tuition for some students to attend religious high schools.

The ""Statement of Interest"" filed Monday supports a lawsuit that targets the state's longstanding tuition policy for students in districts that don't have a high school. In those cases, the state will pay for tuition to a private school, but not a religious school.

Over the years, state and federal courts have consistently upheld the Maine's exclusion of religious-backed private schools from the tuition program.

But the Department of Justice contends that the state has failed to justify its ""discrimination"" against religious schools, citing a U.S. Supreme Court decision in a case in which the Missouri Department of Natural Resources denied a grant to a church-affiliated preschool.

The DOJ filing reflects how the U.S. Supreme Court ""seems to be leaning our way on this issue,"" said Steven Whiting, an attorney who filed a friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of an Orthodox Jewish organization.

""The law has changed over time and now it's time for the court to look at this thing as a constitutional right. School choice shouldn't depend on whether you're religious or not,"" he said.

But Zachary Heiden from the ACLU of Maine said he didn't see many similarities with the Supreme Court case that dealt with state grants for a playground surface made from recycled rubber tires in Missouri.

""This is a case about whether the state is going to be required to fund religious school education, which I think is very different than shredded rubber tires,"" he said Tuesday.

Maine Assistant Attorney General Sarah Forster and Christopher Taub wrote that the U.S. Supreme Court ruling was intended to be interpreted narrowly, and that Maine's tuition system ""is fully constitutional.""

Three families in Glenburn and Palermo are suing in U.S. District Court to force the state to pay for their kids to attend Bangor Christian Schools and Temple Academy.

The lawsuit contends that denying religious schools, while allowing tuition payments for other private schools, violates the families' constitutional rights.

Maine's attorney general advised in 1980 that it's unconstitutional to use public funds to send students to schools ""characterized by a pervasively religious atmosphere."" Lawmakers enacted legislation in 1982 to prevent religious schools from receiving such tuition payments.

The U.S. Department of Justice has filed several similar actions around the country following an executive order promoting ""Free Speech and Religious Liberty"" by President Donald Trump. Then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions followed up with guidance for federal agencies in October 2017.

Last month, DOJ weighed in with support of students who are suing Vermont. The lawsuit targets the state's refusal to pay college tuition under a dual enrollment program for students attending religious high schools. The program helps students at public or secular private schools obtain college credits while attending high school.

House Intelligence panel requests documents after reports WH blocked climate change testimony,https://www.cnn.com,['Eli Watkins'],06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/11/politics/house-intelligence-state-department-climate-change/index.html,"Washington (CNN) House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff has requested documents from a State Department agency on the heels of reports that the White House blocked an official from submitting testimony on climate change.

Schiff, a California Democrat, said in a letter dated Tuesday to Ellen McCarthy, the assistant secretary for the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, that his committee was left with ""deep concern"" that the Trump administration recently sought to bar the submission of written testimony from Rod Schoonover ""for political reasons."" Schoonover, an analyst with the State Department agency, testified before the House panel last week.

The Washington Post, citing several administration sources, reported that officials from several different White House offices took issue with Schoonover's prepared testimony in which he was going to warn Congress about wide-ranging and ""possibly catastrophic"" national security concerns as a result of human-caused climate change.

In his letter, Schiff said the administration ""repeatedly confirmed"" ahead of the June 5 hearing that Schoonover would submit written testimony, but that the evening before the hearing, the State Department informed the committee ""without explanation"" that the agency would not submit a written statement.

He said the House Intelligence Committee, ""in light of these reports of undue White House interference in testimony before the Committee,"" now requests testimony from McCarthy or ""an appropriate senior representative"" to address: Schoonover's testimony; communications with the White House about that written testimony; the prepared written testimony itself; and other documents relevant to the hearing and blocked testimony.

Homeland Security watchdog retires early after his office was forced to retract ‘feel-good’ audits of disaster response,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Lisa Rein', 'Reporter Covering Federal Agencies', 'The Management Of Government In The Trump Administration', 'Kimberly Kindy', 'National Investigative Reporter']",06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/homeland-security-watchdog-retires-early-after-his-office-was-forced-to-retract-feel-good-audits-of-disaster-response/2019/06/10/a370f488-8b9d-11e9-b08e-cfd89bd36d4e_story.html,"A house on Staten Island that was heavily damaged during Hurricane Sandy, shown in 2012. (Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images)

John V. Kelly, the acting inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security, announced his retirement Monday following revelations that he directed his staff to whitewash audits of the agency’s performance after federal disasters.

Kelly, 64, a career auditor who rose to the top job in 2017, announced his retirement in a brief email Monday morning to hundreds of DHS employees and contractors.

“It has been an honor and privilege to serve the American citizens for over 40 years,” he wrote. “However, it is time for me to retire.”

Kelly, who had planned to retire after the confirmation of President Trump’s nominee for the position, wrote in an email to The Washington Post that he “accelerated my retirement because I feel it’s in the best interest of the organization and its employees.”

“As I told the staff, I have truly enjoyed my 11-year tenure with the DHS OIG, an organization with a very important mission and extraordinary staff and managers that successfully execute that mission on a daily basis,” Kelly wrote. “Nobody in DHS leadership or any member of Congress asked me retire.”

Kelly’s announcement follows The Post’s report last week that an internal review found that Kelly overrode auditors who had found problems with the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s response to various disasters.

When teams of auditors flew to local communities to assess how well FEMA was helping residents recover, Kelly — then in charge of the emergency management auditing staff — directed them to ignore most problems, according to the internal review and interviews. Instead, he told them to produce what the staff dubbed “feel-good reports.”

[How the DHS watchdog whitewashed audits of FEMA’s disaster response]

The practice was repeated over five years after hurricanes, floods, wildfires and other disasters, including Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and catastrophic flooding in Louisiana in 2016, the review found.

Under pressure from House Republicans, the inspector general’s office retracted 13 faulty reports and purged them from its website in 2017 and 2018. Officials acknowledged they did not comply with federal auditing standards.

The inspector general’s office then spent 14 months examining what occurred. Kelly was recused from the review.

Investigators found that Kelly had praised FEMA’s work ethic to his auditors, telling them they would see “FEMA at her best” and instructing supervisors to emphasize what the agency had done right in its disaster response

Kelly joined the inspector general’s office in 2008 from the Government Accountability Office, where his long career covered performance and financial audits and program evaluations at numerous federal agencies.

A graduate of the University of Scranton, he quickly rose through the ranks in the DHS inspector general’s office, which provides independent, fact-driven audits and investigations of the performance of the sprawling agency.

The flawed audits on his watch represented a tiny fraction of the watchdog’s oversight of FEMA. The internal review did not find that Kelly was influenced by a personal relationship with anyone at the emergency response agency.

However, Jennifer Costello, the deputy inspector general, told the head of the internal review team that the “retraction of publicly issued reports because they are not reliable” was “not an insignificant matter.”

The reports, Costello wrote, “represent millions of wasted taxpayer dollars and understandably cast doubt on our credibility.” She said the inspector general’s office needs to hold itself to “the same standards to which we hold the Department when conducting oversight of its programs and operation.”

When the internal review was made public on May 23, Kelly sent his staff an email of apology, writing, “I take responsibility for failing to set a tone that all of our products need to be fully objective.”

The office has agreed to an outside review of its performance by another federal inspector general’s office to ensure that it has improved its overall operations and oversight of FEMA.

Trump this spring nominated Joseph V. Cuffari, a policy adviser to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R), to lead the office. His nomination has not yet been voted on by the Senate.

Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, said that the situation underscored the need for Cuffari to be promptly confirmed. “Ensuring a department has an independent inspector general is vital to maintaining transparency and holding government agencies accountable,” Johnson said in a statement."
Just One Tiny Industry May Emit More Methane Than EPA Had Estimated for All of Them,https://earther.gizmodo.com,"['Yessenia Funes', 'About The Author', 'I Mostly Write About How Environmental Policy', 'Climate Change Intersect With Race', 'Class Though I Occasionally Write About Animals', 'Science', 'Art', 'Too.

People tend to equate methane with cow farts (though their burps are worse), but we may be pointing our fingers in all the wrong places, according to a new study. The production of ammonia for fertilizer may result in up to 100 times more emissions than has been previously estimated for this sector. And that alone is more than what the Environmental Protection Agency estimates all industries emit across the U.S.

The study, published May 28 in the journal Elementa, zooms into the ammonia fertilizer industry because it relies heavily on natural gas to run its production plants. Ammonia is a compound made of nitrogen, which is used across the agriculture sector to fuel the growth of crops. While the ammonia fertilizer industry’s emissions of carbon dioxide are better understood, emissions of methane—which has 25 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide over a century—were a huge question mark. Until now.

The team of authors from Cornell University and the Environmental Defense Fund had two sampling adventures in June 2015 and September 2016 that took them to six ammonia fertilizer plants in the Midwest, including Oklahoma, Kansas, and Iowa. They used their findings to estimate industry-wide emissions throughout the U.S. The team found that the fertilizer industry results in 29 gigagrams of methane emissions a year. The EPA, however, reports this industry emitted only 0.2 gigagrams of methane a year between 2015 and 2016. As for all industries (like waste, chemical, and metals production), the EPA estimates 8 gigagrams, which is still much smaller than this single industry’s.

A worst case scenario—where other plants are consuming more natural gas than the ones analyzed—resulted in methane emissions that reached 139 gigagrams a year. For context, that’s equivalent to the carbon emissions from 669,314 passenger vehicles driven in a year. Or more than the carbon emitted from 3 billion pounds of coal burned. Best case scenario, the emissions are just 2 gigagrams of methane a year, which is still a lot more than what the EPA currently estimates for this industry.

That is pretty wild, but this is an estimate based only on six plants. They make up more than 25 percent of the 23 plants operating in 2016 and are also of varying sizes to represent the different facilities throughout the U.S., so the six are a pretty good sample. But the authors would like to examine more plants to be sure.

The researchers drove downwind from the facilities in a Google Street View car decked out with a killer methane analyzer that recorded the methane levels in the air. That way, the team was able to capture the methane emissions near the facility in the areas where wind was likely to push it. This poses some limitations, though, because not every plant had the best road access. The authors recommend looking at airborne measurements next time, too. The team looked at samples over just a few days in a single month over these two years. Capturing a longer timeline of data could further verify (or disprove!) their analysis.

Methane emissions feel especially relevant these days. The Trump administration has been attempting to roll back methane regulations since President Awful took office. (The Department of Energy actually called natural gas “freedom gas” the other day.) A coalition of states and environmental groups like the Sierra Club pressed a judge Friday to stop Trump from rolling back these protections, reports E&E News.

Methane isn’t just dangerous for our planet because it’s worsening climate change; its emissions are often coupled with particulate matter and other air pollutants that pose threats to the health of communities closest to the facilities where it’s being emitted.

State Dept. pushes back on Friedman comments about Israel's 'right' to annex West Bank,https://www.cnn.com,"['Nicole Gaouette', 'Jennifer Hansler']",06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/11/politics/david-friedman-us-israel-west-bank/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The State Department pushed back on comments by the US ambassador to Israel suggesting that Israel has a right to annex part of the West Bank.

State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said the administration's position on the West Bank has not changed, despite Ambassador David Friedman's comments to The New York Times that ""Israel has the right to retain some, but unlikely all, of the West Bank.""

Speaking to reporters Monday, Ortagus said that ""the administration's position on the settlements has not changed. Our policy on the West Bank has not changed.""

Asked what the US position on settlement activity is, a State Department official cited President Donald Trump, saying that ""as the President has said, while the existence of settlements is not in itself an impediment to peace, further unrestrained settlement activity doesn't help advance peace.""

International law

Israeli settlement activity in the Palestinian territories is illegal under international law, though Israel has always sought to dispute this. The State Department official said they had nothing further to add when asked if the US considers Israeli settlement construction to be illegal.

Ortagus on Monday said there was no plan for any sort of disciplinary action against Friedman.

""The ambassador, the secretary and everyone who is involved in the Middle East peace plan, in this entire administration, is working towards a comprehensive and lasting peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians,"" she continued.

The State Department has been a junior partner in the administration's efforts to forge a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That initiative has been led out of the White House by Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, along with Friedman and a former lawyer for the Trump organization, Jason Greenblatt.

'A significant change'

The trio has been promoting the economic aspects of their plan, saying they want to improve Palestinian quality of life, but downplaying the prospect of finding a political solution and playing down the long-standing formula of a two-state solution with both sides having a capital in Jerusalem.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu raised the prospect of annexing some parts of the West Bank in the final days of the recent election campaign in an effort to rally conservative voters. Asked if that move might hurt the chances of peace, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Jake Tapper in April, ""I think that the vision that we'll lay out is going to represent a significant change from the model that's been used.""

Aaron David Miller, a vice president at the Wilson Center and a CNN contributor, said that in previous administrations, Israeli settlement policy was ""on the radar screen"" as an issue.

Not on the radar

""It is now not on the radar screen and there is what I would describe as a willful acquiescence to the settlement enterprise,"" Miller said. ""When no one challenges statements about annexation, including the secretary of state ... you can't help reach the conclusion that this is a fundamental reorientation in policy to basically undermine the traditional US approach"" of a two-state solution and ""some reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians.""

Other analysts raised the security implications of annexation.

The Israeli Policy Forum, a group that advocates for a two-state solution, said while Friedman's annexation remarks ""are not surprising, given his long publicized pro-settlement and anti-two-state outlook, they are disturbing nonetheless."" The Israeli security establishment, most major American Jewish organizations and pro-Israel members of Congress support the idea of two states, the forum said.

Annexation would be ""deeply harmful to Israel's long-term future as a Jewish, democratic, and secure state,"" the forum said in a statement, adding that it would create an uncertain security and diplomatic environment for Israel, risk the collapse of the Palestinian Authority and ""be a disaster for Israelis and Palestinians."""

Thompson’s announcement was made on the heels of the disclosure by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) that a subcontractor had suffered a data breach, compromising photos of travelers and license plates compiled by the border agency.

CBP told The Hill the subcontractor that had its network breached had not been given permission to transfer CBP photos to its system. CBP has not named the subcontractor, and told The Hill that as of Monday, none of the images involved in the breach has been discovered on the darknet.

Thompson criticized CBP and the Department of Homeland Security in general for allowing the data breach to occur, saying in a statement that the privacy of Americans can’t be compromised.

“Government use of biometric and personal identifiable information can be valuable tools only if utilized properly,” Thompson said. “Unfortunately, this is the second major privacy breach at DHS this year. We must ensure we are not expanding the use of biometrics at the expense of the privacy of the American public.”

A spokesperson for Thompson told The Hill that the committee “hopes to have government witnesses” at the hearings, but had no further details on dates in July the hearings will take place."
Veteran 'literally body-slammed' by VA police: Lawmakers grill VA on use of force,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Donovan Slack', 'Published P.M. Et June']",06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/06/11/veterans-affairs-officials-grilled-va-police-vet-injuries-death/1425552001/,"CLOSE A USA TODAY investigation into VA Medical Centers shows that veterans are enduring longer emergency room wait times than those at non-VA facilities. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – One described a Veterans Affairs police officer throwing a New York veteran seeking therapy to the ground. Another said a California veteran died after receiving similar treatment at the hands of VA police there. A third noted that a VA officer training to be an instructor at the national VA police academy threatened employees with a gun at a Massachusetts car dealership.

The underlying question from lawmakers to VA officials Tuesday: What is going on with VA police?

“I mean really what are they doing over there?” asked Rep. Gilbert Cisneros, Jr, D-Calif., who questioned training in particular. “Why are we having these situations where individuals are being injured or hurt or killed?”

An investigation of the VA police force by the agency’s inspector general concluded in December that systemic management failures had resulted in short-staffing and millions in overtime charged to taxpayers, as well as missed opportunities to ensure staff and veteran patients were protected.

USA TODAY reported in December on a case in Missouri where a veteran died after being tackled and detained by VA police in Kansas City.

Senior VA executives told lawmakers at the hearing Tuesday that the agency has hired a new security manager and appointed police supervisors in every VA region to improve management. They said officer training has been extended in recent years and includes a focus on de-escalating situations rather than confrontation.

“It’s really troubling, it’s hard for me to sit here and answer questions after hearing the stories that you’re talking about, and certainly anytime anything like this occurs, we have to go back and question whether or not the things that we are doing are being effective,” said Renee Oshinski, acting deputy under secretary for health for operations and management.

Kevin Hanretta, the principal deputy assistant secretary for operations, security and preparedness, said the incidents in New York and California described by lawmakers are “very unfortunate.” But he said they are not representative of “the VA police in the field serving our nation’s veterans.” Hanretta said the job offer for the instructor-trainee at the academy, since rescinded, is under investigation.

The VA employs nearly 4,000 officers at 139 medical centers who play a critical role in securing property, preventing and investigating crimes and often intervening to help patients or staff during potentially dangerous incidents.

'Literally body-slammed'

Rep. Kathleen Rice, D-N.Y., said Tuesday that mission went awry when one of her constituents went last June to the VA in Northport, N.Y. Jean Telefort, a veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder, was seeking therapy after spinal surgery.

She said the VA had allowed him to see a non-VA therapist after the procedure, but then cut that off and sent him to a VA facility instead. That facility, however, didn’t offer therapy. So the VA sent him to the VA in Northport. When he became frustrated, a scheduling clerk there called VA police.

“He was literally body slammed onto the ground, with his arms twisted behind his back,” Rice said. “This is someone who was post spinal surgery – he informed them of that, ‘I can’t breathe, I just had spinal surgery.’”

But VA officers kept him on the ground, and refused to take his handcuffs off, even after a physical therapist who had treated him before said Telefort was not a danger.

Rice said he later received summonses to appear in federal court for charges that have since been deferred. She said a VA employee later accessed his medical records and entered false information.

“This incident keeps going on and on and on,” Rice said. “The questions that I have are many.”

The director of the VA’s office of security and law enforcement, Frederick Jackson, said an investigation after the incident, which included statements from witnesses, concluded the VA officers acted appropriately.

Veterans die after VA police run-ins

In Loma Linda, California, a 65-year-old veteran became frustrated after waiting four hours for a procedure in 2011. He tried to leave and go to a VA in Long Beach instead, but VA officers wouldn’t let him.

“They pretty much took him, slammed him to the ground, hit his head and he ended up dying,” Cisneros said.

The family won a $500,000 settlement from the VA in 2015, according to the lawyer who filed the case, although the agency maintained he had died from an unrelated stroke.

Family members of the veteran who died in Kansas City after an altercation with VA police also have filed suit. USA TODAY reported in December that a veteran tackled by VA officers outside the VA medical center was found by emergency medical workers to be “non-verbal, moaning with a decreased level of consciousness,” according to internal documents.

They said he had a gash in his scalp and “multiple” cuts and bruises on his face. A CT scan of his head showed areas of bleeding around his brain. The veteran, identified as Dale Farhner in the lawsuit, died soon afterward.

In response to inquiries from USA TODAY at the time, VA spokesman Curt Cashour said the incident was under investigation.

An instructor trainee

In January, a VA police employee who had recently won a post as an instructor trainee at the national VA police academy stumbled into a car dealership in Massachusetts, flashed a gun and demanded gas for his car, The Boston Globe reported.

Police arrested him and put him in a cell, where he stuffed the toilet with paper and banged his head against the door. He had previously been dismissed from the Massachusetts State Police, faced allegations of sexual harassment and, in 2017, had his permit to carry a weapon revoked.

“Can you just help me understand how that would happen – how this man of all people would be sent to the elite VA police academy?” Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., asked VA officials Tuesday.

Hanretta, the deputy assistant secretary overseeing security, said the VA immediately launched an investigation and the academy job offer was rescinded.

“In this particular case, at the time of his selection, we were not aware of all of the background circumstances,” he said.

Jackson, the director of law enforcement noted that while he did “go down to the law enforcement training center, he was never an instructor” because he hadn’t completed training yet.

“I have no idea why this man would wear the uniform period,” Moulton said.

REUTERS/Ting Shen

(Reuters) - The main U.S. refining industry association said on Monday it sued to block the Trump administration’s effort to expand sales of higher ethanol blends of gasoline, arguing the move exceeded the administration’s authority.

The legal challenge from the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) association escalated a battle between the oil and corn industries over the nation’s biofuel policy, which requires refiners to blend biofuels like corn-based ethanol into their gasoline, often at great expense.

President Donald Trump had directed the Environmental Protection Agency to lift a summertime ban on the sale of gasoline containing 15 percent ethanol, called E15, in an effort to help farmers suffering from the U.S. trade war with China. The EPA unveiled its rule doing so on May 31.

The summertime E15 ban had been implemented during the Obama administration to reduce smog emissions, but Trump’s EPA said E15’s impact on air quality was similar to that of E10, which could already be sold year-round.

The tension over the policy move reflects how Trump has struggled to please both Big Oil and Big Agriculture, two critical constituencies in the Republican president’s 2020 re-election bid.

AFPM asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to review the EPA’s rule, in papers filed on Monday, said Diana Cronan, a spokeswoman for the group.

AFPM has one month to provide the court with the outline of its case, she said."

“We will work with this group of employees just as we work with all USDA employees,” Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement Tuesday. (Erik S. Lesser/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock) (Erik S Lesser/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)

For the second time this year, workers at a science division of the Agriculture Department voted overwhelmingly to unionize in apparent revolt against the administration’s plan to relocate them from Washington, D.C., to a yet-to-be-announced location.

On Tuesday, employees at the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which distributes $400 million in grants to researchers around the country each year, voted 137 to 2 to be represented by the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employees union. In May, the Economic Research Service, a federal statistical agency also included in the relocation, voted 138 to 4 to unionize with AFGE.

“We will work with this group of employees just as we work with all USDA employees,” Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement distributed to reporters before the votes were counted. In August, Perdue announced the relocation as a cost-saving measure that would move scientists closer to those they serve, a claim critics dispute.

In early May, USDA announced that Kansas City, the Research Triangle in North Carolina and the state of Indiana had been selected as the leading candidates for relocation sites. The department has not said when it would make a final decision. “I truly believe that the relocation of ERS and NIFA will help to fulfill USDA’s commitment to be the most effective, most efficient and most customer-focused agency in the federal government,” Perdue said in the statement.

Former USDA officials and leaders in the agricultural community argue the relocation will paralyze the agencies, and have also warned that this proposal is an attempt to weaken the influence of scientists under the Trump administration.

Members of Congress were divided largely along partisan lines. At an Agriculture Committee hearing last week, Rep. Neal Dunn (R-Fla.) said the secretary “has broad support to move forward with this decision.” But Democrats in both chambers have introduced legislation to block the move, and they dispute whether the secretary has the authority to relocate the offices without congressional approval.

Peter Winch, a union organizer for AFGE, said that the newly formed union would ask the department to allow employees to visit the proposed relocation site and to give them more than 30 days to respond to reassignment letters.

The unionization vote comes as the Trump administration has taken a confrontational approach toward federal employees and their unions with executive orders, new policies creating a faster path to firing and tough stances at the bargaining table.

At a rally on Tuesday morning, about a dozen NIFA and ERS employees waved American flags and handed out pro-union stickers. Unionization would “delay changes to working conditions” and offer “protection from political interference,” according to the fliers they distributed. Those who spoke to The Washington Post did so on the condition of anonymity because they said they feared professional repercussions. Many employees are applying for new jobs in the District, and few said that they would consider relocating.

A senior NIFA employee said that the push to unionize “would never have happened without the secretary of agriculture.” Another lamented the absence of a USDA chief scientist, who in previous administrations had been the voice of scientists in the department.

A third employee said the workload — the number of grant awards to be processed — has quadrupled due to high attrition and the lasting effects of the federal government shutdown this winter. “The mission still has to be done,” the person said, but the “morale is not great.”

Inside the NIFA office building, workers waited for up to an hour to vote. Three-quarters of NIFA employees eligible to cast a ballot did so. About 30 people watched as an official from the Federal Labor Relations Authority counted the votes. NIFA employees cheered when the final tally was announced.

“Waiting for the department to give us a voice was not going to happen,” the senior NIFA employee said. The relocation process, which has “generated considerable frustration,” the person said, “provided a lot of motivation for employees to form a union in order to have a voice.”

The administration has argued that its pro-management policies are an effort to make government and its employees more efficient and able to serve the public. But the actions have created anxiety in federal offices and resulted in court challenges.

Last year, a federal judge shot down the bulk of three White House executive orders that were designed to bring a pro-management atmosphere to federal offices.

Among the toughest provisions was a drastic cut to what is known as official time, legally mandated spans that union officials spend on the clock representing their members in grievances and other disputes. The executive orders also sought to make it easier for managers to fire poor performers.

The judge’s ruling is on appeal, and a decision is expected in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, the administration has worked around the constraints of the court ruling at the bargaining table.

Additionally, the DOJ announced that the probe, let by Connecticut U.S. Attorney John Durham, was looking into the involvement of ""foreign intelligence services."" Former Trump aide George Papadopoulos told Fox News last month that an informant who was likely ""CIA and affiliated with Turkish intel"" had posed as a Cambridge University research assistant in September 2016 and tried to ""seduce him"" to obtain information linking the Trump team to Russia.

The information was contained in a letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., who had inquired as to the scope of Durham's investigation. The letter could indicate that the DOJ is looking closely at work done during the campaign by Fusion GPS, the firm retained by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee (DNC) to conduct opposition research against the Trump campaign.

Fusion GPS, in turn, hired British ex-spy Christopher Steele to produce an unverified and largely discredited dossier that the FBI went on to cite in secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court applications to surveil former Trump aide Carter Page.

CARTER PAGE: FBI INFORMANT 'INTENSIFIED' COMMUNICATIONS JUST BEFORE FISA WARRANT OBTAINED

Last week, reports indicated Steele had agreed to talk with Durham if certain preconditions were met. Multiple sources familiar with the matter told Fox News, meanwhile, that Durham is “very dialed in” and “asking all the right questions."" Separately, sources within the Justice Department confirmed to Fox News that Barr has met “on multiple occasions in recent weeks” with Durham in Washington, D.C.

Numerous problems with the Steele dossier's reliability have surfaced, including several issues that were brought to the FBI's attention before it cited the dossier in its FISA application and subsequent renewals. Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report made plain, for example, that then-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen did not travel to Prague to conspire with Russian hackers seeking to access Democrat files, as the dossier alleged.

Mueller also was unable to substantiate the dossier's claims that Page had received a large payment relating to the sale of a share of Rosneft, a Russian oil giant.

FMR TRUMP AIDE ALLEGES BOMBSHELL INFORMANT TRIED TO 'SEDUCE' HIM IN 'BIZARRE' EPISODE FOR RUSSIA DIRT ON TRUMP

North Carolina GOP Rep. Mark Meadows told Fox News on Sunday he has seen ""additional documents"" that demonstrate that “prior to the first FISA application, Peter Strzok, Andy McCabe, and others at the FBI knew that Christopher Steele's dossier was not credible.” Internal FBI text messages obtained by Fox News in March showed FBI brass scrambling to respond to a concern from a senior DOJ official about the potential ""bias"" of a key FISA source.

Meadows, speaking to ""Fox News Sunday,"" pointed specifically to a report from The Hill's John Solomon, who found that Ukrainian businessman Konstantin Kilimnik, a key figure in Mueller's report, was actually a U.S. informant. In his report, Mueller linked Kilimnik to Russian intelligence, and did not mention Kilimnik's secretive ties to the U.S. in the report other court filings -- even as Mueller suggested former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's ties to Kilimnik were nefarious.

""The deeper the dive we take into the Mueller report, we're starting to find out some of the conclusions, and actually some of the facts they put forth in there, are a misrepresentation of what we actually know,"" Meadows said.

Meadows added that he expected DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigation into potential FBI and DOJ surveillance misconduct to come out later than June, when it was originally expected. Meadows said more information has come to light that might necessitate the delay.

Solomon, reporting for the Hill, also recently unearthed a documented conversation Steele had with a State Department contact -- which were relayed to the FBI -- in which Steele claimed the Russians were running a “technical/human operation run out of Moscow targeting the election"" and that ""payments to those recruited are made out of the Russian Consulate in Miami.""

There is no Russian consulate in Miami, a fact the State Department official, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec, emphasized in her notes. Additionally, Steele had suggested his client was ""keen"" to see his information come to light prior to Election Day. Kavalec forwarded her notes to the FBI and other government officials several days before the FISA warrant was issued for Page. Fox News has confirmed The Hill's reporting.

RUSSIAN-BORN UK ACADEMIC SAYS SHE'S BEING USED TO 'SMEAR' MICHAEL FLYNN

Further, in its original FISA application and subequent renewals, the FBI told the FISA court that it ""did not believe"" Steele was the direct source for a Yahoo News article implicating Page in Russian collusion. Instead, the FBI suggested to the court, the September 2016 article by Michael Isikoff was independent corroboration of the dossier.

But London court records show that contrary to the FBI's assessments, Steele briefed Yahoo News and other reporters in the fall of 2016 at the direction of Fusion GPS.

'Dangerous Proposal': USDA Seeking to Replace Government Inspectors at Beef Slaughter Plants With Private Employees,https://www.ecowatch.com,"['Common Dreams', 'Jordan Davidson', 'Yes', 'The Revelator', 'Olivia Rosane']",06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.ecowatch.com/usda-inspectors-deregulation-2638771530.html,"By Julia Conley

In an apparent effort to boost profits for meat manufacturers despite potential harms to food safety, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is reportedly planning to privatize inspections of beef slaughter plants.

""This dangerous proposal could rid beef slaughter plants of most government inspectors,"" Food and Water Watch said in a statement.

The group released an application from beef, pork, and poultry manufacturer Tyson Foods, in which the company requested a waiver to allow Tyson employees to conduct more inspections at its beef plant in Holcolm, Kansas, instead of relying on USDA food safety inspectors.

Food and Water Watch reported Monday that the USDA is pursuing deregulation of the food inspection system that has been used for years at beef slaughterhouses. The information came from documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act.

BREAKING: We have obtained documents that confirm the USDA is seeking to privatize inspections of beef slaughterhouses. This dangerous proposal could rid beef slaughter plants of most government inspectors. https://t.co/jNospAvLYn pic.twitter.com/cbx4fo6lHy

The documents were uncovered after many recent denials by USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) that it plans to privatize inspections of mass-produced beef, Food and Water Watch stated.

Tyson's proposal comes 21 years after FSIS first launched a pilot program in more than two dozen poultry and pork plants in which government food safety inspectors were replaced by the manufacturers' own inspectors, allowing the companies to regulate themselves.

In 2013, the USDA's inspector general found that the agency ""did not critically assess whether the new inspection process had measurably improved food safety at each plant"" that produced pork.

The following year, FSIS expanded the program to the entire poultry industry. The agency will not conduct an assessment of the new system's effects on food safety until 2022.

""The previous attempts at privatized inspection have led to weaker food safety performance and are a ploy by the industry to increase line speeds,"" said Tony Corbo, a senior lobbyist with Food and Water Watch.

Despite a lack of evidence that the privatized food safety inspection system is making food safer — and CDC data showing that foodborne illnesses from foods including chicken have been on the rise since 2015 — FSIS is weakening standards in order to increase the speed with which meat is processed, allowing for greater manufacturing profits.

""The Tyson plant in Holcomb, Kansas is approved to operate at the current maximum line speed allowable"" said Corbo. ""FSIS management has had difficulty meeting its inspection staffing requirements in the past in western Kansas, which has contributed to beef slaughter plants not being able to maintain maximum line speeds. Tyson's solution seems to be to get rid of the government inspectors."""
Trump appoints Social Security Administration watchdog to also oversee Interior,https://thehill.com,[],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/447713-trump-appoints-social-security-administration-watchdog-to-also,"President Trump Donald John TrumpTop Armed Services Republican plots push for 0B defense budget Amash exits House Freedom Caucus in wake of Trump impeachment stance Amash exits House Freedom Caucus in wake of Trump impeachment stance MORE has quietly appointed his Social Security Administration (SSA) inspector general to also oversee a much different agency: the Interior Department.

On May 28, Gail Ennis began her second job overseeing the Interior Department’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG), a role she will keep for the foreseeable future, the OIG confirmed to The Hill.

The Trump administration is still awaiting the confirmation of Mark Greenblatt, the former assistant inspector general for investigations at the Commerce Department, to formally head the Interior’s OIG office.

Ennis was sworn into the SSA role just five months ago, her first time serving as an inspector general. Her professional background is in securities litigation, working previously as a partner at the Washington, D.C.-based law firm WilmerHale, where she reportedly earned $2 million a year.

At the SSA, Ennis has most recently led efforts to thwart scam Social Security phone calls, at the Interior department she will oversee investigations into Interior’s newly appointed Secretary David Bernhardt's lobbying ties and two ongoing Justice Department investigations into former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke Ryan Keith ZinkeOvernight Energy: Trump appoints Social Security watchdog to also oversee Interior | Critics question EPA guidance on pipelines | Battle over science roils EPA Overnight Energy: Trump appoints Social Security watchdog to also oversee Interior | Critics question EPA guidance on pipelines | Battle over science roils EPA Trump appoints Social Security Administration watchdog to also oversee Interior MORE. One of those investigations has reportedly made it to the grand jury.

The appointment of Ennis to Interior was not formally announced by the White House, however, the Interior Department’s website was updated last week to reflect her new position.

Ennis replaces former acting Inspector General Mary Kendall, who retired from the office at the end of May. Kendall oversaw multiple ethics investigations into Zinke, including recommending a number of them to the Justice Department for further investigation. Those investigations reportedly played a heavy factor in Zinke’s decision to leave the administration early this year.

Ennis is the second Trump political appointee whom the administration has attempted to put in the Interior OIG role.

Earlier this year, Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson Benjamin (Ben) Solomon CarsonTrump appoints Social Security Administration watchdog to also oversee Interior Trump appoints Social Security Administration watchdog to also oversee Interior Ben Carson decries 'gotcha' politics: 'Give me a break' MORE announced to staff that Assistant HUD Secretary Suzanne Israel Tufts would replace Kendall. Because Tufts had been previously confirmed by the Senate, she would not have to go through another confirmation process for the role.

However, following backlash to that announcement, the Interior Department later said the announcement was a misunderstanding and Carson reversed the move. Tufts resigned not long after.

“On May 28th, Social Security [Inspector General] Gail S. Ennis started at [Department of Interior] OIG as Acting Inspector General. Continuing with her responsibilities as SSA IG, Ms. Ennis will also lead our organization while Mark Greenblatt’s nomination continues to progress in the Senate,” an OIG spokesperson said in a statement to The Hill.

The White House referred comment to the Interior OIG. The Interior Department did not return a request for comment.

In addition to the ongoing investigations into Interior's current and former secretaries, the OIG is also investigating six high-ranking interior officials for ethics concerns.

Wilmer Hale, the law firm where Ennis previously worked as a partner, lobbies for a number of clients with business before Interior. For example, the law firm represents Twin Metals a Minnesota based mineral mining company that is lobbing to build a hotly debated copper-nickel mine near the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. In May, the Trump administration moved to renew one of the mine's mineral leases, reversing a decision from the Obama administration.

Ennis, who was not a registered lobbyist, said the Interior OIG ethics office is currently reviewing her former clients.

""DOI OIG General Counsel is conducting a thorough ethics review that will ensure that I do not participate in any matter that would create a conflict of interest or an appearance of a conflict of interest,"" Ennis told the Hill in a statement.

"DOJ: Strawberry Farm to Pay Civil Penalties, Back Pay to Settle Claim of Discrimination Against U.S. Workers",https://www.cnsnews.com,['Craig Bannister'],06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnsnews.com/blog/craig-bannister/doj-strawberry-farm-pay-civil-penalties-back-pay-settle-claim-discrimination,"(Getty Images/Yawar Nazir)

A Florida strawberry farm has agreed to pay civil penalties and back pay to qualified U.S. workers to settle a claim it discriminated against American workers by employing temporary visa workers, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced Tuesday.

The settlement is the seventh achieved through its “Protecting U.S. Workers Initiative,” DOJ explains in a press release detailing the agreement:

“The Department of Justice today announced that it has reached a settlement agreement with Sam Williamson Farms Inc. (SWF), a strawberry farm in Dover, Florida. The settlement resolves the Department’s investigation into whether SWF violated the anti-discrimination provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) by preferring to hire H-2A visa holders to harvest its strawberry crop instead of U.S. workers. This is the seventh settlement under the Civil Rights Division’s Protecting U.S. Workers Initiative, which is aimed at targeting, investigating, and taking enforcement actions against companies that discriminate against U.S. workers in favor of temporary visa workers.

“The Department of Justice’s independent investigation concluded that at the end of the 2016-2017 strawberry picking season, SWF informed its existing U.S. workers that it would rely instead on H-2A workers from a farm labor contractor to harvest its strawberries for the next season, and retained a farm labor contractor for the express purpose of obtaining workers with H-2A visas. Ultimately, the strawberry picking positions were filled by more than 300 H-2A workers and no U.S. workers.

“Refusing to recruit or hire available and qualified U.S. workers because of their citizenship status violates the INA.”

Under the settlement, the strawberry farm agrees to:"
VA owes $190 million to disabled veterans improperly charged home loan fees,https://www.foxnews.com,['Robert Gearty'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/va-owes-190-million-to-disabled-veterans-improperly-charged-home-loan-fees,"The Department of Veterans Affairs owes about $189 million to 53,000 disabled veterans who were charged home loan fees they were exempt from having to pay, an investigation has found.

These veterans were charged the fees under the VA’s Home Loan Guaranty Program and now may be entitled to refunds ranging from $5,000 to $20,000, a VA Inspector General audit released Thursday found.

VA loan managers knew disabled vets were being charged the fees improperly since 2014 but never did anything about it, VA IG auditors determined.

“OIG finds it troubling that senior (Veterans Benefits Administration) management was aware that thousands of veterans were potentially owed more than $150 million yet did not take adequate actions to ensure refunds were issued,” the IG report says.

DOZENS OF ATTORNEYS GENERAL ASK BETSY DEVOS TO FORGIVE DISABLED VETS STUDENTS LOANS

The loan managers told the IG they were focused on other priorities, including processing high volumes of applications, USA Today reported.

The report faulted the Veterans Benefits Administration for placing the burden on a disabled vet to submit a claim for a refund.

The VA announced last month that it was notifying veterans when they buy homes through the Home Loan program that they are exempt from the fees if they are disabled or later determined to be disabled, the paper reported.

“Through an internal quality improvement effort, VA has put a plan in place to better inform veterans through key communications when the law allows VA to waive the fee for a veteran,” the announcement quoted VA Secretary Robert Wilkie as saying.

The Veterans Benefits Administration told the IG that it would identify exempt veterans who paid the fees and issue them refunds and that the financial impact to the veterans was minimal over the life of the loan, The Washington Post reported.

ANNUAL 'DAY OF SERVICE' TO OFFER FREE DENTAL CARE FOR VETERANS

Auditors looked at the period 2012 to 2017.



They determined nearly $300 million in home loan origination fees had been collected from 73,000 exempt disabled vets during that time.

The auditors found that nearly 20,000 of these veterans submitted claims for refunds and were reimbursed nearly $100 million."
Lawmakers try to save DHS lab that prepares first responders for terror threats,https://www.cnn.com,['Geneva Sands'],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/10/politics/dhs-lab-first-responders-funding-house/index.html,"(CNN) Lawmakers are again attempting to keep a Department of Homeland Security laboratory that specializes in first-responder technology and assistance from shutting its doors.

The House overwhelmingly passed a bill Monday evening that would permanently authorize the New York City-based National Urban Security Technology Laboratory, which has been at risk of losing funding over the past couple of years and was not included in the administration's latest DHS funding request.

The lab ""is constantly developing and testing new tools for our brave first responders to use in the event of a terrorist attack, industrial accident or natural disaster and closely collaborates with law enforcement agencies like the FDNY, NYPD and the Nassau County Police Department in my district,"" Rep. Kathleen Rice, a New York Democrat who cosponsored the bill, said Monday on the House floor, urging her colleagues to pass the legislation. The final vote was 395-3.

She said the administration has proposed closing the lab in each of the last two federal budgets.

The potential funding cut comes amid budget battles between the White House and Democrats on Capitol Hill, as the administration has shifted its funding and influence to the department's immigration missions.

WASDE: Corn Production Trimmed by 1.4 Billion Bushels,https://www.agweb.com,[],,,,https://www.agweb.com/article/wasde-corn-production-trimmed-by-14-billion-bushels/,"WASDE - 589

WHEAT: U.S. 2019/20 wheat supplies are down with lower beginning stocks partly offset by slightly higher production. Beginning stocks are down 25 million bushels on increased 2018/19 exports. Winter wheat production is forecast up 6 million bushels to 1,274 million with an increase to Hard Red Winter more than offsetting decreases for Soft Red Winter and White Winter. Total wheat production is now forecast at 1,903 million bushels, up 5.8 million bushels from the May forecast. Exports for 2019/20 are unchanged at 900 million bushels but feed and residual use is raised 50 million bushels to 140 million on reduced projected corn supplies. Ending stocks are lowered 69 million bushels to 1,072 million, and the season-average farm price is raised $0.40 per bushel to $5.10. The price increase reflects sharply higher wheat futures prices and reduced 2019/20 corn supplies.

World 2019/20 wheat supplies are raised 4.9 million tons on a 1.6-million-ton increase in beginning stocks and a 3.3-million-ton increase in global production. India’s wheat crop is raised 1.2 million tons on updated government data. Production in Russia and Ukraine are each raised 1.0 million tons reflecting favorable weather to date. Projected 2019/20 global trade is expanded 0.8 million tons with a 1.0-million-ton increase for Russia and a 0.5-million-ton increase for Ukraine, both due to larger crops. Russian exports are now projected at 37.0 million tons and Ukraine exports are projected at a record 19.5 million. Partly offsetting is a 0.5-million-ton decrease for EU exports with greater competition from Black Sea origins. Projected 2019/20 world consumption is raised 3.6 million tons on both higher food and feed and residual use. With supplies rising more than use, ending stocks are projected up 1.3 million tons to a record 294.3 million.

COARSE GRAINS: This month’s 2019/20 U.S. corn outlook is for increased beginning stocks and imports, sharply lower production, reduced feed and residual use and exports, and smaller ending stocks. Beginning stocks are up reflecting a 100-million-bushel decline in projected exports for 2018/19 to 2.2 billion bushels, based on current outstanding sales and reduced U.S. price competitiveness. Corn production for 2019/20 is forecast to decline 1.4 billion bushels to 13.7 billion, which if realized would be the lowest since 2015/16. Unprecedented planting delays observed through early June are expected to prevent some plantings and reduce yield prospects. USDA will release its Acreage report on June 28, which will provide survey-based indications of planted and harvested area. With sharply lower supplies, use is projected to decline 425 million bushels to 14.3 billion, based on reductions to feed and residual use and exports. With supplies falling more than use, ending stocks are projected to decline 810 million bushels to 1.7 billion, which if realized would be the lowest since 2013/14. The season-average farm price is raised 50 cents to $3.80 per bushel.

This month’s 2019/20 foreign coarse grain outlook is for lower production, increased trade and lower stocks relative to last month. Argentina corn production is raised on increased area with higher prices. Canada corn production is lowered on reductions to both area and yield with planting delays in Ontario. Russia corn production is higher based on government data indicating larger-than-expected planted area. Barley production is lowered for the EU reflecting a reduction for Spain. For 2018/19, Brazil corn production is raised based on the latest government statistics.

Major global trade changes for 2019/20 include larger forecast corn exports for Argentina and Russia, with a partly offsetting reduction for Zambia. For 2018/19, exports are raised for Brazil and Argentina for the local marketing year beginning in March 2019 based on higher-than-expected shipments during May. Foreign corn ending stocks are lowered from last month mostly reflecting reductions for Argentina, Brazil, Canada, and the EU.

RICE: The outlook for 2019/20 U.S. rice this month is for lower supplies, reduced domestic use and exports, and lower ending stocks. Projected U.S. all rice production is lowered 20.1 million cwt or 9 percent to 198.1 million with all of the decrease in long-grain, primarily on a reduction in planted area. The excessive spring precipitation in the Delta is expected to result in lower rice area in this region compared to the NASS Prospective Plantings intended acreage, issued March 29. Partially offsetting the smaller production are higher projected imports, which are raised by 1.2 million cwt to a record large 29.2 million with increases for both long-grain and medium- and short-grain. All rice projected domestic and residual use is lowered 7.0 million cwt to 133.0 million, mainly the result of reduced long-grain supplies. Projected all rice exports are reduced 1.0 million cwt to 100.0 million. The reduction in long-grain exports on higher projected prices is partially offset by increased medium- and short-grain exports as a portion of outstanding sales from the 2018/19 market year are expected to be shifted to 2019/20. Projected 2019/20 all rice ending stocks are lowered 7.2 million cwt to 51.6 million with long-grain accounting for all of the reduction. The projected 2019/20 all rice season-average farm price (SAFP) is raised by $0.50 per cwt to $11.70 with increases in the projected SAFPs of all rice classes this month.

Global 2019/20 rice supplies are decreased by 0.5 million tons to 667.8 million as higher carryin stocks are more than offset by lower production. Global production is down as reductions for the United States, North Korea, and Thailand are not completely offset by higher projected production for Madagascar, Egypt, and the EU. World 2019/20 consumption is lowered fractionally to 496.0 million tons on reduced expected use in China, North Korea, and the United States more than offsetting higher use in Madagascar, Bangladesh, Burma, and Egypt. Global 2019/20 trade is lowered 0.4 million tons to 47.2 million as reduced exports by India, Burma, and the United States are not completely offset by higher exports by China. Projected world ending stocks are adjusted lower this month to 171.9 million tons but remain record large.

OILSEEDS: This month’s U.S. soybean supply and use projections for 2019/20 include higher beginning and ending stocks. Beginning stocks are raised reflecting a 75-million-bushel reduction in projected exports for 2018/19 based on lower-than-expected shipments in May and a lower import forecast for China. Although adverse weather has significantly slowed soybean planting progress this year, area and production forecasts are unchanged with several weeks remaining in the planting season. With soybean use unchanged, 2019/20 ending stocks are projected at 1,045 million bushels, down 25 million from the revised 2018/19 projection. Other changes for 2018/19 include increased soybean meal imports and exports, reduced soybean oil used for biodiesel production, and higher soybean oil ending stocks.

The 2019/20 season-average price for soybeans is forecast at $8.25 per bushel, up 15 cents reflecting the impact of higher corn prices. Soybean meal prices are forecast at $295 per short ton, up 5 dollars. The soybean oil price forecast is unchanged at 29.5 cents per pound.

The 2019/20 global soybean supply and use projections include lower production and stocks compared to last month. Global production is down 0.3 million tons to 355.4 million due to lower crops for Ukraine and Zambia. The 2019/20 soybean ending stocks are lowered 0.4 million tons mainly reflecting lower carryin due to revisions to 2018/19 balance sheets. Beginning stocks for 2019/20 are reduced for Argentina and China offsetting higher stocks for the United States. For Argentina, stocks are lowered on a 1.5-million-ton increase to exports to 7.8 million for 2018/19 based on the recent pace of shipments. Beginning stocks are lowered for China due to a 1-million-ton decrease to imports to 85 million for 2018/19.

SUGAR: U.S. sugarbeet production for 2019/20 is projected at 33.916 million tons, up 1 percent from last month. Overall planting progress in the United States advanced beyond the pace indicated last month to move the yield forecast to 30.8 tons/acre, up from 30.5. Based on average levels of beet pile shrink and slicing recovery, beet sugar production from this crop is projected at 4.992 million short tons, raw value (STRV) with production occurring in August and September at 511,111. This results in fiscal 2018/19 beet sugar production at 4.920 million STRV, a gain of 9,509 STRV. This increase is largely offset by lower 2018/19 Florida cane sugar production reported by processors. High-tier tariff imports for 2018/19 are increased by 20,000 STRV to 90,000 based on the pace of entries to date. These supply changes result in ending stocks for 2018/19 residually increasing to 1.526 million STRV, implying a stocks-to-use ratio of 12.40 percent, up marginally over last month.

Beet sugar production for 2019/20 is projected at 5.154 million STRV based on the larger sugarbeet crop. This increase is partially offset by lower cane sugar production in Texas due to weather-related area reductions for the 2019/20 crop as reported by the processor. With no changes to imports or use, the combination of higher beginning stocks of 20,469 STRV and a net production increase of 23,457 STRV implies ending stocks of 1.528 million and a stocks-to-use ratio of 12.37 percent.

Mexico sugar production for 2018/19 is estimated at 6.400 million metric tons (MT) based on CONADESUCA-estimated area of 796,770 hectares (ha) and USDA estimates of yield at 71.08 MT/ha and sucrose recovery of 11.30 percent. Mexico sugar production for 2019/20 is projected at 6.183 million MT assuming the same area as in 2018/19 and 5-year averages of sugarcane yield and sucrose recovery. With no other changes, the changes to production result in exports to non-U.S. destinations of 1.386 million MT in 2018/19 and 263,100 MT in 2019/20, based on CONADESUCA targets for ending stocks.

LIVESTOCK, POULTRY, AND DAIRY: The forecast for 2019 red meat and poultry production is reduced from last month as lower forecast beef, pork, and turkey production more than offset higher broiler production. The decline in beef production largely reflects lower steer and heifer slaughter in the second half of the year. Forecast pork production is lowered from last month primarily as the pace of slaughter to date has been slower than expected. The broiler production forecast is raised on recent hatchery data and expected heavier bird weights. Turkey production is lowered slightly on production data to date.

The 2020 red meat and poultry production forecast is lowered from the previous month. Production growth for livestock and poultry is expected to be slower as producers respond to higher feed costs. The beef production forecast is reduced on lower expected steer and heifer slaughter as incentives to add weight on pasture slows the pace of feedlot placements.

The beef import forecast is raised for 2019 on recent trade data, but the export forecast is reduced from the previous month on the current pace of beef exports to a number of trading partners. No change is made to the 2020 beef trade forecasts. Pork export forecasts for 2019 and 2020 are raised from the previous month, largely reflecting the removal of Mexico’s tariffs on U.S. pork products in late May. The 2019 broiler export forecast is reduced slightly on recent trade data; no change is made to the 2020 broiler export forecast. The turkey export forecast is unchanged for 2019 and 2020.

For 2019, the cattle, hog, and broiler price forecasts are reduced from last month, reflecting current price weakness. The 2019 turkey price forecast is raised slightly on higher second-quarter prices. For 2020, cattle, broiler, and egg price forecasts are reduced on continued demand weakness. The 2020 hog price forecast remains unchanged as slower production growth and stronger exports support prices. The 2020 turkey price forecast is unchanged.

Milk production for 2019 is lowered from last month on slower-than-anticipated growth in milk per cow and lower expected cow numbers. The 2020 milk production forecast is reduced from last month as higher expected feed costs are expected to weaken producer margins, limiting growth in the dairy cow herd and milk per cow next year.

The 2019 and 2020 fat basis import forecasts are unchanged from the previous month. The 2019 fat basis export forecast is reduced from the previous month, as gains in cheese exports due to the elimination of tariffs by Mexico only partly offset weakness in butterfat exports to other markets. The 2020 fat basis export forecast is unchanged. The skim-solids basis import forecast for 2019 is raised from last month on increased imports of milk protein products while the 2020 skim-solids basis import forecast is unchanged. The skim-solids basis export forecast for 2019 is reduced on current weakness in exports of nonfat dry milk (NDM), while exports of lactose are expected to be constrained by the additional tariffs imposed by China. The 2020 skim-solids basis export forecast is lowered on continued weakness in sales of lactose.

The 2019 cheese and whey price forecasts are reduced from the previous month while NDM and butter price forecasts are raised. For 2020, cheese and butter price forecasts are raised from the previous month, while NDM is unchanged. The whey price forecast is fractionally lower for 2020. The 2019 Class III price is reduced on lower cheese and whey price forecasts and the Class IV price forecast is raised on higher forecast butter and NDM prices. Class III and Class IV prices are raised in 2020. The all milk price forecast is reduced to $18.00 per cwt for 2019 but is raised to $18.90 per cwt for 2020.

COTTON: The 2019/20 U.S. cotton supply and demand projections are unchanged from last month, with the exception of a 1-cent decline in the season-average upland farm price, to 64 cents per pound. The 2018/19 U.S. cotton balance sheet is unchanged."

Justice Dept.: Review of Russia Probe 'Broad in Scope',https://www.realclearpolitics.com,[],06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/06/11/justice_dept_review_of_russia_probe_broad_in_scope_140540.html,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A Justice Department review of the origins of the FBI’s Russia investigation is “broad in scope and multi-faceted,” and intelligence agencies have already been asked to preserve records and make witnesses available, according to a letter sent to Congress on Monday.

Attorney General William Barr said last month that he had directed John Durham, the United States attorney in Connecticut and a veteran prosecutor, to determine if law enforcement and intelligence authorities engaged in improper surveillance as they investigated potential coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign to sway the 2016 presidential election.

“It is now well-established that, in 2016, the U.S. government and others undertook certain intelligence-gathering and investigative steps directed at persons associated with the Trump campaign,” said the letter from Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd, the department’s top liaison to Congress.

“As the Attorney General has stated publicly at congressional hearings and elsewhere, there remain open questions relating to the origins of this counter-intelligence investigation and the U.S. and foreign intelligence activities that took place prior to and during that investigation,” the letter said.

The point of the review, Boyd added, “is to more fully understand the efficacy and propriety of those steps” and to answer open questions for the attorney general.

Barr has repeatedly said he believes there was “spying” on the Trump campaign, language President Donald Trump has seized on to support his claims that special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation was a “witch hunt.” Barr has said he doesn’t yet know if the “spying” was improper, but he has been unsatisfied with the answers he has received.

He has not elaborated on what specific surveillance he is troubled by. The FBI did obtain a secret warrant in 2016 from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to monitor the communications of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. That application was renewed several times.

Durham and his team will be working primarily out of Washington, with the Justice Department making existing office space available for the work, Boyd wrote to Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.

The team has already asked that certain intelligence agencies preserve records, make witnesses available and identify materials that may be relevant for the review.

Though the White House has granted Barr the authority to declassify documents, the Justice Department sought to assuage concerns that he would abuse that power, with Boyd saying the attorney general would prevent from disclosure information that could expose sources and methods or harm U.S. national security interests.

Mueller’s investigation identified questionable contacts between Trump associates and Russians but found insufficient evidence of a criminal conspiracy between the campaign and the Kremlin.

At around 1:25 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.145% while the yield on the 2-year note climbed to 1.926%. Bond yields move inversely to prices.

The recent uptick in yields comes after President Donald Trump said 5% levies all Mexican imports into the U.S. would be suspended indefinitely. He added he had ""full confidence"" in Mexico's ability to crack down on immigration from Central America.

Wall Street also got a lift from increasing expectations of lower rates from the Fed.

Though market participants grew concerned over a deteriorating economic outlook throughout the month of May amid renewed trade barbs between the U.S. and its economic partners, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin disputed that interpretation in an interview with CNBC on Monday.

Mnuchin said falling bond yields, rather than warning of a recession, should be viewed as a sign that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates over the coming months. Bond yields fell to 20-month lows last week after government data showed U.S. job creation slowed more than expected in May.

Investor expectations of a June rate cut from the Fed rose last week to 27.5%, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. The market gives a 79% chance of a Fed rate cut in July.

The Labor Department said in a report Tuesday that business prices inched higher in May, the latest data to suggest anemic inflation in the United States. The producer-price index, a gauge of prices businesses receive for their goods, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.1% in May from a month earlier.

Barring the volatile food and energy components, the so-called core PPI rose 0.2% as expected.

The Treasury Department auctioned $38 billion in 3-year notes at a high yield of 1.861%. The bid-to-cover ratio, an indicator of demand, was 2.62. Indirect bidders, which include major central banks, were awarded 56.6%. Direct bidders, which includes domestic money managers, bought 13.4%.

Affected beef products from Aurora Packing Co. were packaged back on April 19, and the federal agency’s Food Safety and Inspection Service is worried some are “in institutional facility freezers.” The two Michigan stores listed in the long list of affected retailers spread across 10 states include the Holiday Market in Royal Oak and Treasure Chest Foods in Lambertville.

The federal agency’s full list of retailers published to its website Monday, June 10 can be found by clicking here. Aurora Packing Co. is based in North Aurora, Illinois. All Kroger stores located in Ohio received recalled raw beef products in addition to Illinois’ 65 affected retail locations.

Products included in the recall bear the establishment number of “EST. 788” inside the mark of inspection. To check out he lengthy list of affected products, click here. For a look at the labels of recalled items, click here.

Those in possession of affected beef products listed in the recall are urged to throw it away or seek a refund at the point of purchase.

The issue was originally discovered during “traceback activities in response to random sample testing.” The recall is labeled as a Class I one with a high health risk, according to the USDA release. A Class I recall is a “situation where there is a reasonable probability that the use of the product will cause serious, adverse health consequences or death.”

There are no known reports of illnesses or incidents related to the recall, according to the news release from the USDA FSIS.

E. coli is a potentially deadly bacteria that can cause severe dehydration, bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain and vomiting. Symptoms typically last less than a week, but seniors and children younger than the age of 5 and the elderly are at risk of suffering kidney failure."
"EPA cuts 40 regulations, saves $3.6B, seeks balance on costs",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-11-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/epa-cuts-40-regulations-saves-3-6-billion-seeks-balance-on-costs,"Aiming to erase the “fuzzy math” past administrations used to hide the costs of politically favored policies, the Environmental Protection Agency is pulling back the curtain on costs and benefits, and planning to kill regulations that are out of whack.

“It hopefully will take away some of the fuzzy math that administrations have done in the past on justifying regulations,” said EPA Administrator Andrew R. Wheeler of his new policy.

And, he added, it will set a new bottom-line for all regulations in the rules heavy agency. “If the costs are too high we should change the regulatory approach. We shouldn’t be having regulations that cost more than the benefits they provide,” he said in an interview.

With the new rules will come unusual transparency and a pledge to make public the costs and benefits of regulations coming out of the environmental agency.

“It will provide more confidence in the regulatory process,” said Wheeler.

And, he added, “Hopefully there will be fewer people upset with EPA, upset with the federal government.”

The new effort in Wheeler’s policy memo, titled “Increasing Consistency and Transparency in Considering Benefits and Costs in the Rulemaking Process,” is aimed at opening the door to the secretive regulation process and ending suspicions that politics drives policy.

“I really do hope it depoliticizes it,” said Wheeler.

President Trump campaigned on a promise to cut two Obama-era regulations for every new one he proposes. The EPA has led that effort, cutting far more than 2-1 for a total savings to taxpayers of $3.6 billion, Wheeler said. Since Trump came into office, the EPA has cut 40 major regulations and plans to axe another 49, he said.

“We are definitely at the top” of regulation killers, he added.

The new memo to assistant administrators said that regulations on the Clean Air Act will come under scrutiny first.

While Wheeler’s actions may sound like common sense, many EPA laws only “contemplate the consideration of benefits and costs as part of the regulatory decision-making,” said his memo.

Now, he wrote, “the EPA should evaluate and consider both benefits and costs in decision-making.”"

Private attorney and GOP activist Brady Toensing is leaving Vermont to take a senior counsel position with the U.S. Department of Justice. He starts work for the Office of Legal Policy Monday.

Toensing, 51, announced his resignation as vice chair of the Vermont Republican Party on May 23. An activist lawyer, advocate for open government and head of President Donald Trump’s Vermont campaign committee in 2016, Toensing has long been a thorn in the side of moderate Republicans, iconoclastic lefty U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders and the Democratic establishment in Vermont.

“We are going to miss Vermont, but I am excited to be joining the Department of Justice in a dream job and under the leadership of Attorney General Bill Barr,” Toensing said in an email. “Our youngest is graduating from high school this week, so the timing is pretty good.”

Deb Billado, chair of the Vermont Republican Party, said his seat will remain vacant until the party reorganizes in November. “It’s certainly an opportunity that doesn’t come along every day for lawyer and I’m excited for him,” Billado said.

Toensing and Billado have been Trump stalwarts, pushing away moderate Republican Party members, including Gov. Phil Scott who has rebuffed many of the president’s policies.

Toensing’s connection to Trump runs deep. Last year the president considered retaining Toensing’s mother and stepfather, prominent conservative D.C. attorneys Victoria Toensing and Joseph diGenova, to be part of his team handling the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller.

Over the past five years, Toensing has fought with the state’s most prominent politicians in the press and the courts over the state’s gun laws, climate change initiatives, accusations of campaign finance abuse and the state’s refusal to produce public records. He also waded into public disputes with U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, Gov. Peter Shumlin, and former Vermont Attorney General William Sorrell, accusing them of misconduct.

TJ Donovan, who took Sorrell’s place when he was elected Vermont attorney general in 2016, says Toensing has been a worthy adversary. Donovan appointed him to the Vermont Campaign Finance Task Force in 2017.

VTDigger is underwritten by:

“I said to him I hope you’re not leaving Vermont for good, that we need lawyers like Brady in our state,” Donovan said in an interview Monday. “He can be a pain in the butt no doubt, but he holds government officials accountable — he was a worthy adversary, he was tough, he was dogged and he was fair.”

“Brady and I have been fighting for the past three years so my sense is our fights will continue,” Donovan said. “But I also think it’s useful, I will have somebody I can call and have a reasonable conversation with — I anticipate calling upon Brady as issues arise … I have respect for his legal acumen and his integrity.”

Others on the left of the political spectrum weren’t as generous in their appraisal of Toensing’s contributions to the legal and political landscape.

State Sen. Chris Pearson, P/D-Chittenden, who was the subject of one of Toensing’s several campaign finance complaints leveled at liberals, said “he really does epitomize the modern Republican ethic of winning at all costs.”

“I know how hard it is to recruit people to run for office and to serve and when they look at the kind of harassment that can entail at the hands of people like Brady Toensing that discourages more people from being engaged,” Pearson said. “At the same time he’s vigorously defended transparency and the public’s right to know, there’s a tension there I think.”

Most recently, Toensing served as local counsel in a case brought by the National Rifle Association against the state of Vermont over the constitutionality of a new magazine limit put in place last year as part of sweeping reforms to the state’s gun laws.

Toensing won a landmark First Amendment case in 2018. The Vermont Supreme Court ruling set a new precedent making the private emails of officials pertaining to government business subject to public records requests. In that lawsuit, the Charlotte attorney represented the interests of the Free Market Environmental Law Clinic and the Energy and Environment Legal Institute, conservative groups funded by the Koch brothers, that were seeking information about a group of state attorneys general offices — including Vermont’s — investigating Exxon Mobil’s alleged early knowledge and longtime denials of climate change.

Toensing is perhaps best known for his 2016 letter to the U.S. Department of Justice alleging that Sanders pressured People’s United Bank to issue a loan requested by his wife, Jane Sanders, the former president of Burlington College, for the purchase of the former Roman Catholic Diocese of Burlington headquarters on Lake Champlain. Last fall, the Vermont U.S. Attorney’s Office dropped an investigation into whether Jane Sanders overstated donor pledges used as collateral for the loan.

Toensing also went after then-Vermont Attorney General William Sorrell in 2015 for alleged campaign finance violations when he accepted $200,000 from a PAC set up by the Democratic Attorneys General Association in his 2012 primary against Donovan. Sorrell was accused of improperly coordinating with the PAC. A special investigator found in 2017 that DAGA — not Sorrell — ran afoul of Vermont campaign finance rules.

When former Gov. Peter Shumlin came under criticism for taking advantage of his neighbor Jeremy Dodge in East Montpelier, Toensing represented Dodge pro bono and helped him reclaim his land.

And then there were the campaign finance cases.

When Sanders promoted former staffer Pearson’s campaign for the state Senate in an email to supporters in 2016, Toensing cried foul. He alleged that the email was an in-kind contribution that generated an $80,000 windfall from 12,000 Sanders fans and therefore violated campaign finance laws.

In 2011, Toensing defended former Republican Lt. Gov. Brian Dubie when he was accused of misusing campaign finance laws by allegedly coordinated with the Republican Governors Association on a poll. In a settlement, Dubie paid $10,000 to the state and $10,000 to the Vermont Foodbank. The RGA settled for $30,000.

Toensing holds an undergraduate degree and obtained a juris doctorate from Georgetown University in 1996. He worked for U.S. Sen. Warren Rudman after law school and then went into private practice. Toensing has represented plaintiffs and defendants in gender discrimination cases, and CIA and FBI employees in internal hearings and investigations, according to a bio on his law firm’s website.

Since 2010, he has represented the former president of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International through multiple lawsuits involving allegations of international money laundering and bank fraud.

His mother, Victoria Toensing, and his stepfather, Joseph DiGenova, are prominent conservative Washington lawyers and fierce advocates for Trump. A recent Politico piece characterized the “husband and wife duo” as the staunchest defenders of the president on TV. Toensing and DiGenova were such a dominant media presence in the Lewinsky affair that Washington Post dubbed them the “Power Couple at the Scandal’s Vortex.”

"Acting DHS secretary praises White House deal with Mexico on immigration, defends Trump's tariff threat",https://www.foxnews.com,"[""Andrew O'Reilly""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/acting-dhs-secretary-praises-white-house-deal-with-mexico-on-immigration-defends-trumps-tariff-threat,"Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan on Sunday praised the recent deal reached by the United States and Mexico to handle the migration situation along the two countries’ shared border, while downplaying the criticism of President Trump for threatening to impose tariffs on the U.S.’ neighbor.

Speaking on “Fox News Sunday,” McAleenan said that while people can disagree with Trump’s tactics, the fact remains that Mexico approached the White House with “real proposals” on how to handle the immigration crisis. “Mexico came to the table with real proposals,” McAleenan said. “We have an agreement that, if they implement, will be effective.”

The agreement — announced late Friday in a tweet by Trump — ended a showdown that business leaders warned would have disastrous economic consequences for both the U.S. and one of its largest trading partners, driving up consumer prices and driving a wedge between the two allies. And it represented a win for members of Trump's own party who had flooded the White House with pleading calls as well as aides who had been eager to convince the president to back down.

PELOSI NEEDS TO ADDRESS 'INVASION' AT BORDER, CONGRESS' INACTION 'SHAMEFUL,' GOP REP SAYS

“I think, just in general, Republicans understand that tariffs are a tax on American consumers,” Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said during a separate interview on “Fox News Sunday.” “And we don't want to see them in place long-term, nor do I believe President Trump does either. He's using tariffs as leverage in trade negotiations and I think he used them as leverage in this situation brilliantly, quite honestly.”

A ""U.S.-Mexico Joint Declaration"" released by the State Department said the U.S. ""will immediately expand the implementation"" of a program that returns asylum-seekers who cross the southern border to Mexico while their claims are adjudicated. Mexico will ""offer jobs, health care and education"" to those people, the agreement stated.

Mexico has also agreed, it said, to take ""unprecedented steps to increase enforcement to curb irregular migration,"" including the deployment of the Mexican National Guard throughout the country, especially on its southern border with Guatemala. And Mexico is taking ""decisive action to dismantle human smuggling and trafficking organizations as well as their illicit financial and transportation networks,"" the State Department said.

Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador tweeted, ""Thanks to the support of all Mexicans, the imposition of tariffs on Mexican products exported to the USA has been avoided."" He called for a gathering to celebrate in Tijuana Saturday.

TRUMP DEFENDS DEAL WITH MEXICO TO STEM MIGRANT FLOWS, PREVENT TARIFFS

The changes, in part, continue steps the Trump administration was already taking. The U.S. announced in December that it would make some asylum seekers wait in Mexico while their cases were being proceeded — a begrudging agreement with Mexico that has taken months to scale and that has been plagued with glitches, including wrong court dates, travel problems and issues with lawyers reaching their clients.

Homeland Security officials have been ramping up slowly, and were already working to spread the program along the border before the latest blowup. About 10,000 people have been returned to Mexico to wait out the processing of their immigration cases since the program began Jan. 29.

More than 100,000 migrants are currently crossing the U.S. border each month, but not everyone claims asylum and migrants can wait an entire year before making a claim.

“We need to change the asylum standard, so that that front bar, where we assign credible fear, is not so automatic, so that 85-95 percent of people get that, while only 10 percent get asylum at the end of a court proceeding,” McAleenan said. “We need to align that more closely with what might actually be a successful claim.”

Trump had announced the tariff plan last week, declaring in a tweet that, on June 10, the U.S. would ""impose a 5 percent Tariff on all goods coming into our Country from Mexico, until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico, and into our Country, STOP."" U.S. officials had laid out steps Mexico could take to prevent the tariffs, but many had doubts that even those steps would be enough to satisfy Trump on illegal immigration, a signature issue of his presidency and one that he sees as crucial to his 2020 re-election campaign.

After returning from Europe Friday, though, Trump tweeted, ""I am pleased to inform you that The United States of America has reached a signed agreement with Mexico."" He wrote that the ""Tariffs scheduled to be implemented by the U.S. on Monday, against Mexico, are hereby indefinitely suspended.""

Trump said Mexico has agreed to work to ""stem the tide of Migration through Mexico, and to our Southern Border"" and said those steps would ""greatly reduce, or eliminate, Illegal Immigration coming from Mexico and into the United States.""

The 5 percent tax on all Mexican goods, which would increase every month up to 25 percent under Trump's plan, would have had enormous economic implications for both countries. Americans bought $378 billion worth of Mexican imports last year, led by cars and auto parts.

Many members of Trump's Republican Party and business allies had urged him to reconsider — or at least postpone actually implementing the tariffs as talks continue — citing the potential harm to American consumers and manufactures.

ATCHISON, Kan. - Most history classes teach Zachary Taylor was the 12th U.S. president and Harry Truman was the only president from Missouri.

But a pair of historical markers in Plattsburg, Missouri, and a museum in Atchison, Kansas, tell a different story.

People pass by the towering statue outside the Clinton County Courthouse every day. Few people recognize it as David Rice Atchison, and likely fewer understand the plaque below that declares him ""President of the United States for one day.""

""He was this vital important pre-Civil War person that pretty much vanished off the pages of history,"" said Chris Taylor, Atchison County Historical Society executive director.

But on March 4, 1849, Atchison was the nation`s highest ranking elected official sworn into office.

The nation's 11th president, James Polk's term had expired, and the President-elect, Zachary Taylor, refused to be inaugurated on a Sunday.

Atchison of Missouri had just been named president pro tempore of the U.S. Senate.

""In 1849, there was no pressing thing that would happen. Today, if we didn't have a president for 24 hours, the whole world would be in total chaos,"" Taylor said.

The Atchison County Historical Society Museu boasts ""The World's Smallest Presidential Library.""

In its Hall of Presidents, Atchison is placed between Polk and Taylor and proclaimed ""The Real 12th President."" It features an 1849 newspaper article from Washington D.C.'s National Intelligencer that explained how Atchison may have accidentally become president for a day.

The museum asks visitors to vote in an 1850s Kansas ballot box what they'd do if they were president for a day.

So how did Atchison spend it? After being up for hours signing final presidential orders that had to pass through the Senate from the previous term, he mostly slept.

""His friends started showing up to wake him up to be appointed as ministers to different countries or part of his 24-hour cabinet, so people realized this odd thing was happening,"" Taylor said.

Atchison never gained the official title of vice president either, but would serve in the de-facto capacity under two presidents because of deaths in office. He'd retire from politics shortly after Atchison, Kansas, was named for him, on the losing side of the debate whether Kansas should be admitted as a slave or free state.

A marker next to his Plattsburg, Missouri, grave declares him ""President for a Day."" Memoirs say he'd often boast after his odd attachment to history that he had ""the honestest administration in the U.S.""

Since 1849, whenever Inauguration Day has fallen on a Sunday, the president has been sworn in privately, and then had a formal public ceremony the following day."

Brady Toensing

Vermont Republican Party vice chair Brady Toensing is leaving the state — and party leadership — for a job with the U.S. Department of Justice. He’ll be a senior counsel for its Office of Legal Policy.Toensing had already split his time between Vermont and Washington, D.C., where he works at a law firm owned by his mother, Victoria Toensing, and step-father, Joseph diGenova. Toensing is leaving the firm and giving up his Vermont residency to live full-time in D.C.The 51-year-old attorney declined to share additional details about his new job because the Department of Justice has strict policies governing who can publicly speak about its operations. According to the mission statement of the Office of Legal Policy, it is responsible for implementing criminal justice policies and advising the attorney general on policy matters. Toensing's departure was first reported by VTDigger.Toensing has been vice chair of the VTGOP since November 2013 and has used his legal expertise to be a thorn in the side of Democrats and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).In early 2016, Toensing filed a complaint with the Department of Justice seeking an investigation into Jane O’Meara Sanders, the senator’s wife, over her work while president of now-defunct Burlington College. Toensing asked officials to investigate whether she’d committed bank fraud by overstating the college’s pledged donations in a loan application.The feds launched an investigation, and it was not until late 2018 that Jeff Weaver, speaking for the Sanders family, announced that the feds had decided not to bring charges. Weaver said Toensing’s request for an investigation had been part of a ""multiyear political smear campaign against Jane Sanders.""Toensing has used public records requests repeatedly to embarrass political adversaries. He revealed a state trooper had voided a speeding ticket for former Gov. Peter Shumlin. In 2013, he represented Shumlin’s neighbor Jeremy Dodge, who claimed Shumlin had ripped him off on a land deal.Toensing said in an interview Tuesday that Vermont Republicans need to get back to basics in order to win elections and put the state on more solid financial footing.The party should “go to the get-out-the-vote type projects,” Toensing said. “Real fundamentals. Kind of like the movie, we have to go back to our fundamentals and our roots.”He said the Vermont Democratic Party has been very effective in getting voters to turn out, but he pointed out that elected Democrats have fallen short of their goals due to internal fractures “You can see what happened with this last session,"" he said. Democrats ultimately failed to pass legislation on two key party priorities: paid family leave and increasing the minimum wage.Toensing, the Vermont chair of Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign for president, has been accused of causing a rift the Vermont GOP between Trump-aligned conservatives like himself and GOP chair Deb Billado and more moderate Republicans such as Gov. Phil Scott.Billado did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday morning.Toensing said the claims of division are overblown.“A lot’s made about these claims of rifts within the party,"" he said, ""but there really is not a big rift within the party policy-wise.”"
Treasury yields rise after Trump suspends tariffs on Mexico,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/10/us-treasury-yields-tick-higher-as-trump-suspends-tariffs-on-mexico.html,"At around 4:04 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note , which moves inversely to price, was higher at around 2.143%, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was also higher at around 2.621%.

U.S. government debt yields rose Monday after President Donald Trump said U.S. tariffs on goods from Mexico would be suspended.

U.S. President Donald Trump announced Sunday that proposed tariffs on Mexican imports would be suspended indefinitely. Trump said in a Twitter post Sunday that he has ""full confidence"" that Mexico will crack down on migration from Central America, after the two neighbors reached a consensus. The New York Times reported Saturday that the deal to avert tariffs largely comprised actions Mexico had already agreed to take.

Meanwhile, investors will be watching trade developments between the U.S. and China ahead of a key meeting between the leaders of the two countries. Speaking to CNBC on Sunday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said President Trump will decide about further Chinese tariffs after he meets his Chinese counterpart later this month."
