Trump: US warship destroyed Iranian drone in Strait of Hormuz,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Frank Miles', 'Frank Miles Is A Reporter', 'Editor Covering Geopolitics', 'Military', 'Crime', 'Technology', 'Sports For Foxnews.Com. His Email Is Frank.Miles Foxnews.Com.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/trump-us-warship-iranian-drone-strait-hormuz,"A U.S. warship destroyed an Iranian drone in the Strait of Hormuz amid heightened tensions between the two countries, President Trump announced Thursday.

“The U.S. reserves the right to defend personnel, facilities, interests,” he said.

Trump said the USS Boxer took defensive action after the drone closed to within 1,000 yards of the warship and ignored multiple calls to stand down. The president called it the latest “hostile” action by Iran.

Marines on board took down the drone using electronic jamming equipment, U.S. officials told Fox News later Thursday.

The device, known as the Light Marine Air Defense Integrated System, deployed for the first time in January aboard the USS Kearsarge, the same class of warship as the USS Boxer.

Trump also called on other countries to condemn what he described as Iran’s attempts to disrupt the freedom of navigation and global commerce in the strategic waterway in the Persian Gulf region.

IRAN FOREIGN MINISTER SAYS COUNTRY 'HAD NO CHOICE' BUT TO BUILD MISSILES FOR DEFENSE

Chief Pentagon Spokesperson Jonathan Hoffman confirmed to Fox News in a statement: ""At approximately 10 a.m. local time, the amphibious ship USS Boxer was in international waters conducting a planned inbound transit of the Strait of Hormuz. A fixed wing unmanned aerial system (UAS) approached Boxer and closed within a threatening range. The ship took defensive action against the UAS to ensure the safety of the ship and its crew.""

The president said the drone threatened the safety of the American ship and its crew.

Meantime, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said Thursday he had ""no information about having lost a drone today.""

The latest actions came amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and Iran in the wake of the breakdown of the nuclear deal, as the secretive regime announced it exceeded the threshold of low-enriched uranium stockpile as agreed upon in the 2015 accord.

Iran’s state television said earlier Thursday that regime forces captured a foreign tanker with a crew of 12 accused of smuggling oil.

The tanker was seized by Revolutionary Guard forces on July 14 after getting intercepted south of Iran’s Larak Island in the strategic Strait of Hormuz amid allegations that the tanker was smuggling fuel from Iranian smugglers to foreign customers.

Iran recently shot down a U.S. drone that it said was flying over Iran. Trump called off a planned retaliatory airstrike at the last minute.

Trump Disavows ‘Send Her Back’ Chant as G.O.P. Frets Over Ugly Phrase,https://www.nytimes.com,['Julie Hirschfeld Davis'],07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/18/us/politics/ilhan-omar-donald-trump.html,"Mr. Trump’s effort to dissociate himself from his own supporters reflected the misgivings of his allies, who have flooded the upper echelons of his team with expressions of concern in the wake of a rally that veered into ugly nativist territory. They warned privately that the president was on dangerous ground, according to people briefed on the conversations.

Among them were House Republican leaders, who pleaded with Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday morning to separate the party from the message embraced by the crowd in Greenville, N.C.

“That does not need to be our campaign call, like we did the ‘lock her up’ last time,” said Representative Mark Walker, Republican of North Carolina, a top official in the party’s messaging arm, who attended the rally and tweeted hours later that he had “struggled” with the chant. “We cannot be defined by this.”

Still, while they denounced the chant, Republican leaders declined to criticize Mr. Trump.

Congressional Republicans have struggled all week to respond to Mr. Trump’s attacks on Ms. Omar, one of the first two Muslim women elected to the House, and three other Democratic congresswomen of color who he tweeted over the weekend should “go back” to their countries. Now they must contend with the nativist fervor of his supporters as captured in the frenzied moment in North Carolina, with a rageful refrain that they worry could further damage their party’s brand.

“Those chants have no place in our party or our country,” Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican leader, told reporters."

Did his blowing past the boundaries of acceptable discourse render him unelectable? That his base showed up in force last night, parroting his attacks on the congresswomen, once again showed that, for these voters, the answer is no. (Whether the suburban white women and independent voters who were part of his 2016 coalition feel the same is far from certain.)

Talking with the rallygoers, I couldn’t find one who faulted Trump for demonizing the freshman representatives, all four of whom are American citizens, calling on them to leave the United States and return to the “totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.” A few conceded that Trump occasionally fires off an inappropriate tweet, but said his accomplishments in office overshadow any offense. If anything, they said, his language springs from an authenticity they find refreshing. None of the people I spoke with considered his comments about the congresswomen racist.

“He’s not always the best at how he handles his emotions,” said Christian Carraway, 32, of Greenville, sitting on a folding chair outside the arena and waiting for Trump to appear. “He’s a very emotional guy. Passionate. But I like his policies and I think he has good intentions.”

All seemed to accept Trump’s slight reformulation of his original tweets. Trump’s initial messages had a hard edge: “These places need your help badly, you can’t leave fast enough.” Amid an uproar over his comments, Trump reworked the argument a bit: He now says that if the congresswomen want to leave, they’re welcome to do so, but they’re also free to stay.

It doesn’t appear that Trump’s supporters inside the arena, with their “Send her back!” chants, believed his message needed any softening. One thing was certain: When Trump stepped behind the podium, he looked out at an audience that was fertile ground for continued attacks on the four representatives—a crowd that believed the congresswomen may have deserved what they got.

Here, a few snapshots.

“Everything he says is how I feel,” Stacy said. “I feel like, ‘Hey, man. You hate the country, you don’t like it, you trash the country—get out of the country! Move on!’”

On the House resolution that labeled Trump’s attacks on the congresswomen racist: “I don’t think they were racist at all. I know this president. I’ve been to his inauguration, been to his other rallies. Everything he says I agree with,” she said. “He’s speaking for me. He may be a little rough around the edges, but he’s not a politician. I’m a little rough around the edges in this interview, but I love this country.”"
Many USDA workers to quit as research agencies move to Kansas City: ‘The brain drain we all feared’,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Ben Guarino', 'Reporter Covering The Practice', 'Culture Of Science', 'July At Am', 'Ben Guarino Is A Reporter For The Washington Post S Science Section. He Joined The Post In']",07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2019/07/18/many-usda-workers-quit-research-agencies-move-kansas-city-brain-drain-we-all-feared/,"

Two research agencies at the Agriculture Department will uproot from Washington, D.C., to Kansas City in the fall. But many staffers have decided to give up their jobs rather than move, prompting concerns of hollowed-out offices unable to adequately fund or inform agricultural science.

About two-thirds of the USDA employees declined their reassignments, according to a tally the department released Tuesday. Ninety-nine of 171 employees at the Economic Research Service, an influential federal statistical agency, will not move. At the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which manages a $1.7 billion portfolio in scientific funding, 151 of 224 employees declined to relocate.

Jack Payne, University of Florida’s vice president for agriculture and natural resources, warned that the hemorrhage of employees will devastate ERS and NIFA. “This is the brain drain we all feared, possibly a destruction of the agencies,” Payne said.

Workers who agreed to move must do so by Sept. 30, although USDA has not established permanent office space and has not said whether the agencies will be located on the Missouri or Kansas side of the Kansas City area. Workers who were asked to move but declined “will be separated by adverse action procedures,” per letters the employees received in June.

The department expects relocation numbers may “fluctuate” until the Sept. 30 cutoff, according to a statement provided by USDA. “These anticipated ranges were taken into account in the department’s long-term strategy, which includes both efforts to ensure separating employees have the resources they need as well as efforts to implement an aggressive hiring strategy to maintain the continuity of ERS and NIFA’s work.”

Tim Cowden, president of the Kansas City Area Development Council, which advocated for the relocation to Kansas City, said in a statement that “just over 36 percent of those given the option to relocate have accepted, which is very strong for any HQ relocation. We remain committed to working with all USDA employees interested in relocating to KC.”

Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II (D-Mo.), along with Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.) and Rep. Sam Graves (R-Mo.), was an early supporter of the move to Kansas City. Cleaver said in a statement he empathized “with not wanting to uproot your family.” But if the move “has to happen,” he said, “then Kansas City is the best place in America for these agencies’ new home,” because it can “fill the void with competent and qualified individuals.”

Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) told The Washington Post, “This kind of staff loss will completely gut the ERA and NIFA, and will ultimately prevent the USDA from conducting critical research that helps grow the food our families eat.”

Sonny Ramaswamy, the NIFA director from 2012 to 2018, said he was aware of $50 million in grants, slated to be distributed over the next three months, for research areas identified as priorities in the 2018 farm bill. Those grants would have funded studies into subjects as diverse as disease-resistant cotton in Mississippi and hail-damaged corn in Nebraska.

Now, that science is “not going to happen,” Ramaswamy said, because the planned move has disrupted the agency. A senior NIFA scientist familiar with the grants, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid professional retaliation, confirmed that these grants are on hold and in danger of never being distributed.

NIFA, when fully staffed, employs about 400 people. As it becomes more diminished, the agency’s ability to review grant proposals, manage awards or hold grant recipients accountable is threatened, Ramaswamy said. He predicted tens of millions of dollars in grant funding will be in jeopardy. Most money earmarked for NIFA grants, if unspent, returns to the Treasury Department.

Katherine Smith Evans, the ERS administrator from 2007 to 2011, reviewed a list of employees who are leaving. Four of five economists working on bees and pollination at ERS have left or will leave, she said. Ten of 12 economists working on trade and international development have retired, already left or plan to do so. None of the farm finance and tax experts will remain with the agency. “I agree with people who say it will take 10 years to recover,” Smith Evans said.

Gale Buchanan, the USDA chief scientist and undersecretary for research, education and economics in the George W. Bush administration, said employees face “an almost impossible task” by trying to do their jobs with reduced numbers.

The decision process, he said, has been flawed. “I could live by whatever blue-ribbon committee recommended to do to address some of the concerns the secretary had,” Buchanan said. But, he added, “you don’t just pull an idea out of the air and, for some political reason, make a decision.”

The agencies were understaffed even before Tuesday’s tally of those who will not relocate. Employees at the agencies quit in large numbers before the department issued reassignment letters. In early June, vacancy rates at the agencies were about 20 to 25 percent.

“Both agencies already have experienced significant losses of skilled personnel, beginning back when the proposed move was announced,” Payne said. “The percentage of employees moving is even smaller when the denominator is the full staff level.” During fiscal year 2018, ERS had 320 employees. Unless a wave of new hires fills the deserted desks, by this fall, ERS will be half the size it was two years ago.

When Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced the relocation in August, he said it would “provide more streamlined and efficient services.” A cost-benefit analysis released by the department in June suggests moving to Kansas City will save as much as $300 million over 15 years.

An organization of economists, the Agricultural and Applied Economics Association, disputed the projected savings; the move may cost taxpayers money, the group said, because the analysis overestimated the expense of retaining the agencies in the capital and did not calculate the value of lost research.

"After census debacle, White House to knock out senior Commerce official",https://www.politico.com,"['Nancy Cook', 'Margaret Harding Mcgill']",07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/18/white-house-earl-comstock-out-1600269,"Commerce policy director Earl Comstock clashed with Trump administration officials on a number of policy issues. | Andrew Harnik/AP Photo White House After census debacle, White House to knock out senior Commerce official Senior Trump aides have sparred with the policy director for Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross over the census, 5G and other issues.

The White House is pushing a top aide to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross out of the Trump administration, the first round of house-cleaning after the 2020 census debacle and clashes over tech policy.

In recent months, Commerce policy director Earl Comstock has angered Trump’s acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, White House lawyers, members of the National Security Council and officials at the National Economic Council, according to five current and former administration officials. The irritation extends to the highest staff level of the White House, several officials stressed, citing both Comstock’s handling of the 2020 U.S. census’s citizenship question and the internal debate over spectrum policy as key areas of disagreement.

Story Continued Below

One former administration official said he could not think of anyone who “had pissed off as many senior White House officials” as Comstock, who critics allege often tried to exceed his own authority as a top Commerce policy staffer. Comstock also clashed with officials across federal agencies, according to one administration official.

While officials said the process of forcing out Comstock through a firing or resignation is underway, the date of his actual departure remains unclear. He was at the agency until the end of the day on Wednesday.

The White House referred questions about Comstock to the Commerce Department. A Commerce spokesperson said “there is no truth to these rumors. Earl Comstock is an instrumental and valuable member of the Commerce team. He has a keen understanding of the functions of the federal government and has spearheaded multiple departmental initiatives as the deputy chief of staff for policy. Earl will continue to work tirelessly on behalf of the Secretary, the Department of Commerce and the American people.”

As Mulvaney has sought to exert greater control over federal agencies, Comstock’s performance has come under far greater scrutiny — similar to how the White House also has paid close to attention recently to top officials at the departments of Labor and Health and Human Services.

Comstock’s role in failing to put the citizenship question on the U.S. census was just the latest high-profile blow for him, since it’s an issue the president cares about deeply — adding to widespread views inside the White House that Commerce is not effectively executing the president’s agenda.

Administration officials said Comstock’s eventual departure is not necessarily a foreshadowing of Ross’s own tenure in the Cabinet — though the president has been frustrated over the past year with his Commerce secretary’s negotiating prowess in trade talks and the census question.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201907/1311/1155968404_6058082603001_6058083404001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

And Commerce officials don’t see Ross, an 81-year-old investor and longtime friend of the president, leaving imminently despite months of speculation and ongoing sparring with lawmakers. “He likes doing the job,” said a personal familiar with Ross.

Comstock, who acted as Ross’s sherpa during the confirmation process, clashed with other Trump administration officials on a number of policy issues, including spectrum and net neutrality.

A feud among Trump's advisers over 5G wireless — a technology crucial to U.S. competition with China over the future of the internet — spilled into public view in March, when Commerce raised concerns that FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's effort to free up more 5G airwaves for the wireless sector would interfere with the government's use of nearby airwaves for weather forecasting. The White House ultimately sided with the FCC in that debate.

But that did not end the internal infighting. Pai accused the department of “blocking our efforts at every single turn” during a Senate oversight hearing in June. He said the relationship between his agency and Commerce has deteriorated since David Redl abruptly resigned his post as head of Commerce’s NTIA in May.

Commerce’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, with support from NASA, has raised concerns that using 24 GHz airwaves for 5G services could degrade weather forecasting systems’ ability to make predictions. The FCC concluded its auction of the airwaves in May.

Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) in June warned Ross that a senior adviser “may be placing personal animosity ahead of our country's 5G goals.” Ross responded by saying officials had reached a “workable compromise” — an assertion the FCC denied. The issue also arose in a House hearing Tuesday on spectrum policy.

Comstock has not been in lock-step with the FCC in other policy areas. Early in his tenure at Commerce, he quietly opposed the FCC’s repeal of Obama-era net neutrality regulations by backing a congressional effort to restore the rules. The one-time Republican Senate staffer believes telecom companies like AT&T and Verizon need firm oversight, and had previously challenged the Obama-era rules in court because he did not believe they went far enough in reining in broadband providers.

Homeland Security has gutted programs aimed at stopping WMD terrorism,https://www.latimes.com,"['Staff Writer', 'David Willman Is A Reporter For The Los Angeles Times Based In Washington']",07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2019-07-17/times-investigation-homeland-security-gutted-programs-aimed-at-stopping-wmd-terrorism,"The Trump administration has quietly dismantled or cut back multiple programs that were created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to help detect and prevent terrorism involving weapons of mass destruction, a Times investigation has found.

The retreat has taken place over the last two years at the Department of Homeland Security, which has primary domestic responsibility for helping authorities identify and block potential chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats.

The changes, not previously reported, were made without rigorous review of potential security vulnerabilities, The Times found, undermining government-wide efforts aimed at countering terrorist attacks involving unconventional weapons, known as WMD.

More than 30 current and former Homeland Security employees and contractors voiced concern that the changes — including the cancellation of dozens of training exercises and the departure of scores of scientists and policy experts — have put Americans at greater risk.

“What we had done in the past was analytically based: Where are the threats? Where can we get the most return on the taxpayers’ investment for security?” said Paul Ryan, who until mid-2017 helped lead Homeland Security’s Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, which was merged with another office last year.

“We’re not as secure as we were 18 months ago,” said Ryan, a retired Navy rear admiral.

The cutbacks and shifts have been directed by James F. McDonnell, who has been appointed by President Trump to successive posts at Homeland Security, a long-troubled department that has seen waves of leadership changes and policy upheaval since 2017.

McDonnell declined through a Homeland Security spokeswoman to be interviewed for this report, and the department did not answer written questions submitted on June 27.

On July 15, the spokeswoman, Ruth Clemens, emailed a three-sentence statement, saying that the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office, which McDonnell heads, “is focused on preventing WMD terrorism by working with federal, state, and local partners across the nation.”

It also said, “some programs were realigned or restructured to better address threats, remove bureaucratic redundancy, and fully align with [Trump’s] National Security Strategy.”

Trump pledged in that 2017 document to “augment measures to secure, eliminate, and prevent the spread of WMD and related materials … to reduce the chance that they might fall into the hands of hostile actors.”

Among the programs gutted since 2017, however, was an elite Homeland Security “red team,” whose specialists conducted dozens of drills and assessments around the country each year to help federal, state and local officials detect such potential threats as an improvised nuclear device concealed in a suitcase, or a cargo ship carrying a radiation-spewing “dirty bomb.”

Another Homeland Security unit, the Operations Support Directorate, had helped lead up to 20 WMD-related training exercises each year with state and local authorities. The directorate participated in less than 10 such exercises last year and even fewer so far this year, according to internal Homeland Security documents.

Experts at Homeland Security’s National Technical Nuclear Forensics Center had worked with counterparts throughout the federal government to strengthen detection and tracing capabilities that might deter a hostile foreign state from slipping radiological or nuclear material to terrorists.

The center has been reduced to a shell: Its leadership is out and its staff has shrunk to three positions from about 14.

A separate Homeland Security component, the International Cooperation Division, which worked closely with foreign counterparts and the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency to track and stop the smuggling of dangerous nuclear materials overseas, has been disbanded.

Also cut back was the use of specialized, mobile detection units to help protect large public events from nuclear and radiological threats. The deployments have helped train local and state responders for a potential emergency.

For the first time in years, Homeland Security did not send a unit to protect the NCAA Final Four college basketball championship in April in Minneapolis or to an annual hot air balloon festival last fall in Albuquerque.

Homeland Security also has halted work to update a formal “strategic, integrated” assessment of chemical, biological and nuclear-related risks.

The assessment had previously analyzed millions of potential WMD threat scenarios. Under a directive President George W. Bush signed in 2007, the assessment is supposed to be updated at least every other year to provide objective guidance for the government’s purchases of detection-related technologies and medications for use following an attack.

“These risk assessments are how we stay ahead of the game,” said a former Homeland Security official, one of many who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of losing a security clearance or other retaliation. “If we don’t keep updating those assessments, then we essentially lose the little bit of focus that we have on the problem and we really risk a strategic surprise.”

The risk assessments provide “an understanding of where to make investments that are targeted to reduce the risk of terrorism,” a current Homeland Security official added. If effective detection technologies are not put in place and if the right medications are not procured for the nation’s emergency stockpile, “that’s putting people at risk,” the official said.

Overall, more than 100 scientists and policy experts specializing in radiological and nuclear threats have been reassigned or left to take jobs unrelated to their expertise, The Times found, undermining the department’s ability to protect the nation from devastating attacks.

Similar turmoil has unfolded among those who had specialized in countering such biological threats as airborne spores of anthrax.

In the worst biological attack in U.S. history, letters laced with powdered anthrax spores were sent through the U.S. mail soon after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Five Americans were killed and 17 others were infected. In July 2008, an Army scientist, Bruce E. Ivins, killed himself after he learned he was about to be indicted for the anthrax deaths.

Current and former Homeland Security officials warned in interviews that cutting back training around the country could erode readiness among those who would first confront a WMD terrorism attack.

“You keep the country safe by empowering state and local first responders who are out and about 24/7, 365 [days a year],” said one former Homeland Security official.

“The real thing could happen tomorrow with no warning,” another former official said. “And the only practice our defenders are going to have is through these ‘red team’ studies and actual exercises. That activity is necessary to ensure even basic competence.”

The changes have undermined the U.S. government’s multi-agency commitment since 2006 to build and maintain a “global nuclear detection architecture,” according to the present and former officials.

The goal, specified in legislation, was a layered network — from locations overseas to inside U.S. cities — to detect and assist the seizure of radiological or nuclear materials that could be wielded by terrorists.

McDonnell has become a formidable figure at the Department of Homeland Security since Trump named him director of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office in early 2017. In May 2018, the president promoted him to be an assistant secretary of Homeland Security, heading the new Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office.

Trump signed the legislation that formally merged the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, which was responsible for reducing the risk of radiological and nuclear terrorism, with the Office of Health Affairs, which had run BioWatch, the nation’s system for detecting potential airborne biological terrorism threats.

McDonnell has used broad discretion over the last two years to shift priorities and policies regarding WMD terrorism. Some of the changes are at odds with priorities authorized by formal presidential directives and by legislation enacted into law, The Times found.

The National Technical Nuclear Forensics Center, for example, was established in 2006 under Bush, and affirmed by legislation signed by President Obama in 2010, to help counter smuggling of nuclear materials that could be used in an attack. It has now been effectively gutted.

Separately, the presidential directive that Bush signed in 2007 required Homeland Security to update the integrated assessment of chemical, biological and nuclear-related risks “not less frequently than every two years.” The directive remains in force, along with two related mandates, but the update is incomplete and is more than two years overdue, The Times found.

Michael Grossman, who collaborated with Homeland Security specialists during his six years as chief of the Los Angeles County sheriff’s anti-terrorism section, said any slippage in attention to the WMD threat concerns him, in part because regaining readiness would take time.

“If you stay ready, you don’t have to get ready,” he said.

Current and former Homeland Security officials said they have struggled to grasp McDonnell’s rationale for cutting back training and other efforts intended to improve readiness, detection and tracing. They cited instances when specialists were removed from their areas of expertise in apparent retaliation for raising concerns about his policies.

Although the mobile detection units were deployed 70 or more times a year in response to requests from state and local officials, for example, McDonnell told subordinates he wants them used chiefly to support other Homeland Security operations and agencies, such as U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Coast Guard.

Those agencies already have nuclear-detection equipment and procedures in place, according to congressional testimony and the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress.

In 2016, Customs and Border Protection deployed specialized equipment to scan almost 100% of the cargo bound for and arriving at U.S. ports of entry, for example. It uses 1,400 giant radiation portal monitors to scan vehicles and cargo at land-border crossings, seaports, airports and mail facilities, the GAO reported that October.

Trump has repeatedly vowed to prevent terrorists from gaining access to unconventional weapons. In December, he said the “efforts will require close collaboration with and support to” the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.’s nuclear watchdog agency, based in Vienna.

But McDonnell has disbanded the International Cooperation Division, which worked closely with the IAEA to help ensure dangerous nuclear material is seized overseas before it could be smuggled into the United States.

An IAEA official said “numerous” collaborations with Homeland Security over the years had bolstered nuclear security worldwide but that the joint efforts had come to a near-standstill.

“We hope that they would join in again,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly.

The Homeland Security division had participated in exercises with other IAEA member nations and helped generate “guidelines and best practices” that were adopted by 42 nations, according to one of McDonnell’s predecessors.

“This strategic partnership will continue to serve as a force multiplier for nuclear security efforts for years to come,” Huban A. Gowadia, then director of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, told the House Homeland Security Committee in February 2015.

To aid the collaborations, Homeland Security embedded a specialist at IAEA headquarters for several years. McDonnell eliminated the position.

Asked about the now-canceled position, an IAEA spokesman said in an email that the specialist had assisted member states “in strengthening their efforts to detect nuclear and radioactive material.”

Officials participating in a program known as Securing the Cities, which was intended as Homeland Security’s last layer of defense against radiological or nuclear terrorism, also have raised concerns.

Securing the Cities was supposed to fortify defenses in five major urban areas — greater Washington, D.C.; Los Angeles and Long Beach; New York City and nearby Newark, N.J.; Chicago; and Houston.

Overall, Homeland Security has provided the cities with training assistance and direct financial grants totaling about $145 million for detection equipment from 2007 to mid-2018. (The Los Angeles-Long Beach area was made part of Securing the Cities in 2012.)

But a GAO report dated May 13 described “confusion and uncertainty” among city officials participating in the program. According to the report, the chaotic circumstances have arisen, in part, because McDonnell has said he wants Homeland Security to reduce its participation and let other federal agencies play a larger role.

The GAO report said, however, that the agencies McDonnell had cited — the FBI and the National Nuclear Security Administration, part of the Energy Department — didn’t intend to do so.

Homeland Security officials told the GAO “that they have not conducted any studies or analyses that would justify making changes to the program,” the report states.

“We asked, `Why are you making changes and what are these changes going to look like?’” David Trimble, the supervising analyst for the report, recalled in an interview. “The details were very light. [Homeland Security] couldn’t really provide us a road map of where they were going. We found no analysis behind it.”

McDonnell’s overall objectives are unclear.

According to congressional budget experts, $162.2 million — about 40% of the money Congress appropriated last year for his office — went unspent. The unspent funds reflect indecision surrounding the shifted priorities and staff departures, current and former Homeland Security officials said.

On Dec. 18, dissatisfaction at the changes erupted at an “all-hands” staff meeting convened by McDonnell and attended by Kirstjen Nielsen, then-Homeland Security secretary, along with scores of subordinates from the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office.

A supervisor, responsible for ensuring that operational expenditures are based on validated needs, stood and voiced concerns about McDonnell’s leadership and asked Nielsen to intervene, according to people who were in the room.

McDonnell sat silently and did not respond.

Soon after, Nielsen’s office instructed a personnel official, Sharon M. Wong, to conduct a “workplace climate assessment” to elicit opinions from current and recent staff members. Many of those who spoke with The Times said they also shared their misgivings with Wong.

One official said he had raised concerns about McDonnell’s efforts to install BioDetection 21, a controversial nationwide system intended to replace BioWatch for detecting airborne infectious agents such as anthrax. The replacement technology McDonnell is backing failed repeatedly in field testing sponsored by Homeland Security scientific staff.

The Times disclosed the test results and McDonnell’s support for BioDetection 21 in February, prompting a House Energy and Commerce Committee investigation that is ongoing.

In early May, after Nielsen resigned, Wong submitted her results to the office of the acting Homeland Security secretary, Kevin McAleenan, according to people familiar with the matter. The results have not been released publicly.

Although morale at Homeland Security has long ranked lowest of all federal departments, the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office had routinely scored much higher, according to surveys conducted by the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service.

In 2014, the office ranked 11th among similar “subcomponent” offices. Last year, it ranked 415th — last among its peers."
US Treasury Secretary Says Cash Is Not Laundered As Much As Bitcoin Is,https://cointelegraph.com,"['Helen Partz', 'Jose Rafael Ruiz Estanga', 'Gary Cros', 'Duane Wood', 'Justin Connelly', 'Bitcoins', ""Alex 'Alcyone' Newman"", 'Online Date']",07-18-2019,2019,7,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-treasury-secretary-says-cash-is-not-laundered-as-much-as-bitcoin-is,"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that the authority will be preventing Bitcoin (BTC) from becoming an “equivalent of Swiss-numbered bank accounts.”

U.S. secretary of the treasury to closely monitor Bitcoin regardless of price

In a press briefing reported by CNBC on July 18, Mnuchin criticized Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as they can be used for illicit purposes such as money laundering, adding that the department intends to enforce strong regulations on the space.

The official emphasized his own intent to closely monitor Bitcoin to prevent illegal activity regardless of its price, claiming that there are billions of dollars in Bitcoin and other crypto for nefarious activities.

Mnuchin believes that cash is not laundered like Bitcoin is

As Mnuchin clearly said that Bitcoin’s vulnerability to money laundering is the main reason for the Treasury to regulate it tightly, CNBC’s host Joe Kernen questioned his point in an interview on “Squawk Box” on July 18.

Kernen argued that Bitcoin and other existing currencies’ capabilities to be used for nefarious activities cannot be a reason for banning them, noting that “cash is laundered all the time.” Mnuchin did not back off from his position, replying that such a statement is not accurate.

The Secretary elaborated that the U.S. has the strongest anti-money laundering (AML) system in the world, adding that the government combats “bad actors in the U.S. dollar every day to protect the U.S. financial system.”

Following the interview, Kernen expressed sarcasm about Mnuchin’s idea that cash has not been laundered all the time, but the authorities are combating illicit activities in its system. He tweeted:

“‘the existing system has never been used for illicit activities but we're going to make sure crypto is isn't used for illicit activities like the current system.’ Got it.”

On July 15, Mnuchin expressed concern over Facebook’s proposed cryptocurrency and its potential illicit use, noting that he is not comfortable with Libra cryptocurrency, which can be used for tax evasion, extortion, illicit drugs and human trafficking, among others."
Feds Say Former VA Employee Used Vets’ Ailing Kids to Scam Millions,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Lachlan Markay', 'Seamus Hughes']",07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.thedailybeast.com/feds-say-former-va-employee-used-vets-ailing-kids-to-scam-millions,"A Department of Veterans Affairs employee used a network of shell companies to steal millions of dollars from a VA program to provide health services to children of veterans who are suffering from a debilitating spinal condition, federal prosecutors say.

The Justice Department lodged 23 federal criminal charges late last year against Joseph Prince, a former Veterans Affairs employee who prosecutors say used his position to steer almost $20 million in taxpayer money to companies run by family members and associates. Those companies then provided huge kickbacks to Prince, his wife, and other family members, the government alleges.

The previously unreported criminal case appears set to go to trial in Colorado in November. Prince has pleaded not guilty. An alleged co-conspirator, Roland Vaughn, initially did the same, but recent federal court filings indicate he is set to change that plea to guilty at a hearing early next month. Neither of their attorneys responded to requests for comment on the case.

Before he was fired late last year, Prince worked at a VA facility in Denver, where he oversaw a program that provides health benefits to the families of Vietnam and Korean War veterans with children who suffer from spina bifida, a debilitating spinal birth defect. Part of Prince’s job entailed counseling those families about the treatment options available to them through the VA. Prosecutors say he exploited that position of trust to steer patients to seven different home health agencies that subsequently kicked back money to Prince and his family.

The scale of the alleged fraud was extraordinary, according to data filed by federal prosecutors in search warrant affidavits. Of the $25.2 million the VA paid to home health agencies through the spina bifida program from June 2017 through June 2018, $18.9 million, or 75 percent, was paid to the seven companies implicated in the indictment against Prince.

Prince’s alleged scheme involved selling VA patients on home health services offered through the department’s spina bifida program. Certain services can be performed by family members and others without medical training provided they register with the VA ahead of time. Those services include basic assistance with daily tasks such as meal preparation and home care, but home providers can also be certified by medical professionals to help with bladder and bowel care often required for spina bifida patients. They can then submit invoices for services provided for reimbursement at a preset hourly rate.

According to the indictment, Prince sold patients on the benefits of doing that home health work themselves and recouping the hourly payments that the VA provided. He even allegedly encouraged them to falsely inflate the number of hours they worked, and falsely told some that there were minimum hourly billing requirements.

Prince then referred the patients to one of seven home health companies, assuring them that the companies could secure them the best reimbursement rates and assist with VA red tape. One of those companies was run by Prince’s wife. Others had reached pre-arranged deals with Prince under which he would steer them VA patients in exchange for referral fees. In many cases, Prince even sent patients prepopulated VA forms with his preferred home health agency.

Prince vouched for the companies’ track records even though, according to prosecutors, none were run by medical professionals. He used terms like “preferred,” “handpicked,” and “vetted,” and promised that the companies would assist with the red tape and would take the smaller fees than their competitors off of VA reimbursement checks.

In fact, the companies were taking huge premiums—paying home health caregivers between $16 and $20 per hour while filing for VA reimbursement at hourly rates between $86 and $141.

When patients found out about that discrepancy, they were livid. After receiving a regular statement of benefits from the VA, one beneficiary referred to a Prince-affiliated agency wrote to Rep. John Moolenaar (R-MI) in April 2018. “Our daughter is in the Spina Bifida Program,” the unnamed parent wrote, according to documents filed in court. “The program has a provision to provide health care for her at home for the rest of her life. We were told that we would be paid for this. We signed a contract with a company that would take care of getting us paid, but they didn’t tell us that they got to keep 82% and pay us 18% for doing all the work. This is highway robbery.”

The scheme was extremely lucrative for both Prince and the home health agencies with which he worked. Prosecutors say his wife’s Advantage Home Health Agency alone received more than $4.3 million in VA payments as part of its work for the spina bifida program. Three agencies owned by Prince’s half-sister received more than $7.1 million.

Together, all seven agencies kicked back roughly $1.5 million to Prince individually, according to the indictment, and hundreds of thousands more to members of his family.

Some of the money went directly into Prince’s bank account, while some was paid to a consulting firm he owns. He used the funds to buy a house and a car, pay down student loans, fund plastic surgery procedures (for whom it’s not clear), and even to donate to his and his wife’s church, according to documents filed by federal prosecutors.

In an emailed statement, the church said Prince “has not been associated with our congregation for quite a while,” but that “we are saddened to learn of these allegations, and our prayers are extended to all who may have been victimized by the crime alleged.”

Prince was arrested last summer after an investigation by the FBI and the VA inspector general's criminal investigations division. The evidence against him appears to be considerable, due in large measure to the official record of his time at the VA. Because he worked in a call center, all of Prince’s phone conversations were recorded. And his emails were preserved as required under the Federal Records Act. Federal prosecutors have amassed an evidentiary record consisting of at least 6,000 printed pages and 1,414 audio files.

“Evidence at trial will include the testimony of numerous witnesses, including VA employees, at least 16 caregivers… as well as the playing of recorded phone calls between Mr. Prince and the beneficiaries, which will be time consuming,” according to prosecutors. Prosecutors have also filed more than 40 federal seizure notices on the bank accounts of those involved in the scam, hoping to get back nearly $3.2 million taken by Prince and his associates.

During questioning after his arrest, Prince denied any wrongdoing, and said “he thought he was providing more benefit to the beneficiaries and caregivers by sending them to companies that were going to pay them more for the same services.”

Privately, his tone was far different. The FBI recruited the owner of one of the implicated home health agencies to conduct a monitored phone call with Prince, during which he admitted receiving kickbacks from the agencies to which he referred patients. “It may not be” legal, Prince admitted.

“All it takes is one person to say something and that’s the end of it for everybody,” he added. But “everything is fine if nobody finds out.”"

Scientists Desert USDA As Agency Relocates To Kansas City Area,https://www.npr.org,['Merrit Kennedy'],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/07/17/742519999/future-of-key-farming-research-uncertain-as-2-3-of-usda-staff-say-they-wont-move,"Scientists Desert USDA As Agency Relocates To Kansas City Area

Enlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP

Two vital research agencies at the U.S. Department of Agriculture are hemorrhaging staff as less than two-thirds of the researchers asked to relocate from Washington to the Kansas City area have agreed to do so.

When U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced the planned new location of the research agencies last month, he said it ""will be placing important USDA resources closer to many stakeholders"" and ""increasing the probability of attracting highly-qualified staff with training and interests in agriculture.""

But groups such as the Union of Concerned Scientists call it a ""blatant attack on science"" that will ""especially hurt farmers, ranchers and eaters at a particularly vulnerable time.""

The American Federation of Government Employees, the union representing the USDA's Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, said the relocation ""has resulted in catastrophic attrition at USDA's top research agencies.""

""Evidence suggests that the relocation of these agencies is an attempt to hollow out and dismantle USDA science that helps farmers and protects our food supply,"" the union added.

The USDA gave employees until just before midnight on Monday to notify their employers whether they planned to accept the relocation.

On Tuesday, a USDA spokesperson told NPR that at ERS, 72 employees accepted relocation and 99 declined or did not respond. At NIFA, the spokesperson said 73 accepted and 151 declined or did not respond. That means the total number that accepted is about 36% of those reported.

The USDA spokesperson said that these numbers may fluctuate until Sept. 30, the date employees are expected to report to the area, and employees can change their statuses until then.

They added that the USDA is working ""to ensure separating employees have the resources they need as well as efforts to implement an aggressive hiring strategy to maintain the continuity of ERS and NIFA's work.""

Last month, the USDA said that of the 644 jobs in the two agencies, 544 would be relocated and 100 would remain in the D.C. area. The numbers reported on Tuesday by the USDA do not appear to account for some 150 positions that the USDA initially announced would be relocated.

The department did not immediately respond to explain the difference, though the employees' union has reported high rates of ""retirements, employees securing new jobs, and employees choosing to be terminated."" A statement last month from three Democratic senators said that ERS had a vacancy rate of 20% and NIFA had a vacancy rate of 26.4%.

NIFA provides grants for research on agriculture-related science, and the ERS conducts research and analysis on topics such as outlooks on major crops and livestock, how much food is going to cost and whether U.S. households will be food secure.

It's not yet clear whether the research agencies will be located in Kansas or Missouri, according to The Kansas City Star.

Lawmakers from both states, including Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran, have supported the move. ""My first thought was Kansas City would be the perfect place,"" the Republican said, as NPR's Frank Morris reported.

An ex-employee of ERS recently told Morris that ""efforts by the secretary ... have just destroyed morale."" He said the way the agency is run has become increasingly partisan, and he resigned after the surprise announcement about relocations.

""I think it's had its intended effect. People have left, morale is low. The agency will take a long time to recover from the damage that's been inflicted,"" the former employee told Morris.

Some of ERS' recent studies, as Morris noted, may be politically uncomfortable for the Trump administration:

""ERS studies, for instance, concluded that the 2017 tax cuts championed by the administration would most benefit the richest farmers, and that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which Trump wants to cut, is good for the economy.""

Perdue said last month that the move would save the USDA some $300 million. That number has been met with skepticism by some analysts. The Agricultural & Applied Economics Association estimated the relocation would actually cost taxpayers between $83 million and $182 million, partially due to the lost value of the research from staffers who decide not to move."
House Democrats vote to hold Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt over census fight,https://www.cnbc.com,"['Sunny Kim Kevin Breuninger', 'Sunny Kim', 'Kevin Breuninger']",07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/17/census-fight-house-holds-ag-barr-commerce-secretary-ross-in-contempt.html,"U.S. Attorney General William Barr delivers opening remarks at a summit on ""Combating Anti-Semitism"" at the Justice Department in Washington, July 15, 2019.

House Democrats on Wednesday voted to hold Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in criminal contempt of Congress for defying subpoenas related to President Donald Trump's push to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.

The resolution passed by a vote of 230-198. It marks the latest escalation in the fight between Democrats, who say their oversight duties require launching a slew of subpoenas and requests for information from the Trump administration, and Trump, who has vowed to fight ""all the subpoenas"" from the House.

The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee last month voted to recommend that the entire House hold Barr and Ross in contempt for ""refusing to comply"" with their subpoenas for information about the census controversy.

""It begs the question: What else is being hidden from the American people?"" Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said in a press release at the time.

Ross responded in a statement Wednesday, saying, ""House Democrats never sought to have a productive relationship with the Trump Administration, and today's PR stunt further demonstrates their unending quest to generate headlines instead of operating in good faith with our Department.""

""It is an unfortunate fact that there are some who would like nothing more than to see this Administration fail whatever the cost to the country may be,"" Ross said. ""Preferring to play political games rather than help lead the country, they have made every attempt to ascribe evil motivations to everyday functions of government.""

The White House also responded after the decision, calling it a ""ridiculous and yet another lawless attempt to harass the President and his Administration.""

Trump had asserted executive privilege over the documents requested by the committee. A Commerce Department official told Cummings in a letter at the time that Trump's hand was forced because Oversight had set an ""unnecessary"" and ""premature"" contempt vote ""rather than allowing the Department to complete its document production.""

Trump abandoned his bid to add the citizenship question to the 2020 census last Thursday, just a few weeks after the Supreme Court blocked the question. Chief Justice John Roberts said Ross' reasoning for adding the citizenship question was ""contrived"" and not ""genuine."" Trump himself said the reasoning for the question on the census was for redistricting purposes.

Instead of gathering the data through the census, Trump said he would order federal agencies to give the Commerce Department all records related to information regarding how many citizens and noncitizens live in the United States.

The census question would have led to fewer responses, especially in households with noncitizens, according to Census Bureau research. Democrats say adding the question would result in an undercount in areas with a large Hispanic population and other minority communities, which would reduce Democratic representation in such areas."
"Donald Trump is not America's first racist president, but hopefully he'll be our last",https://www.usatoday.com,"['Paul Brandus', 'Opinion Contributor', 'Published A.M. Et July']",07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/07/17/donald-trump-racist-president-hates-what-makes-america-great-column/1743525001/,"CLOSE

Why does Trump hate the things that make our country great? And how do the rest of us get beyond this hatred and ignorance?

It was amusing at the start of the great racist tweet controversy to hear the media asking, “Is President Donald Trump a racist?” We are well beyond such questions.

“I am the least racist person you have ever met,” he has said on numerous occasions. If you were living solo on a deserted island and he showed up, that might be true, but for everyone else, it’s just another one of his delusional claims. In fact, I have met the president myself, and he’s off by one word. He is not the least racist person I’ve ever met — he is the most.

Trump supporters reading this will probably get upset and melt like snowflakes.Yet since October 1973, when Richard Nixon’s Justice Department sued Trump and his father Fred for barring blacks from their apartment buildings, it has been known that the president is a racist — and a congenital one at that.

Trump racism goes back decades

The least racist person you have ever met? You don’t know the history of the Central Park Five (Trump called for the death penalty for the accused teens), or the history of blacks who worked at his casinos (fine paid for discrimination, and much more) in Atlantic City.

The least racist person you have ever met? “Laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It’s not anything they can control,” he said in a 1997 Playboy interview.

The least racist person you have ever met? Mexicans? “they’re rapists.” White supremacists waving swastikas in Charlottesville? “very fine people on both sides.” On and on and on.

Before we move on, here’s my favorite. Remember when Trump (you know, the least racist person you’ve ever met) said that Haitian immigrants “all have AIDS” and that many African nations were “s---hole countries?”

One country he has singled out is Nigeria; he said once Nigerians have seen the United States, they would never “go back to their huts.”

President Donald Trump in Washington D.C., on July 16, 2019. (Photo: Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images)

His base loves this stuff, but guess what? The joke’s on them. According to Trump’s own Census Bureau, Nigerian immigrants are far better educated than white Americans. For instance, 17% of Nigerians who are here have a master’s degree; just 8% of whites do. And 4% of Nigerians who are here have a Ph.D. Just 1% of whites do.

Holding these figures down are lesser educated white folks like Trump himself and his relatives. None of them have an advanced degree — though Tiffany Trump, a second-year law student at Georgetown, may be the first to earn one.

Racism from Andrew Johnson to FDR

Americans have survived racist presidents before. Woodrow Wilson, a southerner, opposed postwar Reconstruction because ""the dominance of an ignorant and inferior race was justly dreaded."" He opposed giving blacks the right to vote, claiming “it was a menace to society,” and as president he oversaw the re-segregation of the federal government. He lived in the White House a century ago.

Calvin Coolidge signed an immigration bill aimed at keeping out “the yellow peril” — i.e. Asians, along with Africans and Arabs. “America must be kept American,” he said in 1923.

Trump's tweets: Bullies told me to go back to my country. At first it silenced me, now it spurs me on.

And everyone knows that after Pearl Harbor was bombed, Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, leading to the forced relocation of 117,000 Japanese Americans from the West Coast to inland internment camps. FDR’s defenders pointed out that we had just been bombed by Japan and were at war.

But few know that in 1925, Roosevelt wrote that “Japanese immigrants are not capable of assimilation into the American population...Anyone who has traveled in the Far East knows that the mingling of Asiatic blood with European and American blood produces, in nine cases out of ten, the most unfortunate results.”

FDR led us through the Great Depression and World War II. He was one of our greatest presidents. Yet those words cannot be ignored.

Visions of racial superiority

There are other examples — Andrew Johnson, who succeeded Lincoln, was probably the worst of all — but you get the idea. American history is dotted with presidents who harbored visions of racial superiority.

But not in the modern era, at least not to the degree that we have seen with Trump. He went from bad to worse just the last few days with his attacks on ""The Squad"" -- Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Ilhan Omar, D-,Minn., Ayanna Pressley D-Mass., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., all young freshmen congresswomen of color. And then he doubled down Monday, saying they hate America?

Actually, Trump seems to hate America himself. After all, he has complained about several amendments to our Constitution. He has complained about our system of checks and balances, our judicial system, our free press, people who are different than him.

Why does he hate the things that make our country great? And how do the rest of us get beyond this hatred and ignorance?

Donald Trump is not our first racist president. Let us hope, however, that he will be our last.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expressed concern about sending one of his top arms control negotiators, Andrea Thompson, to head a U.S. delegation meeting with Russia’s deputy foreign minister this week after it was revealed that she had failed to disclose her ties to the boyfriend of Russian foreign agent Maria Butina.

So Pompeo dispatched his deputy, John Sullivan, to lead the delegation instead. The delegation, which now includes Sullivan, Thompson and other senior U.S. officials, is attending the strategic security dialogue in Geneva, where American officials are set to talk with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov about arms control, including what sort of arrangement might replace the International Nuclear Forces treaty that the Trump administration scuttled earlier this year.

Story Continued Below

Thompson’s presence at the meeting raised concern in some quarters of the administration after the Washington Post reported last month that she had not disclosed her personal and financial ties to Paul Erickson, the veteran GOP operative who worked with Butina to establish a Kremlin backchannel to the Trump campaign in 2016.

Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, sent a private letter to the State Department in recent days regarding Thompson’s “apparent failures to disclose required and material information to the SFRC during her nomination process,” according to Juan Pachon, Menendez’s communications director on the committee.

A State Department spokesman confirmed receipt of the letter, but declined to comment on Pompeo’s last-minute decision to send Sullivan to Geneva, or on whether the department was satisfied with Thompson’s disclosures during her confirmation process.

Thompson failed to alert her superiors that Erickson officiated her 2017 wedding, according to two U.S. officials, and did not disclose during her Senate confirmation that her husband, David Gillian, a retired Australian Army officer, had wired Erickson $100,000 for an allegedly fraudulent investment scheme in which Gillian and others were allegedly defrauded by Erickson -- a transaction laid out by the FBI in court filings.

The failure to disclose could have serious repercussions for Thompson, former officials said, though it is not necessarily fatal to her career.

“All senior officers have to report on their finances and any connections to overseas interests. Diplomatic Security should review her clearance,” said John Sipher, who spent nearly three decades working in the CIA’s clandestine service, including a stint in Moscow. “When Erickson and Butina were all over the news, she should have reported her connection. At the very least it now puts the administration in a bind where critics can question her competence, professionalism and judgment.”

At the time of her wedding and her then-fiance’s investment in Erickson’s business four months prior, Thompson was working as national security adviser to Vice President Mike Pence. A year later, in April of 2018, she was confirmed by the Senate as undersecretary for arms control and international security.

At the time, Gillian was complaining to Erickson that he hadn’t seen the promised return on his investment, the FBI said, and received what agents described as a “lulling payment” of $5,000 -- intended to allay Gillian’s concerns -- on March 29, 2018, the month after Thompson’s Senate Committee hearing and the month before her confirmation vote.

Thompson’s alleged failure to disclose her relationship with Erickson, who was by then the subject of national news stories detailing his relationship with Butina, during her Senate confirmation has raised anxiety among Russia hawks in the Trump orbit who fear that Thompson, one of the last remaining acolytes of the president’s first national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, is insufficiently hard-headed and enters this week’s talks in a compromised position.

One of these officials said that Thompson’s failure to disclose her connection to Erickson indicates that her “judgment is in question.”

“She either didn’t understand what she was doing … or she did and she tried to conceal it,” this person said.

Flynn was pushed out of the administration in February of 2017 after news reports indicated he had misled senior White House officials about the substance of his conversations with Russian officials during the transition period. He stands accused of lying to the FBI about the nature of those interactions, though he has suggested that investigators tricked him into making false statements.

In March of 2017, Thompson filed a public financial disclosure report after joining the vice president’s office. Prosecutors in the Erickson case note that her then fiancé, Gillian, had wired $100,000 to Erickson on February 28, 2017. That was just days before her paperwork was submitted, but neither Erickson’s nor Butina’s role in the presidential campaign had yet been reported.

A subsequent financial disclosure would have been due in May 2018, according to a source in the vice president’s office, but by then, Thompson was at the State Department.

In the interim, Erickson became the subject of national headlines when reports surfaced that he had made overtures to the Trump campaign offering to establish a backchannel to the Kremlin. Erickson was engaged in a romantic relationship with Maria Butina, who has since pleaded guilty to conspiring to act as an unregistered Russian agent.

Throughout the 2016 campaign, prosecutors argued, Butina, a 30-year-old graduate student, worked to forge relationships with influential Republican political organizations, including the National Rifle Association, in an attempt to create backchannels to the Russian government. She worked both to organize trips for influential GOP operatives to visit Moscow and to get access to government officials for Russian delegations visiting the U.S.

A former GOP operative and fundraiser, Erickson was indicted in February on fraud charges in February and pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors allege that he swindled upwards of $2 million from investors for three business propositions, including one to invest in a chain of elder care facilities, and did not spend the money on any of them.

Though the charges were not directly related to Erickson’s relationship with Butina, the FBI alleged that “some of Gillian’s money went to Erickson’s girlfriend, Maria Butina."""
"Protesters vent anger at NY mayor, U.S. DOJ after chokehold decision",https://www.reuters.com,"['Jonathan Allen', 'Min Read']",07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-police-garner/protesters-vent-anger-at-ny-mayor-u-s-doj-after-chokehold-decision-idUSKCN1UC2HX?feedType=RSS&feedName=politicsNews,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Several hundred people took to the streets of New York on Wednesday to protest the U.S. Department of Justice’s decision not to bring charges against a New York City policeman in the chokehold death of an unarmed black man in 2014.

The demonstrators also vented their anger at New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat who has declined to fire Officer Daniel Pantaleo in the five years since Eric Garner died in police custody.

De Blasio told reporters on Wednesday that he was surprised to learn that the Justice Department would not bring charges and that he regretted delaying the start of disciplinary proceedings against Pantaleo for years at the DOJ’s request.

“You can do something about it,” said Takiema McKiver, 30, from Queens, responding to de Blasio’s comments. “You can’t just say that you can’t do something about police brutality. You’re the mayor; this is your city.”

De Blasio, who is running for his party’s presidential nomination, said New York City’s police commissioner would decide by August whether to punish or fire Pantaleo.

The officer has been on desk duty since he was seen in bystanders’ cellphone videos putting Garner in a prohibited chokehold and wrestling him to the ground on July 17, 2014. Garner is heard in the videos of the incident saying “I can’t breathe!” at least 11 times shortly before he died.

The death of Garner, 43, who was initially approached by police because they suspected him of illegally selling untaxed cigarettes, touched off a nationwide furor and helped give rise to the Black Lives Matter movement.

In announcing that it would not bring charges against Pantaleo, Justice Department officials said they could not conclusively determine whether Pantaleo willfully committed misconduct, which must be established to prove that he violated Garner’s civil rights.

“We asked for (Pantaleo) to be prosecuted. We asked him to be fired. We asked for it. Now we’re demanding he gets fired,” Garner’s daughter, Emerald, said at the demonstration.

Protesters chanted “Hey hey, ho ho! Pantaleo has got to go!” and “I can’t breathe!” as they were addressed by civic rights activists. The crowd later marched to NYPD headquarters in Lower Manhattan, where they laid down cardboard coffins.

Filmmaker Spike Lee mingled in the throng, accompanied by a camera operator, but declined to speak to a Reuters reporter.

Pantaleo was the latest example of an American law enforcement officer to avoid criminal liability in killings of unarmed black men."
"Sanders, Omar call for Labor Department investigation of all US Amazon warehouses",https://www.cnet.com,['Ben Fox Rubin'],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnet.com/news/sanders-omar-call-for-labor-department-investigation-of-all-amazon-warehouses/#ftag=CAD0610abe0f,"Ben Fox Rubin/CNET

A group of 13 members of Congress on Tuesday asked the Department of Labor to investigate all of Amazon's US warehouses, citing a long list of concerns about working conditions, labor violations, injuries and mistreatment.

The group is led by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Democratic candidate for president, and Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. The members are all Democrats except Sanders, who's an independent, and include prominent party members including Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard.

In a statement Tuesday, Sanders called on the Labor Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration to open an investigation immediately and ""prosecute those responsible to the fullest extent of the law.""

""People who work for a company owned by the wealthiest person in America should not have to risk their lives, health or well-being on the job,"" he said, referring to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. ""They must be treated with dignity and respect.""

Amazon shot back Tuesday, saying Sanders has an open invitation to visit its warehouses ""but to date has never stepped foot in one of our buildings."" The company said if Sanders had seen the facilities, he'd have learned that the company already implemented multiple layers of safety protocols at its warehouses. That work includes monthly employee surveys of safety, more than 1 million hours of safety training last year, and $55 million in safety improvement investments in the past year.

""The allegations outlined in this letter are not an accurate portrayal of activities in our buildings,"" Amazon said, adding that people as young as 6 can tour the buildings to see for themselves.

Sanders rejected Amazon's suggestion, saying in a tweet Tuesday afternoon he preferred surprise inspections be conducted by the Labor Department.

""I am not interested in a photo op at an Amazon warehouse,"" Sanders' tweet said. ""I am calling for Labor Department inspectors to come in, unannounced, and do thorough investigations of the facilities where hundreds of workers have told me about horrendous conditions and abuse.""

The congressional request continues long-running criticisms of how Amazon operates its warehouses, with years of news reports detailing employees being overworked, closely monitored and forced to move faster. While Amazon has faced heavy criticism in the press and from several members of Congress, a comprehensive government report on its warehouse conditions hasn't happened.

Now playing: Watch this: For these women, working at Amazon while pregnant ends...

Sanders' criticisms follow his repeated attacks against Amazon last year, when he called on the company to raise its minimum wage. When it did in October, he congratulated it for making that change.

The congressional group sent a letter requesting an investigation during Prime Day, Amazon's annual summer sale. In its fifth year, Prime Day has started to garner plenty of negative attention, with protests going on across the US and Europe on Monday.

On Wednesday, a Department of Labor spokesperson said: ""OSHA has confirmed receipt of the letter. The agency is still reviewing the letter at this time.""

I stand in solidarity with the courageous Amazon workers engaging in a work stoppage against unconscionable working conditions in their warehouses. It is not too much to ask that a company owned by the wealthiest person in the world treat its workers with dignity and respect. https://t.co/GxagHx70pb — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) July 15, 2019

Amazon said Monday that Prime Day has ""become an opportunity for our critics, including unions, to raise awareness for their cause, in this case, increased membership dues."" The company has often mentioned that it raised its minimum wage to $15 last year and offers a comprehensive benefits package that includes paid education, parental leave and opportunities for promotion.

Amazon's roughly 300,000 US employees aren't represented by unions.

In Tuesday's letter to OSHA, the members of Congress outlined several workplace problems they want investigated, including a report from Mother Jones that highlighted hazardous warehouse floor conditions that can cause long-term injuries. The group said they've heard hundreds of stories directly from people who worked for Amazon that present extremely poor conditions for employees, including high temperatures, closely monitored productivity that causes workers to avoid bathroom breaks for fear of falling behind, mental health issues, and calls for a faster pace that ultimately lead to injuries.

One former worker, a Navy veteran, said, according to the letter: ""There was a point where I would find myself crying on my shift ... I really felt like I just didn't wanna be alive anymore.""

""This work environment creates a high risk of physical injuries, a risk increased by Amazon's intentional disregard for the health and safety of their employees,"" the letter said.

In addition to Omar, Sanders, Gabbard and Ocasio-Cortez, Reps. Rashida Tlaib, Deb Haaland, Ayanna Pressley, Barbara Lee, Jan Schakowsky, Ro Khanna, Al Green, Debbie Dingell and Andy Levin joined the call for an investigation and signed the letter to OSHA.

"3 blue states file suit against Treasury, IRS over state and local taxes workaround",https://www.cnn.com,['Donna Borak'],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/17/politics/blue-states-treasury-irs-salt-lawsuit/index.html,"Washington (CNN) New York, New Jersey and Connecticut aren't backing off from a legal fight with the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service.

The three blue states filed a lawsuit in federal court in New York challenging the constitutionality of the Trump administration's decision to block a workaround that would have helped high-tax areas to bypass a $10,000 limit on federal deductions for state and local taxes.

""The final IRS rule flies in the face of a century of federal tax law that says state choices to provide tax incentives for charitable donations do not affect the federal deductibility of those gifts,"" according to a joint statement released by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's office.

In June, the Treasury Department finalized regulations that would bar individuals in high-tax states from creating charitable funds in exchange for state tax credits -- a maneuver developed as a workaround for changes to the treatment of state and local taxes under the 2017 tax reform

""The regulation is based on a longstanding principle of tax law: When a taxpayer receives a valuable benefit in return for a donation to charity, the taxpayer can deduct only the net value of the donation as a charitable contribution,"" the Treasury Department said in a statement.

Democratic lawmakers have repeatedly issued dire warnings about the limit, saying the measure primarily hurts Democratic-leaning states that tend to have taxpayers with higher incomes and higher home prices.

The controversial limit was a key revenue raiser in the $1.5 trillion tax code overhaul, which slashed tax rates for corporations and individuals.

This is not the first time these three states, along with Maryland, have challenged the deduction cap. In their latest lawsuit, the states argue that the rules violate the Administrative Procedure Act because they are inconsistent with federal tax law regulations about deducting charitable contributions.

""This is entirely unacceptable and as I've said before, the IRS should not be used as a political weapon,"" Cuomo said in the joint statement. ""The IRS regulations lack any basis in the law, upend decades of precedent without authorization from Congress, and target programs established by New York and other states to incentivize charitable contributions."""
State Department bureaucratic bloat undercuts Syria and Islamic State strategies,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/state-department-bureaucratic-bloat-undercuts-syria-and-islamic-state-strategies,"AMUDEH, Syria — On the day I left Syria, Special Envoy James Jeffrey visited to try to sell local leaders on his proposal for a buffer zone between Syrian Kurds and Turkey. America’s Kurdish allies listened politely, but confused. For the past 11 months, Jeffrey has been the “special representative for Syria Engagement and special envoy to the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.” The Syrian Defense Forces were the tip of the spear to defeat ISIS and were largely successful. Their civilian counterpart, the Syrian Democratic Council, runs northeastern Syria generally with tolerance and efficiency on very little income. Schools operate, municipalities pick up garbage, and the region even boasts its own cellphone company.

To unravel that stability and security in a flawed attempt to appease Turkey is unwise. It is also not clear it is consensus U.S. policy.

Over the last several decades, special envoy positions have proliferated for the simple reason that the State Department bureaucracy can suffocate policy implementation. Under normal circumstances, the State Department is slow and unwieldy. The bureaucracy is byzantine and beset by petty turf fights that undercut cooperation to a common cause. Nor does every issue conform neatly to preexisting bureaucracy. The fight against ISIS, for example, initially involved Syria and Iraq (two different State Department desks), and coalition affairs mandated interactions with Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, among other countries.

Still, most State Department reform efforts single out the proliferation of special envoys that often impose a bureaucracy upon an existing bureaucracy. A 2001 Council on Foreign Relations’ Independent Task Force report , for example, called on the State Department to “Reduce appointment and use of special envoys.” A separate Brookings Institution report the same year also found negatives to outweigh positives regarding special envoys. “Such innovations may provide political cover against charges that the administration is ignoring a foreign policy issue critical to a vocal constituency,” Clinton administration National Security Council officials Ivo Daalder and James Lindsay wrote , “but they undercut the nation’s diplomatic establishment.”

Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson targeted the envoy positions in his anemic reform attempts, but his successor Mike Pompeo resurrected many positions. In September 2018, career Ambassador Earl Anthony Wayne authored a Wilson Center report finding “the use of stand-alone special envoys or representatives should remain limited to a few roles of high importance and be well integrated into existing 'bureaus' and interagency structures. Otherwise, these ‘specials’ will likely add to the silos and bureaucratic infighting that have long complicated efforts to produce and implement a coherent foreign policy, and they can contribute to fragmented international policy.”

Back to Syria and Iraq: While Jeffrey is a special envoy, he is of equal rank to Joel Rayburn , deputy assistant secretary for Levant Affairs and special envoy for Syria. Add into the mix William Roebuck , deputy special envoy to the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS and senior adviser to the special representative for Syria engagement who, grandiose title aside, acts as an informal ambassador often resident in northeastern Syria. Perhaps such special envoys were needed for the year plus in which Sen. Tim Kaine prevented a confirmation vote on the Trump administration’s pick to be assistant secretary of state for near Eastern affairs. But David Schenker assumed his post last month and so in theory should also oversee Levant policy.

It’s not just the State Department that is confused. Surveying senior Iraqi officials in Baghdad and Syrian Kurdish officials at a counter-ISIS conference in Amudeh, Syria, earlier this month, few officials had a clear notion of which American officials were in charge and whether the emphases of each interlocutor were personal or reflective of policy. In short, Iraqis and Syrian officials say some U.S. officials are pro-Turkish, others seem to emulate Lawrence of Arabia in their infatuation with Arab tribal politics, and others still are relatively seeking to make their voices heard.

The bottom line is Syria policy is broken, but the proliferation of diplomats taking charge only makes matters worse. Every additional envoy or diplomat working on Syria and Iraq gives Syrian and Iraqi officials a reason for confusion or an excuse to feign confusion. Five years ago, it may have made sense for the Obama administration to embrace a special envoy position to defeat the ISIS but, with that group no longer controlling territory, it makes far more sense to return to a more traditional State Department structure.

Certainly it is ironic that, for all the criticism that Trump made of President Barack Obama and Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry during his campaign, Trump's team appears intent on replicating their bureaucratic bloat at the expense of effective policy creation and execution.

House Votes To Condemn Trump's 'Racist Comments',https://www.npr.org,['Tim Mak'],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/2019/07/16/742236610/condemnation-of-president-delayed-by-debate-can-lawmakers-call-trump-tweets-raci,"House Votes To Condemn Trump's 'Racist Comments'

Enlarge this image toggle caption Alex Brandon/AP Alex Brandon/AP

Updated at 7:05 p.m. ET

The House of Representatives approved a resolution Tuesday evening condemning the president for a series of racist tweets about four Democratic lawmakers.

The vote was mostly along party lines, as the House split 240-187, with four Republicans supporting the nonbinding measure.

Republican Reps. Fred Upton of Michigan, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Susan Brooks of Indiana and Will Hurd of Texas joined with Democrats to rebuke the president, as did Michigan Rep. Justin Amash, who recently left the Republican Party to become an independent.

The House was paralyzed for a substantial portion of the afternoon over legislative procedure. Republicans sought a ruling on the question: Does calling the president's tweets ""racist"" violate the rules of decorum established in the House?

So an already heated debate turned to farce as the House voted on whether to sanction House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for characterizing the president's remarks as ""racist,"" as part of a debate on a resolution that also calls the president's remarks ""racist.""

At issue was the phrasing of Pelosi as she spoke in favor of the resolution.

""Every single member of this institution, Democratic and Republican, should join us in condemning the president's racist tweets,"" she said. ""To do anything less would be a shocking rejection of our values and a shameful abdication of our oath of office to protect the American people.""

GOP Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, objected to the language, calling it ""unparliamentary,"" and called for her comments to be ""taken down"" — officially removed from the record. When that happens, the lawmaker is no longer allowed to speak on the House floor for the remainder of the day.

House rules prohibit impugning the motives of a person during legislative debate. There is no explicit rule that states that lawmakers cannot call comments ""racist,"" but there is precedent for declaring these sorts of characterizations out of bounds. The rules and precedents are outlined in Jefferson's Manual, which lays out parliamentary procedures.

As House staff and lawmakers huddled to sort out what to do and expected a decision, the presiding chair of the House, Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., unexpectedly dropped his gavel and declared that he was ""abandoning the chair.""

Majority Leader Steny Hoyer later delivered the ruling that Pelosi's words were not in order, but Democrats defeated a vote to strike them from the official congressional record.

Both the attempted sanctioning of the speaker of the House and Cleaver's decision to walk off the floor and leave the House without a presiding officer are highly unusual developments in the House.

The resolution states that the House ""strongly condemns President Donald Trump's racist comments that have legitimized and increased fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color.""

The president's weekend comments about four female members of Congress have done what Trump's remarks so often do: take control of the agenda in Washington, D.C.

As the weekend began, lawmakers expected that this week would be focused primarily on issues like a proposal to raise the minimum wage, a budget deal and a vote holding the attorney general in contempt over the 2020 census.

The president's tweets upended the whole order. His tweets, in which he implored four women of color to ""go back"" to the ""places from which they came,"" dominated the conversation in the capital — with Democrats condemning it and Republicans being asked to defend or denounce it.

The statements targeted four freshman progressive lawmakers: Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts. All but Omar were born in the United States.

In response to the president's comments, Ocasio-Cortez responded that telling ""four American Congresswomen of color"" to "" 'go back to your own country' "" reflects the ""hallmark language of white supremacists.""

Ahead of the debate on the House floor, Democrats were warned to watch their language.

In a meeting with his Democratic colleagues Tuesday morning, Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Mass., reminded lawmakers about the House rules saying they cannot impugn the personal motives of the president. Pelosi suggested to the caucus that they could use phrasing like his ""words were racist,"" noting that such nuance allows them to make their point and stick within the rules.

While some Republicans in the House and Senate have criticized the president's comments, GOP leadership in the House of Representatives stood with the president.

Asked if the president's tweets were racist, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said on Tuesday that they weren't. He added that he planned to vote against the Democratic resolution, dismissing it as ""it's all politics.""

House Republican Conference Chair Liz Cheney declined to address the president's comments directly, instead focusing on attacking the left.

""Our opposition to our colleague's beliefs has absolutely nothing to do with race or gender or religion,"" she told reporters. ""We oppose them and their policies because their policies are dangerous and wrong and would destroy America."""
Lindsey Graham reveals three areas of 'deep dive' after DOJ inspector general report,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/lindsey-graham-reveals-three-areas-of-deep-dive-after-doj-inspector-general-report,"Lindsey Graham laid out three areas he wants to explore as part of his ""deep dive"" inquiry into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation after the conclusion of Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s investigation into alleged abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.

During an interview Wednesday evening, Fox News host Sean Hannity asked the South Carolina Republican senator where he plans to go with his investigation. Graham, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said there are questions he wants to ask former FBI Director James Comey and his deputy Andrew McCabe.

""I'd want to ask Comey, what did you tell the president in January of 2017, 'Here is the dossier, I can’t verify it, but I want you know about it,'"" Graham said. ""And he used the same document and told the court that it was reliable on four different occasions. I want to know when McCabe reaffirmed again that without the dossier that there would be no warrant.""

He was referring to Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants filed by the FBI to surveil onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. Four FISA warrant applications and renewals were filed from October 2016 through June 2017 against Page. Robert Mueller was appointed special counsel of the Russia investigation in May 2017, after President Trump fired Comey.

The applications relied heavily on the unverified dossier about Trump's ties to Russia compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele, who was hired by Fusion GPS. The opposition research firm was hired by Marc Elias of the Perkins Coie law firm at the behest of the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. Steele and Fusion GPS shopped the research around to various government figures, including one skeptical State Department official, as well as the media in the run-up to the 2016 election.

McCabe has accused Republicans of mischaracterizing his testimony about the dossier.

Graham said he also wants to know what exactly former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopolous told the FBI.

""I want to find out, did Papadopoulos tell them upfront that, you know, if I was working with the Russians that would be a crime. I would never do that,"" Graham said. ""I want to know a bunch of things things.""

Papadopolous pleaded guilty October 2017 to making false statements to the FBI about his contacts with Russians and served 12 days in federal prison late last year and is now on supervised release."
EPA hails Trump's work on reducing air pollution,https://thehill.com,[],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/453601-epa-hails-trumps-work-on-reducing-air-pollution,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pointed to a new study released Wednesday to emphasize what it characterized as the Trump administration’s achievements in decreasing air pollution.

The report showed that emissions from all six measured criteria air pollutants decreased between 2016 and 2018, the years Trump has been in office.

It hailed this as part of decades-long trend of falling pollution rates that began in 1970, when the Clean Air Act was implemented. The results of the annual national air quality report showed that the emissions of six key pollutants dropped by 74 percent in that time period. The pollutants measured do not include carbon dioxide or methane, known greenhouse gases.

A statement from EPA added that the U.S. economy has grown 275 percent since 1970.

The arguments echo President Trump Donald John TrumpAmash responds to 'Send her back' chants at Trump rally: 'This is how history's worst episodes begin' McConnell: Trump 'on to something' with attacks on Dem congresswomen Trump blasts 'corrupt' Puerto Rico's leaders amid political crisis MORE’s remarks last week from the White House that drew criticism from environmental groups for taking credit for long-term improvements in air quality that had little to do with his own administration’s actions.

“They are taking credit for long term improvements in air quality that are results of regulations we’ve had in place for many years,” said Gretchen Goldman, research director for the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

“The way they frame it is we’ve mostly seen improvements of air toxics emissions, but at the same time they are doing that, they are changing policies that will actually make it worsen air toxics emissions.”

Trump has withdrawn the United States from the Paris climate deal since entering the White House.

The administration in the last year also replaced former President Obama’s Clean Power Plan for regulating emissions from power plants and revoked the “once in, always in policy,” which loosened regulatory compliance standards for certain sources of air pollution previously considered “major.”

“Despite EPA’s press release spin, reductions in air pollution during the Trump administration have stalled, while the Department of Energy estimates C02 emissions alone actually spiked in 2018, something Administrator Wheeler and his agency conveniently failed to mention, of course,” said Alex Formuzis, a spokesperson for the Environmental Working Group.

Critics say the damage from Trump’s policies are unlikely to be measured for some time.

“This is a long-term thing, you don’t see improvements and declines with a quick turn around, the way the process is, it’s a science based policy, often when you change a policy it’s years till you see the outcome, Goldman said.

Goldman pointed to the Obama administration’s 2015 ozone rule. Industry compliance results for that rule weren’t measured and released until this year.

“It’s going to be a while until we see the public impact of that but it’s 100 percent coming,” she said.

"China will not use its Treasury holdings as a weapon against the US, says expert",https://www.cnbc.com,['Grace Shao'],07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/18/us-china-trade-war-beijing-will-not-weaponize-us-treasury-holdings.html,"The move fueled concerns that China, the largest foreign owner of U.S. Treasurys, could employ the so-called ""nuclear option"" — the ability to sell off its Treasury bonds and trigger a surge in interest rates that would damage the American economy.

As trade tensions between the two countries escalated in March, Beijing cut down its U.S. debt holdings at the fastest pace in about two years.

China has other ""weapons"" in its trade battle with the United States — and selling off its U.S. Treasury holdings will not be one of them, said Richard McGregor, senior fellow at think tank Lowy Institute.

If China were to do anything to the U.S. dollar, that would obviously hurt Chinese holdings of the U.S. dollar.

""Weaponizing"" U.S. Treasury holdings has always been a ""non-starter"" for Beijing, said McGregor.

""The Chinese current account deficit is now under 1% of GDP,"" he explained. ""If China were to do anything to the U.S. dollar, that would obviously hurt Chinese holdings of the U.S. dollar. And I also don't think they want to see the disruptive affect that will have.""

McGregor said China has other options in the trade battle.

""China can manage its economy, manage its entry to its economy,"" he said.

Beijing can manage foreign access to the Chinese economy, and decide whether to boost the presence of foreign firms or deny them further access.

More importantly, he said, people should be watching how Chinese private companies navigate their way through this difficult time, because the implications of their success will have a major impact on the Chinese economy.

""They're the big exporters, not state companies,"" said McGregor, author of ""Xi Jinping: The Backlash.""

""I think what we need to watch is how they sort of manage or limit the damage — that is if the trade war goes on, and particularly if we get another round of tariffs.""

Some of China's largest companies by market capitalization are along the eastern coast of the country: notably tech conglomerate Tencent in Shenzhen, tech behemoth Alibaba in Hangzhou, and various commercial banks in the Shanghai region.

McGregor said how some of those companies ride out the current crisis could offer clues to the health of the world's second largest economy.

""What happens to the private companies along the coast there, which are the sort of the real driving force of the Chinese economy, they could be really hurt,"" he said."

The Trump administration plans to relocate most of the Bureau of Land Management’s D.C. workforce to west of the Rockies, part of its broader push to shift power away from Washington and shrink the size of the federal government.

The proposal to move roughly 300 employees from a key Interior Department agency — among them the majority of top managers — comes as Trump officials are forcibly reassigning career officials and upending operations across the federal government. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue finalized plans this summer to move about 550 jobs at two of his department’s scientific agencies from the nation’s capital to greater Kansas City. The White House is trying to abolish the Office of Personnel Management, the government’s human resources agency, and has threatened to furlough as many as 150 employees if Congress blocks it.

“The problem with Washington is too many policy makers are far removed from the people they are there to serve,” Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) said in a statement supporting the land agency’s move. “Ninety-nine percent of the land the BLM manages is West of the Mississippi River, and so should be the BLM headquarters.”

But opponents argue that abrupt decisions to relocate or reassign federal workers have not been justified by sufficient analysis, can disrupt families’ lives and already have cost the government valuable expertise. BLM has about 360 employees in Washington, many of them supervisors, with 95 percent of its 9,260 employees working in the field.

“If I wanted to dismantle an agency, this would be in my playbook,” said Steve Ellis, who retired as BLM’s deputy director in 2016 after nearly four decades in government service. In a phone interview Monday, he said that transferring so many employees out of Washington could complicate the agency’s relationship with Capitol Hill, budget officials and other federal entities.

He noted that BLM dispatched all of its wildfire and aviation staff to Boise, Idaho, in the 1990s only to reestablish a wildland fire office in the District when lawmakers expected briefings after fires broke out in the West.

“It’s important for these agencies to have a meaningful footprint in D.C.,” Ellis said.

Margaret Weichert, Office of Management and Budget deputy director for management, said in a statement that the move will make the government more efficient and “better serve the American people.”

In a shift long sought by conservatives, Trump’s government has shed thousands of employees overall since he took office, with gains at the Defense Department and Department of Veterans Affairs but an exodus of civil servants at several other agencies, including Labor, Education, and Housing and Urban Development.

Jason A. Briefel, head of the Senior Executive Association that represents 6,000 top government leaders, said it is worth having a public conversation about how to reorganize different agencies. But he questioned whether the Trump administration has made a solid business case for some of these decisions.

“This isn’t just an Interior issue,” he said in an interview. “This is a government-wide issue.”

Interior’s plan for BLM, according to two people briefed on it who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, proposes dispersing about 225 staffers who report to headquarters to states including Colorado, Nevada and Utah over time, while reassigning another 75 to the bureau’s state offices. The rest of employees would remain in Washington to work on issues such as the bureau’s budget, regulations and Freedom of Information Act requests.

Some of the BLM top employees slated for a job transfer will move to Grand Junction, Colo., according to three federal officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the decision has not been formally announced. But many affected workers — who include some top officials, Senior Executive Service staffers and low-level managers — will move to other cities in the West.

Interior officials have been eyeing a possible move for BLM, which manages more than 10 percent of the nation’s land, for more than two years. A handful of Western states, such as Colorado and Utah, have sought to recruit the agency.

While administration officials defend the Agriculture Department and BLM moves as an effort to spread the federal workforce around, 85 percent of the 2.1 million federal employees already live outside the Washington area.

The idea of shifting the bureau west has received the support of some lawmakers, including the top Republican on the House Natural Resources Committee, Rob Bishop (Utah), as well as Gardner and Sen. Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.). In March 2018, the two senators from Colorado urged then-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to look at Grand Junction, roughly 280 miles west of Denver.

Bishop said Interior Secretary David Bernhardt is “promoting a thoughtful, methodical approach that is a true win for the West. I’m pleased that a significant number of personnel will be coming to Utah and other Western states.”

But House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) accused Bernhardt of being secretive about his plans. Bernhardt’s hometown of Rifle, Colo., is not far from Grand Junction.

“Putting BLM headquarters down the road from Secretary Bernhardt’s hometown just makes it easier for special interests to walk in the door demanding favors without congressional oversight or accountability,” Grijalva said. “The agency will lose a lot of good people because of this move, and I suspect that’s the administration’s real goal here.”

Interior declined to comment on the relocation.

It remains unclear whether Congress would have to explicitly authorize the shift in personnel. The first stage of the move is expected to cost about $5 million, according to two government officials.

This is not the first time Interior has reassigned senior executives with little notice. In June 2017, political appointees reshuffled the assignments of more than three dozen career executives, with just 15 days’ notice of their job change. Interior’s Office of Inspector General investigated the matter but did not determine whether the moves were justified, citing the department’s incomplete records.

Denise Sheehan, who worked at Interior for 33 years before retiring last month from U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, said in an interview that the round of reassignments had a “chilling effect,” limiting what career officials are comfortable saying to political appointees.

“I don’t know if that was intended or not, but that was definitely the effect. It’s the most toxic thing in the senior executive corps I have ever seen,” she said.

In many cases, reassigned federal staffers have chosen to leave the government because they hail from two-career families or for other personal reasons. A majority of scientists and researchers at the USDA agencies slated to move to Kansas City are choosing not to move, and Perdue’s plan has been dogged by questions about its cost and the motivation behind it.

“When you move large numbers of employees from one part of the country to another, you’re going to lose a lot of institutional knowledge,” said Ward Morrow, assistant general counsel for the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employee union — with 530 members at BLM.

In other instances, the administration has shuttered parts of agencies altogether. The small Federal Labor Relations Authority, which adjudicates disputes between federal employees and their agencies, has closed regional offices in Dallas and Boston, citing declining workloads.

Under federal law, BLM will have to pay all relocation and real estate costs for employees who choose to move west, including what it takes to sell their homes in the Washington region and purchase a new one. Employees and their families will be entitled to four months of hotel stays on the government’s dime, federal personnel experts said, which could cost as much as $100,000 per employee.

The agency probably will offer retirement and buyout packages to employees who decide not to move, which could equal as much as a year’s salary depending on their age and years of service.

House votes to condemn Trump's racist tweets with support from only 4 Republicans,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Christal Hayes', 'Jason Lalljee', 'Sarah Elbeshbishi', 'Published P.M. Et July']",07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/07/16/president-trump-house-resolution-squad-aoc/1743579001/,"CLOSE Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi responded to the recent comments made by President Donald Trump and the White House while on the House floor. USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – The House formally condemned President Donald Trump’s Twitter posts as racist on Tuesday – in a vote split largely along party lines despite pressure for Republicans to denounce the president’s attacks on four Democratic congresswomen of color that they should ""go back"" to where they came from.

The vote on the resolution condemning a series of Trump’s remarks and Twitter posts came after a dramatic and combative hours-long debate that hit several snags due to long-standing House rules that prohibit any personal attacks on the president.

The vote, 240-187, fell nearly entirely along party lines with only four Republicans voting with Democrats. The four Republicans lawmakers are: Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan and retiring Rep. Susan Brooks of Indiana. Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, who recently left the GOP to become an independent, also voted in support of the resolution.

The resolution specifically called Trump's comments about ""The Squad"" — Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.; Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.; Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.; and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich. — ""racist"" and says the attacks have ""legitimized fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color.""

Everything we know: Trump triples down on his controversial tweets about 'The Squad.'

Reparations bill: Calling racism the 'poison of America,' Schumer backs reparations bill

The vote put Republicans on the record as to whether they denounced the president's comments or stuck beside him. Throughout Tuesday's debates Democrats aimed to pressure Republicans to hold Trump accountable while Republicans resisted, denouncing the resolution as a political ploy.

The intense debate over the president's rhetoric led to the House halting proceedings for nearly two hours after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Trump's comments “racist” and a top Republican asked her remarks be taken down.

""These comments from the White House are disgraceful and disgusting and these comments are racist,"" Pelosi said. ""Every single member of this institution — Democratic and Republican — should join us in condemning the president’s racist tweets. To do anything less would be a shocking rejection of our values and a shameful abdication of our oath of office to protect the American people.""

Editorial: Trump's racist rants are too offensive to overlook

As Pelosi called the president’s tweets racist, Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., tried to interrupt and cut off her speech. Pelosi only spoke louder, looking down at her prepared remarks.

After Pelosi was done, Collins looked wide-eyed at Pelosi and asked if she wanted to ""rephrase that comment."" Pelosi shot back: ""I have cleared my remarks with the parliamentarian before I read them."" House Democrats started cheering and clapping.

The move led to two hours of delay as officials debated over whether Pelosi violated House rules, which the House ruled she had. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., who was presiding over the House floor at the time, abdicated his post due to the dramatic fighting on both sides.

""We don’t ever, ever want to pass up, it seems, an opportunity to escalate. That’s what this is,” he said, noting that he tried to remain fair. But, he said. “fairness isn’t enough. We want to just fight.""

“I’ll abandon the chair,” Cleaver said, slamming the gavel on the dais and storming away as House officials watched in amazement.

The moment was replayed on loop on C-SPAN like a moment from an NFL game with reporters left with their jaws dropped remarking aloud whether this had happened before. A large crowd of journalists gathered in the gallery overlooking the House floor to watch the debate.

Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., and chairman of the House Rules Committee, also got in a heated back-and-forth with Republicans after he attacked the president's comments in a speech as something that ""used to be reserved for the darkest corners of the internet.""

""This is proudly using Twitter as a megaphone to attack fellow Americans,"" he said. ""These are American citizens being turned into some kind of scary 'other,' not because of their party, but because of their background, their race and their opinions.""

He added: ""I implore my colleagues to think twice before you follow the president off a cliff.""

Rep. Rob Woodall, R-Ga., took issue with McGovern's comments, saying they clearly violated rules and were ""diminishing"" the institution of the House of Representatives.

Pelosi told members of her caucus Tuesday morning she wasn't worried about House rules on calling out the president's comments, describing the four congresswomen as their ""sisters"" and saying Trump's ""words were racist,"" according to an aide in the room.

She added that she hoped Republicans would join them in condemning the comments by voting in a bipartisan fashion for the resolution.

""If they can’t support condemning the words of the President, well that’s a message in and of itself,"" Pelosi said, according to the source.

Most Republicans did not condemn the president and Republican leaders in both the House and Senate refused to do so throughout the day Tuesday, alleging the outcry is over politics.

“Let’s not be false about what is happening here today,” said GOP minority leader Kevin McCarthy. “This is all about politics and beliefs of ideologies.""

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell declined to call the comments racist and specifically said ""the president's not a racist.""

""Our words do matter. We all know politics is a contact sport. But it's about time we lowered the temperature all across the board,"" said McConnell, R-Ky. ""All of us ought to contribute to a better level of discourse.""

After Tuesday's vote, Republicans said they felt the day was wasted talking about the president instead of working to settle issues that will help the American people.

""This resolution divides our nation and distracts us from addressing the issues the American people sent us here to solve,"" Republican Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., said. ""It's time House Democrats start focusing on the real problems facing the American people, instead of their own.""

CLOSE Four congresswomen reacted to President Donald Trump seemingly suggesting they ""go back"" to the countries they ""originally came from"". USA TODAY

Rep. Dan Newhouse, R-Wash., said the debate and chaos the resolution caused on the House floor left him ""struggling."" He said, to him, this debate ""is not about race.""

""It should be about the issues that we disagree on, trying to come together and find common ground,"" Newhouse said. ""That’s what I’m looking forward to try to find some respectful discourse and some civility out of all this.""

Along with the resolution, Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., introduced a measure that would censure Trump for his racist comments. Democrats aren't expected to take up the measure for a vote, instead hoping the resolution on Tuesday would garner bipartisan support.

Trump wrote on Sunday that it was ""so interesting to see 'Progressive' Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe"" now telling the U.S. how to run its government. He did not mention Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, Pressley or Tlaib by name.

""Why don’t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came,"" Trump wrote on Twitter. ""Then come back and show us how it is done.""

All four are American citizens. The four progressive freshmen lawmakers are some of the president's most vocal critics in the House and have become known as ""The Squad"" — sticking together even when they seem to go against the rest of their party on key votes and issues.

The president's tweets appeared to help unite House Democrats after weeks of infighting that exploded into the public last month over sending emergency money to border agencies running migrant detention centers.

The feud garnered headlines after Pelosi criticized members of ""The Squad,"" telling New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd that the four congresswomen ""have their public whatever and their Twitter world"" but do not ""have any following.""

Ocasio-Cortez questioned why Pelosi would single out the new women of color in the caucus, telling the Washington Post it was ""outright disrespectful.""

The back-and-forth digs ended over the weekend after Trump's attacks. Instead, Democrats united against the president and denounced his comments.

More: 'The Squad': These are the four congresswomen Trump told to 'go back' to other countries

The resolution not only condemns Trump's comments. It also highlights immigration as a centerpiece of American history and culture, quoting presidents throughout history and comparing them to the policies of the Trump administration, which has been heavily scrutinized due in part to the worsening conditions in migrant detention centers at the southern U.S. border.

""The commitment to immigration and asylum has been not a partisan cause but a powerful national value that has infused the work of many Presidents,"" the resolution reads. ""American patriotism is defined not by race or ethnicity but by devotion to the Constitutional ideals of equality, liberty, inclusion, and democracy and by service to our communities and struggle for the common good.""

EPA worker rights under White House assault,https://thehill.com,[],07-18-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/labor/453710-epa-worker-rights-under-white-house-assault,"Last week, the Trump administration executed another step in its plan to dismantle the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Step one was appointing agency leaders who don’t support EPA’s mission. Step two was throwing out rules designed to protect the public from pollution and from climate change. Now comes step three: stripping EPA employees of rights and unilaterally changing employment conditions that are essential to maintaining a functioning workplace.

While running for office in 2016, Donald Trump told Fox News that, if elected, he would dismantle EPA to the point where there would be only “little tidbits left.” Unless Congress steps in, this goal will soon be in sight.

On July 8 – the same day President Trump Donald John TrumpAmash responds to 'Send her back' chants at Trump rally: 'This is how history's worst episodes begin' McConnell: Trump 'on to something' with attacks on Dem congresswomen Trump blasts 'corrupt' Puerto Rico's leaders amid political crisis MORE gave a fantastical speech boasting of “incredible” environmental achievements – his administration announced it was throwing out years of past agreements between EPA management and our union, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), and imposing new workplace edicts on two-thirds of the workforce as AFGE represents nearly 8,000 EPA workers.

These new workplace rules, which were not negotiated with the union and not agreed to by employees, will have far-reaching consequences on employees and the work that they do.

For instance, the new directive nearly eliminates the option for most employees to work from alternative work locations closer to where they live. For an agency that is supposed to be committed to reducing carbon emissions, minimizing commutes for its own employees should be a high priority. Over the past decade, EPA has steadily increased the availability of telework to the point where many employees rely heavily on that option – not only to reduce commute times, but to balance childcare and other obligations. With that option yanked away, many employees will choose other employment alternatives – especially any that are closer to home.

Additionally, the unilateral directive denies workers due process by limiting workers’ access to grievance procedures and preventing union representatives from meeting with employees and managers to resolve disputes. Denying workers due process in this way creates an untenable work situation for employees.

In the Bay Area, this action initially and primarily hurts the staff-level attorneys who work at EPA’s Pacific Southwest Regional Office (EPA Region 9) in San Francisco and are members of AFGE Local 1236. They handle mission-critical cases that include cleaning up Superfund sites, pursuing clean air and clean water cases in court, prosecuting environmental crimes, cleaning up oil spills, enforcing hazardous waste and toxic substances laws, and much more – all to protect the American public and the environment from diverse and complex environmental burdens and disasters. And they have been doing this vital work despite severe staffing and budget cuts over the past several years.

Unfortunately, the administration’s attack on our workplace rights and protections isn’t isolated to EPA. At agency after agency – Education, Health and Human Services, Social Security, Veterans Affairs – political appointees are hijacking the collective bargaining process in an attempt to force through anti-worker provisions. Many of these proposals mirror those contained in three executive orders President Trump issued in May 2018 that were subsequently ruled illegal by a federal judge.

The administration’s rejection of labor rights is part of a broader effort to silence federal workers and gut workplace rights. It is precisely these benefits that make it possible for many of those employees to stay at the EPA, working toward a cleaner and safer environment for all of us.

If the administration succeeds in enforcing these anti-labor directives, EPA and other federal agencies will have an even harder time recruiting and retaining employees who perform critical services on behalf of our country. That is clearly the intent of the Trump administration, which sees federal employees as the enemy.

As employees leave the agency, most are never replaced, and access to clean air and clean water and safe places for our families to live and play will steadily dwindle. We all need to let our senators and congressional representatives know that we value the work of the EPA and other federal agencies and ask them to intervene before the damage that is being done to EPA and other agencies across the government becomes permanent.

U.S. State Department official suspected of DUII in Bend,https://www.oregonlive.com,['Bend Bulletin'],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.oregonlive.com/news/2019/07/us-state-department-official-suspected-of-duii-in-bend.html,"A senior official with the U.S. State Department was arrested this month on suspicion of drunken driving after crashing her vehicle while returning from a wedding.

Susan A. Phalen was arrested July 6 on suspicion of DUII and reckless driving near Central Oregon Community College. As of Tuesday, she had not been charged with a crime, according to the Oregon Judicial Information Network.

At 10:39 p.m., dispatch received a report of a single-vehicle rollover crash on Mt. Washington Drive. Bend police Officer Matthew Baldwin arrived to find a 2019 Land Rover Discovery on its side in the middle of the northbound lane and Phalen sitting on the curb with a COCC campus security officer standing near her, according to court documents.

Baldwin said he “immediately” noticed numerous signs of impairment in Phalen, such as watery and bloodshot eyes, slurred and slow speech.

She allegedly needed help standing, according to court records.

Phalen reportedly told the officer she had been returning to her Airbnb after a wedding in Tumalo. Unfamiliar with the area, she attempted to follow her navigation by making a left turn when she rolled her vehicle.

The nearest road was Regency Drive, about one-eighth of a mile up the road, Baldwin said.

Phalen reportedly admitted to drinking margaritas at the wedding, but refused to perform roadside sobriety tests or take a breath test for alcohol, according to court records.

“I have no comment,” Phalen told The Bulletin when reached.

Phalen, 49, of Alexandria, Virginia, is listed as a senior adviser for external affairs for the State Department, according the department’s current directory. Her career in government stretches to the 1990s and has included stints as communication director for the House Homeland Security Committee and before that, the House Intelligence Committee. More recently, she was director of external affairs for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to her LinkedIn page.

Phalen made headlines last year when a fellow press secretary left FEMA, citing in his resignation letter a “boys club” mentality that excluded Phalen.

Phalen resigned from FEMA in early 2018.

"Veterans Affairs abandoned 200,000+ health care applications this year",https://www.ajc.com,[],,,,https://www.ajc.com/news/breaking-news/veterans-affairs-abandoned-200-000-health-care-applications-this-year/VR5zYSyyBn0LnTndnE2x1L/,"An arm of the Veterans Affairs Department in Atlanta eliminated 208,272 applications from across the country for health care early this year amid efforts to shrink a massive backlog of requests, saying they were missing signatures or information about military service and income, according to records reviewed by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Veterans groups say the VA should have done more to communicate with the veterans before closing their applications, some of which date back to 1998. Troops face additional challenges in applying for VA health care, they said, as they grapple with reentry into civilian life, change addresses following overseas deployments and suffer from combat stress.

In the middle of the controversy is the VA’s Health Eligibility Center, the Atlanta office that oversees the process by which veterans seek access to the VA medical system. It and its parent agency have come under intense scrutiny in recent years for mismanagement and delays in providing medical care, presenting a thorny challenge for the administration of President Donald Trump, who focused on veterans’ care during his presidential campaign.

As of April, 8.8 million veterans were enrolled in the VA’s health care system, the agency’s records show. The VA said it enrolled 395,417 people in its health care system and rejected 98,897 in the fiscal year ending in September. Its backlog of pending applications totaled 317,157 in April, down from a high of 886,045 last year, according to records the VA sent the AJC.

That current backlog is still “way too high,” said Jeremy Butler, CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, a New York-based advocacy group. He suggested additional collaboration between the VA and veteran service groups could shrink it more.

“Something is not quite working right if we are not getting that number lower than it is,” he said. “We need to be working together to get that number down.”

Butler joined Adrian Atizado, deputy national legislative director for Disabled American Veterans, a nonprofit charity based in Kentucky, in criticizing the VA’s efforts to reach the veterans before rejecting and closing their 208,272 applications.

The VA sent out one rejection letter to each of those applicants in 2016. In 2017, a bipartisan group of federal lawmakers — including Georgia Sen. Johnny Isakson — urged the VA to send the applicants an additional letter clarifying what missing information they needed to turn in. The lawmakers were responding to allegations that a coding error caused the VA to send veterans incorrect letters about what they still needed to submit.

The VA said it opted against sending an additional letter after its Office of Inspector General determined there was no such error and that the letters it sent in 2016 were appropriate and complied with federal law.

Isakson, who leads the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, was unavailable for an interview, according to an aide. But his spokeswoman said the VA took Isakson’s recommendation to have the inspector general review the issue and then briefed the senator’s committee about its decision to close the applications.

Atizado called the VA’s decision to send just one letter to the applicants in 2016 before closing their cases this year “quite unfortunate.”

“When we hear about the VA not taking a more thoughtful approach to a situation like this — when they only send one letter because they have an incomplete application — I think we all should be expecting our government and this administration to do better by our veterans,” he said.

The VA said veterans may reapply for health care. The agency said it is now striving to contact people about incomplete applications up to six times each with phone calls and letters. Its Health Eligibility Center in Atlanta, meanwhile, has added 115 employees since July of 2016.

The 208,272 eliminated cases didn’t receive such treatment, though. That also has drawn renewed criticism from Scott Davis, a VA employee and whistleblower who testified before Congress in 2014 about problems at the VA’s Health Eligibility Center, located off Clairmont Road.

“This purge has the dual effect of letting the VA avoid the work of processing the applications and absolving the agency of any responsibility for veterans’ delayed access to health and disability benefits,” Davis wrote in an article for the Washington Examiner in May.

Defending its decision, the VA pointed to a federal law that says applications that remain incomplete for a year cannot be approved.

“In accordance with federal law, VA closed 208,272 incomplete health care enrollment applications between January and February,” the VA said in a prepared statement. “It would have been illegal for VA to keep the applications open.”

Davis disputed that, saying the law doesn’t say anything about closing applications. In an interview, he accused the VA of “purging applications under a law that does not give them the authority to do so.”

Asked how many of the 208,272 applications the agency closed were from former prisoners of war, Purple Heart recipients and combat veterans, the VA told the AJC that the newspaper would have to file a request under the federal Freedom of Information Act for that information. The AJC did that last month and its request is still pending.

U.S. Sanctions Senior Myanmar Generals Over Rohingya 'Ethnic Cleansing',https://www.npr.org,['Merrit Kennedy'],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/2019/07/17/742538509/u-s-sanctions-senior-myanmar-generals-over-rohingya-ethnic-cleansing,"U.S. Sanctions Senior Myanmar Generals Over Rohingya 'Ethnic Cleansing'

Enlarge this image toggle caption Lynn Bo Bo/AP Lynn Bo Bo/AP

The State Department said it has issued sanctions to four top military leaders in Myanmar over what it called ""gross human rights violations"" during the ""ethnic cleansing"" of the Rohingya Muslim minority.

Targets of the sanctions include the military's commander in chief Min Aung Hlaing, his deputy Soe Win, Brig. Gen. Than Oo and Brig. Gen. Aung Aung. The sanctions, which were announced by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday, mean the leaders and their immediate families are barred from entry into the United States.

""With this announcement, the United States is the first government to publicly take action with respect to the most senior leadership of the Burmese military,"" Pompeo said in a statement. ""We designated these individuals based on credible information of these commanders' involvement in gross violations of human rights.""

A U.N. fact-finding mission said last year that the military ""took the lead in killing thousands of Rohingya civilians, as well as forced disappearances, mass gang rape and the burning of hundreds of villages."" It recommended that Min Aung Hlaing and other top leaders be tried for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.

A spokesperson for the Myanmar military, Brig. Gen. Zaw Min Tun, told The New York Times that the new travel ban won't have much effect on the leaders.

""It doesn't matter that they banned travel to the United States for the generals,"" said the spokesperson. ""But it does insult the Myanmar military's dignity.""

Pompeo's statement said that Min Aung Hlaing ordered the release of his men convicted of killing a group of Rohingya men in Inn Din, which was the subject of a Reuters investigation that won the Pulitzer Prize. ""The Commander-in-Chief released these criminals after only months in prison, while the journalists who told the world about the killings in Inn Din were jailed for more than 500 days,"" Pompeo said. He called it an ""egregious example of the continued and severe lack of accountability for the military and its senior leadership.""

Fortify Rights, a human rights organization based in Southeast Asia, said the sanctions alone are ""not sufficient but a step toward more justice and accountability.""

""It is the military as an institution which needs to be targeted,"" Mark Farmaner, director of the advocacy group Burma Campaign UK, said in a tweet. ""The military will not change its behavior because a small number of its members have reduced holiday options."""
"U.S. Justice Department may sue to block Sprint, T-Mobile merger: source",https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sprint-corp-m-a-t-mobileus/doj-may-sue-to-block-sprint-t-mobile-merger-cnbc-idUSKCN1UD23C,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has told T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) and Sprint Corp (S.N) to wrap up a deal by the end of next week to sell assets that are to be divested as a condition of their proposed merger or face a lawsuit aimed at stopping the transaction, a source familiar with the deal said on Thursday.

FILE PHOTO: A smartphones with Sprint logo are seen in front of a screen projection of T-mobile logo, in this picture illustration taken April 30, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo

T-Mobile and Sprint did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment. The Justice Department declined to comment.

CNBC was the first to report the ultimatum.

In June, a group of U.S. state attorneys general filed a lawsuit in federal court in New York to block the merger of the third and fourth largest U.S. wireless carriers, arguing that the proposed $26 billion deal would cost consumers more than $4.5 billion annually.

To win over the Justice Department, which is not involved in the lawsuit, T-Mobile and Sprint have agreed to a series of deal concessions, including selling the prepaid brand Boost.

The companies have been in talks for weeks to sell Boost to Dish Network Corp (DISH.O) but are haggling over issues such as restrictions over who can buy the divested assets if they are sold in the future. T-Mobile and Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE), which owns 63 percent of T-Mobile, are seeking to prevent them from going to a cable or technology company.

Sprint is controlled by Softbank Group Corp (9984.T).

The companies told the court in late June that they were willing to refrain from closing the deal until after the state attorneys general case is completed.

The two companies have a July 29 deadline to complete the deal but are expected to extend it.

Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai has given his blessing to the merger in principle and is expected to circulate a formal order within weeks."
Fewer than half of USDA workers will follow agency to KC,https://www.kansascity.com,[],,,,https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article232730352.html,"Employees protest plan to move USDA jobs to Kansas City The USDA’s decision to move hundreds of research jobs out of Washington to Kansas City has triggered a backlash among federal employees. Employees stood in silent protest during a meeting about the move to Kansas City. Up Next × SHARE COPY LINK The USDA’s decision to move hundreds of research jobs out of Washington to Kansas City has triggered a backlash among federal employees. Employees stood in silent protest during a meeting about the move to Kansas City.

Fewer than half of the USDA researchers offered transfers from Washington, D.C., to Kansas City will follow their jobs here, the agency announced Tuesday.

But those who did decide to make the 1,000-mile journey still don’t know exactly where they’ll be working.

U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced on June 13 that the ag department would ship more than 500 jobs from Washington to Kansas City. Local leaders in Kansas and Missouri cheered the bi-state recruitment effort, though it sparked an immediate backlash from employees in D.C.

A USDA spokesperson told The Star that 72 employees in the ag department’s Economic Research Service accepted their transfer to Kansas City. Another 99 turned down the offer — a number that included employees who did not respond by a Monday deadline. In USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture, 73 employees signed on to the transfer while another 151 turned it down.

In total, the agency reports 145 workers will follow their jobs to Kansas City, while 250 will leave the agency, meaning 36.7% accepted their transfer assignments. As USDA announced earlier, the two agencies will keep a combined 97 positions in the Washington area.

Some of USDA’s positions were already vacant, as workers began leaving the two agencies in the fall, when news of the relocation first emerged. In June, the agency announced 547 jobs would move to Kansas City. With only 145 signing up to move, that means it may have to hire as many as 400 workers.

Those numbers confirmed earlier predictions that many workers would flee USDA’s ranks rather than move to Kansas City.

USDA says the figures may fluctuate until Sept. 30, the last date employees can report to Kansas City. Employees can change their decision up until that date.

“With employee decisions made, the Department will work to promptly implement an aggressive hiring strategy to ensure continuity of work during the transition,” USDA said in a statement Tuesday.

The USDA spokesperson told The Star that human resources was working with both agencies to begin bringing on employees July 22 — the first date new and relocating employees may begin work in Kansas City.

Economic development officials from Kansas and Missouri joined forces to lure the two agencies to the region. But now, cities on both sides of the state line are working to land the final site of USDA’s offices. While all property owners can place bids, sources previously told The Star that six sites across the metro got USDA’s attention.

Tim Cowden, president and CEO of the Kansas City Area Development Council, said his organization has been working with affected USDA employees over the last month. He said an acceptance rate below 40 percent is in line with that of a typical headquarters relocation.

“We are committed to working with all USDA employees interested in relocating to KC. In fact, we have a team dedicated to them,” Cowden said in an email. “We expect there will be others who may elect to relocate to KC and our community is ready to welcome them.“

On Tuesday, U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, and more than a dozen other Democratic lawmakers wrote to the agriculture secretary urging him to slow down the relocation process.

While those members of Congress pledged to continue efforts to halt the move, in the meantime they asked the ag secretary to allow researchers to work remotely or from existing offices in the D.C. area until the feds have secured a permanent home in Kansas City.

USDA is looking for about 115,000 square feet of office space on either side of the state line.

The General Services Administration, the federal government’s real estate arm, will consider sites in a city center or suburban office park setting. GSA recently extended the deadline for developers to propose sites for the new USDA offices by one month. Those proposals are now due Aug. 7, though employees will begin working at temporary offices this fall in Kansas City.

“This predicament makes it nearly impossible for your employees to determine where they will be living, where to send their children to school, and other important decisions until they know where the final office space will be located in Kansas City,” Van Hollen’s letter said.

Experts believe the USDA’s move may portend a “new frontier of economic development” in which cities and states vie to lure federal offices away from Washington, D.C. On Monday, Republican senators announced that the federal Bureau of Land Management would ship jobs to three western states as it seeks to relocate its headquarters from the nation’s capital.

The agriculture department has argued that moving to Kansas City will put researchers closer to farmers and drastically reduce expenses given the Midwest’s relatively lower cost of living.

But many scientists — including the Union of Concerned Scientists — suspect that USDA’s relocation is meant to diminish USDA research.

The Milwaukee-based Agricultural and Applied Economic Association predicted the move could cost U.S. taxpayers upward of $182 million in lost productivity and research capacity.

And Tuesday’s letter from Democrats claims that it could take as long as two years to build out new office space in Kansas City.

“We remain concerned that this restructuring will gut the ability of these agencies to successfully carry out their important missions,” the Democrats said. “We also remain concerned that the quality of work being done at ERS and NIFA has already been undermined and will continue to degrade.”

USDA did not respond to questions from The Star about the timeline to establish permanent office space.

But GSA’s request for bids on the project calls for an extended construction period: from the time a lease is awarded, property owners have up to 330 days to make physical improvements.

Employee transfer notices showed USDA workers might temporarily work out of existing USDA office space on Beacon Drive near Swope Park in south Kansas City."
Democrat lifts hold on Treasury nominees amid ongoing fight over Trump's tax returns,https://www.cnn.com,['Donna Borak'],07-18-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/18/politics/wyden-treasury-nominee-hold-tax-returns/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee is dialing back his threat to block Treasury Department nominees, saying he will allow hearings on three nominees to proceed.

In a statement, Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden said Thursday the Treasury Department has ""finally cooperated"" with his investigation into its handling of a request by House Democrats for six years of President Donald Trump' s personal tax returns.

Wyden said the July 17 letter by Justin Sok , senior adviser for Treasury's office of legislative affairs, ""acknowledged the unprecedented process that led to its refusal to comply with a lawful request.""

In its letter, Wyden said, the agency admitted no Treasury secretary to their knowledge had ever been previously involved in responding to a tax return request under an obscure tax law, known as Section 6103, as Secretary Steven Mnuchin has been involved in handling the response to the request for Trump's returns.

The letter also confirmed that the Office of Legal Counsel had never been formally consulted previously on such a request, and that Treasury had never formally considered whether there was a legitimate legislative purpose behind the tax law.

"A Revere veteran’s legal marijuana job cost him a VA loan. Now, Congress is stepping in",https://www.bostonglobe.com,[],07-16-2019,2019,7,https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/marijuana/2019/07/16/fought-good-fight-revere-veteran-shocked-congress-cared-about-his-home-loan-rejection-over-legal-marijuana-job/kPnw9QCisvNtgvUshzwXeJ/story.html,"It was validation for the 35-year-old disabled Army veteran from Revere. He never imagined that anyone would care that the Veterans Administration had rejected his home loan application in January, just as his family was set to move, because the VA disapproved of his job managing a marijuana store.

The US House of Representatives passed your amendment, said the caller from Representative Katherine Clark’s office. Thank you for bringing this issue to our attention.

But now, the House had shown it agreed that the veteran should have received his earned benefit. On Friday, it passed a measure banning the VA from considering veterans’ income from state-approved cannabis industries as a reason to deny them their benefit of a low-rate home loan guarantee with no money down.

“I’m blown away — I can’t believe it,” said the veteran, who spoke on condition of anonymity to protect his military relationship. “It’s cool because we fought the good fight and something really went the way it should go.”

In January, after the veteran’s house purchase fell through at the last moment because of the VA’s rejection, he contacted his congresswoman, Clark. She filed the amendment to ban the VA’s practice as part of the larger defense budget. Separately, she sent a letter, signed by 20 lawmakers, to the VA requesting more policy details in light of the veteran’s case. The letter noted that more than 211,000 people work in the legal cannabis trade nationwide, which generates $11 billion in sales per year.

“The cannabis industry is a growing part of our economy and no one, let alone our veterans, should be penalized for being part of it,” Clark said in a statement Friday after the House vote. “The passage of this amendment ensures that our service members receive the benefits they deserve while modernizing the policies of the VA.”

The VA did not respond to a request for comment, but previously said it would reply directly to the lawmakers.

Because the Senate had already passed its version of the defense budget, a joint committee will determine whether the measure will be included in the bill that lands on President Trump’s desk.

The Revere veteran’s experience highlights one of the many ways that veterans and others can get caught between federal marijuana prohibition and states that have legalized pot.

Some veterans have reported a loss of benefits or being labeled unemployable as a result of consuming marijuana or working in the legal marijuana industry. Many veterans who find medical relief from pot say they’re financially overburdened and medically underserved because the VA doesn’t discuss or cover the drug as it does with other medications, including opioids.

The Revere veteran started working in the cannabis industry after finding that medical marijuana helped ease his chronic pain resulting from tearing both shoulders in a military training exercise. The cannabis also allowed him to get off opioids, he said, which made him “a shell of myself.”

Last year, he became the assistant manager of a marijuana retailer, now one of the state’s 22 pot shops. He loves helping patients find relief. The job gives him fulfillment that he’d missed since the Army.

In January, when he learned why the VA rejected his home loan, the veteran vented to his coworkers. One of his colleagues connected him to a mortgage company that helped him secure a reduced-rate home loan that he could afford.

The veteran and his family are no longer crammed into a tiny apartment or his parents’ home. Last week, they moved into their new house: a yellow four-bedroom in Dracut with a sunroom, white countertops, and a huge backyard perfect for his three children.

“It’s a dream come true,” the veteran said. “It’s a bigger, better, beautiful house. Maybe everything happens for a reason.”

"EPA pushed for tighter, more enforceable PolyMet water permit",https://www.duluthnewstribune.com,['Jimmy Lovrien'],,,,https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/business/energy-and-mining/3976773-EPA-pushed-for-tighter-more-enforceable-PolyMet-water-permit,"A newly released Environmental Protection Agency memo shows the federal agency continued to urge the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency to set stiffer standards on its water permit later given to PolyMet, the company looking to build the first copper-nickel mine in Minnesota, up until two days before the water permit was issued to the company.

The memo, first given to the Minneapolis Star Tribune by the American Federation of Government Employees Local 704, which represents EPA employees in the midwest, was written by Kevin Pierard, chief of the NPDES Programs Branch and dated Dec. 18, 2018. The MPCA issued its water and air permits to PolyMet on Dec. 20.

Pierard outlines concerns and comments made by EPA staffers reviewing a draft of PolyMet’s national pollutant discharge elimination system, or NPDES, permit, which regulates water discharged from industrial activities.

In the memo, Pierard explains the EPA urged the MPCA to require water quality based effluent limits, or WQBELs, in its permit to PolyMet, instead of operating limits, which the federal agency said are less enforceable.

Opponents of PolyMet argue the project could send tainted runoff into the St. Louis River watershed and Lake Superior.

WQBELs set standards on pollutants discharged into the environment and are enforceable under the Clean Water Act and apply at the discharge point where dilution may occur.

But instead of requiring PolyMet to follow those standards, the MPCA plans to regulate contaminants such as arsenic, cobalt, lead, nickel and mercury with operating limits, which the state agency said is “more conservative and protective” than WQBELs because operating limits are measured prior to discharge and don’t require dilution, MPCA spokesperson Darin Broton said in an email to the News Tribune Wednesday.

But the EPA memo maintains operating limits are more difficult to enforce.

“Unlike WQBELs and (technology-based effluent limitations), internal ‘operating’ limits may lack a clear regulatory connection to controlling surface water discharges,” Pierard wrote, acknowledging that EPA lawyers determined PolyMet’s operating limits set by the MPCA are still “arguably federally enforceable.”

But he added, “We note that federal enforceability of these operating limits is less certain and more complex than if these limits were established as WQBELs.”

Broton said the MPCA did not find “reasonable potential” for discharge to exceed water quality standards in the receiving water, which would have required a WQBELs.

“PolyMet’s proposed reverse osmosis treatment is extremely effective in removing pollutants,” Broton said. “Using this data, staff did not find that the discharge had reasonable potential to result in an exceedance in the water quality standards and therefore needed WQBEL.”

Paula Maccabee, counsel and advocacy director of WaterLegacy, an environmental group opposed to PolyMet, has long argued WQBELs for PolyMet are required by law.

“With operating limits, it’s uncertain whether it can be enforced at all,” Maccabee said Wednesday. “It’s uncertain what kind of action could be required, even if there’s a violation. So in every possible way, it’s a second best or maybe third best alternative. Water quality based limitations are what the law requires and should require.”

The EPA memo echoes concerns made by the EPA in an April 2018 document released last month on an earlier draft and a leaked email that critics of the project say shows the MPCA tried to suppress those comments from reaching the public record.

The handling of those comments is being investigated both by the EPA’s Office of Inspector General and Minnesota Office of the Legislative Auditor. Similarly, the Minnesota Court of Appeal’s cited the permitting processes “procedural irregularities” and sent the case to a district court for a hearing.

Through a rights offering last month, Swiss mining giant Glencore now owns almost 72% of PolyMet shares. PolyMet must still raise almost $1 billion to finance the project."

"Controversial agency relocation slammed as attack on science by lawmakers, employees",https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/agriculture-usda-blm-move-dc-climate-trump-protests-science-e8e534ec12fc/,"Employees and Democratic lawmakers are pushing back on the Trump administration’s plans to relocate hundreds of positions within two agencies outside of Washington, D.C. — a move some see as an effort to clamp down on science.

While the planned moves of both the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and parts of the Department of Agriculture (USDA) differ in their scope and rationale, resistance to both plans has shaped up similarly.

Critics are expressing concern over the motivations behind the efforts, which would lead to a mass-exodus of agency experts unwilling to relocate. This would spur a science brain drain in line with President Donald Trump’s crackdown on reports and research from within his own government.

“These decisions… are meant to displace seasoned scientists and regulators who have honorably served Republican and Democratic Administrations alike,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) in a statement to ThinkProgress responding to both the BLM and USDA relocation plans. Van Hollen sits on the Interior and Environment Appropriations subcommittee.

Responsible for administering public lands, BLM has become a battleground under the Trump administration as the White House has rolled back the boundaries of national monuments and advocated for fossil fuel drilling on U.S. acreage.

Now, the bureau is sparking controversy again. Administration officials confirmed this week that the overwhelming majority of BLM positions in D.C. are set for relocation. Around 84% of BLM staffers will be asked to relocate by the end of next year to areas outside of the nation’s capital, mostly to western states.

That announcement comes a month after Secretary Sonny Perdue mandated that over 500 USDA employees move en masse to Kansas City — located in both Missouri and Kansas — by Sept. 30, and gave them a deadline of July 15 to respond.

In the case of BLM, the Interior Department (DOI) plans to concentrate many of the positions in Grand Junction, Colorado, in addition to a range of western states stretching from Arizona to Alaska. Joe Balash, DOI assistant secretary for land and minerals, called the decision “demonstrably cost-effective” in a July 16 letter to Sen. Tom Udall (D-NM), ranking member of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Interior and Environment.

The Trump administration argues that the move would both cut expenses and shift workers closer to the public lands they focus on, an argument supported by many Republicans including Rep. Rob Bishop (R-UT), who sits on the Natural Resources Committee.

But Democrats immediately raised objections. Udall said he had “serious reservations” about the move, as did his subcommittee counterpart in the House, Rep. Betty McCollum (D-MN). Democrats in both chambers of Congress indicated this week that they feel the plan is largely an effort to push out the D.C.-based senior staff who do not want to relocate.

Many of those employees are experts in their field, including scientists. “It’s a way for them to get rid of a lot of professional staff here in Washington,” said Rep. Jared Huffman (D-CA) in a statement.

Many BLM employees are already located in other parts of the country and support for moving the bureau has been somewhat bipartisan over the years. But the latest push for relocation by the Trump administration coincides with a heated clash between USDA and its employees.

Given until this past Monday to make their decision, scores of USDA workers have opted out of moving. Of the employees with the USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), more than half declined to relocate, according to Politico.

ERS workers in particular argued that the move would disrupt their work and efforts to publish important scientific reports. NIFA, meanwhile, is responsible for grant funding that touches climate, economic, and agricultural work that uses D.C. as a home base.

Many USDA employees have also argued that the move is politically motivated. ERS has recently released reports critical of Trump’s escalating trade war with China and its impact on farmers.

Experts also worry the move is a warning shot with implications for climate science. An investigation by Politico last month found that USDA has repeatedly sought to bury studies showing the danger of climate change. That report noted that some scientists see the ERS move as a foreshadowing of wider repercussions for research that doesn’t align with the administration’s broader “energy dominance” agenda.

USDA workers have fought through their union, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), to dispute the move, but the department has rejected those efforts. Moreover, there is concern that other departments could face similar moves, like the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Geological Survey, both of which are under DOI’s jurisdiction.

But Democrats asserted that they are looking into measures to combat the relocations, emphasizing that the move could be costly to taxpayers in addition to dramatically shifting the wealth of knowledge offered by current government staffers.

Lawmakers indicated they might seek to halt the relocation by blocking its funding in the upcoming appropriations bill that covers both the DOI and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). A group of senators, including Van Hollen, have meanwhile introduced legislation to keep ERS and NIFA in the D.C. metro area, a move that was made before the BLM move was announced.

“This Administration is acting to undermine the subject-matter experts at many of our federal agencies,” said Van Hollen, who added that his office would “continue to use every tool available to push back against these actions.”

This article has been updated to note that only USDA would be impacted by the Senate legislation due to timing."

DOJ calls Qualcomm antitrust ruling a threat to national security,https://9to5mac.com,['Apple Watch Series'],07-17-2019,2019,7,https://9to5mac.com/2019/07/17/threat-to-national-security/,"The Department of Justice is arguing that the Qualcomm antitrust ruling back in May poses a threat to national security. It is calling for the remedies issued by the court to be put on hold pending an appeal.

Although Apple settled its civil lawsuit against Qualcomm, the exact same evidence put forward for that case was earlier used by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to take the radio chipmaker to court — with judgement awarded against Qualcomm …

NordVPN

Background

Apple’s evidence in the case was key to the FTC victory. The court ruled that Qualcomm’s contracts with the iPhone maker and other smartphone companies were unfair, and evidence that the chipmaker held an effective monopoly on essential wireless technologies.

Judge Koh ordered three remedies. First, Qualcomm must renegotiate existing licensing terms, ensuring that customers can choose to license patents without being forced to buy their chips from the company. Second, it must license those essential patents on FRAND terms – Fair, Reasonable And Non-Discriminatory. Third, it cannot enter into any exclusivity agreements: all its chips must be available for sale to any company that wishes to buy them.

Qualcomm appealed the case, arguing that the judge misapplied a rather obscure legal precedent involving a ski company.

The DOJ intervention

We learned back in May that the DOJ might seek to intervene in the case, expressing concern about the impact of the remedies on Qualcomm’s future. In particular, it was concerned that Qualcomm is the US leader in the development of 5G technology, and anything which damaged the company’s business model could leave it with less incentive to invest in research and development. That could leave the US dependent on Chinese 5G tech.

CNET reports that it has now done so.

The Justice Department on Tuesday filed an amicus brief with the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, asking the judges to grant Qualcomm a reprieve. The filing followed a request by Qualcomm last week that the appeals court grant a stay in remedies ordered by US District Court Judge Lucy Koh in May after she declared the wireless chip provider to be a monopoly.

An amicus brief — literally a submission from ‘a friend of the court’ — is an argument put forward by a third-party, not directly involved in the case, but which has a point it wishes the judge to consider in reaching a decision.

The DOJ makes two arguments. First, it agrees with Qualcomm that the precedent was misapplied and that the chipmaker is likely to win its appeal. Qualcomm says the remedies would do irreversible damage to the company, and it is therefore right that they should be put on hold until the appeal is heard.

“Unless stayed, the injunction will significantly impair an American company that is the worldwide leader in the development of cellular technologies, at a critical moment in the development of the worldwide standards for next-generation 5G cellular systems, thereby forfeiting the lead to foreign interests,” Qualcomm’s filing said.

Second, says the Justice Department, the ruling poses a threat to national security.

The threat to national security arguments

If Qualcomm is able to make less money from licensing its patents, and selling chips, it may well decide that expensive investment in 5G R&D no longer makes financial sense. Since Chinese companies currently dominate the production of 5G tech, that would leave both US companies and the government forced to use Chinese technology for crucial infrastructure.

Additionally, says the DOJ, Qualcomm is a key supplier to the Defense Department, and it is in the national interest that the company remains motivated to invest in R&D.

The risks to national security include the disruption of DOD’s supply chain and unsure US leadership in 5G, said Ellen Lord, the under secretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment. She added that the Defense Department believes Qualcomm is the market leader in wireless chips because of its expertise and R&D expenditure and that Qualcomm holds important Defense Department security clearance and contracts. “A hobbled Qualcomm, without the ability to make significant investments in R&D, presents a serious threat to DOD’s extensive networks, advanced telecommunications systems, and ultimately its ability to control the battlespace,” Lord said.

Trump administration denies possible ouster of Commerce Secretary Ross,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",07-15-2019,2019,7,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-census-ross/trump-weighs-ousting-commerce-secretary-ross-nbc-idUSKCN1UA0VD,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Monday denied a media report nbcnews.to/2XPQJ4B that President Donald Trump is considering removing Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross after a Supreme Court defeat on adding a citizenship question to the census.

Trump retreated on Thursday from adding a contentious question on citizenship to the 2020 census, but insisted he was not giving up his fight to count how many non-citizens are in the country and ordered government agencies to mine their databases.

Although Trump has previously been frustrated with Ross, in particular over some failed trade negotiations, the 81-year-old commerce secretary has so far kept his job.

Since late last year other media outlets have reported at different times that Trump, whose administration has been characterized by high turnover in top posts, was considering replacing Ross.

Mnuchin told reporters that Trump remained satisfied with Ross in his role. “I have every reason to think Secretary Ross is doing a good job. I’ve never heard anything otherwise,” Mnuchin said.

The Commerce Department said in a statement Monday that Ross was currently overseeing the department’s response to Hurricane Barry and noted that he had joined Trump on his trip to Wisconsin and Ohio on Friday.

Ross “will continue to work on behalf of the American people and the President’s America First agenda,” the department said.

However, NBC reported early Monday that Trump has been making calls to “allies outside the White House about replacing Ross.”

The White House declined to comment on Monday. Trump is set to have a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.

On Friday, Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta resigned amid fresh scrutiny of his handling of a sex abuse case when he was a federal prosecutor in Florida more than a decade ago. Trump, who had supported the labor secretary amid calls for him to resign, said it was Acosta’s decision to step down.

Late on Friday, Trump said he disagreed with the findings of a Commerce Department investigation that found uranium imports threaten to impair U.S. national security and instead ordered a 90-day review by federal agencies, saying “a fuller analysis of national security considerations with respect to the entire nuclear fuel supply chain is necessary.”"
Treasury Department bureaucrats risk jumpstarting Islamic State resurgence,https://thehill.com,[],07-18-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/453525-treasury-department-bureaucrats-risk-jumpstarting-islamic-state,"It has now been 21 months since Kurdish forces, backed by U.S. Special Forces and U.S. air support, moved into Raqqa, the capital of the Islamic State. Earlier this month, I spoke at a Rojava Centre for Strategic Studies conference in Amudeh, Syria, exploring the Islamic State’s enablers, after which I had the opportunity to visit Raqqa as the local administration’s guest.

To enter Raqqa is to be overwhelmed by destruction. Thousands of former residents remain in tents at a camp alongside the road outside Ayn Issa. Most would like to return to their homes just 45 minutes’ drive away, but Raqqa remains largely destroyed. Driving into town requires passing the shells of apartment buildings stretching miles. Local authorities have given a face lift to Naim Square, where the Islamic State executed prisoners and mounted their heads, and rebranded it Freedom Square. The buildings facing the square, however, remain bombed out.

There are signs of life in the center of town: wedding dresses, children’s toys, and sweets sold in shops surrounded by rubble.

Unexploded ordnance slows recovery, as workers clear rubble by hand, and tempers are short. The biggest obstacle to Raqqa’s recovery, however, lies in Washington rather than Syria: The U.S. Treasury Department has been sitting on the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) waiver for the Syrian Democratic Council for four years.

Opposition groups in Syria can be an alphabet soup of acronyms but, in short, the Syrian Democratic Council is the umbrella organization for pro-American Syrian Kurdish militias like the People’s Protection Units (YPG), the all-female Women’s Protection Units (YPJ), and the Syrian Democratic Forces.

When I first visited northeastern Syria in January 2014, U.S. diplomats had refused to talk to the Syrian Kurdish opposition out of deference to Turkey. The United States reconsidered its position due to both Kurds’ effectiveness against the Islamic State and Turkey’s double-dealing on terrorism. The United States began talking to the Syrian Democratic Council (SDC), the political wing of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), in December 2015, and almost immediately, the SDC applied for a U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) waiver so that they could hire American companies to participate in reconstruction and so that they could spend their own money in the United States. The SDC does not ask for handouts: one of the biggest differences between my most recent trip and my first is that the oil derricks between Qamishli and the Tigris River are now operating but absent a waiver, the SDC cannot legally spend money in the United States or elsewhere.

It is unclear whether inertia or a misguided strategy motivates OFAC to sit for years on the pending SDC waiver: The group is pro-Western and cooperates closely with Washington. The Treasury Department previously granted the Syrian National Council, the political arm of the Free Syrian Army, a waiver even though extremists and terrorists have infiltrated the Free Syrian Army. In contrast, U.S. military members in Syria trust the SDF more than local partners in Iraq or Afghanistan; there has not been a single instance of SDF men or women turning on American mentors.

The Treasury Department’s inaction not only handicaps diplomacy but also undercuts U.S. strategy.

Isolating Syrian President Bashar al-Assad remains a core U.S. interest. The Kurds dislike Assad: He voided citizenship papers Kurds need for school and employment, and imprisoned Kurdish activists. However, given Turkey’s support for Islamist radicals and its anti-Kurdish ethnic cleaning in areas of Syria the Turkish army occupies, Syrian Kurds fear Turkey more. Simply put, Treasury’s failure is pushing pro-American Kurds back toward Assad.

Numerous diplomats castigate the Iraqi government for its failure to reconstruct Mosul after it was damaged first by Islamic State conquest and then its liberation. Diplomats fear frustration could fuel Islamic State resurgence. The same is now true with Raqqa, where frustration is palpable. The only difference is that if Raqqa erupts, the blame will not be on a foreign government, but on the glacial pace of the U.S. government’s own bureaucracy.
