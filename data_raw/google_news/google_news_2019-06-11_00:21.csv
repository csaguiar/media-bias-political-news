Trump Comments on Antitrust Investigation of Big Tech Fail to Conceal True Motive of Pure Revenge,https://gizmodo.com,"['Matt Novak', 'About The Author', ""Matt Novak Is The Editor Of Gizmodo'S Paleofuture Blog""]",,,,https://gizmodo.com/trump-comments-on-antitrust-investigation-of-big-tech-f-1835372123,"Photo: Getty Images

President Donald Trump suggested this morning that Attorney General Bill Barr might go after the big tech companies, seeming to confirm rumors that the U.S. Justice Department would soon launch an onslaught against Silicon Valley. The DOJ is reportedly thinking about an antitrust investigation of Google but Trump’s comments today hint that “antitrust” might be a smokescreen for other motives.



Trump spent his morning talking to CNBC’s TV show “Squawk Box” live by phone and said that while the European Union, which the U.S. president called “a fantastic group of negotiators,” is pursuing antitrust action against the big tech companies, his approach might be different.

“The European Union is suing them all the time. We’re going to maybe look at it differently. We have a great Attorney General. We’re going to look at it differently,” Trump said, repeating himself as he often does because his brain is basically just mashed potatoes at this point.

“But when they give European Union 7 billion dollars, and 5 billion and 2 billion,” Trump said trailing off and just naming numbers without context. “And Apple gets sued for $10 billion, and you know, that’s right now it’s going on but they’ll end up settling...”

Trump also said that the EU doesn’t actually care about antitrust laws and viewed the legal actions against companies like Facebook and Google as a pure money-making endeavor. The president also seemed conflicted about whether the EU should be punishing American companies, briefly sounding territorial and defensive, like a mobster who doesn’t like outside interlopers muscling in on his turf.

“They get all this money, well, we should be doing it. They’re our companies. So they’re actually attacking our companies, but we should be doing what they’re doing,” Trump rambled down the phone like a dementia patient who happens to be the leader of the free world.

“They think there’s a monopoly but I’m not sure that they think that, they just figure this is easy money: ‘We’ll sue Apple for $7 billion and we’ll make a settlement or win the case.’ So I think it is a bad situation but obviously, there is something going on in terms of monopoly.”

Trump frequently reveals his true motives when he talks like this, first by stating his true feelings, “this is easy money,” before remembering that he has to use the cover story, “there is something going on in terms of monopoly.”

What could the real reason be for Trump pursuing a case against Big Tech? Trump has previously railed against American tech giants for being “biased” against conservatives and recently called for a boycott of AT&T because the company owns CNN. Trump’s attacks on CNN are solely based on the fact that the news network will report on Trump’s various crimes against humanity without the rosy shine that viewers might see on Fox News.

But it’s not just AT&T and CNN that find themselves as objects of the president’s wrath. Trump has accused Google of rigging search results against him.

“Google search results for ‘Trump News’ shows only the viewing/reporting of Fake New Media,” Trump in August of 2018. “In other words, they have it RIGGED, for me & others, so that almost all stories & news is BAD. Fake CNN is prominent.”

And more recently, Trump has criticized Facebook for treating right-wing commentators like Diamond & Silk poorly, at least according to the president.

“I am continuing to monitor the censorship of AMERICAN CITIZENS on social media platforms. This is the United States of America — and we have what’s known as FREEDOM OF SPEECH! We are monitoring and watching, closely!!” Trump tweeted on May 3.

The clip of Trump from CNBC is available on YouTube, for anyone who wants to hear Trump ramble on in his own words.

But Trump isn’t the only one going after the Big Tech companies these days. Democratic presidential contender, Senator Elizabeth Warren, has argued that the big tech companies like Google and Facebook should be broken up.

The House Judiciary Committee, which is currently controlled by Democrats, is also launching its own investigation into the monopoly position of Silicon Valley’s most profitable companies. Those hearings start tomorrow at 2 pm ET.

Breaking up the biggest tech companies is probably a good idea. But if you’re Google or Facebook, this morning’s Grandpa Word Slurry may have been sent directly from heaven. We all just heard the president hint that he doesn’t actually care about antitrust violations and that his real motive for going after Big Tech is something else, perhaps perceived “bias” against Republicans. Needless to say, companies like Google just got a great big piece of evidence for their defense."
Trump accuses the Fed of making a 'big mistake' with its interest rate hikes,https://www.politico.com,['Caitlin Oprysko'],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/10/trump-federal-reserve-interest-rate-hikes-1358816,"President Donald Trump has repeatedly voiced his opinions on what actions he believed the Fed should take, publicly chastising Chairman Jay Powell for raising interest rates until Powell backed off late last year. | Charles McQuillan/Getty Images Finance & Tax Trump accuses the Fed of making a 'big mistake' with its interest rate hikes

President Donald Trump ripped into the Federal Reserve Monday, accusing the central bank of making a “big mistake” with its interest rate hikes while suggesting that current Fed policy was undermining him in negotiations with China.

In an interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” Trump tried to shift blame from his administration for the actions of the Federal Reserve Board, and said that whatever the reason for their decision not to go forward with expected rate hikes, it wasn’t because they were heeding his advice.

Story Continued Below

“We have people on the Fed that really weren’t — they’re not my people, but they certainly didn’t listen to me because they made a big mistake. They raised interest rates far too fast,” Trump said, despite having appointed four of the five current members of the board. He has vowed to only install new members of the board who support rate cuts, but his last two picks withdrew from consideration after backlash from Congress.

In what seemed to be an effort to underscore his comments, Trump tweeted out a clip of them shortly after his appearance ended.

Trump has repeatedly voiced his opinions on what actions he believed the Fed should take, publicly chastising Chairman Jay Powell for raising interest rates until Powell backed off late last year. This year, Trump has urged Powell to cut interest rates, a move that some Fed watchers now say is more likely because of the president’s erratic trade moves. He’s also pressed Powell to resume quantitative easing, a bond-buying program launched by the Fed in 2008 in the wake of the financial crisis to stop the collapse of the housing market and increase the supply of money in the economy. Trump argued for that again Monday.

He also bemoaned current monetary policy for how it factored into his trade negotiations with China, saying that the communist country’s currency devaluation had “put them at a tremendous competitive advantage.”

“We don’t have that advantage because we have a Fed that doesn’t lower interest rates,” Trump lamented. “We have a Fed that raises interest rates the day before a bond issue goes out. So we have to pay more money. You tell me about that thinking, OK?”

Despite Trump’s assertion that the U.S. “should be entitled to have a fair playing field,” which he said was not currently the case “because our Fed is very disruptive to us,” he argued that “even without a fair playing field, we’re winning.”

“I’m winning, but I’m not winning on a level table,” he continued, contrasting the independence of the Fed with China’s central bank. “If I had a table — don’t forget the head of the Fed in China is President Xi — the president of China. He’s also the head of the Fed, he can do whatever he wants.”

A Republican Explains Why Clinton Was Guilty and Trump Is Not,https://www.theatlantic.com,['Russell Berman'],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/06/impeachment-trump-chabot/591340/,"Chabot: Certainly I think anybody who reads the report is going to see that there were things that he or anyone could have done differently. But we weren’t in that same situation that he was. And the issue comes down to, did he obstruct justice? And the attorney general determined that he did not. Or at least there was, you know, insufficient grounds to prove it or make a case that he did.

Berman: You read the report yourself. You read the descriptions of the actions that Mueller acknowledged could be construed as obstruction of justice, and you’ve served on the Judiciary Committee for a long time. Did you personally see obstruction in those actions? Or did you see appropriate actions by the president?

Chabot: I did not see obstruction of justice myself. I’ll just leave it there.

Berman: Was there anything in that section that concerned you, whether it was the president asking the FBI director to let go of the Michael Flynn investigation or telling [White House Counsel] Don McGahn to fire Robert Mueller repeatedly? Did any of those things concern you? Do you think that was the right thing for the president to do?

Chabot: I think when you study almost anybody as closely and with such a fine-tooth comb as the president was studied, you’re always going to find instances where a person’s judgment can be second-guessed. But that’s not the standard we use to determine whether we ought to impeach a president or not. It’s whether he committed high crimes and misdemeanors. And I think there’s no evidence that that’s the case, or that you could ever prove a case of that nature.

Berman: You’re obviously just one of two Republicans who are on the committee who were around for the last impeachment of a president. Do you regret that vote, or do you think that Clinton committed impeachable offenses in lying about his sexual activity, and do you stand by that?

Chabot: I do stand by it. I think he did commit an impeachable offense—that’s why I voted that way. And there are a lot of differences. President Clinton put his hand on the Bible, swore to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. And then he lied. He perjured himself. And we had hundreds of people at the time that were in jail around the country for that very thing, and so I think perjury is a high crime and misdemeanor. And that’s why I voted that way. And we had the Starr report, which was somewhat similar to the Mueller report, and there were 11 grounds on which he recommended that we move forward on impeachment. Trump didn’t perjure himself. He was never under oath. And also Mueller did not recommend that there was an impeachable offense. So both things.

Berman: If Mueller had made a decision on obstruction—if he had concluded that Trump committed a crime, even if he couldn’t charge him while in office—or if he had made a more explicit impeachment referral to Congress, would that have weighed on you?"
Trump’s Russia Ambassador Wants to Come Home,https://www.theatlantic.com,['Mckay Coppins'],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/06/huntsman-russia-utah/591247/,"Read: How the U.S.-Russian relationship went bad

The ambassador’s tenure in Moscow has been a tumultuous one. Hundreds of American diplomats have been expelled from the country amid growing tensions over Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. And during a now-infamous summit in Helsinki last year, Trump drew global outrage after appearing to side with Russian President Vladimir Putin over U.S. intelligence agencies on the question of election tampering.

In the aftermath of the summit, many called on Huntsman to resign his post. Even The Salt Lake Tribune—a newspaper owned by his brother—ran a column making the case. “Ambassador Huntsman, you work for a pawn, not a president,” the columnist Robert Gehrke wrote. “It’s time to come home.” (After the column drew national media attention, the paper published a house editorial arguing that Huntsman “should stay put.”)

Ultimately, Huntsman chose to remain in the embassy and keep his head down, casting his service as an act of patriotic duty rather than loyalty to Trump. In an interview last year with the Deseret News, he said his sons, who serve in the Navy, “don’t have the luxury of saying, ‘Well, what party is our president and do I agree or disagree, and then I’ll decide whether to deploy.’ That’s not the way we operate. We salute those who are duly elected and try to do our best to serve. It’s pretty simple.”

But people close to Huntsman say he has come to miss the governor’s mansion—and the autonomy that comes with it. As an ambassador, every consequential move must be made in coordination with the White House and the State Department. A governorship—especially in a state, like Utah, that’s dominated by a single party—is different. “It’s the one job in the United States where you actually get to make decisions,” said a former Huntsman adviser.

This wouldn’t be the first time Huntsman left a diplomatic job to run for office. Back in 2010, I interviewed him while he was serving as ambassador to China under former President Barack Obama. Huntsman was in the States for the holidays, and we spoke in the sparsely furnished Washington, D.C., home he’d recently bought with his wife, prompting speculation about his political future. The notion that he would run for president in 2012 seemed far-fetched at the time. But when I asked him about it, he replied with a calculated coyness: “I think we may have one final run left in our bones.” Within a few months, he had resigned and announced his candidacy.

The resulting presidential campaign was short-lived, and Huntsman has made clear to friends that he has no interest in running for the office again. But he’s been heard using the same “one final run” phrase more recently when asked about the gubernatorial race.

Some Utah political observers are skeptical that Huntsman will actually choose to run when the time comes. And even those close to him stress that any number of outside factors could change his thinking in the coming months. Last year, he acknowledged that he’d been diagnosed with skin cancer. (“It’s just Stage 1,” he told the Deseret News. “So we’ll probably get it taken care of, and we’ll be fine.”)"
The intriguing stones Robert Mueller left unturned on Trump,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Aaron Blake', 'Senior Political Reporter', 'Writing For The Fix', 'June At Pm']",06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/06/10/intriguing-stones-robert-mueller-left-unturned-trump/,"Perhaps the most consequential decision that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III included in his 400-plus-page report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election was that it wasn’t his place to decide whether Donald Trump obstructed justice.

But as we continue to learn in the weeks since the report dropped, intriguing stones were left unturned in other areas.

The release of a voice mail from Trump lawyer John Dowd to a lawyer for former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn has reignited questions about how far Mueller did and didn’t go in his investigation. In the voice mail, Dowd probes Flynn’s counsel for tips about what Flynn might share with Mueller’s team after cutting a deal. Dowd also alludes to Trump’s warm feelings about Flynn — which, when heard in the actual audio, carries clear overtones of a potential pardon.

Elsewhere in the voice mail, Dowd tells Flynn lawyer Robert Kelner that if anything Flynn says “implicates the president, then we’ve got a national security issue, or . . . some issue . . . not only for the president but for the country.” He adds that, even if Flynn’s team can’t share anything, “remember what we’ve always said about the president and his feelings toward Flynn, and that still remains.”

As Michael S. Schmidt and Charlie Savage analyzed this weekend for the New York Times, the voice mail would seem to present a compelling avenue of inquiry for Mueller — especially if it delivered a message that Trump himself authorized. The voice mail could have figured into the obstruction investigation, and some have argued that it sounds a lot like witness tampering. It’s somewhat similar to other potentially obstructive episodes Mueller detailed in depth — most notably, Trump’s conduct toward former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, which included publicly leaving open the possibility of a pardon.

Mueller’s report says his team did not interview Dowd “because of attorney-client privilege issues.” As some legal experts have noted, though, that privilege doesn’t extend to illegal conduct. So if Mueller believed this voice mail might be part of illegal acts, he could have fought to get the interview.

But this isn’t the only interview he could have sought that seemed to have some bearing on questionable — and potentially illegal — conduct. There is, of course, the big one: an interview with Trump himself. Despite obstruction charges requiring evidence that the alleged perpetrator intended to obstruct legal proceedings, Mueller relied only on written answers from Trump and other evidence to establish his frame of mind. His report indicates that, even though he regarded Trump’s written responses as “inadequate,” he decided that a protracted subpoena fight over an interview with Trump would have delayed the report too long.

Mueller didn’t interview Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., either, even though Trump Jr. organized a Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer pitching dirt about Hillary Clinton. Mueller said that he considered charges against Trump Jr. but that he didn’t believe the government could prove he acted “willfully.” An interview with him probably would have shed some light on that topic. The Mueller report says Trump Jr. declined to be interviewed, but again, Mueller could have fought for the interview.

Mueller’s report also doesn’t dwell upon several other key elements here. It devotes little space, for example, to questions about the president’s finances, including his business ties to Russia or other foreign governments — a hole Democrats have said they intend to fill in the course of their investigations. The omission is particularly striking given reporting that suggested Mueller was probing these areas, crossing Trump’s self-declared “red line” in the process.

Nor did the report delve far into key allegations made in the much-discussed “Steele dossier.” For example, it only briefly mentions the dossier’s claim that Michael Cohen, a former Trump lawyer, traveled to Prague to strategize with Russians in the summer of 2016. And rather than lay out evidence, it merely states that Cohen himself denied it, without indicating whether that claim stood up to scrutiny.

“Why didn’t Mueller finish?” Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) said last month, according to the Bulwark website. “There’s great controversy around the Steele dossier, and, I mean, I think it was glancingly mentioned at best. And I’d like to know. They had a lot more resources than we — I think that’s an important issue for the American people.”

Conducting an inquiry of the size and scope of Mueller’s and then summarizing all of it, even at more than 400 pages, is liable to leave plenty of people disappointed about what was not investigated or said. But these exclusions are certainly some of the more conspicuous ones, and they suggest, at the least, that Mueller wasn’t some prosecutor hellbent on taking Trump down at whatever cost, as Trump has argued.

They also suggest that there is still plenty more that we don’t know — and may never know."
Homeland Security watchdog retires early after his office was forced to retract ‘feel-good’ audits of disaster response,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Lisa Rein', 'Reporter Covering Federal Agencies', 'The Management Of Government In The Trump Administration', 'Kimberly Kindy', 'National Investigative Reporter', 'June At Pm']",06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/homeland-security-watchdog-retires-early-after-his-office-was-forced-to-retract-feel-good-audits-of-disaster-response/2019/06/10/a370f488-8b9d-11e9-b08e-cfd89bd36d4e_story.html,"A house on Staten Island that was heavily damaged during Hurricane Sandy, shown in 2012. (Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images)

John V. Kelly, the acting inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security, announced his retirement Monday following revelations that he directed his staff to whitewash audits of the agency’s performance after federal disasters.

Kelly, 64, a career auditor who rose to the top job in 2017, announced his retirement in a brief email Monday morning to hundreds of DHS employees and contractors.

“It has been an honor and privilege to serve the American citizens for over 40 years,” he wrote. “However, it is time for me to retire.”

Kelly, who had planned to retire after the confirmation of President Trump’s nominee for the position, wrote in an email to The Washington Post that he “accelerated my retirement because I feel it’s in the best interest of the organization and its employees.”

“As I told the staff, I have truly enjoyed my 11-year tenure with the DHS OIG, an organization with a very important mission and extraordinary staff and managers that successfully execute that mission on a daily basis,” Kelly wrote. “Nobody in DHS leadership or any member of Congress asked me retire.”

Kelly’s announcement follows The Post’s report last week that an internal review found that Kelly overrode auditors who had found problems with the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s response to various disasters.

When teams of auditors flew to local communities to assess how well FEMA was helping residents recover, Kelly — then in charge of the emergency management auditing staff — directed them to ignore most problems, according to the internal review and interviews. Instead, he told them to produce what the staff dubbed “feel-good reports.”

[How the DHS watchdog whitewashed audits of FEMA’s disaster response]

The practice was repeated over five years after hurricanes, floods, wildfires and other disasters, including Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and catastrophic flooding in Louisiana in 2016, the review found.

Under pressure from House Republicans, the inspector general’s office retracted 13 faulty reports and purged them from its website in 2017 and 2018. Officials acknowledged they did not comply with federal auditing standards.

The inspector general’s office then spent 14 months examining what occurred. Kelly was recused from the review.

Investigators found that Kelly had praised FEMA’s work ethic to his auditors, telling them they would see “FEMA at her best” and instructing supervisors to emphasize what the agency had done right in its disaster response

Kelly joined the inspector general’s office in 2008 from the Government Accountability Office, where his long career covered performance and financial audits and program evaluations at numerous federal agencies.

A graduate of the University of Scranton, he quickly rose through the ranks in the DHS inspector general’s office, which provides independent, fact-driven audits and investigations of the performance of the sprawling agency.

The flawed audits on his watch represented a tiny fraction of the watchdog’s oversight of FEMA. The internal review did not find that Kelly was influenced by a personal relationship with anyone at the emergency response agency.

However, Jennifer Costello, the deputy inspector general, told the head of the internal review team that the “retraction of publicly issued reports because they are not reliable” was “not an insignificant matter.”

The reports, Costello wrote, “represent millions of wasted taxpayer dollars and understandably cast doubt on our credibility.” She said the inspector general’s office needs to hold itself to “the same standards to which we hold the Department when conducting oversight of its programs and operation.”

When the internal review was made public on May 23, Kelly sent his staff an email of apology, writing, “I take responsibility for failing to set a tone that all of our products need to be fully objective.”

The office has agreed to an outside review of its performance by another federal inspector general’s office to ensure that it has improved its overall operations and oversight of FEMA.

Trump this spring nominated Joseph V. Cuffari, a policy adviser to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R), to lead the office. His nomination has not yet been voted on by the Senate.

Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, said that the situation underscored the need for Cuffari to be promptly confirmed. “Ensuring a department has an independent inspector general is vital to maintaining transparency and holding government agencies accountable,” Johnson said in a statement."
DOJ investigating 'non-governmental organizations and individuals' as part of 'broad' probe into surveillance abuses,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/durham-investigating-non-governmental-organizations-and-individuals-potentially-including-fusion-gps,"As part of its ongoing ""multifaceted"" and ""broad"" review into potential misconduct by U.S. intelligence agencies during the 2016 presidential campaign, the Justice Department revealed Monday it is also investigating the activities of several ""non-governmental organizations and individuals.""

Additionally, the DOJ announced that the probe, let by Connecticut U.S. Attorney John Durham, was looking into the involvement of ""foreign intelligence services."" Former Trump aide George Papadopoulos told Fox News last month that an informant who was likely ""CIA and affiliated with Turkish intel"" had posed as a Cambridge University research assistant in September 2016 and tried to ""seduce him"" to obtain information linking the Trump team to Russia.

The information was contained in a letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., who had inquired as to the scope of Durham's investigation. The letter could indicate that the DOJ is looking closely at work done during the campaign by Fusion GPS, the firm retained by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee (DNC) to conduct opposition research against the Trump campaign.

Fusion GPS, in turn, hired British ex-spy Christopher Steele to produce an unverified and largely discredited dossier that the FBI went on to cite in secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court applications to surveil former Trump aide Carter Page.

CARTER PAGE: FBI INFORMANT 'INTENSIFIED' COMMUNICATIONS JUST BEFORE FISA WARRANT OBTAINED

Last week, reports indicated Steele had agreed to talk with Durham if certain preconditions were met. Multiple sources familiar with the matter told Fox News, meanwhile, that Durham is “very dialed in” and “asking all the right questions."" Separately, sources within the Justice Department confirmed to Fox News that Barr has met “on multiple occasions in recent weeks” with Durham in Washington, D.C.

Numerous problems with the Steele dossier's reliability have surfaced, including several issues that were brought to the FBI's attention before it cited the dossier in its FISA application and subsequent renewals. Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report made plain, for example, that then-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen did not travel to Prague to conspire with Russian hackers seeking to access Democrat files, as the dossier alleged.

Mueller also was unable to substantiate the dossier's claims that Page had received a large payment relating to the sale of a share of Rosneft, a Russian oil giant.

FMR TRUMP AIDE ALLEGES BOMBSHELL INFORMANT TRIED TO 'SEDUCE' HIM IN 'BIZARRE' EPISODE FOR RUSSIA DIRT ON TRUMP

North Carolina GOP Rep. Mark Meadows told Fox News on Sunday he has seen ""additional documents"" that demonstrate that “prior to the first FISA application, Peter Strzok, Andy McCabe, and others at the FBI knew that Christopher Steele's dossier was not credible.” Internal FBI text messages obtained by Fox News in March showed FBI brass scrambling to respond to a concern from a senior DOJ official about the potential ""bias"" of a key FISA source.

Meadows, speaking to ""Fox News Sunday,"" pointed specifically to a report from The Hill's John Solomon, who found that Ukrainian businessman Konstantin Kilimnik, a key figure in Mueller's report, was actually a U.S. informant. In his report, Mueller linked Kilimnik to Russian intelligence, and did not mention Kilimnik's secretive ties to the U.S. in the report other court filings -- even as Mueller suggested former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's ties to Kilimnik were nefarious.

""The deeper the dive we take into the Mueller report, we're starting to find out some of the conclusions, and actually some of the facts they put forth in there, are a misrepresentation of what we actually know,"" Meadows said.

Meadows added that he expected DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigation into potential FBI and DOJ surveillance misconduct to come out later than June, when it was originally expected. Meadows said more information has come to light that might necessitate the delay.

Solomon, reporting for the Hill, also recently unearthed a documented conversation Steele had with a State Department contact -- which were relayed to the FBI -- in which Steele claimed the Russians were running a “technical/human operation run out of Moscow targeting the election"" and that ""payments to those recruited are made out of the Russian Consulate in Miami.""

There is no Russian consulate in Miami, a fact the State Department official, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec, emphasized in her notes. Additionally, Steele had suggested his client was ""keen"" to see his information come to light prior to Election Day. Kavalec forwarded her notes to the FBI and other government officials several days before the FISA warrant was issued for Page. Fox News has confirmed The Hill's reporting.

RUSSIAN-BORN UK ACADEMIC SAYS SHE'S BEING USED TO 'SMEAR' MICHAEL FLYNN

Further, in its original FISA application and subequent renewals, the FBI told the FISA court that it ""did not believe"" Steele was the direct source for a Yahoo News article implicating Page in Russian collusion. Instead, the FBI suggested to the court, the September 2016 article by Michael Isikoff was independent corroboration of the dossier.

But London court records show that contrary to the FBI's assessments, Steele briefed Yahoo News and other reporters in the fall of 2016 at the direction of Fusion GPS.

Carter Page has not been charged with any wrongdoing, even though the FBI called him an ""agent of a foreign power"" in its October 2016 FISA application. On Sunday, Page told Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that his actions had been ""completely spun in the fake Mueller"" report to help advance what he characterized as Democrats' ""ridiculous"" goal of impeachment.

DOJ reveals scope of Trump campaign surveillance probe,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Stephen Dinan']",06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jun/10/doj-reveals-scope-trump-campaign-surveillance-prob/,"The Justice Department on Monday gave more details about the review Attorney General William P. Barr has ordered into the government’s surveillance of President Trump’s 2016 campaign, saying there are still too many “open questions” about why it was done.

Assistant Attorney General Stephen E. Boyd avoided saying Mr. Trump was spied upon — forgoing the language Mr. Barr has used — but did say the “U.S. government and others undertook certain intelligence-gathering and investigative steps” toward Mr. Trump’s campaign.

“The purpose of the review is to more fully understand the efficacy and propriety of those steps,” Mr. Boyd said in a letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler.

John Durham, the U.S. attorney whom Mr. Barr tapped the lead the review, will do double-duty, continuing to serve as Connecticut’s top federal prosecutor while also working out of Washington to lead the review team.

Its funding will come from general money available to federal prosecutors at the department, Mr. Boyd said. He did not speculate on the size of the budget nor the length of the probe.

The Justice Department did defend Mr. Trump’s grant of declassification powers to Mr. Barr for purposes of letting the public see what the review generates. Mr. Boyd, in his letter, said the department has already issued a directive to intelligence community agencies to preserve their records and to make their people available to cooperate.

And Mr. Boyd said Mr. Barr will be judicious in his use of the declassification powers Mr. Trump granted him.

Just One Tiny Industry May Emit More Methane Than EPA Had Estimated for All of Them,https://earther.gizmodo.com,"['Yessenia Funes', 'About The Author', 'I Mostly Write About How Environmental Policy', 'Climate Change Intersect With Race', 'Class Though I Occasionally Write About Animals', 'Science', 'Art', 'Too.

People tend to equate methane with cow farts (though their burps are worse), but we may be pointing our fingers in all the wrong places, according to a new study. The production of ammonia for fertilizer may result in up to 100 times more emissions than has been previously estimated for this sector. And that alone is more than what the Environmental Protection Agency estimates all industries emit across the U.S.

The study, published May 28 in the journal Elementa, zooms into the ammonia fertilizer industry because it relies heavily on natural gas to run its production plants. Ammonia is a compound made of nitrogen, which is used across the agriculture sector to fuel the growth of crops. While the ammonia fertilizer industry’s emissions of carbon dioxide are better understood, emissions of methane—which has 25 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide over a century—were a huge question mark. Until now.

The team of authors from Cornell University and the Environmental Defense Fund had two sampling adventures in June 2015 and September 2016 that took them to six ammonia fertilizer plants in the Midwest, including Oklahoma, Kansas, and Iowa. They used their findings to estimate industry-wide emissions throughout the U.S. The team found that the fertilizer industry results in 29 gigagrams of methane emissions a year. The EPA, however, reports this industry emitted only 0.2 gigagrams of methane a year between 2015 and 2016. As for all industries (like waste, chemical, and metals production), the EPA estimates 8 gigagrams, which is still much smaller than this single industry’s.

A worst case scenario—where other plants are consuming more natural gas than the ones analyzed—resulted in methane emissions that reached 139 gigagrams a year. For context, that’s equivalent to the carbon emissions from 669,314 passenger vehicles driven in a year. Or more than the carbon emitted from 3 billion pounds of coal burned. Best case scenario, the emissions are just 2 gigagrams of methane a year, which is still a lot more than what the EPA currently estimates for this industry.

That is pretty wild, but this is an estimate based only on six plants. They make up more than 25 percent of the 23 plants operating in 2016 and are also of varying sizes to represent the different facilities throughout the U.S., so the six are a pretty good sample. But the authors would like to examine more plants to be sure.

The researchers drove downwind from the facilities in a Google Street View car decked out with a killer methane analyzer that recorded the methane levels in the air. That way, the team was able to capture the methane emissions near the facility in the areas where wind was likely to push it. This poses some limitations, though, because not every plant had the best road access. The authors recommend looking at airborne measurements next time, too. The team looked at samples over just a few days in a single month over these two years. Capturing a longer timeline of data could further verify (or disprove!) their analysis.

Methane emissions feel especially relevant these days. The Trump administration has been attempting to roll back methane regulations since President Awful took office. (The Department of Energy actually called natural gas “freedom gas” the other day.) A coalition of states and environmental groups like the Sierra Club pressed a judge Friday to stop Trump from rolling back these protections, reports E&E News.

Methane isn’t just dangerous for our planet because it’s worsening climate change; its emissions are often coupled with particulate matter and other air pollutants that pose threats to the health of communities closest to the facilities where it’s being emitted.

Trump appoints Social Security Administration watchdog to also oversee Interior,https://thehill.com,[],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/447713-trump-appoints-social-security-administration-watchdog-to-also,"President Trump Donald John TrumpHouse panel seeks to block Pentagon funds for border wall Giuliani evokes Joseph McCarthy in criticism of Pelosi Giuliani evokes Joseph McCarthy in criticism of Pelosi MORE has quietly appointed his Social Security Administration (SSA) inspector general to also oversee a much different agency: the Interior Department.

On May 28, Gail Ennis began her second job overseeing the Interior Department’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG), a role she will keep for the foreseeable future, the OIG confirmed to The Hill.

The Trump administration is still awaiting the confirmation of Mark Greenblatt, the former assistant inspector general for investigations at the Commerce Department, to formally head the Interior’s OIG office.

Ennis was sworn into the SSA role just five months ago, her first time serving as an inspector general. Her professional background is in securities litigation, working previously as a partner at the Washington, D.C.-based law firm WilmerHale, where she reportedly earned $2 million a year.

At the SSA, Ennis has most recently led efforts to thwart scam Social Security phone calls, at the Interior department she will oversee investigations into Interior’s newly appointed Secretary David Bernhardt's lobbying ties and two ongoing Justice Department investigations into former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke Ryan Keith ZinkeOvernight Energy: Investigators found Zinke's MAGA socks violated Hatch Act | Major union endorses Green New Deal | Group sues Trump over fishing permits said to endanger sea turtles Overnight Energy: Investigators found Zinke's MAGA socks violated Hatch Act | Major union endorses Green New Deal | Group sues Trump over fishing permits said to endanger sea turtles Federal investigators concluded Ryan Zinke's MAGA socks violated Hatch Act MORE. One of those investigations has reportedly made it to the grand jury.

The appointment of Ennis to Interior was not formally announced by the White House, however, the Interior Department’s website was updated last week to reflect her new position.

Ennis replaces former acting Inspector General Mary Kendall, who retired from the office at the end of May. Kendall oversaw multiple ethics investigations into Zinke, including recommending a number of them to the Justice Department for further investigation. Those investigations reportedly played a heavy factor in Zinke’s decision to leave the administration early this year.

Ennis is the second Trump political appointee whom the administration has attempted to put in the Interior OIG role.

Earlier this year, Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson Benjamin (Ben) Solomon CarsonBen Carson decries 'gotcha' politics: 'Give me a break' Ben Carson decries 'gotcha' politics: 'Give me a break' Trump administration to make it easier for adoption agencies to reject same-sex couples: report MORE announced to staff that Assistant HUD Secretary Suzanne Israel Tufts would replace Kendall. Because Tufts had been previously confirmed by the Senate, she would not have to go through another confirmation process for the role.

However, following backlash to that announcement, the Interior Department later said the announcement was a misunderstanding and Carson reversed the move. Tufts resigned not long after.

“On May 28th, Social Security [Inspector General] Gail S. Ennis started at [Department of Interior] OIG as Acting Inspector General. Continuing with her responsibilities as SSA IG, Ms. Ennis will also lead our organization while Mark Greenblatt’s nomination continues to progress in the Senate,” an OIG spokesperson said in a statement to The Hill.

The White House referred comment to the Interior OIG. The Interior Department did not return a request for comment.

In addition to the ongoing investigations into Interior's current and former secretaries, the OIG is also investigating six high-ranking interior officials for ethics concerns.

Wilmer Hale, the law firm where Ennis previously worked as a partner, lobbies for a number of clients with business before Interior. For example, the law firm represents Twin Metals a Minnesota based mineral mining company that is lobbing to build a hotly debated copper-nickel mine near the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. In May, the Trump administration moved to renew one of the mine's mineral leases, reversing a decision from the Obama administration.

Ennis, who was not a registered lobbyist, said the Interior OIG ethics office is currently reviewing her former clients.

""DOI OIG General Counsel is conducting a thorough ethics review that will ensure that I do not participate in any matter that would create a conflict of interest or an appearance of a conflict of interest,"" Ennis told the Hill in a statement.

Justice Dept. Agrees to Turn Over Key Mueller Evidence to House,https://www.nytimes.com,['Nicholas Fandos'],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/us/politics/mueller-judiciary-committee.html,"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department, after weeks of tense negotiations, has agreed to provide Congress with key evidence collected by Robert S. Mueller III that Democrats believe could shed light on possible obstruction of justice and abuse of power by President Trump.

The precise scope, volume or usefulness of the material was not immediately clear, but the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, said it would include “interview notes, firsthand accounts of misconduct and other critical evidence” collected by Mr. Mueller from the White House and former officials.

The deal appeared to provide a rationale for House Democrats’ choice, announced last week, to back away from threats to hold Attorney General William P. Barr in contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena for the materials in question. Out of an abundance of caution, the House still planned move forward with a Tuesday vote to empower the Judiciary Committee to take Mr. Barr and other noncompliant witnesses to court to fully enforce their subpoenas if necessary.

And another panel, the House Oversight and Reform Committee, is to vote on Wednesday to recommend that the House hold Mr. Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt for defying subpoenas in a different case related to the Trump administration’s addition of a citizenship question on the 2020 census."
VA owes $190 million to disabled veterans improperly charged home loan fees,https://www.foxnews.com,['Robert Gearty'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/va-owes-190-million-to-disabled-veterans-improperly-charged-home-loan-fees,"The Department of Veterans Affairs owes about $189 million to 53,000 disabled veterans who were charged home loan fees they were exempt from having to pay, an investigation has found.

These veterans were charged the fees under the VA’s Home Loan Guaranty Program and now may be entitled to refunds ranging from $5,000 to $20,000, a VA Inspector General audit released Thursday found.

VA loan managers knew disabled vets were being charged the fees improperly since 2014 but never did anything about it, VA IG auditors determined.

“OIG finds it troubling that senior (Veterans Benefits Administration) management was aware that thousands of veterans were potentially owed more than $150 million yet did not take adequate actions to ensure refunds were issued,” the IG report says.

DOZENS OF ATTORNEYS GENERAL ASK BETSY DEVOS TO FORGIVE DISABLED VETS STUDENTS LOANS

The loan managers told the IG they were focused on other priorities, including processing high volumes of applications, USA Today reported.

The report faulted the Veterans Benefits Administration for placing the burden on a disabled vet to submit a claim for a refund.

The VA announced last month that it was notifying veterans when they buy homes through the Home Loan program that they are exempt from the fees if they are disabled or later determined to be disabled, the paper reported.

“Through an internal quality improvement effort, VA has put a plan in place to better inform veterans through key communications when the law allows VA to waive the fee for a veteran,” the announcement quoted VA Secretary Robert Wilkie as saying.

The Veterans Benefits Administration told the IG that it would identify exempt veterans who paid the fees and issue them refunds and that the financial impact to the veterans was minimal over the life of the loan, The Washington Post reported.

Why former Defense Secretary Ash Carter wouldn't work for Trump,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Emily Tillett'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ash-carter-former-defense-secretary-would-not-work-for-trump/,"While he previously swore he would stay outside of politics, former Secretary of Defense Ash Carter says he wouldn't work for President Trump. Carter describes the commander-in-chief and his administration in his new book ""inside the Five-Sided Box: Lessons from a Lifetime of Leadership in the Pentagon"" as ""offensive, racist and divisive.""

""It's not politics, it's personal conduct,"" Carter said on ""CBS This Morning"" on Monday. Carter explained that he used to tell officers and soldiers in the military that they ""needed to behave themselves"" and would have fired an officer for acting as the president has.

""It's not just the president, it's the kind of behavior and personal conduct that you see everywhere in Washington today is not the kind of thing we tolerated in the military. I fired people for doing that and subordinates fired people for doing even less,"" Carter said.

Carter, who first began working for the Department of Defense in 1981, said he would not work under Mr. Trump if asked because he ""wouldn't know how to help him."" The Obama-era Defense chief said Mr. Trump appears to not take the advice of his Cabinet secretaries. That lack of concern for expert opinion is exactly what led Carter's successor, former Secretary of Defense James Mattis, to step down from the post in December, who cited vast differences in viewpoints with Mr. Trump as a sticking point.

""Your first duty as a Cabinet secretary is to serve the president, to help him...I couldn't take a job knowing that what I know and what I brought to the job, I wouldn't be able to apply to helping him,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Carter said the most urgent threats posed to the United States include China, Russia, Iran, North Korea and general terrorism.

""The future is more concerning to me, it's a competitive world,"" he said. ""All five of those are potential opponents are focused on us and we have to deal with all five of them and its a fast-moving world in technology, and so we need to make sure we stay competitive, because being the best, which we are, isn't a birthright, you got to keep earning it.""

He noted, however, that he was ""confident in our plans and capabilities with respect to all five of those today."""
Ken Cuccinelli named acting head of DHS's legal immigration division,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Stephen Dinan']",06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jun/10/ken-cuccinelli-named-acting-head-dhss-legal-immigr/,"Former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli was officially named acting director at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services on Monday, putting him in charge of some of the most important behind-the-scened immigration initiatives of the Trump administration.

Foremost among his tasks will be to speed changes to a major guest-worker program and to finalize the new “public charge” rules, which are designed to push legal immigrants to prove they can be self-sustaining without becoming dependent on public assistance.

Mr. Cuccinelli, in a statement, pronounced himself “honored” to lead the agency.

“USCIS has the extraordinary responsibility to administer and protect the integrity of our nation’s lawful immigration system,” he said. “Our nation has the most generous legal immigration system in the world and we must zealously safeguard its promise for those who lawfully come here.”

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan announced Mr. Cuccinelli’s accession to the USCIS job in a statement Monday — though there could be some legal hurdles.

Since Mr. Cuccinelli has not been in the agency, Mr. McAleenan created a new deputy position at USCIS and placed it first in the line of succession, giving him a path to be the new director.

Democrats said that was a cheap-shot end run that might not hold up to court scrutiny.

“Once again, this president is trying to circumvent Congress and our Constitution by appointing someone as acting head of an agency who would not be confirmed by the Senate to that post and who is grossly unqualified for it,” said House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer.

Mr. Cuccinelli had been under consideration for a job as immigration “czar” at the White House, but instead President Trump deputed him over to Homeland Security as an advisor.

Now he lands in a specific job, taking over for Director Francis Cissna, who had fallen out of favor with the White House for not moving fast enough on what top presidential advisors said were their top priorities.

Democrats saw Mr. Cuccinelli’s appointment as an attempt to undermine the agency.

“Mr. Cuccinelli is an anti-immigrant fringe figure that has no business leading a component that is supposed to administer our nation’s legal immigration system,” said Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, chair of the House Homeland Security Committee.

The Mississippi Democrat predicted Mr. Cuccinelli would be a force for chaos at the agency, undermining its mission.

And he said there’s no chance Mr. Cuccinelli would be confirmed to the position if nominated to it, so it makes no sense to install him as the acting director.

Mr. Thompson didn’t say which Republicans he had in mind as opposing Mr. Cuccinelli, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell earlier this year told reporters he did not want Mr. Trump to select Mr. Cuccinelli.

Mr. Cuccinelli, as head of a conservative activist organization, backed a challenger to Mr. McConnell in his 2014 election, and in 2017 Mr. Cuccinelli signed onto a letter urging Mr. McConnell to give up the leader’s post. “America is too good for you to lead it,” Mr. Cuccinelli and fellow conservatives wrote.

Though USCIS gets less attention than the other two immigration agencies, Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, it is instrumental in the enforcement of immigration laws, deciding on legal immigration applications and some visitor visas.

The agency is under fire from Democrats who say that it has slow-walked legal immigration under Mr. Trump, erecting what activists have labeled an “invisible wall” to prevent migration.

Yet USCIS points to increased processing of citizenship applications and to the border crisis, which has spawned a massive surge in asylum petitions, both of which fall to the agency’s officers to adjudicate.

The White House has been demanding stricter asylum standards out of USCIS, saying it could help cut down on the flow of illegal immigrants if it took a more critical eye of the initial claims migrants make at the U.S.-Mexico border.

“One of the biggest frustrations is the fact that USCIS has not been able to change agency culture about ‘credible fear’ and asylum from the Obama years,” a White House official told reporters two months ago, predicting changes at the agency.

Those comments came as Mr. Trump had ousted Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and acting ICE Director Ronald D. Vitiello, seeking a tougher direction from his leaders.

Mr. Cissna survived the initial culling, but White House officials made clear he was on the hot seat.

"Treasury Secretary Mnuchin says the bond market is telegraphing a Fed rate cut, not a recession",https://www.cnbc.com,['Michael Sheetz'],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/10/mnuchin-bond-market-telegraphing-a-fed-rate-cut-not-a-recession.html,"Investors have been warning that the bond market is indicating a deteriorating economic outlook, but Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin disputed that interpretation in CNBC interview.

Mnuchin believes that falling bond yields, rather than warning of a recession, are indicating that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in the coming months. Bond yields fell to 20-month lows last week after government data showed U.S. job creation slowed more than expected in May.

""I would say that the bond markets are predicting ... a lowering of interest rates,"" Mnuchin said in an interview Sunday on CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia. ""

Mnuchin noted that he did not intend to comment on whether interest rates should be lowered, saying that he wants ""to respect"" the independence of the Federal Reserve. Mnuchin meets weekly with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. On Monday, President Donald Trump told CNBC the Fed made a mistake raising rates in December and is ""very disrputive"" to the economy.

Investor expectations of a June rate cut from the Fed rose last week to 27.5%, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. The market gives July a 79% chance of a Fed rate cut.

Mnuchin said the global economy is now in an environment where ""interest rates are very low around the world,"" which is what investors are ""seeing in the U.S. bond markets."" But the Treasury sees ""no signs of a recession"" in the U.S. economy, Mnuchin said, even as his department is ""somewhat concerned about what we see as a slowdown in Europe, China and other areas of the world.""

""We still see the growth in the U.S. as really quite strong,"" Mnuchin added."

The breakthrough also seems to have defused — at least temporarily — a push by Democrats to punish key administration officials for their refusal to cooperate in the congressional probes.

The House Judiciary Committee last month had voted to hold Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrDemocrats needle Trump with Watergate witness Democrats needle Trump with Watergate witness Barr compares his return to DOJ to D-Day invasion MORE in contempt of Congress for failing to comply with the panel’s subpoena for Mueller's full unredacted report and underlying documents.

But Democrats are now opting to bring to the floor a softer resolution, one that grants the Judiciary panel new legal tools to obtain disputed information and stops short of holding any individuals in criminal contempt.

""Given our conversations with the Department, I will hold the criminal contempt process in abeyance for now,"" Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler Jerrold (Jerry) Lewis NadlerJudiciary Democrat: 'I don't have any difficulty' with Pelosi 'prison' comment Judiciary Democrat: 'I don't have any difficulty' with Pelosi 'prison' comment Who are the House Democrats backing Trump impeachment? MORE (D-N.Y.) said Monday in a statement announcing the deal. ""We have agreed to allow the Department time to demonstrate compliance with this agreement.”

""If the Department proceeds in good faith and we are able to obtain everything that we need,"" he added, ""then there will be no need to take further steps.""

The agreement constitutes a victory for Nadler, who’s come under friendly fire from some Democrats for his handling of the Judiciary panel’s examination of Mueller’s findings, particularly the open question — left unanswered by Mueller in his 448-page report — of whether Trump obstructed justice during the course of the 22-month probe. Nadler is leading the negotiations to have the reluctant Mueller appear publicly before the committee, and some lawmakers are frustrated that the Judiciary chairman hasn’t secured the testimony nearly two months after Mueller’s report was released.

The DOJ’s decision also provides a temporary reprieve for Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiGiuliani evokes Joseph McCarthy in criticism of Pelosi Giuliani evokes Joseph McCarthy in criticism of Pelosi Will Hollywood be coaxed to the political middle? MORE (D-Calif.), who has been under similar pressure to demonstrate progress in the Democrats’ investigations of Trump’s alleged misconduct amid a growing clamor from liberal members of her caucus to adopt a more aggressive approach.

The president earlier this year had vowed to fight “all the subpoenas,” and the White House stonewalling has led dozens of Democrats to endorse the launch of a formal impeachment inquiry — a move Pelosi has long opposed for lack of popular support outside Congress.

Many impeachment supporters have argued that starting the process would lend the Democrats legal advantages to help them obtain the disputed information. The DOJ’s partial compliance with Nadler’s request gives Pelosi ammunition to say her strategy is working — without taking the divisive step toward impeachment.

Republicans also hailed the agreement as a rare show of comity on an issue that has practically been defined by partisan bickering.

Rep. Doug Collins Douglas (Doug) Allen CollinsDemocrats needle Trump with Watergate witness Democrats needle Trump with Watergate witness Top Judiciary Republican: Mueller hearing could violate 'decency and decorum' rules MORE (Ga.), the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said the administration’s “good faith provision ... debunks claims that the White House is stonewalling Congress.”

The Justice Department on Monday said it was “pleased” with the committee’s decision to continue negotiations without pursuing criminal contempt. However, the agency warned it would pull out of the talks if lawmakers move forward with the contempt resolution.

“The Department of Justice remains committed to appropriately accommodating Congress’s legitimate interests related to the special counsel’s Investigation and will continue to do so provided the previously voted-upon resolution does not advance,” DOJ spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said in a statement.

Even as criminal contempt appears to be off the table for now, the House is gearing up for a vote on a different resolution that would authorize Nadler to go to court to obtain the Mueller documents.

While lawmakers have described the resolution, scheduled for a Tuesday vote, as a contempt measure, the text itself doesn’t mention the word contempt.

And legal experts told The Hill that the resolution is not like the criminal contempt one approved by the House Judiciary Committee, where Democrats would have to ask the U.S. attorney for D.C. to pursue a case against the Justice Department to get the documents.

When faced with similar criminal contempt measures out of the House in the past, the U.S. attorney’s office has uniformly rejected the calls for prosecution. That scenario is all but certain to play out again if the House were to move forward with a criminal resolution.

Rather, this resolution would give Nadler the power to go to court for an order requiring the DOJ to hand over the documents he has sought. It also gives other committee chairs the authority to ask the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group — a group of top lawmakers who oversee the House general counsel — for permission to file similar legal actions.

Thomas Spulak, who served as the general counsel for the Democratic-controlled House from 1994 to 1995, said the civil citation serves the same purpose as a contempt resolution in that they both seek to obtain documents and testimony otherwise unavailable to Congress.

But, he said, no one is being held in contempt in this case, unless the DOJ doesn’t comply with an order from a judge to hand over documents.

“We haven’t gotten to contempt yet,” Spulak said.

Tuesday's vote targets both Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn, who have both rejected congressional subpoenas.

And while Pelosi has pointed to Democrats’ legal victories in the Trump investigations as reason to hold back on impeachment, the lack of impeachment proceedings could end up hampering a court battle to get all of the redacted Mueller materials.

Some of the information not included in the public version of the Mueller report is information presented before a grand jury and can’t be released unless a judge decides it fits certain exemptions. One of those exemptions is for the material’s use in an impeachment proceeding.

But with Democratic leadership ruling out that option for now, it’s unlikely at this point that a judge would order the Justice Department to hand over the grand jury information to Congress."

"USDA Report Corn, Soybean Yield Preview",https://www.agriculture.com,[],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.agriculture.com/news/crops/usda-report-yield-preview,"Market attention continues to focus on the potential size of the U.S. corn and soybean crops.

Acreage totals look to remain uncertain for the rest of the year and any adjustments in the next WASDE report may not reflect the changes facing both crops this year.

U.S. average yields appear set to move lower in Tuesday’s WASDE report as severe delays in planting indicate reduced yield potential.

Expectations for the U.S. average corn and soybean yields this year continue to deteriorate over recent weeks, as planting delays dragged on over much of the Corn Belt. In particular, states in the eastern Corn Belt dealt with extreme moisture and massive delays this year.

Yield potential falls for corn planted after the second or third weeks of May, all other conditions equal. Even though progress accelerated last week on drier weather, corn planting after May 25 came in at a higher-than-average percentage.

Based on the USDA’s weekly Crop Progress report, an estimated 51% of the corn acreage in the 18 major corn-producing states went in the ground after May 25, compared with the average of 16.8% from 1986 through 2018. Typically, late-planted acres remain isolated in specific areas of the country. While most of the very late planting this year occurred in eastern corn-producing states, a substantial amount of late-planted acreage occurred in almost every Corn Belt state.

The USDA’s weekly ratings of corn conditions, due out this week in the Crop Conditions report, should provide an initial indication of the 2019 crop. This conditions report is setting up to be one of the worst on record. Data available since 1986 indicate that as of the 23rd week of the year (June 9 this year), an average of 67% of the crop rated in good or excellent condition at the end of the 23rd week (excluding 1995 when ratings were not yet available due to extremely late planting). The five worst years for good and excellent ratings (excluding 1995) were 1992 (42%), 1988 (47%), 1996 (50%), 1990 (52%), and 1993 (57%). Late-planted corn acreage including 1995 came in well-above average in each of these years except for 1992 and 1988.

Crop Yield History

Crop condition ratings usually fall as the growing season progresses. Early season ratings do not supply an unbiased indication of the final U.S. average yield. Even so, the upcoming rating, along with severe planting conditions, should keep yield expectations low. If one includes 1995 with the five years mentioned above with the worst good and excellent ratings, the U.S. average corn yield came in above trend in only 1992 (+11 bushels) and 1990 (+2 bushels). The average yield over all six years totaled 9 bushels below trend. While the upcoming WASDE report may not fade the corn yield very much, an expectation this year for corn yield at or below trend appears reasonable.

Soybean Yield History

Soybean planting lagged well behind average pace this year as well. As of the June 3 Crop Progress report, 39% of the crop in the 18 major soybean producing states was planted. An expectation of substantial planting progress over the next few weeks is in place.

Based on the USDA’s weekly Crop Progress report, an estimated 72% of the soybean acreage in the 18 major soybean-producing states went in the ground after May 25. This amount sits well above the average from 1986 through 2018 of 39.2%. Field trials in Illinois indicate yield losses higher than 10% after May 20 with increasing levels as planting moves into June. Planting after June 10 led to almost a 20% loss expectation for soybean yields.

While this seems drastic, actual national data on soybean yields rarely falls outside a range of 3 bushels from trend (see farmdoc daily article for more details). Due to the later planting of soybeans this year, the first crop condition rating for soybeans looks to be out in the next two weeks depending on the percentage of the crop emerged.

Crop condition ratings for soybeans tend to decline more than corn as the growing season advances. Like corn, early season ratings do not provide a reliable indicator of the final U.S. average yield.

Lower yield expectations for corn and soybeans seem plausible. By factoring in late planting, a conservative yield estimate for corn near 170 bushels per acre, 4.5 bushels below the current USDA projection, appears reasonable. Uncertainty regarding acreage levels for corn will linger, but acreage reduction in the 7 to 12 million acres range produces a corn crop 1.7 to 2.2 billion bushels smaller than currently projected by the USDA.

For soybeans, an average yield of 47.8 bushels, which sits 1.7 bushels lower than the current USDA projection, fits current conditions. If one assumes 2 million additional soybean acres due to switching, soybean production comes in 150 million bushels lower than forecast by the USDA.

The June 11 WASDE report should provide the first indication from USDA about the size of both crops this year. The June 28 Acreage report will be the next major indicator.

Plan to Reclassify Radioactive Nuclear Waste Spurs Anger,https://www.usnews.com,[],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2019-06-10/energy-department-plan-to-reclassify-radioactive-nuclear-waste-spurs-anger,"A welcome sign outside the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, May 10, 2017, in Richland, Wash. (Young Kwak/The Washington Post/Getty Images)

A Department of Energy plan to reclassify some of the country's radioactive waste to lesser threat levels in order to save time and money is angering environmental groups and raising questions among experts.

Last week, the Energy Department put into place its new interpretation for high-level radioactive waste, saying that the updated definition will allow the agency to more easily move less hazardous waste from old nuclear weapons facilities where it has languished without a permanent disposal solution.

The agency's previous classification efforts managed hazardous waste based on how it was produced instead of its radioactivity. For example, the use of uranium fuel in a nuclear reactor produces high-level radioactive waste. Classifications for the waste determine disposal methods, which can vary in things like how deeply such material is buried in the ground or how thick the protective material in which it is encased.

The Energy Department said its past approach cost billions of dollars and led to decades of delays.

""Recognizing this failure, this Administration is proposing a responsible, results-driven solution that will finally open potential avenues for the safe treatment and removal of the lower level waste currently housed in three states,"" the Energy Department's Undersecretary for Science Paul Dabbar said.

By changing the process to allow for some high-level radioactive waste to be categorized as low-level, the agency said it will be able to start moving waste that has been trapped in Energy Department facilities in Washington state, South Carolina and Idaho.

Management of high-level radioactive waste has effectively been at a standstill as Nevada's Yucca Mountain, which houses a deep geological repository storage facility, awaits proper licensing.

Yucca Mountain has suffered from ""technical and political disagreement"" for decades, says Rod Ewing, a professor in nuclear security at Stanford University.

""There's an understandable pressure to do something with at least some of the waste,"" Ewing says.

Under the proposal, waste newly deemed less harmful that is currently housed at Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington state, the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina and the Idaho National Laboratory could be removed for disposal.

But the National Resources Defense Council says reclassifying the waste is akin to the Energy Department giving itself the authority to declare victory and abandon cleanup at these sites.

""The Trump administration is moving to fundamentally alter more than 50 years of national consensus on how the most toxic and radioactive waste in the world is managed and ultimately disposed of,"" Geoff Fettus, a senior attorney at the environmental group, said in a statement. ""No matter what they call it, this waste needs a permanent, well-protected disposal option to guard it for generations to come.""

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said he would not stop state efforts to clean up the Hanford site to a higher standard and challenged the legality of the federal change.

""By taking this action, the administration seeks to cut out state input and move towards disposal options of their choosing, including those already deemed to be unsafe by their own assessments and in violation of the existing legally binding agreement,"" he said. ""We will consider all options to stop this reckless and dangerous action.""

Experts agreed that reclassification is a valid issue for the Energy Department to examine but had questions about the agency's process.

""In principle, it does make sense to try to tie these definitions more closely to hazards,"" says Edwin Lyman, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. However, the agency ""would have to do a much more rigorous job defining their methodology,"" he says.

Determining the class of radioactive waste involves assessments that can be ""highly controversial,"" Ewing says.

The assessment process can allow for some leeway, which ""opens the door for monkey business,"" Lyman says.

The Energy Department paired its announcement with a notice that the agency is starting an environmental impact analysis for an alternative disposal method for low-level radioactive waste at the Savannah River Site.

Tom Clements, the director of non-profit public interest group Savannah River Site Watch, pushed back against the agency's move."
"Barr compares his return to DOJ to D-Day, likens it to trying to 'land without getting shot'",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Sam Dorman', 'Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News. You Can Follow Him On Facebook']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/william-barr-doj-return-d-day-shot,"Attorney General William Barr compared his arrival at the Justice Department to the type of situation soldiers faced before D-Day.

""As we've been watching the coverage of June 6, 1944 D-Day, I had the thought that my arrival this time felt a little bit, I think, like jumping into Sainte-Mère-Église on the morning of June 5, trying to figure out where you could land without getting shot,"" he said at the FBI Academy on Friday.

Thursday marked the 75th anniversary of D-Day, the day when Allied soldiers stormed the beaches of Normandy in an effort to challenge the Nazi stronghold in Northern Europe.

DEMS UNVEIL CONTEMPT RESOLUTION FOR BARR, MCGAHN OVER SUBPOENA SNUB

President Trump spent that day at Normandy, commemorating the sacrifice of American veterans as he faced impeachment calls and investigations from Democrats in Congress.

“To more than one hundred and seventy veterans of the Second World War who join us today – you are among the very greatest Americans who will ever live,"" he said.

While in Normandy, Trump also spoke with Fox News about the Russia investigation and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who resisted impeachment but also reportedly said she wanted to see Trump in ""prison.""

“She’s incapable of doing deals, she’s a nasty, vindictive, horrible person, the Mueller report came out, it was a disaster for them,"" he said of Pelosi.

ADAM SCHIFF CONTINUES ATTACK ON BARR, SAYS AG IS 'SECOND MOST DANGEROUS MAN' IN US

Pelosi, who also visited Normandy, refused to discuss impeachment during an interview on D-Day but has repeatedly criticized the administration, especially the attorney general.

Barr, who also served as AG under former President George W. Bush, returned to the Justice Department as Pelosi's party continued pressing the Russia issue and his department faced intense questioning surrounding the investigation.

From the start, Barr was suspected of bias due to a memo he wrote which said he thought Trump was well within his powers when he fired former FBI Director James Comey -- one of the main issues in suspicions surrounding whether the president obstructed justice.

Since his arrival, Barr has taken actions that prompted both media figures and congressional Democrats to accuse him of shielding the president from warranted scrutiny. Barr has also come under fire for pursuing the president's directive to de-classify intelligence material in order to uncover information related to the Russia probe's origins.

HOUSE DEMS TO VOTE ON HOLDING BARR, MCGAHN IN CONTEMPT, SEEKING TO KEEP MUELLER SPOTLIGHT ALIVE

That prompted an inquiry from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who blasted the AG as unworthy of that title. Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., who also serves on that committee, said that while he was reluctant to impeach Trump, he was ready to pursue that path with both Barr and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.

Democrats seemed poised to at least hold Barr in contempt as his Department refused to comply with House Democrats request for more information surrounding the investigation.

Citing Barr's refusal, House Democrats proposed giving congressional investigators the power to ""“to initiate or intervene in any judicial proceeding before a Federal Court."" Rules Committee Chairman James McGovern, D-Mass., whose committee would take up the resolution, vowed to hold the administration accountable.

“We will not allow this president and his administration to turn a blind eye to the rule of law,"" he said."
"Daily on Defense: HASC chairman lays down his mark, Republicans cry foul, US-Turkey alliance unwinds over F-35, United Technology and Raytheon join forces",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/house-committee-members-deeply-divided-on-presidents-pentagon-budget-request,"OFF THE MARK: House Armed Services Chairman Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., is drawing clear battle lines with President Trump’s proposed defense budget and its Republican backers in Congress with his “Chairman’s Mark” of the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, released early this morning.

The plan proposed by the House committee controlled by Democrats would trim Trump’s $750 billion request to $733 billion, eliminate funding for low-yield nuclear weapons, bar the use of military construction funds for border barriers, prohibit Trump from pulling U.S. troops out of South Korea or send more prisoners to Guantanamo. Nor would it support a separate Space Force, a top priority for the president.

The plan not only conflicts with the administration’s Pentagon proposal but also the Senate version of the NDAA. That plan, passed with little fanfare by the Senate Armed Services Committee last month, enjoyed bipartisan support.

BY THE NUMBERS: Here’s the House FY 2020 proposal:



Department of Defense base: $632.9 billion

Department of Energy base: $22.6 billion

Other defense-related activities: $0.3 billion

Defense topline: $655.9 billion

Overseas contingency operations: $69 billion

Defense topline: $724.9 billion

Authorizations outside of HASC jurisdiction: $8.2 billion

Total defense authorization: $733 billion

For comparison here are the Senate numbers from two weeks ago:



Department of Defense base: $642.5 billion

Department of Energy base: $23.2 billion

Overseas contingency operations: $75.9 billion

Defense topline: $741.5 billion

Other defense: $8.4 billion

Total defense authorization: $750 billion



BORDER RESTRICTIONS: House Democrats, who have been fuming about President’s Trump’s legal use of emergency powers to divert military construction funds for his border wall, want to specifically bar the practice in the future.

The House NDAA includes a blanket prohibition on the use of DoD, military construction or counter-drug funds to build a “wall, fence, or physical barrier” along the southern border. It also specifically denies $7.2 billion in funding that the Trump administration planned to pay back to the construction fund to make up for the money shifted to border barriers this year.

DEEP PARTISAN DIVIDE: The ranking member on the committee, former chairman Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, weighed in with his objections, noting the move away from what he called the traditional “broad bipartisan support” the NDAA usually enjoys. “There are a number of provisions in the bill that meet that standard,” he said. “There are others that are troubling.”

What troubles Thornberry:



The $17 billion cut from Trump’s budget, which he says doesn’t provide the 3%-5% in real growth to continue readiness restoration

No Space Force, despite bipartisan support on the committee

A $1.2 billion cut in military personnel funds, which he says will hurt service members and their families

Nuclear weapons restrictions. “In addition to prohibiting the deployment of new low-yield weapons, the Chairman’s Mark weakens our deterrent posture against Russia and China and defers essential safety upgrades,” Thornberry says.

A $2.3 billion shortfall in disaster relief funds for Offutt and Tyndall Air Force bases and Marine Corps bases at Cherry Point Camp Lejeune.

Guantanamo restrictions he argues “will ultimately lead to the transfer of current detainees to the U.S.”

Too many reports. The NDAA imposes 240 new reporting requirements, a 34% increase over last year.

The differences will ultimately have to be hammered out in a conference committee.

HAPPENING TODAY: Armed Services chairman Adam Smith will have two shots at defending his cuts to Trump’s defense budget today — first at a Defense Writers Group breakfast 9 a.m. on the campus of The George Washington University and then again this afternoon at an event at the Center for Strategic and International Studies at 2 p.m.

Tomorrow, Mac Thornberry will do the Defense Writers Group breakfast at 8 a.m. to present the Republican case for more defense spending and fewer restrictions on the Pentagon.

CAN THIS MARRIAGE BE SAVED? The U.S.-Turkey alliance is being strained to the breaking point over Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s insistence that he should be able to buy both U.S. F-35s and Russian S-400 air defenses.

Friday the U.S. restated its position after learning Turkey had sent personnel to Russia for training on the S-400 system. “The S-400 is incompatible with the F-35,” said Ellen Lord, undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment at Pentagon briefing. “Turkey will not receive the F-35 if Turkey takes delivery of the S-400 system. Thus, we need to begin unwinding Turkey's participation in the F-35 program.”

Lord said Turkey would be disinvited from future program management activities, and she set a deadline of the end of next month for Turkey to capitulate to U.S. demands or be booted from the F-35 program. “If the United States and Turkey cannot reach a mutually agreeable resolution to this issue by July 31, all Turkish F-35 students and instructor pilots currently in the United States will be required to depart the country,” she said. “Turkey will receive no new workshare in the F-35 program. Its current workshare will be transitioned to alternate sources.”

But at the same time, Lord said the U.S. “greatly values,” the “strategic partnership,” with Turkey and is “trying to be respectful,” with the long-time NATO ally. ““None of the steps we are taking are irreversible. If Turkey chooses to forgo delivery of the S-400, we look forward to restoring normal program activity,” she said.

‘A MERGER OF EQUALS’: Raytheon Company and United Technologies Corp announced Sunday they agreed to an all-stock merger that it called “a merger or equals.”

The combined company, which will be named Raytheon Technologies Corporation, will have approximately $74 billion is 2019 sales, which would make it the second-largest defense and aerospace company in the U.S. after Boeing.

“The transaction will create a premier systems provider with advanced technologies to address rapidly growing segments within aerospace and defense,” said a release from the two companies. More on the merger from the Associated Press here.

‘WE’LL DÉMARCHE THEM’: On Friday, acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan called actions of the Russian navy “unsafe and unprofessional,” and said the U.S. would file a formal protest after a Russian destroyer nearly collided with the U.S. guided missile cruiser USS Chancellorsville in international waters in the Philippine Sea.

""We’ll have military-to-military conversations with the Russians, and of course we'll démarche them,” Shanahan said in a brief exchange with reporters at the Pentagon.

The Navy released video Friday of the encounter showing the Russian warship coming within 50 to 100 feet of the American ship, forcing it to reverse its engine to avoid contact with the Russian vessel.

The Navy’s top admiral, John Richardson, chief of naval operations, also released a statement condemning the Russian actions as “irresponsible and reckless.”

""This unwise maneuver, combined with the unsafe maneuvers by the Russian aircraft in the eastern Mediterranean earlier this week, make it clear that these dangerous actions by Russian military forces across the globe do not match what the world expects from a responsible and trustworthy world power,” Richardson said. “The U.S. Navy will not be deterred from supporting the free and open use of the seas and skies where international law clearly allows all to operate.”

55 SYRIAN HOSPITALS BOMBED: The Union of Medical Care and Relief Organization says the Russian-backed air campaign of Syrian leader Bashar Assad against opposition forces in northern Syria has devastated the regions hospital system, causing widespread misery among the civilian population.

“The entire medical system of Northern Hama and Southern Idlib, Syria, is in a state of emergency, with 55 medical facilities shut down after a month of continuous bombing,” said the humanitarian group in a statement. “Since April 28, 25 medical facilities have been bombed, with some hospitals hit by airstrikes on multiple days. “

“In a region of Southern Idlib, only one hospital is left serving a population of over 500,000. The use of phosphorous (incendiary weapons) and barrel bombs in addition to airstrikes has created an apocalyptic landscape for civilians,” the statement continues. “UOSSM staff on the ground in conjunction with local health directorates report 347 civilians have been killed (including at least 75 children), over 1,000 have been injured and 400,000 IDPs displaced by bombardment on civilian areas.”

RECRUITING BY TWITTER: The RAND Corporation is out with a new report that finds while the Army’s @GoArmy’s Twitter feed helps build awareness of Army culture, it’s not so great at convincing young people to join up.

The report, “Social Media and the Army: Implications for Outreach and Recruiting,” analyzes social media and the Army web presence to see if and how potential recruits and others are engaging.

RAND found that GoArmy.com visitors are interested in career information and the site is used more intensively in densely populated areas and in immigrant and ethnic communities.

It called @GoArmy’s Twitter feed “a good source for building awareness of Army culture,” but concluded the platform appears to be less effective at producing recruits.

And it said GoArmy’s Facebook page “has an audience made up of the general public, soldiers, veterans, military families and potential recruits – and has substantial potential for creating a positive image of an Army career for precisely the people who are in a position to influence recruits.”

ARCTIC STRATEGY: The Pentagon has released updated Arctic Strategy in a report sent to Congress last week. The mission statement says the desired end-state for the Arctic is “a secure and stable region in which U.S. national security interests are safeguarded, the U.S. homeland is defended, and nations work cooperatively to address shared challenges.”

The strategy outlines three objectives:



Building Arctic awareness

Enhancing Arctic operations

Strengthening the rules-based order in the Arctic

NO CASUATIES IN NIGER BOMBING: A U.S. military vehicle struck a roadside bomb in Niger while on the way to a training exercise Saturday, but the U.S. Africa Command says all of the soldiers inside survived the attack.

“There are no reported U.S. casualties, however, as a precaution, U.S. service members are being evaluated,” AFRICOM said in a statement.

The U.S. troops were riding in a Mine Resistant Ambush Protected All-Terrain Vehicle when it triggered an improvised explosive device while entering a firing range in the vicinity of Ouallam, Niger.

U.S. forces are in the north-central African country assisting Nigerien troops in their fight against violent extremist groups like Boko Haram.

CADET IDENTIFIED: West Point has identified the cadet killed in last Thursday’s military vehicle accident. ""Cadet Christopher J. Morgan, Class of 2020, died due to injuries sustained from a military vehicle accident in the U.S. Military Academy’s training area,"" the school said in a press release.

Morgan, 22, of West Orange, N.J., was a Law and Legal Studies major and was part of the Army Wrestling Team.

""Cadet Morgan was a valued member of the Corps of Cadets and will be missed by all. The entire community is ensuring that our cadets are being cared for physically, emotionally, and spiritually,” Superintendent Lt. Gen. Darryl Williams said. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the Morgan family.”

U.S. refiner group sues Trump EPA over high-ethanol gasoline,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-ethanol-lawsuit/u-s-refiner-group-sues-trump-epa-over-high-ethanol-gasoline-idUSKCN1TB2HP,"FILE PHOTO: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sign is seen on the podium at EPA headquarters in Washington, U.S., July 11, 2018. REUTERS/Ting Shen

(Reuters) - The main U.S. refining industry association said on Monday it sued to block the Trump administration’s effort to expand sales of higher ethanol blends of gasoline, arguing the move exceeded the administration’s authority.

The legal challenge from the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) association escalated a battle between the oil and corn industries over the nation’s biofuel policy, which requires refiners to blend biofuels like corn-based ethanol into their gasoline, often at great expense.

President Donald Trump had directed the Environmental Protection Agency to lift a summertime ban on the sale of gasoline containing 15 percent ethanol, called E15, in an effort to help farmers suffering from the U.S. trade war with China. The EPA unveiled its rule doing so on May 31.

The summertime E15 ban had been implemented during the Obama administration to reduce smog emissions, but Trump’s EPA said E15’s impact on air quality was similar to that of E10, which could already be sold year-round.

The tension over the policy move reflects how Trump has struggled to please both Big Oil and Big Agriculture, two critical constituencies in the Republican president’s 2020 re-election bid.

AFPM asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to review the EPA’s rule, in papers filed on Monday, said Diana Cronan, a spokeswoman for the group.

AFPM has one month to provide the court with the outline of its case, she said."

U.S. government debt yields rose Monday after President Donald Trump said U.S. tariffs on goods from Mexico would be suspended.

U.S. President Donald Trump announced Sunday that proposed tariffs on Mexican imports would be suspended indefinitely. Trump said in a Twitter post Sunday that he has ""full confidence"" that Mexico will crack down on migration from Central America, after the two neighbors reached a consensus. The New York Times reported Saturday that the deal to avert tariffs largely comprised actions Mexico had already agreed to take.

Meanwhile, investors will be watching trade developments between the U.S. and China ahead of a key meeting between the leaders of the two countries. Speaking to CNBC on Sunday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said President Trump will decide about further Chinese tariffs after he meets his Chinese counterpart later this month."
Carter Page says FBI informant 'intensified' communications just prior to FISA warrant,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Carter Page', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fbi-informant-intensified-communications-just-prior-to-fisa-warrant-carter-page-says,"Former Trump foreign policy aide Carter Page said Sunday that U.S. intelligence informant Stefan Halper ""intensified"" communications with him as the FBI worked to obtain a secret surveillance warrant to monitor Page, shortly after he and Halper met for the first time at a research institute symposium in Cambridge, England, in July 2016.

Page's remarks on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" come as the Justice Department is set to unearth new documents this week concerning the origins of the Russia probe. A DOJ court filing Thursday, meanwhile, provided more details about a crucial period just before Halper allegedly sprang into action to seek more information on future National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.

Within days of a January 2016 Flynn phone call to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak referenced in the court filing, Russian-born U.K. academic Svetlana Lokhova said Halper suddenly contacted her to gain information on Flynn. Asked about the timing, a source familiar with the situation told Fox News that ""nothing is a coincidence"" when it comes to Halper, and that Kislyak was likely under U.S. surveillance.

""I had a longstanding relationship with Professor Halper,"" Page told host Maria Bartiromo. ""I always believe in 'innocent until proven guilty,' but my conversations with him intensified right in the month before my illegitimate FISA warrant in September 2016, when all these defamatory articles are being placed by the [Democratic National Committee].""

COMEY, BRENNAN SURROGATES DISPUTE WHO PUSHED DISCREDITED DOSSIER

Page has sued he DNC and other actors for defamation related to accusations that he was colluding with Russian agents. The FBI, in its Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) application, flatly called Page ""an agent of a foreign power."" Page has not been charged with any wrongdoing despite months of surveillance, and the dossier that the FBI relied upon in its FISA application has largely been discredited as a political document rife with inaccuracies.

In its warrant application, the FBI assured the FISA court on numerous occasions that other sources independently corroborated the dossier's claims but did not clearly state that the dossier's author worked for a firm hired by Hillary Clinton's campaign.

Page continued: ""Professor Halper was being very positive, you know, like a Harriet Tubman figure. He understands sort of the the injustices, or he presented himself as understanding that ...... and I sort of trusted him.""

The FBI formally opened its counterintelligence probe into the Trump campaign July 31, 2016, several days after Page says he first met Halper at the symposium. From 2012 to 2018, the Defense Department paid Halper more than $1 million for consulting work.

During the 2016 presidential campaign, Halper -- now widely reported to be a confidential FBI source -- also reached out to Trump campaign aides including Page, George Papadopoulos and Sam Clovis. (Papadopoulos separately told Fox News in May that in September 2016, a U.S. intelligence informant approached him in London seeking information, and attempted to ""seduce"" him as part of a ""bizarre"" episode."")

FOX NEWS EXCLUSIVE: INTERNAL FBI TEXT MESSAGES REVEAL HIGH-LEVEL DOJ DOUBTS ABOUT KEY FISA SOURCE

Ultimately, Page told Bartiromo, his actions, and those of other Trump campaign officials, were ""completely spun in the fake Mueller"" report to help advance what he characterized as Democrats' ""ridiculous"" goal of impeachment.

""Professor Halper was being very positive, like a Harriet Tubman figure. ... I sort of trusted him."" — Carter Page

""I had a longstanding relationship with the CIA, going back decades, essentially,"" Page said. ""I was always very transparent, open.""

North Carolina GOP Rep. Mark Meadows, also speaking to ""Fox News Sunday,"" backed up Page's assertion. Specifically, Meadows pointed to a report from The Hill's John Solomon, who found that Ukrainian businessman Konstantin Kilimnik, a key figure in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report, was actually a U.S. informant. In his report, Mueller linked Kilimnik to Russian intelligence, and did not mention Kilimnik's secretive ties to the U.S. in the report other court filings -- even as Mueller suggested former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's ties to Kilimnik were nefarious.

""The deeper the dive we take into the Mueller report, we're starting to find out some of the conclusions, and actually some of the facts they put forth in there, are a misrepresentation of what we actually know,"" Meadows said.

Meadows added that he expected DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigation into potential FBI and DOJ surveillance misconduct to come out later than June, when it was originally expected. Meadows said more information has come to light that might necessitate the delay.

Page, for his part, told Bartiromo that he did not recall ever ""crossing paths"" with Kilimnik.

In a separate lawsuit filed last month, Lokhova accused Halper and various news media outlets of conspiring to defame her, by falsely claiming she had inappropriate contact with Flynn to further the narrative that Flynn was compromised by Russia.

The complaint asserted that ""Stefan Halper is a ratf----- and a spy, who embroiled an innocent woman in a conspiracy to undo the 2016 presidential election and topple the President of the United States of America.""

According to the lawsuit, ""On January 12, 2016, [Cambridge Professor Christopher] Andrew emailed Lokhova, and invited her and her partner, David North ('North'), to Andrew’s house to have dinner with Halper and his wife. Two dates in February were offered. Andrew stated that the purpose of the dinner was to discuss the book that Lokhova and he were authoring. Lokhova was perplexed. At no point before this unexpected invitation had Halper expressed any interest in Lokhova’s work.""

The complaint alleges, ""Halper had no interest in Lokhova’s work. Rather, Halper wanted to have dinner with Lokhova to probe her for information relating to Flynn in the hopes that his FBI handlers might find a basis upon which to file an application to conduct surveillance and spy on General Flynn.""

RUSSIAN-BORN UK ACADEMIC SAYS SHE'S BEING USED TO 'SMEAR' FLYNN

Halper has said virtually nothing in public about his role. During a rare interview with BBC Radio 4 Today in May 2017, Halper was asked if the Trump FBI inquiry was of Watergate proportions. He responded that the probe was ""moving in that direction.""

Multiple independent reviews into potential FBI and DOJ misconduct in 2016 are ongoing. John Durham, the Connecticut U.S. attorney assigned by Attorney General Bill Barr to investigate the origins of the Russia probe, is “very dialed in” and “asking all the right questions,” according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.

Separately, sources within the Justice Department confirmed to Fox News last week that Barr has met “on multiple occasions in recent weeks” with Durham, who was in Washington, D.C., this month.

Battle over science roils EPA,https://thehill.com,[],06-09-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/447520-battle-over-science-roils-epa,"Environmental Protection Agency is battling its own board of science advisers over its controversial plan to dismiss certain types of scientific research from consideration when issuing rules.

A meeting this week between the agency and some of the nation’s top scientists highlighted the growing rift between the EPA and the scientific community, with members of the Science Advisory Board (SAB) pushing back on the administration's efforts to bar consideration of studies that don't make their underlying data public.

Critics say the move would omit important research from EPA consideration and lead to a dramatic rollback of existing regulations.

The SAB, a team of more than 40 of the nation’s top scientists, have been asking to weigh in on the controversial proposal since it was unveiled more than a year ago.

On Wednesday, it said it would do so —despite a request from the agency to review a narrow portion of the rule.

There’s mistrust between the scientific community and EPA’s leaders in the Trump administration.

Then-EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott PruittBattle over science roils EPA EPA head accuses reporters, green group of 'colluding' on press coverage EPA head accuses reporters, green group of 'colluding' on press coverage MORE said the proposal, called Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science, would battle “secret science” when it was first introduced. That spurred scientists to call the proposal “censored science.”

EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerBattle over science roils EPA Overnight Energy: Inslee says DNC won't hold climate debate | Democrats fear Trump opening door to mining in Grand Canyon | Interior pick gets surprising support from greens | Ocasio-Cortez says effective climate plan needs T Overnight Energy: Inslee says DNC won't hold climate debate | Democrats fear Trump opening door to mining in Grand Canyon | Interior pick gets surprising support from greens | Ocasio-Cortez says effective climate plan needs T MORE on Wednesday appeared before the board, vowing to improve the relationship between it and the agency.

“I’ll be the first to admit that we have not utilized you in ways that we should. We can and we will do better,” Wheeler said.

But many in the science and environmental community walked away from the meeting disheartened at what they see is the agency’s plan to amplify pet policies and the voices of industry over those from scientists.

“I would say the way that the meeting proceeded kind of contradicted a lot of Administrator Wheeler’s statement at the beginning of the meeting,” said Genna Reed, lead science and policy analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists. “Their discussion showed that EPA has not really involved the Science Advisory Board and gotten their advice on several of the deregulatory actions they’ve proposed.”

Scientists have had a number of concerns over how the Trump administration values science, but things really came to a head when the EPA announced the science transparency rule without first consulting the SAB.

The group didn’t find out about the rule until it was publicly announced — a sign, scientists and environmentalists say, the EPA was not interested in meaningful feedback.

The proposal has since proven to be one of the most controversial EPA has written, prompting 600,000 comments. Critics say the rule will exclude some of the most important research from consideration simply because it does not rely on data that can be shared publicly.

The board sent a letter in May of 2018 with a number of questions and asking to weigh in on the rule but it took almost 11 months before the agency responded in April of this year.

Wheeler apologized for the delay Wednesday, saying it was the result of the agency taking time to rethink how it wants to work with the board going forward.

He asked the board to give its thoughts on how the agency can deal with studies that don’t make their data public because it includes confidential business information or personally identifiable information.

The board bucked that request and instead voted to review the proposal in its entirety.

“I’m wondering if any of the comments the EPA received gave you pause about proceeding with that rule?” asked Barbara Morrissey, chair of a separate EPA panel, the Children’s Health Protection Advisory Committee.

“I agree the confidentiality issue in an important and a thorny one so I’m glad that you referred that to us, but I’m concerned about whether the best available science can be ignored because it can’t be replicated for obvious reasons,” she said, nodding to studies of people who were exposed to harmful chemicals.

Watchers of the board were surprised by the vote given how the makeup of the board has changed under the Trump administration.

Fears that the EPA planned to sideline scientists started under Pruitt when he announced that scientists who receive grants from the EPA would not be allowed to serve on the board—a move that knocked out about half of the members sitting on the Science Advisory Board.

Reed with the Union of Concerned Scientists said there are pretty much two types of grants available to scientists—those from the EPA and those from industry. She didn’t understand why getting an EPA grant would present a conflict of interest when an industry grant wouldn’t.

“People who received these no strings attached grants and are experts on some of the most pressing environmental issues are kept from serving on the board,” she said. “It’s clearly a political maneuver to change the composition of these advisory committees.”

Twenty six of the 45 current board members were appointed during the Trump Administration, a huge amount of turnover in a board that otherwise loses under a fifth of its members each year due to term limits.

“I was pleasantly surprised,” Chris Zarba, who served as the former staff coordinators for SAB until last year, said of the vote to review the entire science transparency rule. It’s not that the Trump administration picks aren’t qualified, he said, but a good board needs diversity.

“Think of it this way. If I was picking a world class football team, and I only picked people that were world class, top-ranked players — if all those people I picked were field goal kickers, I’d never win a game,” he said. “It’s hard to question any single member on the board, and by law the administrator can pick anyone they want and any member that is qualified, but the bigger question is: is the entire team well equipped and accurately representing mainstream science? I think we will see how it turns out...There are certainly picks I wouldn't have recommended to the administrator.”

Robert Phalen is one Trump administration pick that has been questioned by scientists for views of air pollution that are out of line with most mainstream scientists. The University of California Irvine professor told the American Association for the Advancement of Science that “modern air is a little too clean for optimum health.""

Phalen was one of the few at the meeting to vote against reviewing the science transparency rule in its entirety.

“I can see and respect both sides of the debate on transparency,” he told The Hill in an email. “We need to know if the research used for regulations is free of serious errors, and that requires other scientists having access to the data. On the other hand if the data were widely available it could be improperly used, such as for disclosing private information. So both sides have validity.”

Wheeler said the agency will move forward with something, assuring the board that the administrator will always have the power to give an exemption to an important study, even if it can’t disclose all its data.

“I do fundamentally believe the more information we put out to the public as far as what is the basis for our regulatory decisions, the more sound our decision will be and the more easily understood and accepted by the public our decision will be because they see all the science we are using,” he told the board."
US Commerce Department official killed in DC in apparent murder-suicide,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-09-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/us-commerce-department-official-killed-in-dc-in-apparent-murder-suicide,"A U.S. Department of Commerce official was killed Friday in what police have said is a murder-suicide, according to multiple reports.

Lola Gulomova, 45, was found unresponsive inside her northwest Washington, D.C., home after police conducted a welfare check at the house, Fox News reported.

Police said they also found Jason Rieff, 51, Gulomova’s husband, with an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound inside the home.

The couple has two children, who were not at home at the time of the incident, which police said occurred shortly after 9 a.m. Friday.

Gulomova had been employed with the Department of Commerce for more than a decade, having taken diplomatic posts in various locations throughout Asia."
"U.S. embassies still hoisting rainbow flags, despite advisory from Washington",https://www.pressherald.com,['Email Writer'],06-08-2019,2019,6,https://www.pressherald.com/2019/06/08/u-s-embassies-still-hoisting-rainbow-flags-despite-advisory-from-washington/,"Since the State Department began rejecting all embassy requests to hoist rainbow flags outside the mission buildings during Gay Pride Month this year, some U.S. diplomats have been finding ways to defy, or at least get around, the new policy.

The facades of the U.S. missions in Seoul and Chennai, India, are partially hidden behind large rainbow flags, while the embassy in New Delhi is aglow in rainbow colored lights. The website for the embassy in Santiago, Chile, shows a video of the chief diplomat raising a rainbow flag last month for the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia.

The Vienna Embassy’s website features a photo of a rainbow flag flying below Old Glory on a mast jutting from the building, a statement by Diplomats for Equality and a story about a professor lecturing on the visibility and growth of LGBT rights.

U.S. diplomats in Jerusalem joined a March for Pride and Tolerance, and several ambassadors have tweeted photos of themselves in local Pride parades or standing outside the embassies surrounded by employees holding up letters spelling PRIDE.

“This is a category one insurrection,” said one diplomat, who like others interviewed about the sentiment over the rejections, which were not made in writing, spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of being fired.

A practice routinely approved for most of the decade at many embassies now requires top-level approval from the State Department. But this year, as first reported by NBC News, all requests were nixed.

The flap over the flags started when the State Department did not send out an official cable this year with guidelines for marking Pride Month, as it has in years past. In 2011, the Obama administration directed agencies involved with foreign policy to promote LGBT rights, a striking policy for an agency that, up to the early 1990s, considered homosexuality a security risk and cause for termination.

The Obama administration’s Pride Month guidelines included rules for flying rainbow flags from poles outside embassies – they had to be smaller than the American flag and fly beneath it. But permission was granted with no fuss. By 2016, approvals were left up to each ambassador or chief of mission.

That process changed last year, after Mike Pompeo became secretary of state. An evangelical Christian who believes marriage should be defined as between a man and woman, Pompeo has said gay employees will be respected and treated like everyone else. But he has downplayed some symbols of LGBT rights, while introducing several new panels and envoys specializing in religious freedom issues.

The advisory cable that came out last year said diplomats are required to obtain top-level approval from the State Department’s Office of Management to fly a rainbow flag.

The State Department declined to answer questions about the Pride Month advisory and rainbow flag ban. But two diplomats familiar with the events said all requests last year were approved.

This year, there was a shift. Embassies in Israel, Germany, Brazil and Latvia, plus a handful of other posts, asked to fly rainbow flags. All were denied, said a person at the State Department who was familiar with what happened.

Although most embassies seem to be towing the line, the policy shift appears to have sparked something of a revolt among diplomats.

Some embassies that have flown the flag in previous years opted this year to commemorate the month by posting on their websites President Trump’s statement affirming LGBT rights and inviting nations to join a global campaign to decriminalize homosexuality. The initiative was the idea of Richard Grenell, the U.S. ambassador to Germany, who is gay.

Some embassies got playful with the display of Trump’s statement. In Brasilia, for example, the statement is topped by a photo of two hands holding six Play-Doh letters in rainbow colors: LGBTQ. But some did not mention Trump’s statement at all, an absence made more glaring by the juxtaposition with statements by ambassadors and secretaries of states left over from previous years.

Some gay employees in the foreign and civil service say the ban on flying the rainbow flag is just the tip of an iceberg of slights.

Pompeo has not issued a statement for Pride Month, as he did last year. He did not attend the State Department’s annual Pride Day event for two years running as his predecessors usually did, though he was traveling in Europe this year. Instead, he dispatched Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, a veteran diplomat who promised that the State Department will advocate for gay diplomats and their families.

“Day by day, a death by a thousand cuts, our rights as lgbt+ Americans are being eroded with the removal of a guidance here, the rewriting of a policy there, or just the quiet disappearance of a web site,” Robyn McCutcheon, a transgender woman who has served in several posts abroad, wrote in her blog “Transgender at State,” lamenting what she has observed throughout the government in the past two years. “It should come as no surprise that this erosion would happen also at the U.S. Department of State.”

Some acknowledge that their worst fears have not been borne out.

The administration has appointed several gay ambassadors. Trump became the first Republican president to make a statement celebrating Pride Month. No one has been fired for sexual orientation, but some said they have felt more vulnerable after Trump tried to ban transgender people from the military.

Better, they said, to not even discuss LGBT issues publicly and risk the consequences of drawing attention to themselves.

“We fly below the radar,” one employee said. “We survive because they don’t realize we’re here.”

North Myrtle Beach pizzeria violated federal labor laws,https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com,['Jason Lee'],,,,https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/news/local/article231382163.html,"jlee@thesunnews.com

A North Myrtle Beach pizza restaurant paid more than $50,000 in back pay to its employees after a federal investigation found labor law violations.

Benito’s Brick Oven Pizza and Pasta, at 1598 Hwy 17 S., paid $54,355 to 12 employees for violating overtime requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act, according to a news release from the U.S. Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division.

Federal investigators found the restaurant’s owner, Paul Himmelsbach, had set up a separate company, Benito’s Pizza and Meatball Express LLC, to handle deliveries, but it shared the same location as the restaurant, and the two entities shared employees and ownership.

The employer violated labor laws, the release states, because he failed to combine work hours for employees working for both companies when calculating overtime pay.

No one answered a phone call to the restaurant Monday morning, and a voicemail message left for a number listed to Himmelsbach wasn’t immediately returned.

The Benito’s website states the restaurant was originally established in North Myrtle Beach in 1989, and they opened a second location in Cozumel, Mexico in 2016."
Opinion | Don’t Indict Presidents,https://www.nytimes.com,[],06-09-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/09/opinion/letters/president-indictment.html,"To the Editor:

Re “Elizabeth Warren Wants Congress to Ensure Presidents Can Be Indicted” (nytimes.com, May 31 ):

Contrary to Senator Warren’s view, the mere fact that the current occupant of the White House has engaged in deplorable, and perhaps criminal, conduct provides no basis for revoking the Justice Department’s longstanding rule that a sitting president cannot be indicted.

Senator Warren’s desire to use the criminal justice system against a president the Democrats find objectionable is shortsighted: Given our polarized times, if she were to succeed, it would surely not be long before we would see efforts to use the same tool against a Democratic president.

Moreover, the Justice Department policy, which has remained in force through Democratic and Republican administrations alike, is firmly rooted in the constitutional provision establishing impeachment as the course for dealing with presidential misconduct.

Lastly, as a practical matter, it is likely that the Supreme Court rues the day that it naïvely ruled, in Clinton v. Jones, that a sitting president can simultaneously handle his or her constitutional duties and defend against civil litigation. We saw how the Paula Jones litigation consumed President Bill Clinton’s second term, and having to defend against criminal charges would surely hamstring President Trump to a far greater degree."
"Acting DHS secretary praises White House deal with Mexico on immigration, defends Trump's tariff threat",https://www.foxnews.com,"[""Andrew O'Reilly""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/acting-dhs-secretary-praises-white-house-deal-with-mexico-on-immigration-defends-trumps-tariff-threat,"Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan on Sunday praised the recent deal reached by the United States and Mexico to handle the migration situation along the two countries’ shared border, while downplaying the criticism of President Trump for threatening to impose tariffs on the U.S.’ neighbor.

Speaking on “Fox News Sunday,” McAleenan said that while people can disagree with Trump’s tactics, the fact remains that Mexico approached the White House with “real proposals” on how to handle the immigration crisis. “Mexico came to the table with real proposals,” McAleenan said. “We have an agreement that, if they implement, will be effective.”

The agreement — announced late Friday in a tweet by Trump — ended a showdown that business leaders warned would have disastrous economic consequences for both the U.S. and one of its largest trading partners, driving up consumer prices and driving a wedge between the two allies. And it represented a win for members of Trump's own party who had flooded the White House with pleading calls as well as aides who had been eager to convince the president to back down.

PELOSI NEEDS TO ADDRESS 'INVASION' AT BORDER, CONGRESS' INACTION 'SHAMEFUL,' GOP REP SAYS

“I think, just in general, Republicans understand that tariffs are a tax on American consumers,” Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said during a separate interview on “Fox News Sunday.” “And we don't want to see them in place long-term, nor do I believe President Trump does either. He's using tariffs as leverage in trade negotiations and I think he used them as leverage in this situation brilliantly, quite honestly.”

A ""U.S.-Mexico Joint Declaration"" released by the State Department said the U.S. ""will immediately expand the implementation"" of a program that returns asylum-seekers who cross the southern border to Mexico while their claims are adjudicated. Mexico will ""offer jobs, health care and education"" to those people, the agreement stated.

Mexico has also agreed, it said, to take ""unprecedented steps to increase enforcement to curb irregular migration,"" including the deployment of the Mexican National Guard throughout the country, especially on its southern border with Guatemala. And Mexico is taking ""decisive action to dismantle human smuggling and trafficking organizations as well as their illicit financial and transportation networks,"" the State Department said.

Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador tweeted, ""Thanks to the support of all Mexicans, the imposition of tariffs on Mexican products exported to the USA has been avoided."" He called for a gathering to celebrate in Tijuana Saturday.

TRUMP DEFENDS DEAL WITH MEXICO TO STEM MIGRANT FLOWS, PREVENT TARIFFS

The changes, in part, continue steps the Trump administration was already taking. The U.S. announced in December that it would make some asylum seekers wait in Mexico while their cases were being proceeded — a begrudging agreement with Mexico that has taken months to scale and that has been plagued with glitches, including wrong court dates, travel problems and issues with lawyers reaching their clients.

Homeland Security officials have been ramping up slowly, and were already working to spread the program along the border before the latest blowup. About 10,000 people have been returned to Mexico to wait out the processing of their immigration cases since the program began Jan. 29.

More than 100,000 migrants are currently crossing the U.S. border each month, but not everyone claims asylum and migrants can wait an entire year before making a claim.

“We need to change the asylum standard, so that that front bar, where we assign credible fear, is not so automatic, so that 85-95 percent of people get that, while only 10 percent get asylum at the end of a court proceeding,” McAleenan said. “We need to align that more closely with what might actually be a successful claim.”

Trump had announced the tariff plan last week, declaring in a tweet that, on June 10, the U.S. would ""impose a 5 percent Tariff on all goods coming into our Country from Mexico, until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico, and into our Country, STOP."" U.S. officials had laid out steps Mexico could take to prevent the tariffs, but many had doubts that even those steps would be enough to satisfy Trump on illegal immigration, a signature issue of his presidency and one that he sees as crucial to his 2020 re-election campaign.

After returning from Europe Friday, though, Trump tweeted, ""I am pleased to inform you that The United States of America has reached a signed agreement with Mexico."" He wrote that the ""Tariffs scheduled to be implemented by the U.S. on Monday, against Mexico, are hereby indefinitely suspended.""

Trump said Mexico has agreed to work to ""stem the tide of Migration through Mexico, and to our Southern Border"" and said those steps would ""greatly reduce, or eliminate, Illegal Immigration coming from Mexico and into the United States.""

The 5 percent tax on all Mexican goods, which would increase every month up to 25 percent under Trump's plan, would have had enormous economic implications for both countries. Americans bought $378 billion worth of Mexican imports last year, led by cars and auto parts.

Many members of Trump's Republican Party and business allies had urged him to reconsider — or at least postpone actually implementing the tariffs as talks continue — citing the potential harm to American consumers and manufactures.

EPA issues guidance critics say would limit state's authorities over pipeline projects,https://thehill.com,[],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/447782-states-have-shut-down-pipeline-projects-epa-seeks-to-change-that,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a guidance Friday that critics say seeks to limit states’ influence over controversial pipeline projects.

Federal law through the Clean Water Act essentially gives states veto power over large projects that cut through their rivers and streams if they believe those projects would negatively impact their water quality.

Spurred by an

April executive order

“This seems to be another attempt by the Trump Administration to limit states, and by extension local communities, ability to protect their own waterways and to give pipeline developers or other project proponents an ability to skip over one of the steps in the process that had been there to protect local waterways,” said Nathan Matthews, a senior attorney with the Sierra Club, one of the environmental groups weighing action against the EPA.

The Clean Water Act gives states a year to weigh permits and determine how projects would impact their water, but some feel states have used the process to block major projects.

“I welcome this announcement and hope EPA’s new guidance will reduce abuse of the Clean Water Act to block infrastructure needed to provide reliable and affordable energy,” Sen. Lisa Murkowski Lisa Ann MurkowskiOvernight Energy: Lawmaker warns White House not to influence science in climate report | Trump appeals Arctic drilling decision | Officials promote natural gas exports as 'freedom gas' Trump administration appeals ruling that blocked offshore Arctic drilling Senate GOP vows to quickly quash any impeachment charges MORE (R-Alaska) said of the guidance in a press release. “EPA’s updated guidance will maintain vital protections for our water resources while promoting responsible development of our energy resources.”

The EPA said states should not take more time than is reasonable to review permits, encouraging them to “promptly begin evaluating the request to ensure timely action.”



The guidance says the timeline for reviewing the permits begins as soon as they are filed, and states should not wait for an environmental assessment to be completed as that may take longer than the year states are granted. The guidance also notes that the clock doesn’t stop because states have requested more information.



States have recently sidelined two large projects using the certification process through the Clean Water Act, actions that contradict the energy dominance strategy promoted by the Trump administration.

New York denied a certification for the Constitution Pipeline, a 124-mile natural gas pipeline that would have run from Pennsylvania to New York, crossing rivers more than 200 times. Washington state denied certification for the Millennium Coal Terminal, a shipping port for large stocks of coal.

“The Trump Administration’s attempt to attack our state’s right to protect the health and well-being of our residents, without any consultation with states or tribal governments, is wrong,” Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson said in a statement to The Hill. “It will undermine four decades of state and federal cooperation in environmental stewardship.”

But even states with more conservative leadership have spoken out for maintaining states rights under the law.

“We urge you to direct federal agencies to reject any changes to agency rules, guidance, or policy that may diminish, impair, or subordinate states’ well-established sovereign and statutory authorities to protect water quality within their boundaries,” the Western Governors’ Association wrote in a January letter when the White House was still weighing an executive order.

Matthews said states are likely to have trouble getting the information they need in order to meet the timelines. The lengthy environmental assessment process means pipeline routes or construction plans might change long after they’ve applied for permission from the state. Trying to force states to approve a project before they have that information could backfire, he said.

“States cannot make a decision about whether a project will or won’t comply with state water quality standards until they know where and what rivers it will be crossing,” Matthews said. “If they encourage or later require states to make these decisions before all the information is available, states are going to have to deny these applications without prejudice and encourage them to reapply which could slow everything down rather than speed it up.”

Industry groups voiced support for the EPA guidance, arguing it helped restore the balance between the state and federal government.

“The balance between those roles has been disrupted and some states have viewed Section 401 as means of determining which interstate pipeline projects are in the public interest and which are not,” Don Santa, president of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America, said in a release, referring to the specific portion of the law creating the state certification process.

Environmentalists say they are still weighing what response to take to the guidance, though some say they are more concerned about the coming regulations on the same topic that were also spurred by Trump’s executive order.

“I would say there are several alarming suggestions in this guidance that if taken to their extreme could be very problematic as they play out,” said Moneen Nasmith, an attorney with EarthJustice. “There are a number of places that provide the suggestion that EPA could weigh in in places within the state decisionmaking process that it has never participated in before and doesn’t have the authority to do now.”

She’s concerned the EPA may try to weigh in on what reasons states can give to deny a certification or try to define water quality issues more narrowly, blocking states from weighing certain aspects of projects. Both are things she said EPA is not legally allowed to do.

“I’m worried that in the guidance EPA seems to be contemplating having that kind of role,” she said."
Should Google Be Broken Up? And Four Other Burning Questions As The DOJ Begins Its Antitrust Investigation,https://adexchanger.com,[],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://adexchanger.com/platforms/should-google-be-broken-up-and-four-other-burning-questions-as-the-doj-begins-its-antitrust-investigation/,"The US Department of Justice is reportedly preparing an antitrust investigation into Google. But that doesn’t mean Google is headed for a breakup and, at least for now, there are way more questions than answers.

Which parts of Google’s sprawling business will the DOJ look into? Will it delve beyond Google’s search practices, which have been a major sticking point for regulators in Europe? How deep will the DOJ poke into the twisted innards of Google’s ad tech stack? Where does YouTube come into it? Can and will Google make its own proactive moves to try and stave off potential regulatory action?

If it comes to it, is a breakup of Google even the right remedy?

“So much is speculative right now,” said Brian Wieser, global president of business intelligence at GroupM. “It all depends on what issues they decide to focus on – and if they even get to the point where they decide it is an issue.”

But the breakup movement is energized in a way we haven’t seen before, said Fatemeh Khatibloo, a VP and principal analyst at Forrester.

Whether that enthusiasm leads to action depends on how much noise constituents make and to what extent the investigation reveals anticompetitive business practices, she said.

Why now?

It’s the DOJ’s policy to be very secretive about its work – a spokesperson told AdExchanger that “as a matter of policy, the Department of Justice does not confirm, deny or otherwise comment on the existence or nonexistence of investigations.” So, it’s noteworthy that there was a leak at all. The Wall Street Journal first reported news of the probe late last Friday.

This isn’t the first time that Google is in the antitrust crosshairs, but considering all the saber rattling in Washington, DC right now, and the fact that multiple presidential candidates are calling out Big Tech, it’s not surprising that government agencies like the DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission, which is taking responsibility for potential antitrust probes of Facebook and Amazon, are digging in.

“There has been enough public attention on these entities that the DOJ and FTC decided they better get on top of this,” said George Hay, a Cornell law professor and expert on antitrust. “It’s prudent, even if it’s just smoke and no fire right now, because they need to understand the objections to Google’s behavior to see if there’s even a there there.”

Is there a there there?

Being big isn’t a crime. But it’s illegal to monopolize.

“And the test for monopolization is pretty stringent,” Hay said.

Most antitrust enforcement revolves around a concept known as the consumer welfare standard, which basically says that more competition means good outcomes for consumers, said Dina Srinivasan, an antitrust scholar and former WPP digital ad executive.

Price and quality are often used as a proxy for consumer welfare. But most of Google’s services are free, and consumers aren’t harmed in terms of pricing. “The real moat Google has built is identity, [and] from the perspective of today’s mobile-first consumer, Google’s suite of services is great, from search through browsing to maps and YouTube, it seems pretty amazing that we get all that for free,” said Ana Milicevic, principal and co-founder of Sparrow Advisers. “Hence, the average consumer isn’t going to think too much about what is being traded in return.” But while there's an ongoing debate as to whether privacy and data collection/use are antitrust issues, the law does explicitly extend beyond consumer harm to protect against company-on-company anti-competitive action. Google in recent years has had “a suppressing effect on companies in the mar tech/ad tech space,” said Centro CEO Shawn Riegsecker. “Many investors are afraid of Google’s hegemony and are unwilling to invest in companies they see attempting to compete anywhere near the Google ecosystem.” AppNexus founder and former CEO Brian O’Kelley has firsthand experience of what it feels like to get roiled by Google, like when Google closed YouTube to third-party ad tech, he said. “There are a lot of folks they’ve stepped on throughout the years,” said O’Kelley, who just a few weeks ago called for the breakup of Google while testifying before Congress. What if Google is broken up?

Breaking up a company is rare. The normal remedy, said Hay, is for a company to just stop doing whatever problematic thing it’s doing.

Even Margrethe Vestager, the European Union’s competition commissioner – and the driving force behind multiple multibillion-dollar fines against Google – isn’t a cheerleader for the breakup of Big Tech. Splitting up companies is “a measure of last resort,” Vestager said at SXSW in March.

But fast forward through the multiple years it’ll take for the DOJ to complete its investigation. If a Google breakup does happen, what would it look like?

Google has spent the better part of a decade integrating all of its buy-side services, which would make that part of the business quite difficult to break up, said Justin Scarborough, programmatic media director at PMG.

But it could be feasible to separate Google’s buy-side and sell-side products “to create true separation between both parties of the transaction,” he said.

Another, perhaps more impactful option, could split Google Ads from Google’s consumer-facing products, such as Chrome and Android. “Google maintains a big advantage on the advertising front given their ability to control user identity and device information,” Scarborough said. “Seamless integrations with these products are a huge selling point for their ad services over independent players.”

Walled gardens get much of their power from the vast amounts of user data they control, and from their ability to leverage it with abandon, noted Forrester’s Khatibloo.

Carving off YouTube into a separate entity could also be enough by dint of giving buyers more than a single entry point into YouTube inventory.

But the smartest move would be for Google to preemptively divide off some of its units internally before the government even has a chance to do anything, said O’Kelley. “If I were Google, I’d strategically cede a small handful of areas where I’m vulnerable from an antitrust perspective – like operating YouTube at arm’s length, the same for DoubleClick – and try to preempt any full-on investigation,” O’Kelly said. “They’d probably take some short-term pain in their earnings, but it would be worth it in the end.” What about media buyers?

But how would a breakup of Google affect media buyers who daily toil in its myriad ad systems?

If it’s Google’s ad stack on the chopping block, that would be disruptive at first, said Varick CEO Paul Dolan, but ultimately not that big a deal. The stack isn’t as integrated, at least from a UI perspective, as you might think, and most media buyers are already used to logging in to multiple systems to manage search, display campaigns, YouTube through DV 360 and various open exchange partners on top of that.

After the dust settled, media buyers would simply adjust their day-to-day doings and get on with the business of buying media.

But media buyers would also lose something in the event of a breakup.

Because, unpopular opinion, there are actually a lot of good things (with a lot of catches) about the Google ad stack and its hooks into the rest of the Google machine: the ability to tie audience data with consented Google user data, to easily action it using Google’s demand-side platform and to have access to it all in an ad server for reporting.

Despite the whiff of monopoly, the loss of transparency in that process is part of a tradeoff that many buyers willingly make when they use Google products or run on Google-owned properties, Dolan said. They go in with their eyes open.

So rather than going on about hypothetical breakups, regulators should focus on enacting strong consumer data rights and usage protections, Sparrow’s Milicevic said.

“Then,” she said, “consumers can be the ones with a say in how the data they generate is actually used.”"
"VA may owe veterans millions in refunds but knowingly hasn't paid them for years, probe finds",https://www.usatoday.com,"['Donovan Slack', 'Published P.M. Et June']",06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/06/06/va-may-owe-disabled-veterans-millions-refunds-home-loan-fees/1367679001/,"CLOSE

WASHINGTON – More than 50,000 disabled veterans could be owed as much as $190 million in refunds from the Department of Veterans Affairs for home loan fees they were wrongly charged or no longer owe, an investigation has found.

Senior leaders knew about the problem for years but didn’t ensure veterans received what they are due, the investigation by the VA inspector general found.

Veterans pay the fees when they buy homes with the help of VA's Home Loan Guaranty Program, but they are supposed to be exempt if they are disabled. Fees can total up to 3.3% of a home's value.

In cases where veterans improperly paid the fees or the VA later determined they were disabled, the agency is supposed to issue refunds.

But the VA didn’t do that in thousands of cases dating back more than a decade because the veterans didn't ask for the refunds.

VA loan managers, who knew about outstanding debts to veterans since at least 2014, told investigators that they had been focused on other priorities, including processing high volumes of applications.

Investigators from the inspector general’s office said in their report released Thursday that they found it “troubling” that the managers were “aware that thousands of veterans were potentially owed more than $150 million yet did not take adequate actions to ensure refunds were issued.”

“It is the review team’s opinion that requiring a veteran to submit a claim for a refund improperly places the burden and responsibility solely upon the veteran,” investigators said.

'Internal quality improvement'

The VA issued a press release last month – as the inspector general was preparing to release the investigation results – announcing that the agency is now notifying veterans when they buy homes under the program that they are exempt from the fees if they are disabled or later determined to be disabled.

“Through an internal quality improvement effort, VA has put a plan in place to better inform veterans through key communications when the law allows VA to waive the fee for a veteran,” VA Secretary Robert Wilkie said in the release.

The release did not say what is being done to ensure veterans due refunds from loans in prior years are paid. The inspector general found the amounts owed in its review ranged from $5,000 to $20,000.

The VA said veterans who believe they are owed a refund should consult the agency’s website for more information about VA home loan funding fees.

Between 2012 and 2017, the VA collected roughly $10 billion in fees from veterans under the loan program.

The inspector general estimated disabled veterans who were wrongly charged accounted for $286 million of those fees. But the VA only refunded about $100 million, leaving an estimated $190 million that may still be due to 53,200 veterans.

The Loan Guaranty program was established in 1944 to help veterans finance home purchases. Loans are provided by private lenders, but the VA guarantees a portion of the loans for eligible buyers. The lenders collect the fees and transmit them to the VA.

If a veteran wrongly paid the fees, the VA can refund the money directly to the veteran. If the fees were included as part of a loan, the VA pays the lender, which applies it to the loan balance.

'Other priorities'

In 2014, regional VA loan officials in St. Paul, Minnesota, notified senior VA managers that an analysis found nearly $150 million may be due in refunds to disabled veterans for fees on 48,000 loans issued between 2006 and 2014.

“As of January 2019, the review team received no indication that a large-scale effort had been initiated to issue refunds to these veterans,” the inspector general said.

The director of the Loan Guaranty program since 2017, Jeffrey London, told investigators he “considered contracting out the task of issuing refunds, but never requested the award of a contract because other priorities…took precedence,” the investigators wrote.

The inspector general recommended the agency identify and pay all the veterans owed refunds. In addition, the VA should implement procedures to minimize the number of veterans who are wrongly charged fees and conduct periodic reviews to ensure those who are receive prompt refunds.

The VA told investigators some of the fees were incorrectly assessed by lenders, not the VA. But agency officials said in their response to the report that they “generally agreed” with the investigation’s findings and are consulting lawyers about complexities related to issuing refunds.

The agency “has drafted a plan with contingencies ready for implementation depending on the (legal) opinion,” the VA response said. The agency did not elaborate on what the plan is or when refunds will be issued.

The White House reportedly blocked climate testimony warning of a 'possibly catastrophic' future because it didn't 'jibe' with Trump's policy,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Aria Bendix'],06-08-2019,2019,6,https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-blocked-climate-testimony-trump2019-6,"The White House is engaged in a war of words about climate change.

Last Wednesday, Rod Schoonover, a senior analyst at the US State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, was barred from submitting his written assessment of the effects of a warming world to the House Intelligence Committee, the Washington Post reported.

Schoonover was scheduled to testify on behalf of the bureau at a climate change hearing held on June 5. Though he was permitted to speak in person, his office's written statement was blocked by White House officials, who thought his scientific claims contradicted the policies of the Trump administration.

In his written testimony, Schoonover predicted that the ""the compounded effects of climate change"" would produce ""significant,"" ""possibly catastrophic,"" harm to the planet. The ability to prevent this future, he wrote, will depend partly on humanity's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

A White House aide told the Washington Post that the testimony didn't ""jibe"" with the administration's official stance on climate change.

The testimony was reportedly opposed by members of the White House's Office of Legislative Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, and National Security Council, including William Happer, a National Security Council senior director. Happer, who was dismissed from his post at the Department of Energy in 1993, has stated that most of Earth's warming ""has probably been due to natural causes.""

Before the White House barred Schoonover's written testimony, the Bureau of Intelligence and Research reportedly refused a request from the Trump administration to eliminate certain scientific claims.

Here are a few claims from the written document, first obtained by the Washington Post:

Extreme high temperatures are increasing worldwide, and will continue to increase, due ""largely"" to greenhouse gas emissions.

Today's levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere haven't been seen in ""at least 800,000 years.""

Oceans are becoming more acidic due to increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

Climate change will amplify ""stresses"" such as droughts, floods, and fires.

The effects of climate change could undermine trade routes, the global economy, and the world's food supply.

Climate change will ""almost certainly"" threaten national security in the coming decades.

The crackdown on Schoonover's testimony reflects a larger effort on behalf of the Trump administration to police government reports related to climate change.

In May, the New York Times reported that the administration planned to prevent the federally-funded National Climate Assessment from outlining the ""worst-case scenarios"" if climate change went unchecked.

The Times also reported that the White House aimed to prevent the US Geological Survey from making climate predictions beyond 2040. Scientists expect the worst effects of global emissions to manifest after that time period.

Correction: An earlier version of this article did not fully describe the USDA’s roll-out of a new study about its school nutrition program. New details have been added to explain these efforts. In addition, the article has been updated to note that news of the study and its unusually low-key release were first reported by The Lunch Tray blog.

The U.S. Agriculture Department has good news about the nation’s school nutrition programs. But it isn’t shouting it from the rooftops.

On April 23, the USDA released its “School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study,” which the agency says was “the first nationally representative, comprehensive assessment” of school meals after the implementation of the 2010 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, a key initiative of the Obama administration that mandated healthy changes in food at schools.

The best news was that the Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2010), a multicomponent measure of diet quality, shot up dramatically for both school-provided breakfasts and lunches.

For the 2009-2010 school year, the score for breakfast was an abysmal 49.6 out of 100 (even lower than the overall American average of 59), rising to 71.3 by the 2014-2015 school year. In that same time frame, the lunch score went from 57.9 to 81.5. The score for whole grains in school meals went from 25 to 95 percent of the maximum score, and the score for greens and beans rose from 21 to 72 percent.

In addition, there was greater participation in school meal programs at schools with the highest healthy food standards. And the study found food waste, a troubling national problem in the lunchroom, remained relatively unchanged.

[Why banning ‘meal shaming’ isn’t enough]

But the USDA didn’t go all out in making sure the country knew about the results. There was no news release. USDA Secretary Sonny Purdue didn’t say anything about it. And the link on the USDA website disappeared for several days after that and was altogether inaccessible before reappearing under a different URL. A search of the study title on the Food and Nutrition Service site does not pull it up, nor is it accessible on the National School Lunch Program website tab.

News of the study and its unusually quiet release were first reported on The Lunch Tray blog.

A spokeswoman for the Food and Nutrition Service said that most FNS study publications are not announced with a press release, but that the results of this study were disseminated via email newsletter to 40,000 recipients and via Twitter.

But some questioned that.

“They don’t routinely send out a press release when (a study) plays a central role in a major policy success central to their mission?” said Jerry Mande, a senior USDA official during the Obama administration who was involved in developing the standards. “That would be malpractice. Of course they put out a release when a study makes news.”

Mande said the study was a resounding endorsement of the policies put in place by the former administration.

“As a nutrition and public-health policymaker, what’s extraordinary is for a policy to have that large an effect, to affect tens of millions of school kids. If you consider the crisis that we face — people living shorter, less healthy lives — solutions usually take decades,” he said. “Within two years there’s a dramatic change. This demonstrates the power the USDA has to change the way kids eat. We should be doubling down on this.”

[Spray cheese, beef jerky and stuffed olives to be counted as staples under Trump administration food stamp proposal]

The 52-page summary of study findings is chockablock with other good news. There was greater participation in school meal programs at schools with the highest healthy food standards. And the study found food waste, a troubling national problem in the lunchroom, remained relatively unchanged. So why isn’t Perdue crowing about it?

“It seems fairly outside of the norm for a federal agency to release a study that directly contradicts what the administration’s position is,” explained Elizabeth Balkan, food waste director of the Natural Resources Defense Council. “That’s why it was released very quietly.”

In December, Perdue announced the USDA was weakening school nutrition standards for whole grain, nonfat milk and sodium, all of which had been tightened during the Obama administration. He cited food waste and nonparticipation as key rationales for the shift.

“If kids are not eating what is being served, they are not benefiting, and food is being wasted,” he said at the time.

About two-thirds of the 30 million children who eat school meals every day qualify as low-income and are getting meals free or for a reduced price. Low-income kids are disproportionately affected by obesity and are less likely to be fed healthy meals at home, so the nutritional makeup of those school meals is impactful. Kids can get more than half of their daily calories from school meals.

Advocates say the push to roll back stricter requirements is consistent with President Trump’s overall mission of deregulation.

“Waste was the smokescreen,” said Margo Wootan, vice president for nutrition at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. “There have been several studies that showed that food waste hadn’t increased.”

[Big Money Joins Fight Against $1 Trillion in Wasted Food]

Wootan enumerates many things that can be done — beyond making food saltier, fattier or more processed — to reduce food waste in schools. Have recess before lunch to work up hunger and don’t schedule lunch times midmorning before kids are peckish. Cut up apples instead of offering them whole. Offer taste tests and share tables and give students opportunities to provide more input. Perhaps most importantly, adopt an “offer versus serve” approach at elementary schools and middle schools (it is required at high schools). This means that students can select three out of five meal components and avoid things they don’t like and are likely to discard.

“The Trump administration wants to tick off the maximum number of regulations it can say it rolled back,” Wootan said. “It’s another tick mark on the deregulatory agenda.”

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 13.7 million, or 18.5 percent, of children aged 2 to 19 are obese. That percentage is higher for Hispanics (25.8 percent) and non-Hispanic blacks (22 percent).

The American Medical Association changed the term obesity from a condition into a disease in 2013. The CDC says obesity puts people at an increased risk for all causes of death, but it is linked to high blood pressure and cholesterol, Type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke and some cancers.

The School Nutrition Association, the trade group for school food-service manufacturers and school food professionals, has commended Perdue for seeking regulatory flexibility.

Diane Pratt-Heavner, spokeswoman for the association, says that although the study findings are very positive, the new standards have presented challenges for school districts.

“We’re seeing a lot of schools struggle with cultural preferences with students. Like white rice — some cultures don’t eat brown rice. And in the Southwest, there are students who are not familiar with a whole-grain tortilla.”

She also says that participation in school lunch programs has dropped, from 32 million to 30 million, under the new standards, and that as a result, costs per student have increased.

Schools are forced to rely more heavily on a la carte items (a sandwich, rather than the full meal with fruits, veggies and milk) to stay solvent.

Schools have also looked to restaurant practices, offering more customizable meals such as burritos made to order, to boost participation, and catering programs on the side to bolster revenue. Bottom line, she says: The cost of preparing the new style of meals frequently exceeds the cost of reimbursement.

However, that runs counter to the study’s finding that healthier meals did not impose a greater financial burden.

“There was no significant association between reported cost per NSLP (National School Lunch Program) lunch and the nutritional quality of the meals,” the study said. “That is, mean reported costs per NSLP lunch were not significantly higher in schools that prepared more-nutritious meals . . . than in schools that produced the least-nutritious meals.”"
DOJ to hand over important Mueller evidence to Congress,https://www.thedenverchannel.com,[],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/national/doj-to-hand-over-important-mueller-evidence-to-house-committee,"House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler on Monday said he has struck a deal with the Justice Department to begin providing Congress with some documents from the Mueller Report related to obstruction of justice.

Nadler announced the agreement ahead of a vote scheduled for Tuesday, when the House is expected to approve a resolution to go to court to enforce its subpoenas of Attorney General William Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn .

But a court fight appears to be no longer necessary for the Barr subpoena -- at least for the time being -- as a result of the agreement the committee struck with the Justice Department. The details of which documents would be provided to the committee were not disclosed, but Nadler said the agreement would allow all Judiciary Committee members to see ""Robert Mueller's most important files ... providing us with key evidence that the Special Counsel used to assess whether the President and others obstructed justice or were engaged in other misconduct.""

""These documents will allow us to perform our constitutional duties and decide how to respond to the allegations laid out against the President by the Special Counsel,"" Nadler said.

The agreement is the first sign of a thaw between the House Judiciary Committee and the Justice Department, which have been battling over the special counsel's report since Robert Mueller ended his investigation in March .

The House Judiciary Committee had issued a subpoena for Mueller's unredacted report and all of the special counsel's evidence, and then voted to hold Barr in contempt last month . The committee also fought with Barr over the format of his hearing, prompting the attorney general to skip his appearance .

In a letter last month, Nadler said he was willing negotiate over the scope of the subpoena and accept a smaller subset of documents out of Mueller's evidence, including FBI summaries of key interviews with witnesses. The Justice Department responded it would also be willing to negotiate so long as the House called off its contempt vote against Barr.

Nadler said in the statement that he would ""hold the criminal contempt process in abeyance for now"" as a result of the agreement. But House Democrats were not voting on Tuesday on a criminal contempt citation against Barr -- they have drafted a resolution to go to court under the so-called civil contempt process to enforce their subpoenas of Barr and McGahn.

Nadler said that vote would still happen on Tuesday, pointing to the fact that the resolution also included language authorizing court action against McGahn.

He said as long as the Justice Department ""proceeds in good faith"" there would be no further steps taken against Barr, but added: ""If important information is held back, then we will have no choice but to enforce our subpoena in court and consider other remedies."""

The records do not indicate why Ohr was given the bonus in November 2016, though they show he also received a $14,520 bonus a year earlier, totaling $42,520 over a two-year period.

STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL CITED STEELE IN EMAILS WITH OHR AFTER FLAGGING CREDIBILITY ISSUES TO FBI, DOCS REVEAL

A Justice Department spokesman on Friday did not immediately return an inquiry from Fox News about the bonuses.

The conservative group Judicial Watch, known for suing for public records, released the documents related to Ohr’s salary Friday, saying they obtained them from the Justice Department through a Freedom of Information Act request.

Ohr’s actions during that time have been of interest to investigators, as it’s believed Ohr was the back channel between Trump dossier author Christopher Steele and the FBI. It was also revealed that his wife, Nellie Ohr, conducted opposition research on Trump for the firm Fusion GPS – the same company that commissioned the dossier – raising conflict of interest questions.

Judicial Watch is questioning why Ohr, who was later demoted at DOJ, was given a bonus.

“These documents will raise questions as to whether the conflicted Bruce Ohr, who the FBI used to launder information from Christopher Steele was rewarded for his role in the illicit targeting of President Trump,” Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said in a statement.

Even though Ohr was removed from his position as Associate Deputy Attorney General in 2017, he later received a $2,600 pay increase in 2018, the records indicate, showing Ohr earned $189,000 that year.

"Did Trump Administration ‘Purge’ 200,000 VA Health Care Applications?",https://www.snopes.com,['Bethania Palma'],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.snopes.com/news/2019/06/07/trump-admin-va-applications/,"Five years have passed since Scott Davis testified before Congress about mismanagement at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), a condition that resulted in almost a million backlogged applications and a sometimes deadly state of limbo for veterans waiting to get health care. On 13 May 2019, Davis penned a widely read opinion piece for the Washington Examiner in which he stated that despite a whirlwind of media attention in years past, the problem had hardly been resolved.

Despite President Donald Trump’s blasting the administration of his predecessor for the problem, Davis wrote, “The Trump administration has decided to execute a plan to purge 200,000 applications for VA healthcare caused by known administrative errors within VA’s enrollment process and enrollment system — problems that had already been documented by the Office of the Inspector General in 2015 and 2017.”

“I tried in a very non-partisan way to say, two years after you made a big deal about this, this is happening on your watch,” Davis told us by phone. Davis is a former public affairs officer for VA Member Services, which deals with enrollment. Although he currently works in a different department, Davis is still employed by the VA.

The VA has taken issue with Davis’ use of the word “purge” in reference to applications, with spokeswoman Susan Carter telling us by email that it’s a “loaded term” and calling Davis’ opinion piece “misleading.” However, the VA confirmed that 208,272 veterans’ applications for health care had been moved from “pending” status to “closed” status between January and February (she did not specify the year). Once an application has been closed, the veteran must reapply for health care benefits.

Davis maintained taking issue with his terminology was just wordplay, and that no functional difference existed between “closing” and “purging” an application from the veteran’s perspective. “Offering the person the opportunity to reapply is not offering them anything,” Davis told us. “Intake is a very basic function of any government organization. If you can’t do that, that’s a problem. And that’s a problem that people in my opinion, from the president on down, should be concerned with, because this is the nation’s largest health care system.”

If a veteran applies to receive VA benefits but the application is incomplete, the person has a year to submit necessary additional information. During that time, the application is placed in “pending” status. After a year, in accordance with federal law, the application is placed in “closed” status by the VA, and the veteran is notified by letter how to reapply. The VA states it notified all veterans with incomplete applications via letter “that they are in pending status and that they have 365 days to complete their applications.”

Between January and May 2019, a total of 21,881 applications have been moved to “pending” status, according to Carter’s email. Davis sent us a copy of the VA’s Fiscal Year 2019 briefing book showing more than 317,000 applications currently in “pending” status. That same book shows over 270,000 applications in “closed” status.

Davis told us that known issues exist with the VA’s notification process dating back to a 2014 scandal that prompted Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki to resign. As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump had been critical of the scandal. The VA Office of Inspector General determined in 2015 that “extensive, persistent problems with veterans’ health care enrollment records maintained by the [Health Eligibility Center or HEC]” existed.

Whistleblower Allegations

The 2015 report confirmed whistleblower allegations that the VA had 867,000 “pending” applications, and that of that backlog more than 307,000 were records associated with deceased veterans. But auditors were unable to determine how many of those were people who died while awaiting health care because of sloppy record-keeping by the VA. (The issue was widely misreported, and Trump asserted that all 307,000 cases were veterans who died awaiting care while their applications were pending.)

In 2017, auditors reported that the VA lacked an adequate, uniform system for enrolling veterans at the point of contact, VA health-care facilities. We asked the VA whether a national enrollment policy was enacted in response to that report, and spokeswoman Susan Carter told us a policy was “still under development.”

Carter also said that the VA makes thousands of attempts to reach veterans in “pending” status. The VA “regularly reaches out to Veterans both by mail and by phone. In this fiscal year alone, VA has made over 200,000 call attempts to Veterans with pending applications, and over 300,000 attempts to newly enrolled Veterans. On average over 27,000 calls are placed each month to Veterans with a pending [Veterans Health Administration] application to assist them with completing anything that is missing in order to reach an enrollment determination. VA makes six attempts with each Veteran over the course of one year.”

We asked how many of those attempts yielded verifiable contacts with veterans but have not yet received an answer to that question.

Letters by Mail

Davis questioned whether veterans ever received the letters or calls. He provided us an internal memo dated 30 November 2016 in which Health Eligibility Center (HEC) officials cautioned that tens of thousands of addresses had been flagged as potentially bad, while acknowledging that “although a letter was never returned by the postal service, we cannot say that the Veteran received it.”

“How many times do we all miss one letter in the mail? In 2019, that’s how they’re communicating? It’s ridiculous,” Davis said. “To say, ‘We sent a letter to people’ in 2019 — I know people in government don’t know how the internet works, but people under 60 aren’t running to the mailbox every day.”

The quality of VA health care for veterans, and the agency’s mismanagement of processes that help them get it, have for years been a focal point of public concern, but the controversy rose to the surface again in April 2019 amid news reports that four veterans had committed suicide at VA facilities in the span of one month. On that issue, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote:

Veteran suicide is an acute crisis wrapped in a national crisis. Between 2005 and 2016, suicide rates in the general population climbed 21%. For veterans, already taking their lives at twice the U.S. rate, it climbed 26%. More than 6,000 veterans are dying by their own hands each year – nearly 20 a day. The latest deaths renew questions about whether the VA, criticized and investigated for failing to provide timely or sufficient help to veterans, is doing enough to solve the problem. That is despite making suicide prevention a high priority in recent years.

We asked the VA how many veterans committed suicide while their applications were in “pending” status between January 2012 and May 2019 but received no response to that question."

FUKUOKA, Japan (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Saturday that the U.S.-Mexico immigration deal met President Donald Trump’s objectives of fixing immigration problems on the southern U.S. border, but Trump will retain the authority to impose tariffs if Mexico fails to live up to it.

The deal averts a 5% tariff on all Mexican goods that was due to start on Monday, with Mexico agreeing to rapidly expand a controversial asylum program and deploy security forces to stem the flow of illegal Central American migrants.

“We now have an agreement that we believe is going to fix the immigration issue. And that was extremely important to the president,” Mnuchin told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of a G20 finance meeting in Fukuoka, Japan.

Mnuchin, who said he participated in a call with Trump just before the deal was announced, said the president would retain the right to impose tariffs if Mexico did not keep its commitments.

“Our expectation is that Mexico will do what they’ve committed to do and our expectation is that we won’t need to put tariffs in place, but obviously if that’s not the case, the president retains that authority.”"
Someday the U.S. Will Have to Actually Deal With Its Nuclear Waste Problem,https://slate.com,['Jane C. Hu'],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/technology/2019/06/department-of-energy-nuclear-waste-reclassification-yucca.html,"Photo illustration by Slate. Photo by Jeff J. Mitchell—WPA Pool/Getty Images.

Of all the things in the world to worry about, nuclear waste management is not at the top of most people’s lists. We trust (or hope, at least) that expert scientists and policymakers will make good decisions about how to make sure radioactive byproducts stay far, far away from us, by whatever means possible. But, many of those experts say, we’re going to need to figure out a new way to manage our country’s nuclear waste—and soon.

To that end, the Department of Energy announced Wednesday that they are reclassifying the definition of “high-level,” or highly radioactive, waste stored in underground tanks at Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington state, the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina, and the Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho Falls. The DOE hopes that the redefinition will expedite cleanup of the waste. Currently, the high-level waste stored at these sites is waiting for the government to open a secure waste repository (like Yucca Mountain in Nevada, which has been in limbo for decades). But if some of the less radioactive waste qualifies under the new definition, it might instead be shipped off to other sites, like one in Texas, where it could be mixed with “concrete-like grout.” The cleanup at Hanford has already cost the country billions of dollars and is projected to cost billions more as we continue the search for the waste’s final home. (Adding some urgency to developing a new plan is the risk that containers could leak and contaminate the environment, especially if there’s an earthquake in Washington.)

The DOE’s new plan could be cost-effective, sure, but the question is whether it’s safe. When the agency first announced reclassification plans in October 2018 and solicited public comment, the proposal received thousands of responses. And Washington state officials are not happy; Gov. Jay Inslee and Department of Ecology Director Maia Bellon have both sent letters of concern to the DOE. “I am gravely concerned with DOE forging ahead with a new interpretation of HLW that does not comport with federal law, despite objections from Washington state,” wrote Bellon.

Some countries tried storing barrels of waste in ice sheets, which turns out to be less than ideal given that ice both moves and melts.

In addition to the waste we already have sitting around at Hanford and other old nuclear weapons facilities (charmingly called “legacy waste”), nearly 100 commercial nuclear reactors at 60 facilities around the U.S. are creating new waste every day. The type of waste produced by those two types of facility contains different radioactive materials with varying half-lives, but the same storage issues remain: What will we eventually do with all this radioactive stuff?

The lack of solution is not from lack of discussion. There have been all sorts of wacky ideas floated about where to store nuclear waste. Some have proposed we shoot it all into space, maybe have it orbit Venus. But given how spacecraft are prone to explosions, which would effectively mean showering the world with bits of radioactive waste, that idea stalled. In the ’90s, the idea of burying waste in deep ocean seabeds seemed promising, but it never really got off the ground. And some countries tried storing barrels of waste in ice sheets, which turns out to be less than ideal given that ice both moves and melts. As the earth thaws out, old waste becomes uncovered.

Here in the U.S., we’re running out of space, and experts are concerned about the lack of long-term solutions. “Instead of a planned, coherent system, we have the confusion of an unplanned, less than optimal system,” nuclear experts wrote in a 2018 report on nuclear waste management strategy and policy, calling the U.S. program “an ever-tightening Gordian Knot” subject to technical, scientific, logistical, regulatory, legal, financial, social, and political challenges. “This is not a situation that builds public confidence.”

Currently, we’re at a standstill. In 1987, the government designated Yucca Mountain in southern Nevada as the storage facility for waste, but more than three decades later, proper approvals are still pending. Buckets of radioactive waste are still sitting around at the various facilities around the U.S., waiting for a place to go. While critics from environmental advocacy organizations like Columbia Riverkeeper and National Resource Defense Council have condemned the DOE’s reclassification, calling it “irresponsible,” “outrageous,” and an “attempt to cut corners,” local government welcomed the new policy. Richland, Washington, Mayor Bob Thompson told the Tri-City Herald that the decision was a “fantastic opportunity” to speed up Hanford’s cleanup.

We could avoid adding to the problem by trying to reduce the amount of waste generated. One way to do that is to recycle. By separating out uranium and plutonium from used nuclear fuel, engineers can reuse those in reactors to generate additional energy and throw out the rest. “Ninety-five percent of original energy is in the unused fuel,” says Kathryn Huff, an assistant professor of nuclear engineering at the University of Illinois, who likens the process to recycling a soda can: You wash out the sugar and dirt to reuse the aluminum. By reusing fuel, nuclear plants could cut down on the amount of space they need for waste containment by an order or two of magnitude.

On that front, countries like France, the U.K., and Japan are way ahead of us. France, in particular, leads the game; it generates about 80 percent of its energy through nuclear plants, but thanks to its recycling site, called La Hague, the waste currently fits “in a room not significantly bigger than a basketball court,” says Huff. Of course, the U.S. is a far bigger country than France, we’ve run our reactors for longer, and we have a lot more waste already sitting around, so we’ll never shrink our waste pile to that size. But La Hague is a testament to how the amount of true waste can be reduced through reprocessing.

Adopting recycling is subject to many of the same logistical and regulatory pitfalls as building a repository. For one, recycling is more expensive, and without regulatory pressure to change existing systems, commercial nuclear energy plants may not want to pony up the cash. (Opponents of reprocessing, like the Union of Concerned Scientists, also point to high costs of reprocessing, estimating it could cost tens or even hundreds of billions to implement.) Beyond the costs of just reprocessing waste, we’d also have to build critical infrastructure, like recycling facilities and retrofitting of existing reactors to accept recycled fuel. France’s energy system is government-run, and its government has decided to invest the money to have less waste sitting around in the long term.

To make progress on recycling, or building a repository, or even having a coherent plan for the roughly 80,000 metric tons of waste in our country, experts say any decisions about nuclear management need to be removed from the political cycle. “The instability in the dynamics of American politics makes it a challenge to develop a sustainable program,” says Huff. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future, a group of experts assembled by the Obama administration in 2012, brought up similar concerns in its recommendations and suggested that the government establish an entirely new government entity to oversee nuclear waste policy. “The overall record of DOE and of the federal government as a whole, however, has not inspired widespread confidence or trust in our nation’s nuclear waste management program,” the commission wrote in the final report. “The Commission concludes that a new, single-purpose organization is needed … to get the waste program back on track.” Members recommended also that this organization would solicit active consent from affected communities and implement policies that would provide continuity from administration to administration.

But until then, it seems inevitable that the rules will keep shifting, and we’ll keep passing the buck on the problem of waste management. What’s now “high-level” waste seems destined to be reclassified, but it’s also possible that the next administration could change the definition right back. Unless the government moves toward a longer-term solution, we’ll likely be stuck in limbo until something catastrophic happens, the waste’s radioactivity decreases over thousands of years, or the world ends—whichever comes first.

"DOJ, Commerce reject Dem subpoenas for census docs",https://www.politico.com,['Andrew Desiderio'],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/06/barr-ross-census-democrats-house-1356569,"Rep. Elijah Cummings was denied a request for documents about the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo legal DOJ, Commerce reject Dem subpoenas for census docs

The Justice and Commerce departments on Thursday rejected House Democratic demands for more documents about the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census, likely leading to contempt citations for Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.

In a letter to Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd said the documents the panel subpoenaed are protected by attorney-client privilege and therefore cannot be disclosed.

Story Continued Below

“[T]he committee’s insistence that the department immediately turn over these documents ... is improper,” Boyd wrote, adding that the Justice Department has already turned over tens of thousands of documents and made officials available for interviews.

A Commerce Department spokesperson accused the committee of trying to interfere with ongoing litigation that centers on the constitutionality of the citizenship question appearing on the census.

“In its zeal to influence the Supreme Court’s decision, the committee is poised to hold Secretary Ross in contempt,” the spokesperson said. “Holding the secretary in contempt is an empty stunt, and it shows that the committee is simply interested in playing politics.”

The Democrat-led committee gave the Justice Department and the Commerce Department until 5 p.m. on Thursday to comply with its subpoenas, threatening to initiate contempt proceedings absent compliance.

Cummings said his committee gave Barr and Ross every opportunity to provide the documents but they didn’t cooperate and made no counteroffers.

“They seem determined to continue the Trump Administration’s cover-up,” he said in a statement.

The committee has been investigating the decision to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census, with lawmakers accusing the Trump administration — Ross in particular — of lying about its origins.

New evidence emerged last week that the administration allegedly “concealed” the role of now-deceased Republican gerrymandering expert Thomas Hofeller, who believed that adding a citizenship question to the census would boost Republicans in future elections.

The Trump administration has said it is simply trying to enforce the Voting Rights Act, but Democrats have argued that such a question would create an undercount of ethnic and racial minorities, resulting in newly drawn congressional districts that would diminish their influence in American elections.

Cummings said this week that the Trump administration was seeking “to gerrymander congressional districts in overtly racist, partisan and unconstitutional ways,” and he accused the Trump administration of a “coverup.” Republicans on the committee have said that holding Barr and Ross in contempt is an effort to improperly interfere with ongoing court proceedings about the census question.

The subpoenas, which were first authorized in April, required the Justice and Commerce departments to turn over all communications with the White House, the Republican National Committee, and President Donald Trump’s campaign, among other entities. The subpoenas also sought memos and witness testimony.

One of those witnesses, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Gore, refused to answer lawmakers’ specific questions about his role in drafting a DOJ memo, requesting the addition of a citizenship question, and he later skipped a scheduled deposition with the committee.

In a statement, the Justice Department said Gore had “never heard of” Hofeller’s work, and added that it “played no role in the department’s December 2017 request to reinstate a citizenship question.”

Barr is expected to be formally held in contempt of Congress in a separate matter on Tuesday, when the House is scheduled to vote on a contempt citation for his refusal to turn over former special counsel Robert Mueller’s unredacted report and underlying evidence, allowing the House Judiciary Committee to enforce its subpoena in federal court.

The contempt resolution will also allow other committees to enforce their subpoenas without requiring a full House vote.

U.S. and Mexico Issue Joint Declaration on Migration and Tariffs,https://www.nytimes.com,['Liam Stack'],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/07/us/state-department-mexico-trump.html,"President Trump pulled back from his plan to impose tariffs on all Mexican imports, saying on Friday night on Twitter that the United States and Mexico had reached an agreement to reduce the number of migrants entering the United States over the southwestern border.

The tariffs, which could have been potentially crippling for Mexico, were to go into effect on Monday. Mr. Trump’s announcement came after several days of intense negotiations between the two countries in Washington.

“The Tariffs scheduled to be implemented by the U.S. on Monday, against Mexico, are hereby indefinitely suspended,” Mr. Trump wrote just before 8:30 p.m. “Mexico, in turn, has agreed to take strong measures to stem the tide of Migration through Mexico, and to our Southern Border.”

Here is a joint statement by the United States and Mexico released by the State Department on Friday night:

“The United States and Mexico met this week to address the shared challenges of irregular migration, to include the entry of migrants into the United States in violation of U.S. law. Given the dramatic increase in migrants moving from Central America through Mexico to the United States, both countries recognize the vital importance of rapidly resolving the humanitarian emergency and security situation. The Governments of the United States and Mexico will work together to immediately implement a durable solution."

Treasury targets Iran's most profitable oil refiners with new sanctions,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-08-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/treasury-targets-irans-most-profitable-oil-refiners-with-new-sanctions,"The Treasury Department imposed broad sanctions Friday on Iran's petrochemical and refinery industry for contributing funds to the financial arm of Iran's Revolutionary Guard, which the State Department recently named a terrorist organization.

The sanctions target Iran’s largest and most profitable petrochemical holding group, called the Persian Gulf Petrochemical Industries Company, which maintains dozens of companies and subsidiaries.

“This action is a warning that we will continue to target holding groups and companies in the petrochemical sector and elsewhere that provide financial lifelines"" to the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.

The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control imposed the sanctions on the holding company's 39 subsidiary petrochemical companies and foreign-based marketing firms.

The Treasury charges the petrochemical refiners with providing financial support to Khatam al-Anbiya, the Revolutionary Guard's engineering conglomerate, which the U.S. government refers to as the ""economic arm"" of the group.

“By targeting this network we intend to deny funding to key elements of Iran’s petrochemical sector that provide support to the IRGC,” Mnuchin said.

The Persian Gulf Petrochemical Industries Company and its group of subsidiaries represent 40% of Iran’s total petrochemical production and 50% of Iran’s total petrochemical exports, according to the Treasury Department."
