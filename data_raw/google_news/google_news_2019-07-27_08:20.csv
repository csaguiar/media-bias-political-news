Democrats dub Supreme Court's border wall ruling 'regrettable' and 'nonsensical',https://www.foxnews.com,['Louis Casiano'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-dub-supreme-courts-border-wall-ruling-regrettable-and-nonsensical,"Democrats reacted with disappointment to Friday's Supreme Court ruling allowing the Trump administration to divert $2.5 billion in Pentagon funds for border wall construction.

The 5-4 ruling, which broke along ideological lines, means President Trump can tap into military funds to begin work to replace fencing along the southern border in California, Arizona and New Mexico. Earlier this month, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco had agreed with a lower-court ruling that prevented the government from tapping that funding.

Trump declared a national emergency along the border to get up to $8.1 billion for wall construction, including the $2.5 billion from the Defense Department. He called the ruling a big win for ""Border Security and the Rule of Law.""

TRUMP ANNOUNCES ‘LANDMARK AGREEMENT’ WITH GUATEMALA TO RESTRICT ASYLUM CLAIMS

""Wow! Big VICTORY on the Wall. The United States Supreme Court overturns lower court injunction, allows Southern Border Wall to proceed. Big WIN for Border Security and the Rule of Law!"" he tweeted.

Prominent Democrats criticized the court's logic and Trump's plans to use earmarked funds in an effort to come through on his signature campaign issue. Many argue a wall will not slow the flow of migrants into the United States.

Arizona Rep. Raul M. Grijalva, whose district runs along the U.S.-Mexico border, called Trump's emergency declaration a ""pathetic attempt to circumvent Congress.""

""Trump’s fake emergency was nothing more than a pathetic ploy to circumvent Congress and build his monument to his racist policies. This fight is not over, and I will continue fighting Trump’s efforts to destroy our environment and militarize border communities. #NoBorderWall,"" he tweeted soon after the ruling broke.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called the ruling ""deeply flawed"" over Twitter.

""This evening’s Supreme Court ruling allowing @realDonaldTrump to steal military funds to spend on a wasteful, ineffective border wall rejected by Congress is deeply flawed. Our Founders designed a democracy governed by the people — not a monarchy.""

For his part, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer reminded his Twitter followers that when Trump was still a candidate for president, he promised that Mexico would pay for a border wall.

""It’s a sad day when the president is cheering a decision that may allow him to steal funds from our military to pay for an ineffective and expensive wall for which he promised Mexico would foot the bill,"" he posted.

He followed up with another tweet saying he hopes the courts will conclude Trump doesn't have the authority to build the wall.

Several Democratic presidential candidates also chimed in.

""Taking away money from the Defense Department to build a wall will not make us any safer. Trump’s political stunt will harm border communities & ignores the root causes of migration. We deserve a president with a common sense & compassionate immigration plan,"" former Housing Secretary Julian Castro tweeted.

Former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke, also in the running for the Democratic presidential nomination, likewise expressed disappointment.

""Deeply disappointed in the Supreme Court’s decision. I’ve long opposed building walls, and while in Congress, I introduced language to prevent DOD funds from being used to plan or build a wall along our border. As President, I would do everything in my power to make that law.""

""Congress did not appropriate these funds for Trump's medieval vanity project. Let's be clear: Trump's wall has never been about keeping the American people safe,"" tweeted California Sen. Kamala Harris.

""Diverting military funds for a vanity project is exactly who Donald Trump is. I will continue to fight back and join with those already challenging this wrong and misguided decision,"" New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker.

The American Civil Liberties Union said it plans to fight to keep Trump from using the funds for a wall that's already been denied by Congress.

President Donald Trump Calls For Investigation Into Obama Book Deals,https://deadline.com,['Bruce Haring'],07-27-2019,2019,7,https://deadline.com/2019/07/president-donald-trump-obama-book-dealls-investigation-1202655260/,"Frustrated by continued efforts by the Democratic congress to find a reason to impeach him, President Donald Trump fought back today, saying that an investigation should be mounted on the book deals signed by former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle.

The $65 million in multiple book deals spawned a best-seller for Michelle Obama, with Barack Obama’s memoir scheduled for some time next year.

Trump, speaking in the White House Oval Office on Friday, also called for an investigation into the Clinton Foundation, and put in a jab against Obama for ruining the White House air conditioning system, which he says can’t maintain a comfortable temperature.

The irritation by Trump was likely in response to the Democrats in the House Judiciary Committee stating that they were conducting an “impeachment investigation,” even after obtaining little new information from their big move, this week’s interrogation of Robert Mueller.

The Democrats today are now turning to have Mueller’s secret grand jury materials unsealed.

“All they want to do is impede. They want to investigate. They want to go fishing. And I watched Bob Mueller, and they have nothing,” Trump said. “There’s no collusion there’s no obstruction they have nothing. It’s a disgrace.”"
Donald Trump’s Entire Story About the Economy Fell Apart This Week,https://slate.com,['Jordan Weissmann'],07-26-2019,2019,7,https://slate.com/business/2019/07/trump-gdp-report-economy.html,"Donald Trump, maybe grimacing a little. Alex Wong/Getty Images

This week, much of the story that the White House likes to tell about its economic record fell apart.

It’s not just that growth appears to have slowed, though it has. On Friday, the Commerce Department reported that the country’s gross domestic product expanded at a middling 2.1 percent annual rate during the the second quarter, down from 3.1 percent over the first three months of 2019. This was only a preliminary estimate, a guesstimate really; the government will gather more data and revise that number in the coming months. But it was clearly worrisome to Donald Trump, who tried in vain to put a glass-half-full spin on the news while also placing blame for any weakness on his nemeses at the Federal Reserve.

Q2 GDP Up 2.1% Not bad considering we have the very heavy weight of the Federal Reserve anchor wrapped around our neck. Almost no inflation. USA is set to Zoom! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2019

Friday’s report also robbed the White House of a favorite talking point. Previously, the government believed that the economy grew by more than 3 percent in 2018, a mark it hadn’t hit in more than a decade. This milestone led Trump (or, really, his press shop) to boast that he had “accomplished an economic turnaround of historic proportions.” He was particularly jazzed that growth hit 4.1 percent for one quarter that year.

It turns out we didn’t reach 3 percent growth after all. In its annual data revisions, which also dropped Friday, the Commerce Department reported that the economy grew by just 2.5 percent or 2.9 percent in 2018, depending on exactly how you measure it. It also turns out that growth never actually hit 4 percent in the second quarter of 2018, which—despite being sort of meaningless—had been a point of pride for Trump. In short, goodbye, bragging rights.

Of course, whether or not our GDP growth rate managed to pass a somewhat arbitrary numerical threshold isn’t all that important in the scheme of things. But Friday’s numbers also dealt a deeper blow to the White House’s narrative about how it has supposedly resuscitated the economy from the doldrums of the late Obama years. Trump and his advisers like to claim that by loosening up regulations and cutting taxes on corporations, the administration unleashed a flood of new business investment that has helped push growth along. Their case has always been fairly flimsy: Much of the growth in business investment over the last couple of years was driven by the oil and gas industry, as frackers ramped up drilling in response to higher prices. Still, there was at least some uptick in business investment outside the fossil fuels sector that they could point to as proof that they were doing something right.

After the Commerce Department’s latest data revisions, that no longer seems to be the case. As Harvard Kennedy School economist and former Obama adviser Jason Furman notes, business investment outside of oil and mining has actually slowed down during the Trump administration. It’s possible the investment would be even weaker were it not for Trump’s tax cuts and deregulatory moves. But on the face of things, there’s really no obvious case to be made that they’ve unleashed a boom in business investment.

Jason Furman

In fact, it looks like we might even be heading into a bit of a bust. One major reason why growth slowed so much during the second quarter was that businesses actually cut back on overall investment for the first time since 2016. Somewhat ironically, much of that decline was due to retrenchment by the oil and gas industry, which until recently has been responsible for making Trump’s economic record look much stronger than it really is. Crude prices have had a rocky ride since 2018, and frackers have reduced their spending on new drills and other equipment. The retrenchment has been so severe that Halliburton, the biggest fracking services provider in the country, recently announced that it would lay off 8 percent of its North American workforce. Meanwhile, investment in other industries hasn’t been strong enough to pick up the slack. Donald Trump can’t control the price of oil. But he is responsible for the trade war with China, which has probably put a chill on some corporate spending.

Again, this could just be a blip, and it’s possible that as the data get revised, last quarter’s business investment might start to look stronger. But if it doesn’t, it won’t just be a strike against Trump’s story about the economy. It will also undercut years of conservative, supply-side orthodoxy. After all, when Republicans passed their massive corporate tax cut in 2017, their entire argument rested on the idea that it would lead to a surge in investment that would eventually lead to higher wages. Again, there’s no sign that has taken place. If the economy is reaping any benefit from the tax bill, it doesn’t seem to be strong enough to overcome the headwind of Donald Trump’s other rash decisions. Instead, what really appears to be driving the economy is a combination of consumer spending, perhaps plumped up by the tax cut, and federal deficits. The real story of the Trump economy, it seems, is about the power of stimulus spending—the sort of thing Republicans once claimed to hate."

New timeline emerges for DOJ inspector general report on FISA abuse,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-27-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/new-timeline-emerges-for-doj-inspector-general-report-on-fisa-abuse,"A new timeline has emerged in recent days for Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigation into alleged surveillance abuses by the DOJ and the FBI.

Whereas Attorney General William Barr predicted earlier this year that the watchdog's investigation would be finished by May or early June, now lawmakers are pointing to the early fall.

Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, told Maria Bartiromo on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures that he “expects that report later this fall.”

His colleague John Ratcliffe, who has spoken to Horowitz, gave a more specific target. The Texas congressman told Fox News' Bret Baier on Wednesday, ""I think that we will get the IG's report probably sometime right after Labor Day."" Labor Day is Sept. 2.

Further solidifying the prediction was a RealClearInvestigations report about former FBI Director James Comey having an inside man at the White House, feeding the bureau information about President Trump and his aides in 2017. That report also set a release date sometime in September.

The delay in Horowitz's work was reportedly due to his team's two-day meeting with Steele in person in London in early June, during President Trump’s state visit to the United Kingdom. Investigators found Steele's information credible enough to warrant extending their investigation.

Horowitz launched an investigation in March 2018 into whether the FBI and the Justice Department filing of four Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications and renewals beginning in October 2016 to surveil former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page was an abuse of the FISA process. The applications relied heavily upon the unverified dossier compiled by Steele, who was hired by Fusion GPS. The opposition research firm was hired by Marc Elias of the Perkins Coie law firm at the behest of the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. Steele's Democratic benefactors were not revealed to the FISA Court.

Meanwhile Barr's ""investigation into the investigators"" is underway, and the attorney general has said he is working very closely with Horowitz. The inspector general can recommend prosecutions, and U.S. Attorney John Durham, whom Barr tasked to lead the review, has the ability to convene a grand jury and subpoena people outside of the government. Beyond that, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, has promised a ""deep dive"" into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation after Horowitz completes his work.

Stay tuned to the Washington Examiner this weekend for closer look at what to expect from Horowitz's report."
T-Mobile and Sprint merger approved by Justice Department,https://www.theverge.com,['Jul'],07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/26/6646158/t-mobile-sprint-merger-justice-department-approves-26-billion-fcc,"The United States Justice Department has approved the $26 billion merger deal between T-Mobile and Sprint. After over a year in regulatory limbo, the merger received the green light from the last federal agency to hold out, with the Federal Communications Commission already signaling that it will approve the deal.

The Justice Department finally approved the deal after Dish reached an agreement with the carriers to acquire Boost Mobile, Virgin Mobile, Sprint’s prepaid business, and “certain” spectrum assets. This will position Dish as the replacement fourth major US carrier that will be lost once T-Mobile and Sprint merge. The two companies will be required to provide at least 20,000 cell sites and hundreds of retail locations to Dish, and the satellite TV provider will also get unfettered access to T-Mobile’s network for seven years as it works to build out a mobile network of its own using the newly acquired assets and spectrum that Dish has held on to for years. Dish has publicly remained silent on its plans throughout this entire process, but that is likely to change starting today.

“We are expanding output significantly”

“With this merger and accompanying divestiture, we are expanding output significantly by ensuring that large amount of currently unused or underused spectrum are made available to American consumers in the form of high quality 5G networks,” Makan Delrahim, assistant attorney general of the DOJ’s antitrust division, said.

T-Mobile and Sprint announced their intention to merge last April, claiming that their combined assets would make them a more viable competitor to AT&T and Verizon. The companies said they would be able to lower prices for consumers and more quickly deploy next-generation 5G networks across the country, which are arguments that have faced harsh criticism from consumer advocates and some experts.

Both the FCC and the Justice Department are required to approve the deal before it can move forward. The deal is likely to be approved by the FCC, although the official vote has yet to take place. In May, FCC chairman Ajit Pai announced that he would be voting to approve the deal after the companies made new promises to provide greater wireless and broadband access to rural areas.

“In light of the significant commitments made by T-Mobile and Sprint as well as the facts in the record to date, I believe that this transaction is in the public interest and intend to recommend to my colleagues that the FCC approve it,” Pai said. “This is a unique opportunity to speed up the deployment of 5G throughout the United States and bring much faster mobile broadband to rural Americans. We should seize this opportunity.”

T-Mobile and Dish will also be required to support e-sim technology to make switching carriers easier in hopes of spurring competition.

“This is a unique opportunity to speed up the deployment of 5G”

Shortly after Pai’s comments, the other two Republican commissioners voiced support for the deal as well, despite never seeing any documents related to the new promises. At a congressional hearing last month, commissioners Brendan Carr and Mike O’Rielly confirmed that they had yet to see the specifics of the agreement.

T-Mobile’s connections to the Trump administration have come under heightened scrutiny as the deal has progressed. In March, The Washington Post reported that the company had spent over $195,000 at the Trump Hotel in Washington, DC while lobbying for the merger.

Congress has held a number of hearings on the proposed merger, with many top Democrats (and even presidential candidates) criticizing it for shrinking the US’s major wireless carrier pool down from four to three providers. Lawmakers like Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Cory Booker (D-NJ) all signed letters to Pai and Delrahim, citing threats to market competition that could harm the US’s ability to lead in 5G.

“The best way to achieve the goal of high-quality, affordable, nationwide 5G is through competitive markets,” the senators wrote. “This merger moves us further away from the sort of competition we need to accomplish this aim. It will lead to excessive consolidation and undermine innovation.”

T-Mobile and Sprint’s main counterargument to those concerns was a proposed deal selling off Boost Mobile and a portion of their combined wireless spectrum. Dish will acquire the assets, a move that could supercharge the network into replacing the two companies as the fourth major carrier. Charter and Altice were also reportedly bidding for the spectrum, but Dish became the winner for both the spectrum and the additional assets.

T-Mobile has sought to merge with other major carriers in the past. In 2011, AT&T said that it would purchase T-Mobile for $39 billion, but a few months after the announcement, the DOJ nixed the deal. In 2012, T-Mobile reached an agreement with MetroPCS to take over the smaller company. The Sprint acquisition is now the company’s largest successful purchase.

The merger has one more hurdle to cross before the companies get the all-clear to finalize. Last month, over a dozen state attorneys general filed a multistate lawsuit to block the deal, headed by New York Attorney General Letitia James and California AG Xavier Becerra. “When it comes to corporate power, bigger isn’t always better,” James said. “The T-Mobile and Sprint merger would not only cause irreparable harm to mobile subscribers nationwide by cutting access to affordable, reliable wireless service for millions of Americans.”

In today’s announcement from the Justice Department, five states have agreed to settle including Nebraska, Kansas, Ohio, Oklahoma, and South Dakota. New York and California are still pushing the lawsuit opposing the deal.

“We intend to be prepared to go to trial to fight for a fair, competitive, and equitable marketplace for consumers nationwide,” Becerra said.

Now that the DOJ has approved the deal, T-Mobile and Sprint can move ahead. But if the states’ suit wins out in the end, the whole deal will have to be unwound."
Washington Post: Former Republican designed fake presidential seal that appeared behind Trump,https://www.cnn.com,['Veronica Stracqualursi'],07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/26/politics/presidential-seal-trump-charles-leazott-trnd/index.html,"Washington (CNN) A former Republican voter from Virginia is the man who made a parody image of the presidential seal that was shown behind President Donald Trump at a conservative teen summit, according to The Washington Post.

Graphic designer Charles Leazott, 46, created the fake presidential seal that features a two-headed eagle -- lifted from the Russian Federation coat of arms -- clutching a set of golf clubs in its talons, according to the Post

""This is the most petty piece of art I have ever created,"" Leazott told the Post

Leazott, who dislikes Trump and says he voted twice for George W. Bush, created the fake seal after the 2016 election as ""just a goofy thing for some people I knew,"" the Post reported.

Trump spoke on Tuesday at a summit for conservative students hosted by the group Turning Point USA, and for a brief moment, the President appeared before the doctored seal evoking imagery of the Russian coat of arms on stage.

DOJ’s Russia probe review focusing on 'smoking gun' tapes of meeting with Trump aide: sources,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dojs-russia-probe-review-focusing-on-tapes-of-talks-with-trump-aide-sources,"The Justice Department’s internal review of the Russia investigation is zeroing in on transcripts of recordings made by at least one government source who met with former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos overseas in 2016, specifically looking at why certain ""exculpatory"" material from them was not presented in subsequent applications for surveillance warrants, according to two sources familiar with the review.

The sources also said the review is taking a closer look at the actual start date of the original FBI investigation into potential collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians, as some allege the probe began earlier than thought. Both components are considered key in the review currently being led by Attorney General Bill Barr and U.S. Attorney from Connecticut John Durham -- an effort sure to draw more attention in the coming weeks and months now that Robert Mueller's testimony is in the rearview.

REPUBLICANS CONFRONT MUELLER WITH ALLEGATIONS OF DOUBLE STANDARD IN RUSSIA PROBE

The recordings in question pertain to conversations between government sources and Papadopoulos, which were memorialized in transcripts. One source told Fox News that Barr and Durham are reviewing why the material was left out of applications to surveil another former Trump campaign aide, Carter Page.

“I think it’s the smoking gun,” the source said.

“These recordings have exculpatory evidence,” the other source added. “It is standard tradecraft to record conversations with someone like Papadopoulos—especially when they are overseas and there are no restrictions.”

Prior to the 2016 presidential election, Papadopoulos met with Maltese professor Joseph Mifsud in London, who told him that the Russians had dirt in the form of emails that could damage Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Papadopoulos then told Australian diplomat Alexander Downer of the new information. Downer reported Papadopoulos’ comments to him to the FBI.

A source told Fox News that the ""exculpatory evidence"" included in the transcripts is Papadopoulos denying having any contact with the Russians to obtain the supposed ""dirt"" on Clinton.

But Papadopoulos did not only meet with Mifsud and Downer while overseas. He met with Cambridge professor and longtime FBI informant Stefan Halper and his female associate, who went under the alias Azra Turk. Papadopoulos told Fox News that he saw Turk three times in London: once over drinks, once over dinner and once with Halper. He also told Fox News back in May that he always suspected he was being recorded. Further, he tweeted during the Mueller testimony about ""recordings"" of his meeting with Downer.

It is unclear, at this point, which of these individuals may have recorded conversations with Papadopoulos.

Former Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., now a Fox News contributor, first signaled the existence of transcripts of secretly recorded conversations between FBI informants and Papadopoulos earlier this year.

“If the bureau’s going to send in an informant, the informant’s going to be wired, and if the bureau is monitoring telephone calls, there’s going to be a transcript of that,” Gowdy said in May on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures,” acknowledging he was aware of the files and suggesting they included exculpatory information.

TREY GOWDY: SECRET FBI TRANSCRIPTS FROM RUSSIA PROBE COULD BE 'GAME-CHANGER'

“Some of us have been fortunate enough to know whether or not those transcripts exist. But they haven’t been made public, and I think one, in particular ... has the potential to actually persuade people,"" he continued. “Very little in this Russia probe I’m afraid is going to persuade people who hate Trump or love Trump. But there is some information in these transcripts that has the potential to be a game-changer if it’s ever made public.”

The transcripts are currently classified, according to sources, but under President Trump’s move in May to approve declassification of documents related to the surveillance of his campaign during the 2016 election, Barr will likely have access to those documents in a declassified format.

A source told Fox News that without the declassification order signed by Trump, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats was not going to give anyone access to the files—over concerns for protecting sources and methods. But another source told Fox News in May that Coats, along with CIA Director Gina Haspel and FBI Director Chris Wray, are all working “collaboratively” with Barr and Durham on the review.

Barr and Durham are also trying to pinpoint the actual “start date” of the investigation, according to a source.

It has been widely reported, at this point, that the investigation was officially opened by former FBI senior counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok on July 31, 2016, after Downer shared the information that Papadopoulos was told the Russians had “dirt” on Clinton. But some suggest the probe began before that date.

On Wednesday, House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., challenged former Special Counsel Mueller over when the investigation started.

""The FBI claims the counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign began on July 31, 2016, but in fact, it began before that,"" Nunes said. ""In June 2016, before the investigation was officially opened, Trump campaign associates Carter Page and Stephen Miller were invited to attend a symposium at Cambridge University in July 2016. Your office, however, did not investigate who was responsible for inviting these Trump associates to the symposium.""

Mueller replied: ""Those areas...I'm going to stay away from.""

Meanwhile, Papadopoulos said that in May 2016, he was approached by two U.S. military officials based in the U.S. Embassy in London—Gregory Baker and Terrence Dudley. He told Fox News they were questioning him about his ties in the Middle East and Trump's relationship with Russia.

“Both wanted to ingratiate themselves in campaign via myself,” Papadopoulos tweeted last year.

It is unclear at this point what, if any, involvement Baker and Dudley had in collecting intelligence related to the Trump campaign. Both Baker and Dudley disputed Papadopoulos’ tweet, and reportedly said they reached out to him out of curiosity.

The president, his surrogates and Republicans on Capitol Hill since the start of the Mueller investigation have called for a separate probe into the Russia investigation's beginnings. Barr earlier this year assigned Durham to probe “all intelligence collection activities” related to the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election.

The Barr-Durham review is likely to draw more attention following Mueller’s highly anticipated testimony on Capitol Hill. Republicans sought to focus their questioning on the origins of the Russia investigation under then-Director James Comey's FBI—a topic Mueller repeatedly said was “out of his purview” due to the ongoing investigation being led by the Justice Department. Another review is being conducted by the DOJ inspector general.

“Maybe a better course of action is to figure out how the false accusations started,” Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said Wednesday. “Here’s the good news—that’s exactly what Bill Barr is doing and thank goodness for that.”"
T-Mobile-Sprint merger gains Justice Department OK thanks to Dish,https://www.cnet.com,['Eli Blumenthal'],07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnet.com/news/t-mobile-and-sprint-deal-wins-justice-department-ok-thanks-to-dish/,"Josh Miller/CNET

After more than a year of regulatory battles, T-Mobile's $26.5 billion takeover of Sprint is this close to happening. Justice Department antitrust head Makan Delrahim said Friday that the DOJ will approve the deal because T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom signed an agreement to sell off several Sprint assets to Dish Network, creating a new nationwide wireless carrier.

Under the agreement, Dish will acquire Sprint's 800Mhz wireless spectrum, Sprint's prepaid brands -- Boost, Virgin Mobile and Sprint prepaid -- and their combined 9.3 million customers, as well as network agreements that will allow Dish to use T-Mobile's network for seven years while it builds out its own 5G network.

Now playing: Watch this: T-Mobile-Sprint merger: What it means for you

T-Mobile and Sprint will also need to give Dish access to ""at least 20,000 cell sites"" as well as ""hundreds of retail locations."" In a joint press release, T-Mobile and Sprint say that Dish will be able to ""take on leases for certain cell sites and retail locations that are decommissioned by the New T-Mobile for five years"" after the divestiture closes.

Dish will pay T-Mobile approximately $5 billion for the assets it is acquiring: $1.4 billion for the prepaid businesses and $3.6 billion for the spectrum.

The move could reshape the wireless industry and shake up where you get your wireless service. The deal gives Dish the tools to quickly enter the wireless business by accessing T-Mobile's network. T-Mobile, meanwhile, will combine with Sprint to create a much tougher competitor for AT&T and Verizon in the US wireless market. T-Mobile has argued that its combination with Sprint will supercharge its deployment of 5G across the country, as well as expand its customer reach and scale to match the Big Two: AT&T and Verizon.

At the close of the deal, which T-Mobile says it expects will be in the second half of 2019, Sprint's prepaid businesses and customers will ""immediately move to Dish, as will the more than 400 employees and nationwide independent retail network that supports more than 7,500 retail outlets,"" Dish said in a statement.

There remains some questions about Dish's legitimacy as a wireless player -- one of the primary concerns of the state attorneys general that have sued to block to merger. Dish, after all, has shown little interest before in starting its own wireless service despite sitting on a mountain of valuable spectrum.

But CEO John Legere offered a rare defense of an outside company.

""Dish will be a very credible disruptive fourth player,"" Legere said on a call with analysts and media on Friday.

Double impact

Exactly when Dish will enter the market, however, is unclear as it needs to wait on the completion of the T-Mobile-Sprint merger before it can take on the divested assets. The company, however, says that it will have a ""5G broadband network capable of serving 70 percent of the U.S. population by June 2023.""

T-Mobile Chief Technology Officer Neville Ray said Dish and the other wireless resellers will be able to access its upcoming 5G network right away. A decade ago when 4G was on the rise, the carriers were protective of its then-new network, preventing so-called mobile virtual network operators from using it. Likewise, the company will honor all reseller agreements that Sprint has, including a deal with cable provider Altice.

Now playing: Watch this: How fast is T-Mobile's 5G network? We took it for a test...

Dish has long sought to enter the wireless business. It's been accumulating billions of dollars' worth of wireless airwaves in recent spectrum auctions, facing a deadline of March 2020 to put that to use or risk losing its license. Dish previously said it was working on a narrowband wireless network for ""internet of things"" devices -- such as smart thermostats, energy meters, traffic lights and security systems -- although that network isn't designed for mobile phones and tablets.

As part of the deal it made with the DOJ and T-Mobile, Dish says that it has ""requested that its spectrum licenses be modified"" to reflect its new promise of deploying a 5G network that covers by 70 percent of the population by June 2023.

Dish has made plenty of promises for an eventual wireless 5G network. But through the T-Mobile deal it will be able to offer wireless calling, texting and data services on the combined T-Mobile-Sprint network while it builds out its own service.

Dish could follow in Sprint's footsteps with aggressive offers to try to court subscribers away from the new Big Three, but that play didn't work out for Sprint in the long term. But in recent years, both Sprint and T-Mobile put pressure on AT&T and Verizon with unlimited data plans, cheaper monthly rates and bundles that added subscriptions to services such as Netflix, Hulu, Spotify, Tidal and Amazon Prime.

Friday's ""developments are the fulfillment of more than two decades' worth of work and more than $21 billion in spectrum investments intended to transform DISH into a connectivity company,"" said Dish co-founder and chairman Charlie Ergen in a statement. ""Taken together, these opportunities will set the stage for our entry as the nation's fourth facilities-based wireless competitor and accelerate our work to launch the country's first standalone 5G broadband network.""

""It's a big win for US leadership in 5G,"" Brendan Carr, the Republican Federal Communications Commissioner, said in an interview. He agrees with the argument that the combined companies can build a network that neither could do alone.

T-Mobile, meanwhile, gets the size and customer base to better compete with its larger rivals. The telecom business has been dependent on scale, with a larger subscriber base funding investments in network upgrades. T-Mobile will be keeping Sprint's 2.5Ghz spectrum, the radiowaves Sprint is already using to deploy 5G in five cities across the country. That's a valuable swath of spectrum as the company looks to roll 5G to a broader portion of the country.

""With this merger and accompanying divestiture, we are expanding output significantly by ensuring that large amounts of currently unused or underused spectrum are made available to American consumers in the form of high quality 5G networks,"" said Delrahim.

Pricing changes?

When asked about whether this deal would lead to an end of an era of aggressive promotions and cheaper plans, T-Mobile Chief Operating Officer Mike Sievert dismissed the notion.

""We're going to take the enhanced capability and go after AT&T and Verizon like they've never seen before,"" he said.

T-Mobile has agreed to lock in prices for the next three years, although it hasn't talked about Sprint's plans. Legere hinted at big things ahead.

""We'll waste no time making it clear what this network is capable of,"" he said, also dismissing the notion that T-Mobile would become fat and arrogant like its rivals.

Sievert also reiterated the company's plans to eventually offer 100 megabits per second of coverage to 99% of Americans, and Ray talked about its existing plans to offer nationwide 5G by next year.

Challenges still lie ahead

While the DOJ decision smooths the path for the T-Mobile-Sprint deal, it's not signed, sealed and delivered just yet.

Thirteen state attorneys general, as well as the District of Columbia, have filed a multistate lawsuit to block the T-Mobile-Sprint deal on the grounds that it will lead to higher prices and less competition. Although the new agreement paves the way for Dish to replace Sprint as a fourth wireless carrier, it remains to be seen whether the states will continue to pursue their legal action.

In addition to brokering a deal between T-Mobile and Dish, the DOJ also reached a settlement with five state attorneys general offices: Nebraska, Kansas, Ohio, Oklahoma, and South Dakota.

It has not yet reached an agreement with New York or California, which are leading the lawsuit against the merger. In a statement released by New York Attorney General Letitia James the group of 13 states, as well as the District of Columbia, reinforced their opposition to the deal, citing Dish's previous broken promises and its reliance on using T-Mobile's network for ""for the foreseeable future.""

""The promises made by Dish and T-Mobile in this deal are the kinds of promises only robust competition can guarantee,"" said James in a statement. ""We have serious concerns that cobbling together this new fourth mobile player, with the government picking winners and losers, will not address the merger's harm to consumers, workers, and innovation.""

""A marketplace with fewer active competitors drives up costs, reduces consumer choice and thwarts innovation,"" said California Attorney General Xavier Becerra. ""We intend to be prepared to go to trial to fight for a fair, competitive, and equitable marketplace for consumers nationwide.""

The California Public Utilities Commission also needs to give its blessing to the deal, and a report Wednesday said that cable giant Charter wanted to bid on Sprint assets but never heard back from the DOJ. It's unclear what possible implications that news might have on T-Mobile's deals with both Sprint and Dish.

On the call, Legere said the priority is to work out the concerns of the state AGs as well as the California commission. Sievert said the companies wouldn't move forward on the deal without ending the litigation first.

Different technologies

There's also the wrinkle of having to integrate two networks with different technologies. T-Mobile has a mixture of 5G, 4G LTE and 3G based on GSM technology. Sprint, meanwhile, has 5G, 4G LTE and a 3G technology called CDMA.

Working in the companies' favor: Many popular 4G handsets, including recent iPhones and Galaxy phones, pack support for both carriers' networks. Google's Fi already seamlessly switches between T-Mobile and Sprint for its mobile service.

But we've also seen what happens when integrations aren't handled properly. Sprint disastrously tried to straddle both network technologies when it merged with Nextel in 2005. T-Mobile faced a similar scenario when it purchased MetroPCS, which also used CDMA technology. But under T-Mobile Chief Technology Officer Neville Ray, T-Mobile smoothly transitioned customers off the old network.

This will all, of course, be happening at a much larger scale with Sprint, which has 54.5 million customers to go with T-Mobile's 83.1 million.

Donald Trump Gets Punked … By A Conservative Group?,https://www.fitsnews.com,[],07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.fitsnews.com/2019/07/26/donald-trump-gets-punked-by-a-conservative-group/,"There is a crazy story coming out of our nation’s capital involving U.S. president Donald Trump, who dodged a major bullet this week when former U.S. special counsel Robert Mueller utterly bombed in a hearing that was supposed to have served as Democrats’ prelude to impeachment.

“If Democrats want to get rid of (Trump), they’re going to have to do it at the ballot box in November 2020,” noted Robert Romano for The Daily Torch. “There is not going to be any impeachment now.”

We agree … but Trump was humiliated in Washington, D.C. this week.

In a bizarre and yet-to-be-explained turn of events, a prominent conservative organization – Turning Point USA – embarrassed Trump during his appearance at the group’s “Teen Student Action Summit.”

What happened?

According to reporters Reis Thebault and Michael Brice-Saddler of The Washington Post, Trump’s appearance was marred by the presence of a fake presidential seal on a digital display behind him – one that mocked him as a “puppet” of the Russian government.

The graphic artist who created the fake seal “substituted the arrows in the eagle’s claw for a set of golf clubs – a nod to the president’s favorite pastime,” Thebault and Brice-Saddler noted.

“In the other set of talons, he swapped the olive branch for a wad of cash and replaced the United States’ Latin motto with a Spanish insult,” they added. “Then, his coup de grace: a two-headed imperial bird lifted straight from the Russian coat of arms, an homage to the president’s checkered history with the adversarial country.”

Take a look …

(Via: Reddit)

The fact someone made this seal is sufficiently funny in its own right. The fact Trump appeared at an event – beaming and clapping while standing in front of it?

That is hilarious …

Adding a layer of intrigue? The group’s botched response to the scandal.

A spokesperson for Turning Point USA – a youth outreach group which claims to be “Winning America’s Culture War” – blamed the issue on a “last-minute oversight” and a “hasty Google search.”

The designer of the seal, 46-year-old Charles Leazott of Richmond, Virginia, called bull on that explanation.

“That’s a load of crap,” he told the Post. “You have to look for this. There’s no way this was an accident is all I’m saying.”

According to Leazott, the individual who found the seal online had to dig for it … meaning its on-screen placement during Trump’s appearance was deliberately malicious (contrary to Turning Point USA’s claims to the contrary).

While we find this entire episode amusing, our guess is Trump does not.

Of course Trump is likely more disappointed by the failure of groups like this to make a dent in his abysmal standing with millennial voters – who are going to comprise a huge chunk of the 2020 electorate.

Senators who visited border ask DHS to improve migrant care,https://www.aol.com,"['Aol Staff', 'Leigh Ann Caldwell']",07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.aol.com/article/news/2019/07/26/senators-who-visited-border-ask-dhs-to-improve-migrant-care/23779134/,"WASHINGTON — After visiting migrant detention centers near the southern border, Senate Democrats are requesting that the Department of Homeland Security make immediate changes to its detention centers, citing ""serious concerns"" with conditions.

In a letter signed by 13 Democrats who visited Customs and Border Patrol processing centers near the border last week, the senators list 18 actions the agency should take immediately that they say would ensure humane treatment of migrant children and result in better oversight of the facilities.

CBP processing centers have been scrutinized as migrants, including children, have been held in sub par conditions far longer than the 72-hour limit with reports of abuse and mistreatment.

The senators are asking acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan and acting Commissioner of CBP, Mark Morgan, to respond to their request by Thursday and provide a telephone briefing by Aug. 10 with an update on if the requests are being addressed.

Among the senators' requests: improve the water quality at the McAllen Border Patrol Station; provide schedules to Congress indicating that migrants can make phone calls, eat, take showers and brush their teeth; darken rooms so children can sleep.

The letter notes that the senators want to know if the migrants can report claims of abuse and what type of medical and psychological care the migrants have access to, and if DHW will support additional independent monitoring of facilities.

Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., is the highest ranking member of Congress to visit the border. He and 12 other Democratic senators visited the Border Patrol processing facility in McAllen, as well as processing centers Donna and Ursula, also in Texas.

""The searing accounts about the conditions endured by migrant families are true. We saw overcrowding. We heard migrants tell us that they were unable to brush their teeth, shower, call their families, or access feminine hygiene products,"" Schumer said on the Senate floor earlier this week. ""We saw children in soiled clothing, caged and expressionless — heartbreaking, thousand-mile stares on the faces of toddlers…where smiles and laughter should have been.""

The letter notes that a July inspector general report instructed DHS to ""take immediate steps to alleviate dangerous overcrowding and prolonged detention of children and adults.""

Aaron Hull, head of the Border Patrol's El Paso Sector, will be reassigned to Detroit on Monday, according to documents obtained by NBC News.

Treasury pick Monica Crowley spread Obama smears: 'Can he be both loyal to Islam and loyal to the United States?',https://www.cnn.com,"['Andrew Kaczynski', 'Nathan Mcdermott']",07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/25/politics/kfile-monica-crowley/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump's pick for the top spokeswoman job at the Treasury Department repeatedly spread conspiracy theories that suggested then-President Barack Obama was secretly a Muslim who was sympathetic to America's enemies.

Crowley also endorsed a story claiming Obama was an ""Islamic community organizer"" trying to conform the United States to Sharia law and claimed conspiracy theories about Obama's birth certificate were ""legitimate concerns."" During Obama's presidency, Trump was one of the most prominent voices pushing the so-called birther conspiracy theories questioning Obama's birthplace. When he was seeking the presidency himself and under continual questioning, Trump finally admitted that Obama was born in the US but offered no apologies or explanation for the years he spent sowing doubt about Obama's origins.

Crowley, formerly a syndicated radio host, columnist and Fox News contributor, was originally chosen by Trump in December 2016 to be the senior director of strategic communications for the National Security Council. She withdrew herself from consideration for that position after CNN's KFile team uncovered extensive plagiarism in her book and doctoral thesis.

Crowley did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the Treasury Department also did not respond to a request for comment.

Suggested Obama was a Muslim

Writing on her blog in August 2010 , Crowley blasted Obama for supporting the right to build an Islamic community center and mosque in lower Manhattan. Some conservatives seized on the issue making it a flash-point and objecting to, at times using highly inflammatory rhetoric, building a mosque so close to the site of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

Crowley wrote that Obama had loyalties to Islam and questioned if he could support both Islam and the United States.

""Maybe politics didn't have anything to do with it, but Islam certainly did. And does. Obama was born to a Muslim father, which under Islam automatically made him a Muslim. He says he converted to Christianity as an adult, which under Islam makes him an apostate,"" wrote Crowley. ""He grew up in Indonesia, which is the most populous Muslim nation on earth. His stepfather was also a Muslim. He was steeped in Islam throughout his formative years, so it should come as no surprise that he has loyalties to Islam. During the 2008 campaign, he even slipped and claimed that the United States has '57' states, instead of 50. The number of Muslim states in the Organization of the Islamic Conference is 57.""

""It may not come as a shock that he appears loyal to Islam. The question is: can he be both loyal to Islam and loyal to the United States?"" she added.

Crowley added, ""How could he....support the enemy?""

Called birther conspiracy theories legitimate

Writing in a blog post in April 2011 after the release of Obama's long-form birth certificate, Crowley praised Donald Trump for questioning Obama's citizenship and called concerns about the birth certificate legitimate.

""If the birth certificate were never a big deal, why did No Drama Obama wait nearly 3 years before releasing it? Why endure and stoke all of the drama? To make those raising legitimate concerns about his origins and policies look like kooks? Maybe,"" wrote Crowley.

""For over 2 1/2 years, questions have been raised about Obama's origins and background,"" she added. ""He was never properly vetted by an adoring press corps, so outstanding concerns existed about his birth certificate (the long-form of which he had never released), where he grew up, his family's religious background, his parents' political beliefs, how he got into top schools such as Columbia and Harvard Law, how he paid for his education, what his grades were, etc. The questions were and are legitimate, and yet were never fully answered. In fact, anyone daring to ask them was painted as a fringe moron at best and racist at worst.""

In 2011, Hawaiian officials, at Obama's request, released the long form of his birth certificate. It indicated that he had, indeed, been born in Hawaii. Conspiracy theorists continue to allege the document was a forgery.

Said Obama was on the side of terrorists

Writing a bout the Obama administration in June 2013 , Crowley said it looked the Muslim Brotherhood was dictating American foreign policy.

""The Muslim Brotherhood is a sworn enemy of the United States. In Obama, they have found an ally. What does that say about Obama? I'm sure you can figure that one out,"" she wrote. ""What it says about America's national security is that it looks increasingly like it's being dictated BY that sworn enemy.""

Writing in a January 2009 blog post, Crowley singled out Obama for using his full name at his swearing in (presidents typically are sworn in using their full names) and decisions related to banning the use of torture and closing of the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention center as actions that raised questions about the president's sympathies.

""Barack Obama insisted on being sworn in as president with his full name, Barack Hussein Obama. One of his very first things he did as president was to order the closure of the terrorist detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,"" she wrote, without noting that Obama had campaigned on this issue, the facility had been a top concern for human rights defenders. ""The two things he did along with that was to order a halt to the prosecutions of terrorist suspects there, including the mastermind of the September 11th attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and other top al Qaeda terrorists, like Ramzi Binalshibh. He also issued an order against the use of enhanced interrogation tactics on such terrorists, including waterboarding.

""Now comes word that he is granting his first formal television interview as president to Al-Arabiya,"" she added. ""Tells you where his head is, and possibly, his sympathies. Just sayin'.""

""The administration, with Obama as Islamic community organizer, is not only placating Muslims and, in particular, our Islamic enemies; it is conforming US policy to Islam and Sharia,"" reads the column.

""Obama's actions may, however, actually betray a more nefarious strategy: do as little as politically possible so as to foment chaos across the region, all to the benefit of his seeming policy ""companions"" dedicated to promoting Sharia and Islamic statehood- the Muslim Brotherhood and the Islamic Republic of Iran- while defanging the US's best ally in the region, Israel. Despite public pressure, resist confronting ISIS/ISIL and Bashar Assad in any truly meaningful way and turn his back on the Christian genocide exploding across the region. In addition, flood the US with Muslim immigrants while keeping it bound to foreign oil despite remarkable innovations at home that can render it virtually energy independent."""
DOJ pursuing transcripts of George Papadopoulos tapes in review of Russia investigation origins,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/doj-pursuing-transcripts-of-george-papadopoulos-tapes-in-review-of-russia-investigation-origins,"The Justice Department is intent on reviewing transcripts of recordings that at least one government informant made of conversations with former Trump campaign associate George Papadopoulos.

Little is known about these classified transcripts, including who is the source, other than the growing hype about them in conservative circles. Former Rep. Trey Gowdy called them a ""game changer"" in a Fox News interview in May.

But progress is being made to peel back the mystery, according to a Fox News report, as Attorney General William Barr and U.S. Attorney John Durham's investigation into the origins of the Russia investigation and possible misconduct by DOJ and FBI officials ramps up.

A key element to their disclosure may be President Trump granting Barr “full and complete authority to declassify information” in the Justice Department inquiry.

Trump expressed confidence in Barr during a Fox News interview Thursday evening, reiterating Barr's power to uncover and release information related to the inquiry. ""Anything he needs, he's got it,” Trump said.

Barr tasked Durham, who hails from Connecticut, with leading the inquiry sometime in the spring.

Investigators looking at why certain ""exculpatory"" material from these transcripts was not presented in subsequent applications for surveillance warrants against another Trump campaign aide, Carter Page.

“I think it’s the smoking gun,” one source said.

Without Trump's declassification order, one source said Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats would not have allowed anyone to have access to these mysterious records. But another source stressed that Coats as well as FBI Director Christopher Wray and CIA Director Gina Haspel are cooperating with DOJ's investigation.

Papadopoulos was swept up in Robert Mueller’s special counsel investigation, under suspicion of trying to make inroads with the Russians. His interactions with the mysterious Maltese academic Joseph Mifsud allegedly led to the FBI opening a counterintelligence inquiry into the Trump campaign in July 2016, which predated Mueller's appointment. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty in October 2017 to making false statements to the FBI about his contacts with Mifsud and served just 12 days in federal prison late last year. He is now on supervised release.

Mueller's report said that during a 2016 meeting in London, Mifsud informed Papadopoulos that he learned that the Russians had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton, Trump's presidential rival, in the form of ""thousands of emails."" Papadopoulos later repeated this claim to Australian diplomat Alexander Downer, who informed the U.S. government and the FBI says this prompted the original counterintelligence investigation into Trump's campaign. Mifsud has denied that he told Papadopoulos the Russians had Clinton's emails.

Papadopoulos also said he told the Greek foreign minister that the Russians had damaging information about Clinton.

During his testimony before the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees on Wednesday, Mueller repeatedly shot down GOP attempts to get him to discuss the early stages of the counterintelligence investigation that preceded his May 2017 appointment as special counsel, including why Mifsud was never charged for lying.

A report published by the Hill on the eve of Mueller's testimony this week said Durham's investigators have reached out to Mifsud's attorney to set up an interview with Mifsud, who has laid low for the past couple years. Democratic National Committee lawyers said last year Mifsud may even be dead.

The transcripts that are now a focus of Durham's inquiry may come from conversations Papadopoulos had with Stefan Halper, an American professor at Cambridge University who is believed to be an FBI informant, and a woman who posed as his assistant and called herself Azra Turk.

During one of Papadopoulos' meetings with Halper in September 2016, the woman identified as Turk asked him point blank if Trump's campaign was working with the Russians to get hacked emails. Papadopoulos discussed this woman in his book, Deep State Target. He doubted she was being forthcoming about her identity.

The FBI has cited Papadopoulos' telling Downer about the Russians having dirt on Clinton as the reason the bureau officially began the Trump-Russia investigation, known as Crossfire Hurricane, on July 31, 2016. But a source said another element of the DOJ investigation is to determine the actual “start date” of the investigation, as Republican lawmakers such as Devin Nunes say it may have started earlier."
Attorney General William Barr orders first federal executions in nearly two decades,https://www.cnbc.com,['Tucker Higgins'],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/25/william-barr-orders-first-federal-executions-in-nearly-two-decades.html,"The federal government will resume executing death row inmates after nearly two decades without doing so, the Department of Justice announced Thursday.

Attorney General William Barr directed the Bureau of Prisons to schedule the executions of five inmates convicted of murder and other crimes. The executions have been scheduled for December 2019 and January 2020.

The department also announced a new execution protocol, replacing the three-drug cocktail previously used in federal executions with the single drug, pentobarbital.

The last federal execution was carried out in 2003. There are 62 individuals on federal death row, according to a tracker maintained by the Death Penalty Information Center.

The Supreme Court outlawed state and federal death penalty laws in the 1972 decision Furman v. Georgia. The ruling invalidated the laws then on the books, but did not outlaw the death penalty under all circumstances, leading states and the federal government to draft new legislation.

The federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988, and expanded by Congress in 1994. No federal executions took place, however, until 2001, according to to the Bureau of Prisons website.

""Congress has expressly authorized the death penalty through legislation adopted by the people's representatives in both houses of Congress and signed by the President,"" Barr said in a statement. ""Under Administrations of both parties, the Department of Justice has sought the death penalty against the worst criminals, including these five murderers, each of whom was convicted by a jury of his peers after a full and fair proceeding."""
"Trump appears in front of doctored seal with Russian and golf imagery, TPUSA aide fired",https://www.cnn.com,['Betsy Klein'],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/25/politics/trump-russia-presidential-seal-tpusa-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) An audiovisual aide for conservative student group Turning Point USA was fired this week after President Donald Trump appeared on a stage in front of a parody image of the presidential seal at its Teen Student Action Summit.

Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images

As the President took the stage Tuesday morning before a sea of 1,500 teenage cell phones, a screen behind him showed a fake presidential seal featuring a two-headed eagle -- which bore similarity to the State seal of the Russian Federation -- clutching a set of golf clubs in its talons. The seal was visible for a short time behind Trump, who stood behind a podium affixed with the official (and un-doctored) presidential seal for the duration of his speech.

TPUSA apologized for the incident, telling CNN there was ""zero malicious intent"" behind the imagery.

""We're sorry for the mix-up and meant no disrespect to the White House or the President or the advance team,"" the TPUSA source said.

The individual responsible, a member of TPUSA's AV team, was let go in the wake of the incident. According to a source familiar with the event, the incident was just a terrible Google search mistake. TPUSA had event branding on the screens, but during a run through ahead of Trump's remarks a few hours before the event, the team was told they had to change the branding to a presidential seal, prompting a search for a high quality image.

"Bitcoin Escrow Firm Bilked Investors for $7 Million, DOJ Says",https://www.coindesk.com,[],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.coindesk.com/doj-says-bitcoin-escrow-firm-bilked-investors-for-7-million,"U.S. prosecutors have charged the head of a bitcoin escrow company with defrauding investors for $7 million.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of New York, part of the Department of Justice (DOJ), brought two counts each of commodity and wire fraud against Jon Barry Thompson, principal of Volatnis Escrow Platform LLC. In a complaint unsealed Thursday, he is accused of making misleading statements about investment risks and false representations of his custody and control of digital assets.

U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said in a statement:

“As his clients soon realized, however, Thompson’s representations were false, and these cryptocurrency investors ultimately lost all of the money they had entrusted with him because of his lies.”

Thompson “preyed” on his clients’ lack of information regarding the emerging asset class, prosecutors said. In promotional materials and communication with clients, he allegedly presented himself as a competent investor, custodian, or financier.

The two companies Thompson allegedly defrauded sent him multi-million-dollar wires hoping to receive bitcoin in exchange. Prosecutors alleged that Thompson told one client, “cash is with me, coin is with me,” though he had sent their $3 million to a third-party exchange, skimming thousands off the top for personal use, without first obtaining any bitcoin.

The DOJ did not identify either alleged victim. According to a Forbes article published in January, Volantis negotiated a deal to transfer 6,600 bitcoin to Symphony, a crypto investments firm, but “the transaction never closed.”

Thompson, who was arrested Thursday in Pennsylvania, faces a maximum sentence of 40 years.

Déjà vu: Mueller again causes confusion on his reason for not charging Trump,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/deja-vu-mueller-again-causes-confusion-on-his-reason-for-not-charging-trump,"Robert Mueller caused confusion during his testimony in front of the House Judiciary Committee as he appeared to contradict Attorney General William Barr, as well as declined to stand by a previous official statement from his own special counsel’s office, related to the decision-making behind not charging President Trump with any crimes.

Mueller’s report did not reach a determination on obstruction of justice in his 448-page report, although he laid out 10 possible instances of obstruction. Mueller’s report referenced a longtime Office of Legal Counsel opinion that a sitting president cannot be indicted, but his report did not explicitly claim that that was the only reason Trump wasn’t charged in the investigation. Moreover, Barr said in April that Mueller told him that Mueller was not saying that he would have charged Trump with a crime but for the Office of Legal Counsel opinion and, in addition, a joint statement from the offices of Mueller and Barr in May reiterated that point.

But Wednesday, Mueller appeared to reverse course, appearing to say that he would have charged Trump with a crime if not for the Office of Legal Counsel opinion.

Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu of California asked, “I’d like to ask you the reason, again, you did not indict Donald Trump is because of OLC opinion stating that you cannot indict a sitting president, correct?”

“That is correct,” Mueller said.

Republican Rep. Debbie Lesko of Arizona pressed him on this, saying “that is not what you said in the report and that is not what you told Attorney General Barr.” Lesko also pointed to the joint statement he put out earlier this year, saying there was no daylight between himself and Barr on that issue. She quoted from that statement, reading, “The Attorney General has previously stated that the Special Counsel repeatedly affirmed that he was not saying that, but for the OLC opinion, he would have found the President obstructed justice.”

“So, Mr. Mueller, do you stand by your joint statement that you issued on May 29th as you sit here today?” Lesko asked.

Mueller declined to stand by the official statement from his own office from less than two months ago.

“I would have to look at it more closely before I said I agree with it,” Mueller said.

“My conclusion is that what you told Mr. Lieu really contradicts what you said in the report and what you said apparently repeatedly to Attorney General Barr,” Lesko replied. “And then you issued a joint statement on May 29.”

Lesko was referencing a nearly identical controversy which took place following Mueller’s press conference in late May. “The special counsel's office is part of the Department of Justice, and by regulation, it was bound by that department policy. Charging the president with a crime was therefore not an option we could consider,"" Mueller said at that time. ""The department's written opinion explaining the policy makes several important points that further informed our handling of the obstruction investigation.""

After Mueller's roughly nine-minute statement, politicians, pundits, and journalists interpreted Mueller’s remarks as a clear break from what Barr stated, suggesting that Mueller was saying that the only reason he didn’t charge Trump was the Office of Legal Counsel opinion.

But Barr said in April that he and then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein met with Mueller in early March and that they “specifically asked him about the OLC opinion and whether or not he was taking a position that he would have found a crime but for the existence of the OLC opinion.”

“And he made it very clear several times that that was not his position,” Barr said in April. “He was not saying that but for the OLC opinion, he would have found a crime. He made it clear that he had not made the determination that there was a crime.”

Barr and Rosenstein concluded that obstruction had not occurred.

After the May press conference, the Justice Department and the Office of Special Counsel put on a united front that was intended to end speculation that Mueller contradicted Barr on the decision-making on whether Trump could be charged with obstruction of justice during his public address.

“The Attorney General has previously stated that the Special Counsel repeatedly affirmed that he was not saying that, but for the OLC opinion, he would have found the President obstructed justice. The Special Counsel’s report and his statement today made clear that the office concluded it would not reach a determination — one way or the other — about whether the President committed a crime. There is no conflict between these statements,"" a joint statement from Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec and Mueller spokesman Peter Carr said at the time.

Before the joint statement came out, Mueller's office released a handout comparing his assertions about obstruction of justice to what Barr said about it. The document, which apparently sought to provide context, contained quotes from Barr's press conference before the release of Mueller's report in which he said Mueller repeatedly assured him that he did not think they would have found a crime if not for the Office of Legal Counsel opinion."
Rep. Ayanna Pressley introduces bill to abolish federal death penalty after DOJ reinstates it,https://www.cbsnews.com,"['Emily Tillett', 'Emily Tillett Is A Politics Reporter', 'Video Editor For Cbs News Digital']",,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-death-penalty-rep-ayanna-pressley-introduces-bill-to-abolish-capital-punishment-after-doj-reinstates-it/,"Just after the Department of Justice reversed a 16-year rule banning the use of capital punishment, Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley said the death penalty has ""no place in a just society."" In response, the Massachusetts congresswoman is introducing a bill that would reverse the action and abolish the death penalty altogether.

While short on details, the bill aims to ""prohibit the imposition of the death penalty for any violation of Federal law, and for other purposes."" It's the latest piece of legislation introduced by Pressley, a member of the so-called ""squad"" of progressive Democratic congresswomen, that directly counters the Trump administration.

""The same racist rhetoric coming from the occupant of the White House, who called for the execution of the #Exonerated5, is what led to this racist, vile policy,"" Pressley tweeted, remarking on Mr. Trump's past claims that the wrongly convicted ""Central Park Five"" should face the death penalty for their alleged crimes.

""It was wrong then and it's wrong now. The cruelty is the point - this is by design,"" she added.

Pressley tweeted out an image of the bill. It states, if enacted, ""no person may be sentenced to death or put to death on or after the date of enactment of this act for any violation of federal law."" It notes that those who were sentenced before the bill's enactment should be re-sentenced for their crimes.

On Thursday, Attorney General William Barr anounced that his DOJ was bringing back capital punishment after more than 16 years without a single federal execution. Barr has now directed the federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to adopt a change to the federal execution protocol to make it possible to execute inmates on death row.

In doing so, Barr directed the BOP's Acting Director Hugh Hurwitz to schedule executions for five convicted murderers, and the Justice Department says more executions will be scheduled soon.

The bill currently has support from the likes of Pressley's ""squad"" co-members Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez among 11 other Democrats. It also has support from Rep. Justin Amash, formerly of the Republican party."

"30,000+ Coloradans could lose food stamp benefits under proposed USDA rule",https://www.thedenverchannel.com,[],07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/30-000-coloradans-could-lose-food-stamp-benefits-under-proposed-usda-rule,"DENVER – More than 30,000 Coloradans could lose their food stamp benefits under the Trump administration’s proposal to tighten automatic eligibility requirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).

The Department of Agriculture said Tuesday the proposed rule would close a “loophole” that allows people receiving minimal benefits from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, to be automatically eligible to participate in the SNAP program without undergoing a more robust check on their income or assets.

“For too long, this loophole has been used to effectively bypass important eligibility guidelines. Too often, states have misused this flexibility without restraint,” U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue said in a statement.

Under the proposal, a household must receive at least $50 a month in benefits from TANF for at least six months to qualify for automatic eligibility under the SNAP program.

Perdue said the new rules would prevent abuse of a “critical safety net system, so those need food assistance the most are the only ones who receive it.”

The USDA estimates that about 3.1 million people “will not otherwise meet SNAP’s income and asset eligibility prerequisites under the proposed rule,” acknowledging the proposed rule “may also negatively impact food security and reduce the savings rates among those individuals who do not meet the income and resource eligibility requirements for SNAP or the substantial and ongoing requirements for expanded categorical eligibility.”

In total, the department estimates they would be securing approximately $9.4 billion in net savings over the next five years if the proposed rule goes into effect.

“Enacting the proposed rule changes would alter Colorado eligibility guidelines and decrease the number of families served through this program each month,” Colorado Department of Human Services spokesman John Rosa told Denver7 Thursday.

In our state, that amounts to 33,514 people who would be affected under the proposed rule.

“While the elderly population would not be subject to a gross income test, a net income test and asset limit would now be applied,” according to Rosa. The proposed rule would impact a total of 7,371 elderly throughout the state each month.

Those between 18 and 59 years of age without children in the household who earn between 130% and 200% of the federal poverty line would be eliminated from the program, Rosa said, impacting 6,442 Coloradans monthly.

Families with children in the household earning between 130% to 200% of the federal poverty line would also be eliminated from the program if Colorado was unable to secure additional TANF funds to provide for those families on a monthly basis.

“It is unclear at this time that Colorado has the ability to address this funding and, therefore, these families with children could be eliminated,” Rosa said, adding the proposed rule could impact a total of 19,701 individuals, “11,000 of which are children.”

The Associated Press reports that under current law, states may automatically make people eligible for food stamps, if they meet income and other requirements for TANF. The USDA says 43 states, including Colorado, have expanded that to include households that it says “barely participate” in TANF. The provision is called “expanded categorical eligibility.”

The policy has resulted in people receiving food stamps who don’t need it and wouldn’t qualify under regular program rules, Perdue said.

The proposed rule is open for public comment for 60 days.

REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday kept up his pressure on global tech giant Google days after his Treasury secretary ruled out any national security concerns over the company’s work in China.

Trump, in a tweet, did not offer any evidence of a problem with Google’s business in China but said if there were any issues, his administration would find out about it.

On Wednesday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he and Trump had both had direct talks with Google’s chief executive and were assured that the tech company’s work with China was “very, very limited.”

“The president and I did diligence on this issue, and we’re not aware of any areas where Google working with the Chinese government in a way that in any way raises concerns,” Mnuchin told CNBC in an interview. “Google is an American company that wants to help out the U.S.”

Trump has repeatedly slammed U.S. technology companies, including Google, and alleged without offering any evidence that they have discriminated against him and fellow conservatives. He met with Google CEO Sundar Pichai at a White House meeting on Monday with a number of other top tech executives.

“There may or may not be National Security concerns with regard to Google and their relationship with China. If there is a problem, we will find out about it. I sincerely hope there is not!!!” Trump wrote on Twitter.

Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc, declined to comment. Earlier this month, the company’s top government affairs official said at a U.S. Senate hearing that it did little business in China.

“Fundamentally in China we actually do very little today, certainly compared to any other major technology company,” said Karan Bhatia, vice president for government affairs and public policy.

Alphabet shares rose 11% in midday trading on its strong earnings results released Thursday."

Sanjuana Galicia from Facebook via CNN Francisco Galicia, who was born in Dallas and is a US citizen, was released from ICE custody on Tuesday after spending three weeks behind bars, his lawyer told CNN.

The Texas-born high school student who was detained by immigration officials for more than three weeks told CNN Thursday he was treated less than human at a US Customs and Border Protection facility.

Francisco Galicia, 18, says he was held in filthy, overcrowded conditions where he was not allowed to shower for 23 days, forced to sleep on a cement floor and not given enough food. By the time he was released Tuesday, after word spread about his detention following a report by The Dallas Morning News, he said he was malnourished, having dropped 26 pounds.

""They were not treating us humanely,"" Galicia told CNN during a wide-ranging interview. ""...The stress was so high, they (detention center agents) were on me all the time. It was like psychological torture to the point where I almost (agreed to be deported). I felt safer to be in the cell than to be with the officers. ""

'They threatened me with charges'

The problem began, he says, on June 27 while he was on his way to a college soccer scouting event.

He was traveling with his 17-year-old brother Marlon, as well as a group of friends, from his hometown of Edinburg to Houston when they were stopped at a CBP checkpoint in Falfurrias, about 100 miles north of the US-Mexico border.

Francisco Galicia was born in Texas, and he is an American citizen. As a child, he moved to Mexico with his family and later returned to the US as a teenager. He says he was carrying his state ID, a Social Security card and a wallet-sized birth certificate.

He also had a Mexican tourist visa with him that inaccurately listed his country of birth as Mexico, setting up a conflicting nationality claim, his attorney, Claudia Galan, said.

Both brothers were detained, and Marlon Galicia, who does not have legal status in the US, was retuned to Mexico. Francisco Galicia was sent to an immigration detention center.

""They didn't believe me. I kept telling them over and over, and they kept saying my documents were fake, and they were going to deport me,"" Galicia said. ""...They threatened me with charges -- charges about falsifying documents. Felonies. They kept asking how it was possible for me to not know where I was from. I almost signed (to be deported) because I didn't want to suffer there anymore. ""

US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials declined a CNN request for comment on Galicia's allegations and pointed back to a joint ICE-CBP statement on Wednesday following the teen's release.

""This individual provided conflicting reports regarding status of citizenship after being apprehended by U.S. Border Patrol and transferred into Immigration and Customs Enforcement Custody,"" the statement said.

The statement continued, ""Situations including conflicting reports from the individual and multiple birth certificates can, and should, take more time to verify. While we continue to research the facts of the situation, the individual has been released from ICE custody.""

'You have no rights'

Galicia said he was not allowed to call his family or an attorney while he was detained.

""The moment I got there, we told them we have the right to a phone call and to a lawyer, and they told us, 'you have no rights,'"" he said.

Galicia described squalid conditions in the facility where he was held, saying he was held in a small room with about 70 other people. There was one toilet, with no doors or wall.

Every few days, he said, he and those held with him were given wipes.

""It was to clean up but the dirt, but you couldn't get rid of it because so much time had passed since we showered,"" he said.

Galicia dismissed President Donald Trump's assertion that many of the people crossing the border are ""bad actors,"" who mean to do harm to the US and its people. He said the people he met who were being held with him at the facility meant no harm.

""They just wanted to come for a better future. They were fleeing their countries because they were being threatened or kidnapped,"" he said.

Attorney says she was given the runaround

While Galicia was being held, an attorney retained by his family said she tried for a least a week to get in touch with the teen while he was being held but was given the runaround by CBP and ICE.

Galan says she tried in vain for at least a week to get in touch with Galicia while he was being held, but was given the runaround by Border Patrol.

""They told him he had no right to an attorney,"" Galan said. ""Once I went to border patrol headquarters, they told me the same thing. ... They said that I couldn't get any information until he consented, but he didn't even know I was trying to get him out.""

Galan has said she shared documents two weeks ago with CBP proving Galicia was a US citizen -- including a birth certificate showing he was born in Dallas.

Despite the documentation, the attorney said, Galicia was transferred on Saturday to ICE custody for removal proceedings. He was held in the South Texas Detention Complex in Pearsall until his release Tuesday.

By the time he was released, he had been detained for 27 days: one day at the border patrol checkpoint, 23 days at the Falfurrias processing center and three days in Pearsall.

'I am the eyes and the ears of what's happening'

Galicia showed CNN pieces of paper that he said contained phone numbers of the families of those held with him.

""They asked me to reach out to them to let them know that they're OK. They didn't want me to tell them about the conditions in the detention centers -- they only wanted me to tell them that they were OK,"" he said.

""...Right now, I'm in a place where I can help those who are still in there -- so people can see how they're treated, and change the way they're treated. I am the eyes and ears of what's happening in there. I can talk. They can't do what I'm doing. ""

Galicia says he doesn't know if he will take legal action against the CBP, but he does want a measure of justice.

He said he remains a positive person despite being treated so badly.

""It's made me stronger,"" he said. ""I see life differently after seeing how other people have been suffering. It's made me understand many things like how you can live your life while others are suffering.""

Trump rightly threatens tariffs on France,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/trump-rightly-threatens-tariffs-on-france,"Whether Chablis, Sancerre, or Pomerol, French wine is better than American wine.

But President Trump is right to threaten tariffs over a French tax on U.S. technology companies. Trump explained his position on Twitter.

France just put a digital tax on our great American technology companies. If anybody taxes them, it should be their home Country, the USA. We will announce a substantial reciprocal action on Macron’s foolishness shortly. I’ve always said American wine is better than French wine! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2019

Don't get me wrong, I support free trade. But free trade must flow both ways. In turn, the U.S. cannot sit idle when other nations take unfair advantage of American companies. And tariffs offer a rough but effective tool to force reconsideration of unfair actions.

Such is the case with France's technology tax.

That tax is extraordinarily unfair in its undue impact on U.S. technology firms such as Amazon, Facebook, and Google. Protecting French technology firms by targeting higher-earning U.S. firms, France is punishing American firms for being better. It's an attack on the American economy in protectionist benefit of France's struggling socialist economy. France must know that it cannot act unfairly against America and expect us to simply sit back and smile.

Hopefully President Emmanuel Macron will reconsider his tax. France is a close U.S. ally, and both our nations have a vested interest in expanded trade and cooperation. But trade must be fair and free. Whether abroad or at home, U.S. technology firms are a crown jewel of our economy. As in this case, they deserve protection."
US Treasury Secretary: Amazon ‘destroyed the retail industry across the United States’,https://www.wraltechwire.com,[],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.wraltechwire.com/2019/07/25/us-treasury-secretary-amazon-destroyed-the-retail-industry-across-the-united-states/,"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he supports the Justice Department’s formal antitrust review of the country’s largest tech companies, particularly Amazon, which he said has ruined retail.

In an interview Wednesday with CNBC, Mnuchin said the company has “destroyed the retail industry across the United States” and said there’s “no question they’ve limited competition.”

Regarding the wide-ranging investigation announced Tuesday by the Department of Justice, Mnuchin said it’s “absolutely right” that Attorney General William Barr has started it.

The wide-ranging review could examine numerous firms that have been targets of criticism for having anti-competitive behavior. No specific companies were named in the release, but the Justice Department said it was looking into “market-leading online platforms,” which could include Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google.

“The Department’s review will consider the widespread concerns that consumers, businesses, and entrepreneurs have expressed about search, social media, and some retail services online,” it said in the press release.

Mnuchin said Amazon’s dominance is different from Walmart because the latter company has “developed a business where small businesses could continue to compete with them.”

In response to Mnuchin’s comment, Amazon said small and medium-sized businesses are “thriving” on the platform.

“Today, independent sellers make up more than 58% of physical gross merchandise sales on Amazon, and their sales have grown twice as fast as our own, totaling $160 billion in 2018,” Amazon said a in statement to CNN Business.

It added: “Amazon’s retail business competes in the worldwide market for retail sales and represents less than 1% of global retail and less than 4% of U.S. retail. And the vast majority of retail sales — 90% — still occur in brick-and-mortar stores according to the US Census Bureau.”

Several aspects of Amazon’s business have attracted the attention of politicians.

Last week, Amazon representatives testified at a House hearing about online platforms and market power. The company’s dominance was questioned. According to eMarketer, it accounts for nearly 50% of the US e-commerce market."
Illinois EPA cites company for south suburban water woes,https://wgntv.com,"['Ben Bradley', 'Joe Donlon', 'Wgn Investigates']",07-26-2019,2019,7,https://wgntv.com/2019/07/26/illinois-epa-cites-company-for-south-suburban-water-woes/,"Please enable Javascript to watch this video

UNIVERSITY PARK, Ill. — The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency has hit a private water provider with notice of several violations after high lead levels were detected in several south suburbs. Aqua Illinois first notified its customers in University Park, Green Garden and Monee Township about high lead levels on June 14. Nearly six weeks later, 1,500 households remain under a “do not consume” advisory.

Aqua Illinois officials have blamed the spike in lead levels to a change in the chemicals it uses to treat the water. The Illinois EPA now says the company failed to obtain the necessary permits to make those changes, a violation of IEPA rules.

State regulators also fault Aqua Illinois for failing to properly monitor and report water quality test results last year.

""Your supply did not collect the required number of sample results from a certified laboratory,” the IEPA violation notice reads. All required lead and copper samples were not collected for the July-December 2018 monitoring period in University Park, according to the IEPA.

Aqua Illinois denies any alleged violations contributed to the lead problem or the difficulty in solving it. “We don’t believe the issues associated with these notices of violations contributed to or worsened the lead contamination in University Park,” the company wrote in a statement.

University Park mayor Joseph Roudez has previously criticized the private water provider for not providing the community with water quality reports prior to June.

Aqua Illinois revealed Friday that it has suspended four members of its management and professional team while the company examined the details of the IEPA’s findings.

University Park officials say they were led to believe the problem would be resolved within several days, a claim Aqua Illinois disputes. The water crisis in these south suburban communities is now in its second month.

“It could take several months before this is resolved,” Aqua Illinois president Craig Blanchette told WGN’s Joe Donlon.

In the most recent community update posted July 22, Aqua Illinois officials said “water lead test results in University Park have fluctuated, both increasing an decreasing in some areas. It’s not unusual to see this fluctuation, particularly in the first few months of treatment.”

“We acknowledge that while we all would have hoped to see treatment showing progress, it hasn’t had enough time yet,” reads a statement on Aqua Illinois’ website for residents effected by the water problems.

Aqua Illinois officials insist older homes impacted by the high lead levels will see their numbers subside when residents let water run for 2-3 minutes first thing in the morning. They’ve provided residents with filters and bottled water.

Blanchette provided WGN with the following statement:

""Aqua Illinois is committed to operating with complete transparency with the safety of our customers as our top priority. We have been working closely with the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and other regulators since we issued the voluntary do not consume advisory June 14, and immediately launched an internal investigation. To date, we have identified the likely cause of elevated lead levels in a limited number of homes is due to water chemistry interacting with lead solder in the internal plumbing of homes built prior to 1990. (Lead solder was banned by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 1986). As part of our commitment to resolve this situation, we have engaged nationally renowned experts in this field to complement our team’s efforts. Related Story

Hundreds attend emergency meeting on water lead levels in south suburbs Aqua Illinois leadership makes every effort to comply with all federal and state regulations. We recently learned that IEPA has issued several regulatory violations relating to permitting and sampling. Although we continue working to gather the necessary information to gain a more comprehensive understanding of what took place, it is important to note we don’t believe the issues associated with these notices of violations contributed to or worsened the lead contamination in University Park. We want our customers to know that we take these actions very seriously and are actively working with the IEPA on a resolution. Among the matters raised by the IEPA are permitting actions that took place in 2018. Aqua Illinois has since addressed these issues. During the process to change sources from well water to the Kankakee River, we installed a water main and changed treatment locations prior to receiving an IEPA permit. Though the changes were made prior to receiving the permits, the IEPA ultimately did issue the permits. The delay in applying for the permits, though it was eventually approved by the IEPA in 2018, was an oversight on our part. To correct this process, effective immediately, we have updated internal permit management practices to strengthen oversight of our permitting activities. The other issues raised by the IEPA involve the method of selecting sampling locations during the second half of 2018. Based upon our own investigation, we learned, and proactively advised the IEPA, that several homes selected for compliance sampling did not meet the proper criteria due to the age of the homes. We have addressed this issue, adding about 40 pre-1986 sampling locations to the existing sample set, thanks to the cooperation of our customers. This ensures that our lead testing correctly represents the various property types, ages, and plumbing construction in the community. As part of our holistic examination of the matter, Aqua has been and will continue to evaluate changes to processes and personnel to ensure we correct this situation and continue to improve our service for our customers and communities. As part of this process, Aqua has taken immediate action by suspending four members of the Aqua Illinois management and professional team while we thoroughly examine all the details around the IEPA’s findings. As a company, we collectively work each day with integrity, respect and in the pursuit of excellence in all we do, and we are accountable when we fall short of those values. The safety of our system is our top priority. We will continue to work with regulators, our own team and national water experts to restore and maintain safe drinking water for our customers."""

Ethics Probes Launched at Department of the Interior and EPA,https://undark.org,"['Jane Roberts', 'Frankie Schembri', 'Ek Silbergeld', 'Big Wayne', 'Seeker Of Truth', 'Even When Ugly', 'Peter George']",07-26-2019,2019,7,https://undark.org/2019/07/26/ethics-probe-interior-department-epa-july-2019/,"Acting Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt visits oil rig manufacturer Watson Hopper Inc. in Hobbs, New Mexico.

Two new ethics probes were opened this week — one at the U.S. Department of the Interior and one at the Environmental Protection Agency — following contentions that the two agencies most influential in setting the country’s environmental agenda may be working to limit public access to policy documents, and that a member of EPA leadership may have acted in the interest of private sector lobbyists.

The Interior Department probe, carried out by the agency’s internal audit unit, seeks to determine if a new policy mandating that staff reviewing requests for documents via the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) notify politically appointed officials if they are mentioned in documents slated for release is indeed in violation of the public’s legal right to request government records and merits a formal investigation. A separate bill, aimed at challenging similar FOIA policies at the EPA, was announced in the Senate on the same day with bipartisan support.

The FOIA policy changes come on the heels of the ousting of both agency heads — EPA chief Scott Pruitt in July of last year and the Interior’s Ryan Zinke this January — after records released to the public revealed misconduct on the part of both leaders. Watchdog groups contend that the new FOIA policies are an attempt to shield officials from such scrutiny by allowing them to delay or deny the release of internal documents.

Communicating with New York Times reporters, representatives for both agencies denied this motivation for the policy changes. In an email to The Times, EPA Press Secretary Michael Abboud wrote: “Allegations made that the rule is changing the political appointees role in FOIA are false and irresponsible.”

In the EPA probe, announced on Monday, the agency’s inspector general is looking into the actions of former air quality chief William L. Wehrum, a key legal architect of the Trump administration’s policies easing federal limits on air, water, and coal ash pollution. It’s the third investigation to examine whether Wehrum violated federal rules during his time in office through interactions with his former law firm, Hunton Andrews Kurth, and one of the firm’s clients, the Utility Air Regulatory Group, a now-defunct coal plant lobbying coalition.

In a report sent Sunday to the EPA inspector general and obtained by The Washington Post, Democratic Senators Tom Carper and Sheldon Whitehouse documented allegedly undisclosed meetings between Wehrum and private sector clients. The pair urged EPA officials not to “abandon or decline to pursue work on this matter in the wake of Mr. Wehrum’s departure from the agency.”

• An unprecedented and lethal heatwave swept across Europe this week, breaking records in France, the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and the United Kingdom. As of Friday morning, French authorities reported at least five deaths linked to the rising temperatures. There, temperatures topped 108 degrees Fahrenheit; in Germany, 106.7 degrees; Belgium 105 degrees; and in the Netherlands, 104 degrees. The temperature spike is the second major heatwave to hit the continent this summer and scientists warn that this particular weather system will be moving north, where it is expected to further break records in countries from Norway to Finland on its way into the Arctic region. Scientists have also noted that Arctic sea ice is already at record lows for this time of year and that the super-charged temperatures are likely to accelerate that loss. And climate scientists have noted that with this heat wave, July is on track to be hottest month on record around the world. (The New York Times)

• The Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft successfully launched from the edge of the Bay of Bengal on Monday, marking the start of the Indian Space Research Organization’s ambitious second mission to the moon. Chandrayaan-2 is composed of a lander, a rover, and a lunar orbiter, and will be the country’s first attempt to make a “soft” landing on the surface of the Moon (a controlled descent in which the craft lands without sustaining damages). If all goes to plan, the lunar lander — named Vikram — will touch down in early September, and India will join Russia, the U.S., and China as countries to have complete a soft landing on the moon’s surface. The majority of Chandrayaan-2’s scientific instruments were designed in India, and include: X-ray, infrared, and mass spectrometers; stereoscopic and high-resolution cameras; and radar. NASA designed one instrument for the lander: an array of mirrors to reflect laser beams from Earth, used to help to calculate the distance to the Moon. Vikram’s planned landing site is the Moon’s south pole, a previously uncharted region, where it will study soil samples, rocks, and minerals. (Nature)

• Pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. announced a new, longer-lasting drug for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention at the International AIDS Conference in Mexico City this week. Currently, the main preventative strategy for uninfected individuals with a high risk of contracting the virus is to consume a daily pill — a strategy known as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). However, adherence to an oral HIV PrEP regimen can be challenging for some and the pill’s effectiveness is diminished with intermittent use. At the conference, Merck unveiled a slow-release implant of an experimental antiretroviral (ARV) drug, that the company’s tests suggest could safely provide protection against HIV far longer than any ARV currently on the market. The implant is placed under the skin and slowly delivers the drug in a mechanism similar to some implantable contraceptive devices. Merck’s study included only 12 participants, but the researchers reported that there were no safety issues, and the results showed that individuals receiving a high enough dose could be protected against HIV infection for 12 to 16 months.

• The fungus Candida auris, already a deadly and resilient pathogen, may be growing better suited to infecting human bodies, according to a study published this week in the journal mBio. When researchers examined close relatives of C. auris, they found most similar fungi are incapable of tolerating the human body’s typical internal temperature of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. This led them to suspect that C. auris had somehow adapted to thriving in hotter environments, perhaps thanks to temperatures climbing worldwide as a result of a changing climate, though they could not definitively rule out other factors contributing to C. auris’ unusual resilience. While cases of infection are still rare, C. auris is a worrisome threat as it is difficult to detect, crops up among already ill patients in hospitals, and strains of the fungus have proven resistant to one or more classes of the most common antifungal medications.

• As synthetic opioid overdoses continue to rise in the U.S., West Africa is facing its own crisis due to the abuse of tramadol — a widely available painkiller known at high doses to produce a euphoric effect similar to that of heroin. Reportedly taken by refugees in Nigeria to help cope with post-traumatic stress, along with wage workers, and even schoolchildren looking to gain an edge, many tramadol pills are illicitly manufactured in India and China, making it impossible for users to know what they really contain. According to the United Nations (U.N.), seizures of the drug have increased in recent years. Last year, Nigeria alone seized 6.4 billion pills. In nearby Togo, in contrast, smaller raids have led vendors to become even more secretive. Despite its risks, the U.N. in March declined to make tramadol an internationally controlled substance, saying it could make it more difficult to obtain for those who truly need it. (Mosaic)

• And finally: On Tuesday, a diminutive satellite — or CubeSat — operated by the Planetary Society, a nonprofit, unfurled four large mylar sails in an attempt to demonstrate solar sailing as a viable means of space travel. Over the next month, the toaster-sized satellite, named LightSail 2, will harness the momentum of light from the Sun to propel itself into increasingly higher orbits before eventually falling back to Earth’s atmosphere. LightSail 2 isn’t the first spacecraft to attempt to set sail on the solar wind. In 2010, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency launched IKAROS, a solar sail that made it past Venus, but that lacked a steering mechanism and was last heard from in 2015. Four years ago, the Planetary Society launched LightSail 2’s predecessor, LightSail 1, but that craft’s orbit was too low to demonstrate solar sailing. If successful, LightSail 2 will be the first steerable solar sail to orbit Earth. With silvery sails roughly the size of a boxing ring, it may, at times, be visible from Earth with the naked eye, according to the Planetary Society. (Gizmodo)"

Derek Mize and Jonathan Gregg, who married in New York in 2015, had their daughter Simone Mize-Gregg via surrogacy in England in 2018, their lawyer said in a statement. Both fathers are listed on the birth certificate.

When they applied for Simone's US citizenship, the US consulate in London rejected their application, the release said. ""The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) states that children of married U.S. citizens born abroad are U.S. citizens from birth so long as one of their parents has lived in the U.S. at some point, but the State Department routinely denies that right to same-sex couples and their children,"" the statement says.

""The State Department's policy is not only cruel, it is unconstitutional. The government refuses to recognize Jonathan and Derek's marriage and all of Simone's rights as a U.S. citizen,"" Aaron C. Morris, one of the couple's attorneys and executive director of Immigration Equality , said.

A State Department spokesperson declined to comment on the lawsuit, saying it does not comment on pending litigation.

DOJ taking hard look at Big Tech monopolies,https://world.wng.org,[],,,,https://world.wng.org/content/doj_taking_hard_look_at_big_tech_monopolies,"The U.S. Department of Justice is opening a sweeping antitrust probe of major technology companies, investigating whether their online platforms have hurt competition, suppressed innovation, or harmed consumers. The Justice Department did not name specific companies, but it said the review will consider the widespread concerns about search engines, social media, and some retail services online. “Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands,” said Makan Delrahim, the Justice Department’s chief antitrust officer. “The department’s antitrust review will explore these important issues.”

The news comes as a growing number of lawmakers have called for stricter regulation or even breaking up Big Tech companies.

"Justice Department won't bring charges against Attorney General William Barr, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross after contempt vote",https://www.cnbc.com,['Sunny Kim'],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/25/doj-wont-bring-charges-against-barr-ross-after-contempt-vote.html,"Attorney General William Barr discussing the counting of citizens in the country and the legal issues surrounding that effort, behind him stands Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, in the Rose Garden at the White House.

The Justice Department will not bring charges against Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross after the House voted last week to hold them in criminal contempt.

The DOJ had not been expected to pursue charges against Barr, who oversees the department, or Ross.

""The Department of Justice's long-standing position is that we will not prosecute an official for contempt of Congress for declining to provide information subject to a presidential assertion of executive privilege,"" Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen said in a letter to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday.

The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee had authorized subpoenas to the Justice and Commerce departments in April demanding information about the administration's attempt to put a citizenship question on the 2020 census.

Barr and Ross had refused to comply with the subpoenas, after Trump asserted executive privilege over the documents. The refusal to comply prompted the Oversight Committee to vote along party lines to hold the officials in contempt. That vote was sent to the entire Democrat-led House, which voted last month to hold the men in contempt.

After a defeat at the Supreme Court, Trump abandoned his fight to add the citizenship question to the census, opting instead to sign an executive order to collect citizenship information from government agencies.

Rosen contended in the letter that the Justice Department has ""consistently adhered to the position that 'the contempt of Congress statute was not intended to apply and could not constitutionally be applied to an Executive Branch official who asserts the President's claim of executive privilege.'""

He cited multiple examples of the department taking the same stance during the Bush and Obama administrations.

""The Department has determined that the responses by the Attorney General and the Secretary of Commerce to the subpoenas issued by the Committee on Oversight and Reform did not constitute a crime,"" Rosen wrote.

A spokeswoman for the Oversight Committee did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment."
"EPA: Deal between Calif., 4 automakers to reduce emissions, improve mileage a ‘PR stunt’",https://www.mlive.com,"['Benjamin Raven', 'Braven Mlive.Com']",07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.mlive.com/news/2019/07/epa-deal-between-calif-4-automakers-to-reduce-emissions-improve-mileage-a-pr-stunt.html,"A spokesperson with the Environmental Protection Agency is calling a deal between California and four automakers to increase gas mileage and emissions standards a “PR stunt.”

Michael Abboud made the comments to the Associated Press after the deal was announced Thursday, July 25. This comes as the Trump administration reportedly moves on plans to set a single federal standard for fuel economy ratings and greenhouse gas emissions.

A.P. reports California made a deal with Ford, BMW, Honda and Volkswagen to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 3.7 percent year-over-year from 2022 to 2026 model years. There are “at least” a dozen other states that follow the state’s rules when it comes to these standards.

The Trump administration has bounced around the idea of freezing the standards for each in 2021. Those in favor of this freeze believe it will stop new car prices from rising due to the cost of fuel-saving technology.

Judd Deere, an EPA spokesperson, told the news organization that the Trump administration plans to move forward in taking the state’s rights away when it comes to setting the standard. He told A.P. that the federal government, not a single state should set the standards.

I applaud these four auto companies for reaching an agreement that is good for our workers, manufacturers, and suppliers. This agreement will help reduce carbon emissions, promote innovation, and benefit consumers.https://t.co/CfcjFLtKwb — Sen. Debbie Stabenow (@SenStabenow) July 25, 2019

“Few issues are more pressing than climate change, a global threat that endangers our lives and livelihoods,” Calif. Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement. ""California, a coalition of states, and these automakers are leading the way on smart policies that make the air cleaner and safer for us all.

“I now call on the rest of the auto industry to join us, and for the Trump administration to adopt this pragmatic compromise instead of pursuing its regressive rule change. It’s the right thing for our economy, our people and our planet.”

A.P. reports that the involved automakers view this deal as an insurance policy to provide some certainty no matter who wins the 2020 presidential election. The news organization quotes a person who requested not to be identified due to the negotiations not being made public.

The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a group that represents a dozen automakers, said in a statement that the announced deal is “not attainable and needs to be adjusted”

This is just more proof that no matter how hard the Trump Administration tries to pull us backward, we'll keep moving forward. https://t.co/bR3Zi040xd — Rep. Mike Levin (@RepMikeLevin) July 25, 2019

“Uncertainty from protracted litigation is a major concern for an industry with long production cycles, so much capital investment and 10 million Americans dependent on auto paychecks,” the group writes in the statement. ""Individual companies may have different perspectives on how best to achieve greater certainty.

“A final federal rule regarding future CAFE/GHG standards has yet to be released and automakers continue to seek an optimal pathway forward that meets the diverse needs of our customers while providing environmental improvements, preserving safety and auto jobs and keeping new vehicles affordable for more Americans.”"
US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin Voices New Pessimism About Bitcoin’s Future,https://cointelegraph.com,"['Max Boddy', 'Bitcoins', 'Ivan Franciscovich', 'Real John Smith', 'Jim Bone', 'Brewdog Paradox', 'Jimbo G.', 'Tom Gilchrist']",07-25-2019,2019,7,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-treasury-secretary-mnuchin-voices-new-pessimism-about-bitcoins-future,"United States Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin voiced new bearish views on Bitcoin today, saying that he probably will not be talking about the number one cryptocurrency in as soon as five years. In an interview with Squawk Box CNBC on July 24, Mnuchin said:

“I won’t be talking about Bitcoin in 10 years, I can assure you that […] I would bet even in 5 or 6 years I’m no longer talking about Bitcoin as Treasury Secretary. I’ll have other priorities […] I can assure you I will personally not be loaded up on Bitcoin.”

Mnuchin’s latest remarks follow a recent statement about how cryptocurrencies primarily exist as a vehicle for crime and speculative investment, saying, “I think to a large extent, these cryptocurrencies have been dominated by illicit activities and speculation.”

However, CEO and Digital Currency Group founder Barry Silbert celebrated the Treasury Secretary’s remarks, saying that they were “complete and total validation of Bitcoin.”

Money Laundering

Mnuchin also recently claimed that fiat money is not laundered to the extent that Bitcoin is. In a separate Squawk Box interview, Mnuchin said that the U.S. has the strongest Anti-Money Laundering system in the world. Bitcoin, on the other hand, he believes is vulnerable to money laundering.

Supreme Court clears way for Trump to use Defense Dept. funds for border wall,https://fox59.com,['Cnn Wire'],07-26-2019,2019,7,https://fox59.com/2019/07/26/supreme-court-clears-way-for-trump-to-use-defense-dept-funds-for-border-wall/,"WASHINGTON D.C. (CNN) — The Supreme Court on Friday cleared the way for the Trump administration to use $2.5 billion from the Department of Defense to construct parts of a wall along the southwestern border that the government argues is necessary to protect national security.

The decision allows the Defense Department money to be spent now while a court battle plays out over whether the government had the authority to divert funds that were not appropriated for the wall. The Supreme Court voted 5-4, along ideological lines, to allow the funds to be used while the court appeals proceed.

In a brief order, the court said that it was ruling in favor of the Trump administration before the litigation has played out because the government had made a “sufficient showing” that the challengers did not have the legal right to bring the case.

Three members of the liberal wing of the court — Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan — wrote they would have blocked the funds for now. The fourth member, Justice Stephen Breyer, wrote separately to say that he would have allowed the government to use the funds to finalize the terms for contractors but block the funds from being used for the actual construction.

The Supreme Court’s order is a significant win for Trump, who is likely to use the construction of a wall as a major talking point on the campaign trail. The President celebrated the decision in a tweet Friday evening.

“The United States Supreme Court overturns lower court injunction, allows Southern Border Wall to proceed,” the President tweeted. “Big WIN for Border Security and the Rule of Law!”

The decision overrules a lower court decision that had blocked the transfer of funds while appeals played out. A panel of judges from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals refused to allow the use of the funds earlier in the month, holding that the challengers were likely to prevail in their case because the use of the funds “violates the constitutional requirement that the Executive Branch not spend money absent an appropriation from Congress.”

The order comes after Trump ended a 35-day government shutdown in February when Congress gave him $1.4 billion in wall funding, far less than he had sought. He subsequently declared a national emergency to get money from other government accounts to construct sections of the wall.

The $2.5 billion had been shifted from various programs including personnel and recruiting, Minuteman III and air launch cruise missiles, E-3 aircraft upgrades and the Afghan security forces training fund. The Pentagon said it was able to move that money due to uncovered cost savings as part of a process known as “reprogramming.” The money was moved into a Defense Department counter-drug account that is authorized to spend money on the construction of border barriers.

Many lawmakers slammed the decision to move the money away from those national security priorities, threatening to strip the Pentagon of its ability to move money around, something the Defense Department has acknowledged would be detrimental.

Lawyers for the government had asked the Supreme Court to step in on an emergency basis and unblock the use of the funds while legal challenges proceed in the lower courts.

Solicitor General Noel Francisco noted in court papers that the projects needed to start because the funds at issue “will no longer remain available for obligation after the fiscal year ends on September 30, 2019.” He said that the funds are necessary to permit the construction of more than 100 miles of fencing in areas the government has identified as “drug-smuggling corridors” where it has seized “thousands of pounds of heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine” in recent years.

“Respondents’ interests in hiking, birdwatching, and fishing in designated drug-smuggling corridors do not outweigh the harm to the public from halting the government’s efforts to construct barriers to stanch the flow of illegal narcotics across the southern border,” Francisco argued in the papers, regarding the challenge from environmental groups.

It is a loss for critics, including the Sierra Club and the Southern Border Communities Coalition that argued the administration had illegally transferred the funds after Congress denied requests for more money to construct the wall. The groups argued the wall — in areas in Arizona, California and New Mexico — would harm the environment.

The ACLU, representing the groups, argued in court papers against a stay of the lower court ruling fearful of the wall’s impact on border communities.

“Issuance of a stay that would permit Defendants to immediately spend this money is not consistent with Congress’s power over the purse or with the tacit assessment by Congress that the spending would not be in the public interest,”ACLU lawyers told the court.

The ACLU slammed the decision after it was released Friday evening.

“This is not over. We will be asking the federal appeals court to expedite the ongoing appeals proceeding to halt the irreversible and imminent damage from Trump’s border wall. Border communities, the environment, and our Constitution’s separation of powers will be permanently harmed should Trump get away with pillaging military funds for a xenophobic border wall Congress denied,” said Dror Ladin, a staff attorney with the ACLU’s National Security Project."

The letter provoked criticism from Democrats ahead of Wednesday’s highly anticipated hearing, with House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler calling it “incredibly arrogant.” Asked by Fox News why the Monday letter was sent, Barr said Mueller’s staff asked the department for guidance ahead of the hearing.

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TELLS MUELLER HIS HOUSE TESTIMONY 'MUST REMAIN WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES' OF PUBLIC REPORT

“At his press conference, Bob had said that he intended to stick with the public report and not go beyond that,” Barr said in an interview. “And in conversations with the department, his staff was reiterating that that was their position and they asked us for guidance in writing to explain or to tell them [what] our position was. So we responded in writing. The department sent the guidance that they requested.""

Asked directly if it was Mueller who asked for the letter, Barr replied, “Yes.”

The letter, obtained by Fox News on Monday, was signed by Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer.

The letter said, “Should you testify, the Department understands that testimony regarding the work of the Special Counsel's Office will be governed by the terms you outlined on May 29 -- specifically, that the information you discuss during your testimony appears in, and does ‘not go beyond,’ the public version of your March 22, 2019 report to the Attorney General or your May 29 public statement.""

Speaking to Fox News, Barr also hit back at Nadler, who during a CNN interview Tuesday called the letter “incredibly arrogant” for trying to “instruct” Mueller what to say.

“He was misinformed as to the facts,” Barr said.

The attorney general also declined to comment on the Democratic-controlled House holding him and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in criminal contempt over questions having to do with the Trump administration’s proposed citizenship question to the 2020 census.

“Goes with the territory these days,” Barr said.

On Wednesday, Mueller is expected to testify in public before the House Judiciary Committee for two hours or more, followed by another two hours-plus of testimony before the House Intelligence Committee.

Mueller, meanwhile, also has asked that Aaron Zebley, his former chief of staff and his top aide on the Russia investigation, accompany him at the witness table during Wednesday's hearing.

Republicans are opposed to the request. Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the Judiciary panel's top Republican, called the move an ""apparent stunt"" by Democrats. He said it ""shows the lengths Democrats will go to protect a one-sided narrative from a thorough examination by committee Republicans.""

Mueller has only spoken in public once about his investigation – in May, when he signaled his disinterest in testifying, saying, “There has been a discussion about an appearance before Congress. Any testimony from this office would not go beyond our report. It contains our findings and analysis, and the reasons for the decisions we made. We chose those words carefully and the work speaks for itself.”

Still, Democrats – as some in the party push to impeach President Trump – subpoenaed Mueller to testify.

During his press conference in May, Mueller said there “was not sufficient evidence to charge a conspiracy” over whether members of the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russian government during the 2016 presidential election. But he declined to reach a conclusion over whether the president took steps to obstruct his investigation – something Democrats are expected to focus their questions on Wednesday.

The United States Department of Justice (DoJ) announced the indictment in a press release on July 24.

According to the DoJ, the indictment filings and court statements indicate that Green operated a fiat-to-Bitcoin (BTC) conversion service through the website Destination Bitcoin. As such, Green reportedly would receive money from his customers in order to convert their cash to BTC. The findings further indicated that Green had not registered with the Secretary of the United States Treasury in any capacity.

As noted in the announcement, a person is required by federal law to register any money transmitting businesses with the Secretary of the Treasury.

Potential sentencing

Regarding monetary quantities and compensation, the report says that Green converted over $2 million in fiat money to BTC. Moreover, the maximum penalty for Green’s alleged crime is 5 years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.

According to the DoJ, Green was charged over the same issue in a criminal complaint filed on February 28.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the State of New Jersey filed a complaint last week about purportedly unregistered securities sales within its borders. The State accused blockchain-based online marketplace Pocketinns of selling over $400,000 in securities to investors, without registering with the state’s associated bureau."

They questioned disparities of race and class in the application of the death penalty, described capital punishment as an ineffective crime deterrent and questioned its humanity.

Barr’s announcement that “we owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system” occurred days before a Democratic presidential primary debate in Detroit next week, when race and equality are expected to be prominent issues.

Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle said they were taken by surprise at the administration’s announcement. Rep.

More than 160 people have been sentenced to death since 1973 and later been exonerated, Biden’s plan states. The former Delaware senator said he now favors life sentences without chances for probation or parole at the federal level and would work to pass legislation to outlaw the federal death penalty as a way to encourage states to follow suit.

Twenty-nine states have the death penalty, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, and a map of those states looks a lot like the red-blue political demarcations of next year’s presidential contest.

A majority of Americans supports the practice, although the percentage has ebbed since the mid-1990s when crime rates were on the upswing. A Pew Research Center survey last year found 54 percent of Americans supported the death penalty for those convicted of murder (The Washington Post).

In yet another example of partisan divisions, most Republicans back capital punishment while most Democrats say they oppose it.

The Justice Department says the government will use the barbiturate pentobarbital as its method to execute Daniel Lewis Lee of Oklahoma; Lezmond Mitchell of the Navajo Nation, the only Native American on death row; Wesley Ira Purkey of Michigan; Alfred Bourgeois of Louisiana; and Dustin Lee Honken of Iowa.

LEADING THE DAY





CONGRESS: The House officially fled Washington last night after lawmakers passed the bipartisan deal to raise the spending caps and the debt ceiling for two years. The bill will now go to the Senate, which will take it up next week before adjourning for its August recess.

The House passed the package, which boosts government spending by $320 billion over the next two years, by a 284-149 vote. Sixty-five House Republicans, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy Kevin Owen McCarthyWashington gives up on spending cuts The Hill's Morning Report — DOJ's planned executions stir new debate Overnight Health Care: Senate panel advances drug pricing bill amid GOP blowback | House panel grills Juul executives | Trump gives boost to state drug import plans | Officials say new migrant kids' shelter to remain open but empty MORE (R-Calif.), House Minority Whip Steve Scalise Stephen (Steve) Joseph ScaliseThe Hill's Morning Report — DOJ's planned executions stir new debate Carbon tax shows new signs of life in Congress On The Money: House passes sweeping budget, debt limit deal | Dem court filing defends powers to get Trump's NY tax returns | Debt collectors to pay M to settle consumer bureau charges MORE (R-La.) and Rep.

The package would suspend the debt limit through July 2021 and increase spending caps for the next two years. The United States would be on track to add an estimated $1.7 trillion to the deficit over the next decade when compared with the billions in automatic spending cuts that would have kicked in as a result of the 2011 Budget Control Act.

While most conservatives voted against the bill, they never made a concerted effort to press the president to oppose it. Trump tweeted earlier Thursday urging GOP lawmakers to back the measure, arguing that it “greatly helps our Military and our Vets.” The legislation boosts Pentagon spending to $738 billion, a reason some Republicans decided to vote for the agreement (The Hill).

The House adjourned Thursday night after House leadership decided not to bring up legislation from Rep. Veronica Escobar Veronica EscobarMore than 1,400 Jewish clergy call on Trump, Congress to allow asylum seekers into US The Hill's Morning Report — DOJ's planned executions stir new debate House leaves for six-week August recess MORE (D-Texas) that would overhaul migrant detention policies.

Katherine Clark Katherine Marlea ClarkPelosi denies she's 'trying to run out the clock' on impeachment House Democrat calls Mueller testimony 'emphatic step forward' The Hill's Morning Report — DOJ's planned executions stir new debate MORE (D-Mass.), the House Democratic Caucus vice chair, announced Thursday that she supports opening an impeachment inquiry, making her the highest-ranking House Democrat to move into the impeachment camp.

""I deeply respect the committee work of House Democrats to hold the President accountable, including hearings, subpoenas and lawsuits. All of our efforts to put the facts before the American people, however, have been met with unprecedented stonewalling and obstruction,"" said Clark, the No. 6 House Democrat, in a statement.

""That is why I believe we need to open an impeachment inquiry that will provide us a more formal way to fully uncover the facts.""

The Hill: Appetite for Democratic term limits for leadership fizzling out.

> Saudi Arabia: The Senate is expected to vote Monday on overriding presidential vetoes of resolutions blocking arms sales with Saudi Arabia.

Despite the scheduled vote series, they are not expected to override Trump’s vetoes given that the initial resolutions of disapproval passed with no more than 53 votes, well short of the necessary 67 votes. Trump vetoed the resolutions on Wednesday.

""This resolution would weaken America's global competitiveness and damage the important relationships we share with our allies and partners,"" Trump wrote in veto messages to Congress (The Hill).

> Joint Chiefs: The Senate voted Thursday to confirm Gen. Mark Milley, the Army’s top officer, to serve as the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, replacing Gen. Joseph Dunford when his term expires on Oct. 1.

Milley was confirmed by an 89-1 vote after being nominated by the president in December. Sen. Jeff Merkeley (D-Ore.) was the sole vote in opposition. While the chairman of the Joint Chiefs does not command any military forces, Milley will advise the president, the Defense secretary and the National Security Council on military matters (The Associated Press).

IN FOCUS/SHARP TAKES





2020 POLITICS: Biden is no longer holding his fire at rivals for the 2020 Democratic nomination after taking heat for months as he readies for the second Democratic debates next week.

As Jonathan Easley and Amie Parnes report, the former vice president has been absorbing shots from Sens. Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and Cory Booker on everything from his opposition to “Medicare for All” to his record on race with little to no pushback, leaving his allies frustrated by the passive approach.

However, the sustained questions about his commitment to civil rights seemed to finally provoke Biden to action, with his latest missives against Booker’s record on incarcerations and criminal justice during his tenure as Newark, N.J., mayor serving as the most recent example. The former vice president also said that he would not be as “polite” with Harris at the next debate after their back-and-forth on busing in late June, describing her attacks as a crass political play and wholly disingenuous.

Underlining the attacks is the continued push by Biden and others for support from African American voters and the former vice president’s need to rebound from an underwhelming debate performance last month in Miami to reestablish him as the undisputed front-runner for the 2020 Democratic nod.

“You can't be called the architect of mass incarceration and remain quiet,” a Biden ally said. “That's cruel and personal. That goes against his entire career. You can't let people say bullshit and not respond to it.”

They charged Bustos of being tactless when challenged by lawmakers of color.

“‘The overall plan for Latino outreach seems to be some 1980s playbook, which doesn't work anymore,’ Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) said.

“The DCCC declined to make Bustos available for an interview but said that the ‘DCCC has continued to increase diversity amongst our staff.’

Treasury yields little changed after US says economic growth slowed in the second quarter,https://www.cnbc.com,['Thomas Franck'],07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/26/bonds-treasury-yields-rise-ahead-of-gdp-data.html,"U.S. government debt yields were littled changed Friday after a Commerce Department report suggested that global growth concerns and trade war fears kept business investment lower in the second quarter despite a better-than-expected headline GDP print.

While overall GDP growth slowed to 2.1% from 3.1% in the prior quarter, the print still topped Dow Jones expectations of just 2% growth. A surge in personal consumption helped propel GDP in the month between April and June while a slowdown in business investment weighed on the results.

At around 4:22 p.m. ET, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to price, was little changed at 2.074%, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was slightly lower at 2.594%.

The personal consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, rose 2.3% annualized in the second quarter, up from 0.8% in the first quarter. The core print, which excludes food and energy, was 1.8% in the second quarter, up from 1.1% between January and March.

""The deceleration in real GDP in the second quarter reflected downturns in inventory investment, exports, and nonresidential fixed investment,"" the Commerce Department said in a press release. ""These downturns were partly offset by accelerations in PCE and federal government spending.""

The GDP print could have implications for the Fed and the direction of monetary policy when the central bank concludes its regular two-day meeting on Wednesday. Investors have been considering whether the Fed might not be as dovish as expected when it meets next week, but Wall Street still believes it will elect to cut rates by 25 basis points.

""As expected, inventories and trade were the major drags in the second quarter, after being big positives for growth in the first quarter,"" wrote PNC Chief Economist Gus Faucher. ""Still, the U.S. economy, which has been growing for more than 10 years, will continue to expand at least through the rest of 2019 and into 2020.""

""Growth will slow, however, due to less fiscal stimulus as the impact of the 2017 tax cuts fades, slower labor force growth, and weaker global economic growth,"" he added.

On Thursday, the European Central Bank said that the risk of a recession in the region is low and decided to leave rates unchanged."
'A f---ing travesty': Justice Department veterans say the way Mueller's testimony was handled blew past the 'historical significance of this moment',https://www.businessinsider.com,['Sonam Sheth'],07-26-2019,2019,7,https://www.businessinsider.com/doj-veterans-react-mueller-congress-testimony-2019-7,"The Russian government interfered in the 2016 US election in a ""sweeping and systematic"" fashion to propel Donald Trump to the presidency. The Trump campaign welcomed the intrusion. Trump and his associates tried to weaponize their political positions for financial gain. After assuming office, Trump significantly obstructed the investigation into Russia's meddling on nearly a dozen occasions. He ordered the White House counsel to fire the man investigating him. He urged witnesses not to cooperate with prosecutors. And contrary to his repeated assertions, he was not ""totally and completely exonerated"" of wrongdoing.

The former special counsel Robert Mueller testified to these findings before Congress this week, but none of it was actually news.

Nearly everything the former FBI director told lawmakers was plucked directly from the 448-page report that the Justice Department released in April. At a news conference the next month when he formally closed the investigation, Mueller told reporters that if he were forced to testify before Congress, he would not go beyond what was contained in the document, because ""the report is my testimony.""

So it surprised — and frustrated — Justice Department veterans when politicians and pundits were disappointed that Mueller's six-hour testimony this week wasn't more theatrical.

Mueller 'behaved like a dignified man who didn't want to be turned into some sort of performing monkey'

""Anybody who was disappointed by Mueller's performance simply wasn't paying attention,"" Patrick Cotter, a former federal prosecutor who has worked with members of Mueller's team, told INSIDER.

Elie Honig, a former prosecutor from the Southern District of New York, told INSIDER that ""the debate people are having right now is about style rather than substance.""

""Let's take away the superficiality of whether he looked assured, or whether he hesitated, or looked too old, or if he fired off his answers quickly enough,"" he said. ""Why should that matter? Look at what he said.""

Read more: The 7 biggest takeaways from Mueller's marathon Capitol Hill testimony

Cotter also contrasted Mueller's report with that of Ken Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel.

The Whitewater investigation started as a probe of President Bill Clinton and first lady Hillary Clinton's real-estate investments. But the matter quickly ballooned to include explicit details of the president's personal life and his affair with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky.

The Starr report ""was a perversion of what a prosecutor should do, and it went for the lurid details instead of staying within its scope, and it was blatantly partisan,"" Cotter said.

""Mueller's report was the opposite,"" he added. ""It is a model of clarity. It's well written. It's well organized. He hit the main points over and over again. There are summaries and previews. It's all there. He behaved like a dignified man who didn't want to be turned into some sort of performing monkey.""

'One slip of the tongue could be used to undermine his team's work'

When he could, Mueller stuck with ""yes"" or ""no"" answers, or he directed lawmakers to read the report themselves. He demurred when asked to read aloud portions of the document, and he flatly refused to discuss topics that strayed from his mandate or were currently involved in investigations.

""As a prosecutor, he had to ensure he stayed detached from the political process, presenting his findings in a manner that did not make it appear he was choosing a side or advancing an agenda,"" Renato Mariotti, another longtime former federal prosecutor, wrote for Politico Magazine. ""One slip of the tongue could be used to undermine his team's work.""

Mariotti added that even though Mueller's monotone answers may not have made for dramatic TV, ""they weren't without effect.""

At one point, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff, walked Mueller through a particularly incriminating line of questioning in which he got Mueller to confirm, with one- or two-word answers, that Russia wanted to help Trump win in 2016, that Trump and his campaign encouraged the effort, and that Trump lied to the public about his financial dealings in Russia.

In another instance, Democratic Rep. Val Demings got Mueller to confirm that the president was ""generally"" untruthful in his written answers to prosecutors' questions.

Elsewhere, Mueller said that welcoming foreign assistance in an election is ""unpatriotic"" and ""wrong,"" and that ""'problematic' would be an understatement"" regarding Trump's effusive praise of WikiLeaks.

Among other things, he also revealed that some members of Trump's inner circle are still subjects of counterintelligence investigations.

'It was a f---ing travesty'

Given the substance of Mueller's testimony, former officials expressed frustration with the media's coverage of the hearings.

""Everything we saw in the aftermath was about Mueller asking for questions to be repeated, how it played for the Democrats, how it looked for Republicans, whether this was good or bad for the president,"" a former senior Justice Department official who worked closely with Mueller when he was FBI director told INSIDER. ""And very little was about the value of what Mueller said and what's in his report. It was a f---ing travesty.""

Cotter echoed that view.

""What should have been a very serious, very important inquiry into an attack on our democracy — from outside and from within, reaching to the very highest levels of our government — was treated as a TV show, and it was reviewed as though Mueller was an actor in a play,"" he said.

""The criticism that everyone has is that Mueller refuses to reduce his report to a sound bite,"" Cotter added. ""He won't lie. He won't pervert. He won't take something complex and present it as simple. And with all this circus over who won and who lost and how Mueller performed, we've blown past the historical significance of this moment."""
4 Major Automakers Rebuke Trump Proposal With Emission Compromise. EPA Calls It ‘PR Stunt’,https://fortune.com,"['David Z. Morris', 'Aaron Pressman', 'Paula Bernstein', 'Ben Stupples']",07-25-2019,2019,7,https://fortune.com/2019/07/25/automakers-trump-carbon-emissions-epa/,"Four major automakers reached a compromise with California’s clean-air regulator to boost fuel efficiency, a move the Trump administration dismissed as a “PR stunt” that wouldn’t affect its plans to ease mileage requirements enacted during the Obama administration.

The joint agreement with Honda Motor Co., Ford Motor Co., Volkswagen AG and BMW AG amounts to a rebuke of the Trump administration’s 2018 proposal that recommended capping mileage requirements at a 37 mile-per-gallon fleet average starting in 2020, instead of eventually rising to 47 mpg. That plan also proposed stripping California of its authority to regulate carbon emissions from vehicle tailpipes.

The compromise with California gives participating automakers some relief starting in model year 2022 by easing the pace of annual efficiency gains currently required under the California Air Resources Board’s regulations on tailpipe greenhouse gas emissions, and extends the program by one year through 2026. Automakers will also receive additional compliance credits for selling electric vehicles under the plan, among other revisions, the state’s air pollution regulator said.

‘Complete Denialism’

“The Trump administration is hell bent on rolling them back. They are in complete denialism about climate change,” California’s Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom told reporters on a media call. “Regardless of what the Trump administration determines in the next few weeks, we are moving forward and we reserve our right to litigate.”

California is in talks with additional automakers that are expected to join the pact as well, Mary Nichols, chairman of the state’s Air Resources Board, said on the call.

In a joint statement, the automakers said the pact with California “will provide our companies much-needed regulatory certainty by allowing us to meet both federal and state requirements with a single national fleet, avoiding a patchwork of regulations while continuing to ensure meaningful greenhouse gas emissions reductions.”

The pact comes as the Environmental Protection Agency and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration are working to finalize their 2018 proposal after discussions with California officials broke down earlier this year.

“Today’s announcement from CARB has no impact on EPA’s regulation of greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act,” Michael Abboud, an EPA spokesman, said in an email. “This voluntary framework is a PR stunt that does nothing to further the one national standard that will provide certainty and relief for American consumers.”

In the statement, NHTSA said work continues on a final rule with which all companies must comply.

Automakers for months have urged the Trump administration to moderate its rollback, fearing a lengthy legal battle over California’s regulatory powers would throw the critical standards into uncertainty for years. Those efforts have had little sway so far on the White House, which rejected a plea by 17 carmakers last month to work out a compromise with California.

The companies also want to avoid a split market -- with federal mileage requirements in most states and more stringent rules in more than a dozen states that adhere to California’s standards. The states that follow California standards account for more than a third of all U.S. auto sales.

GM Passes

The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers issued a cautious statement stressing the need to avoid litigation with California but also adjusting the Obama-era standards. “Individual companies may have different perspectives on how best to achieve greater certainty,” the alliance said.

In fact, General Motors Co., which did not sign the pact with California, said in a statement it’s “focus remains on working with all parties on a solution that would involve a 50-state solution and a national electric vehicle program.”

Tom Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance, a free-market advocacy group that backs the Trump administration’s plan, said the deal is unlikely to derail the overall direction of the Trump administration’s plan.

“The autos are attempting to put further pressure on their brethren and the Trump administration to negotiate with California. That’s all this is,” Pyle said. “At the end of the day this deal doesn’t matter because we don’t see a situation where California wins in court.”

Environmentalists cheered the pact.

“It’s a real breakthrough,” said Dan Lashof, director of environmental group World Resources Institute. “I think this is a testament to California’s steadfast determination to make sure we are continuing to make progress on what’s now the biggest source of global warming pollution in the U.S., which is the transportation sector.”
