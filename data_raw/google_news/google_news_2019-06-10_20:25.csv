"Ex-Nixon aide John Dean testifies on Watergate-Russia ‘parallels,’ as GOP mocks appearance",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Alex Pappas', 'Alex Pappas Is A Politics Reporter At Foxnews.Com.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/former-nixon-aide-john-dean-testifies-of-remarkable-parallels-to-watergate-as-dems-ramp-up-trump-probes,"John Dean, the former White House counsel to Richard Nixon, testified Monday that he sees “remarkable parallels” between Watergate and the findings of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report – at a dramatic Capitol Hill hearing that Republicans panned as a political “show” as they repeatedly challenged the credibility of the witness.

In testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, Dean, an outspoken critic of President Trump, said several points in the Mueller report “echo Watergate,” especially relating to the obstruction of justice probe.

""In many ways the Mueller report is to President Trump what the so-called Watergate road map…was to President Richard Nixon,” Dean said, adding Mueller “has provided this committee a road map.”

NADLER PUTS BARR CONTEMPT PUSH ON HOLD AFTER STRIKING MUELLER REPORT DEAL

The hearing turned tense at times as Republicans and Democrats sparred over Dean’s credibility. Georgia GOP Rep. Doug Collins, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, mocked Democrats for bringing Dean in for testimony, accusing Democrats of using him to try to attack the president. “This committee is now hearing from the Seventies and they want their star witness back,” he said.

Collins mockingly added, “Let the show begin.”

During his questioning, Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan referenced how Dean ""pled guilty to obstruction of justice"" 45 years ago, dismissively saying Dean's now ""coming in to enlighten the Judiciary Committee on obstruction of justice.”

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler accused Jordan of casting “aspersions on the witness."" Nadler countered that Dean had been truthful during the Watergate investigation.

Later, Florida GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz accused Dean of “making money off” through books and television appearances by referring to multiple presidents as being worse than Nixon. He then asked Dean to explain how “Democrats plan to pay for Medicare for all,” saying, “I figured if we were going to ask you about stuff you don’t know about, we’d start with the big stuff.”

Dean dismissed Gaetz's remarks. “That was a speech. I don’t believe I can respond to it.""

In opening remarks, Nadler, a New York Democrat, referred to Dean as “a critical witness for prosecutors and congressional investigators"" during Watergate and said the committee will “rely on the expertise of these witnesses to help draw our own conclusions about the findings of the Special Counsel and other evidence before us today.”

At the outset of his testimony, Dean said, ""Clearly, I am not here as a fact witness,"" adding he accepted the invitation to give historical context to the Mueller Report. Dean, who testified before the committee in 1974 during the Nixon impeachment inquiry, eventually cooperated with prosecutors, pleading guilty to obstruction.

Dean used his argument to make numerous comparisons between Watergate and the Russia probe.

In comparing Watergate to Mueller's investigation, Dean said in testimony submitted to the committee: ""In both situations, the White House Counsel was implicated in the cover-up activity.""

Dean acknowledged being “an active participant in the cover-up for a period of time” during Watergate, but said he doesn’t believe Trump’s White House counsel, Don McGahn, “participated in any illegal or improper activity.” Still, he said, there’s “no question Mr. McGahn was a critical observer of these activities,” as “there is evidence he prevented several obstruction attempts.”

Among other parallels argued by Dean: In the Russia probe, the underlying crime was the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign. In Watergate, the underlying crime was the break-in of the Democratic National Committee, he said. While Dean pointed out that the Mueller report found no evidence that Trump engaged in aconspiracy with the Russians, he also said he doesn't believe Nixon himself was involved in the actual break-in and bugging during Watergate.

""Yet events in both 1972 and 2016 resulted in obstruction of the investigations,"" Dean said.

Arguing the president attempted to obstruct justice, he compared Trump’s comments in 2017 to then-FBI director James Comey about then-national security adviser Michael Flynn to Nixon’s comments to then-chief of staff H.R. Haldeman about the Watergate burglars. He also compared Trump’s firing of Comey to Nixon’s firing of Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox in the 1973 “Saturday Night Massacre.”

And in responding to the Mueller’s report finding that Trump directed McGahn to have Mueller fired over purported conflicts of interest (something McGahn never did), Dean said, “This is much like Richard Nixon’s attempt to get me to write a phony report exonerating the White House from any involvement in Watergate…Since I had conducted no such investigation, I resisted months of repeated efforts to get me to write a bogus report.”

The hearing – which comes as House Democrats ramp up efforts to investigate the president and suggest they could move to impeach him -- is titled, “Lessons from the Mueller Report: Presidential Obstruction and Other Crimes.”

On Monday, Trump ripped into Dean. ""Can’t believe they are bringing in John Dean, the disgraced Nixon White House Counsel who is a paid CNN contributor,"" Trump tweeted. ""No Collusion - No Obstruction! Democrats just want a do-over which they’ll never get!""

The Republican National Committee also tore into Dean over his testimony. ""House Democrats are going to new lengths to baselessly smear President Trump,"" the RNC's Steve Guest said in a statement. ""They are hauling in a relic from the past, John Dean, who has absolutely no connection to anything having to do with the Mueller investigation.""

Dean’s testimony kicks off what could be a dramatic week related to oversight of the Russia probe: Nadler announced plans Monday to hit pause on efforts to hold Attorney General Bill Barr in contempt over his refusal to turn over Russia probe-related documents, Democrats could still move forward on a separate contempt-related resolution this week to enforce subpoenas for Barr and former White House Counsel Don McGahn.

Separately, the Democrats on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence announced plans to hold an open hearing on Wednesday titled, “Lessons from the Mueller Report: Counterintelligence Implications of Volume 1.”

Trump accuses the Fed of making a 'big mistake' with its interest rate hikes,https://www.politico.com,['Caitlin Oprysko'],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/10/trump-federal-reserve-interest-rate-hikes-1358816,"President Donald Trump has repeatedly voiced his opinions on what actions he believed the Fed should take, publicly chastising Chairman Jay Powell for raising interest rates until Powell backed off late last year. | Charles McQuillan/Getty Images Finance & Tax Trump accuses the Fed of making a 'big mistake' with its interest rate hikes

President Donald Trump ripped into the Federal Reserve Monday, accusing the central bank of making a “big mistake” with its interest rate hikes while suggesting that current Fed policy was undermining him in negotiations with China.

In an interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” Trump tried to shift blame from his administration for the actions of the Federal Reserve Board, and said that whatever the reason for their decision not to go forward with expected rate hikes, it wasn’t because they were heeding his advice.

Story Continued Below

“We have people on the Fed that really weren’t — they’re not my people, but they certainly didn’t listen to me because they made a big mistake. They raised interest rates far too fast,” Trump said, despite having appointed four of the five current members of the board. He has vowed to only install new members of the board who support rate cuts, but his last two picks withdrew from consideration after backlash from Congress.

In what seemed to be an effort to underscore his comments, Trump tweeted out a clip of them shortly after his appearance ended.

Trump has repeatedly voiced his opinions on what actions he believed the Fed should take, publicly chastising Chairman Jay Powell for raising interest rates until Powell backed off late last year. This year, Trump has urged Powell to cut interest rates, a move that some Fed watchers now say is more likely because of the president’s erratic trade moves. He’s also pressed Powell to resume quantitative easing, a bond-buying program launched by the Fed in 2008 in the wake of the financial crisis to stop the collapse of the housing market and increase the supply of money in the economy. Trump argued for that again Monday.

He also bemoaned current monetary policy for how it factored into his trade negotiations with China, saying that the communist country’s currency devaluation had “put them at a tremendous competitive advantage.”

“We don’t have that advantage because we have a Fed that doesn’t lower interest rates,” Trump lamented. “We have a Fed that raises interest rates the day before a bond issue goes out. So we have to pay more money. You tell me about that thinking, OK?”

Despite Trump’s assertion that the U.S. “should be entitled to have a fair playing field,” which he said was not currently the case “because our Fed is very disruptive to us,” he argued that “even without a fair playing field, we’re winning.”

“I’m winning, but I’m not winning on a level table,” he continued, contrasting the independence of the Fed with China’s central bank. “If I had a table — don’t forget the head of the Fed in China is President Xi — the president of China. He’s also the head of the Fed, he can do whatever he wants.”

A Republican Explains Why Clinton Was Guilty and Trump Is Not,https://www.theatlantic.com,['Russell Berman'],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/06/impeachment-trump-chabot/591340/,"Chabot: Certainly I think anybody who reads the report is going to see that there were things that he or anyone could have done differently. But we weren’t in that same situation that he was. And the issue comes down to, did he obstruct justice? And the attorney general determined that he did not. Or at least there was, you know, insufficient grounds to prove it or make a case that he did.

Berman: You read the report yourself. You read the descriptions of the actions that Mueller acknowledged could be construed as obstruction of justice, and you’ve served on the Judiciary Committee for a long time. Did you personally see obstruction in those actions? Or did you see appropriate actions by the president?

Chabot: I did not see obstruction of justice myself. I’ll just leave it there.

Berman: Was there anything in that section that concerned you, whether it was the president asking the FBI director to let go of the Michael Flynn investigation or telling [White House Counsel] Don McGahn to fire Robert Mueller repeatedly? Did any of those things concern you? Do you think that was the right thing for the president to do?

Chabot: I think when you study almost anybody as closely and with such a fine-tooth comb as the president was studied, you’re always going to find instances where a person’s judgment can be second-guessed. But that’s not the standard we use to determine whether we ought to impeach a president or not. It’s whether he committed high crimes and misdemeanors. And I think there’s no evidence that that’s the case, or that you could ever prove a case of that nature.

Berman: You’re obviously just one of two Republicans who are on the committee who were around for the last impeachment of a president. Do you regret that vote, or do you think that Clinton committed impeachable offenses in lying about his sexual activity, and do you stand by that?

Chabot: I do stand by it. I think he did commit an impeachable offense—that’s why I voted that way. And there are a lot of differences. President Clinton put his hand on the Bible, swore to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. And then he lied. He perjured himself. And we had hundreds of people at the time that were in jail around the country for that very thing, and so I think perjury is a high crime and misdemeanor. And that’s why I voted that way. And we had the Starr report, which was somewhat similar to the Mueller report, and there were 11 grounds on which he recommended that we move forward on impeachment. Trump didn’t perjure himself. He was never under oath. And also Mueller did not recommend that there was an impeachable offense. So both things.

Berman: If Mueller had made a decision on obstruction—if he had concluded that Trump committed a crime, even if he couldn’t charge him while in office—or if he had made a more explicit impeachment referral to Congress, would that have weighed on you?"
Trump names immigration hardliner Cuccinelli as acting head of USCIS,https://www.foxnews.com,"[""Andrew O'Reilly""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-names-immigration-hardliner-cuccinelli-as-acting-head-of-uscis,"The Trump administration has named an immigration hardliner as the acting director of the federal agency that handles legal immigration.

Ken Cuccinelli, a former Virginia attorney general and an advocate for denying citizenship to American-born children of parents living in the U.S. illegally and for limiting in-state tuition at public universities to citizens or legal residents, was named on Monday as the acting head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

“I am honored to be given the opportunity to lead U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services at this critical time and serve alongside this agency’s dedicated workforce,” Cuccinelli said in a statement. “USCIS has the extraordinary responsibility to administer and protect the integrity of our nation’s lawful immigration system. Our nation has the most generous legal immigration system in the world and we must zealously safeguard its promise for those who lawfully come here.""

Cuccinelli's name has been tossed around for months. He had also been considered for a position as an immigration czar, a job possibly housed within the White House, but officials said last month that he would not be taking on that role.

It's unclear if Trump will nominate Cuccinelli for the permanent position. That would require Senate confirmation, which could be difficult.

The position opened after Trump forced the resignation of Lee Francis Cissna, whom Trump believed wasn't doing enough. Cissna said he worked ""passionately.""

Trump is dealing with a growing crisis as tens of thousands of Central American migrants cross the border each month, overwhelming the system, and he has been unable to deliver on his signature issue of reduced immigration and tighter border security.

Cissna told his staff in an email last month that he was grateful for their support and service, but offered no information on what was ahead.

""During the past 20 months, every day, I have passionately worked to carry out USCIS' mission to faithfully administer the nation's lawful immigration system,"" Cissna wrote to staff in May.

New revelations show the Trump administration is making the swamp even swampier,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Paul Waldman', 'Opinion Writer Covering Politics', 'Opinion Writer', 'June At Pm', 'Paul Waldman Is An Opinion Writer For The Plum Line Blog.']",06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/06/10/new-revelations-show-trump-administration-is-making-swamp-even-swampier/,"

Reuters/Joshua Roberts (Joshua Roberts/Reuters)

Opinion writer

One of the enduring mysteries of Trump fandom is that to this day, many of the president’s supporters continue to believe that he is a sworn enemy of “the swamp,” a corrupt system in Washington that he is busily cleaning up. Perhaps it’s too much to ask for a group of voters to admit that one of the central promises their champion made was a lie from the beginning.

But the corruption of the Trump administration is so comprehensive and wide-ranging that it contains important — and depressing — lessons about how corruption works and why it is so difficult to eradicate.

Some facets of Trump corruption are new and unique. For instance, for two centuries nobody thought much about how the emoluments clause of the Constitution should be understood, because the idea that any president would use his office for personal financial gain was absurd. But then there are Trump administration scandals that sound extremely familiar:

The Transportation Department under Secretary Elaine Chao designated a special liaison to help with grant applications and other priorities from her husband Mitch McConnell’s state of Kentucky, paving the way for grants totaling at least $78 million for favored projects as McConnell prepared to campaign for reelection. Chao’s aide Todd Inman, who stated in an email to McConnell’s Senate office that Chao had personally asked him to serve as an intermediary, helped advise the senator and local Kentucky officials on grants with special significance for McConnell — including a highway-improvement project in a McConnell political stronghold that had been twice rejected for previous grant applications.

This comes on the heels of news that Chao tried to include members of her family, which owns a large shipping firm that does extensive business in China, in official meetings with the Chinese government. If there’s anything unusual about these stories it’s that Chao was one of the few people in Trump’s Cabinet who actually knew their way around government; among other things she was secretary of labor under George W. Bush. As someone who had been a member of the Washington elite before Trump arrived and will remain so after he departs, she might have been a less likely suspect for corruption.

But this particular kind of corruption — a federal department steering grants to a particular area not solely on merit but because of the political interests of the secretary (or in this case, her husband) — is by today’s standards utterly mundane. It’s certainly wrong, but it’s usually not the kind of thing anyone goes to jail for.

But it is probably the kind of thing Trump’s voters thought he would be cleaning up when he told them he’d “drain the swamp.” What they didn’t realize was that he couldn’t care less. Do you think Trump is concerned that government contracts are awarded fairly? Of course not. If this helps Mitch McConnell get reelected, he’s all for it.

And here’s another story from Monday:

A real estate company part-owned by Jared Kushner has received $90m in foreign funding from an opaque offshore vehicle since he entered the White House as a senior adviser to his father-in-law Donald Trump. Investment has flowed from overseas to the company, Cadre, while Kushner works as an international envoy for the US, according to corporate filings and interviews. The money came through a vehicle run by Goldman Sachs in the Cayman Islands, a tax haven that guarantees corporate secrecy.... His holding is now valued at up to $50m, according to his financial disclosure documents.

Let’s not forget that Kushner is allowed to work in the White House in the first place because in the early days of the Trump presidency the Justice Department issued a document stating that anti-nepotism laws don’t apply to the White House staff. He had his application for a security clearance rejected by career officials “because of concerns about foreign influence, private business interests and personal conduct,” though they were overruled by a political appointee.

As The Post reported last year, “Officials in at least four countries have privately discussed ways they can manipulate Jared Kushner” by “taking advantage of his complex business arrangements, financial difficulties and lack of foreign policy experience.”

So shadowy foreign interests are providing funding to a firm in which Kushner’s personal interest is estimated at $50 million? Add that to his list of sketchy financial entanglements, such as the case of the financial services company with connections to the Qatari government that bailed out Kushner’s family business from its disastrous investment in 666 Fifth Avenue, an investment that nearly destroyed the Kushner Companies.

In tandem, these stories highlight one of the sobering lessons of the past few years: It’s easy to make the system dirtier, and really hard to make it cleaner. If he wants to, a president can try to change some rules and act with integrity himself, but if the next president is a crook, what the previous president did or didn’t do won’t constrain him at all. He’ll be able to be nearly as corrupt as he wants.

Barack Obama, for instance, came into office with a lot of high-minded ideas about transparency and good government. He put many of them into practice, making it harder for lobbyists to join the administration and easier for the public to access information, and running an administration that turned out to be remarkably free of scandal.

But if you ask people who really understand how government works whether the Obama years made a fundamental and lasting difference in how the system operates, they’ll say, “Well … not really.” It’s not that much of what he did wasn’t worthwhile, it’s just that in the end it either turned out to be not as transformational as people hoped, or it was easily reversed once Trump took office.

So what happens once Trump is gone? Unless we literally put the leader of the Russian mafia in the Oval Office, the next president will be less corrupt than this one. Nevertheless, the danger is that Trump will have succeeded in normalizing his own behavior, whether it’s appointing family members to key offices, maintaining financial interests that could affect policy decisions, or just trying to profit off the presidency.

We can hope that things get better, and they might. But it may be hard to bring us back even to where we were before in terms of the level of government corruption — which wasn’t that great to begin with.

Trump’s Russia Ambassador Wants to Come Home,https://www.theatlantic.com,['Mckay Coppins'],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/06/huntsman-russia-utah/591247/,"Read: How the U.S.-Russian relationship went bad

The ambassador’s tenure in Moscow has been a tumultuous one. Hundreds of American diplomats have been expelled from the country amid growing tensions over Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. And during a now-infamous summit in Helsinki last year, Trump drew global outrage after appearing to side with Russian President Vladimir Putin over U.S. intelligence agencies on the question of election tampering.

In the aftermath of the summit, many called on Huntsman to resign his post. Even The Salt Lake Tribune—a newspaper owned by his brother—ran a column making the case. “Ambassador Huntsman, you work for a pawn, not a president,” the columnist Robert Gehrke wrote. “It’s time to come home.” (After the column drew national media attention, the paper published a house editorial arguing that Huntsman “should stay put.”)

Ultimately, Huntsman chose to remain in the embassy and keep his head down, casting his service as an act of patriotic duty rather than loyalty to Trump. In an interview last year with the Deseret News, he said his sons, who serve in the Navy, “don’t have the luxury of saying, ‘Well, what party is our president and do I agree or disagree, and then I’ll decide whether to deploy.’ That’s not the way we operate. We salute those who are duly elected and try to do our best to serve. It’s pretty simple.”

But people close to Huntsman say he has come to miss the governor’s mansion—and the autonomy that comes with it. As an ambassador, every consequential move must be made in coordination with the White House and the State Department. A governorship—especially in a state, like Utah, that’s dominated by a single party—is different. “It’s the one job in the United States where you actually get to make decisions,” said a former Huntsman adviser.

This wouldn’t be the first time Huntsman left a diplomatic job to run for office. Back in 2010, I interviewed him while he was serving as ambassador to China under former President Barack Obama. Huntsman was in the States for the holidays, and we spoke in the sparsely furnished Washington, D.C., home he’d recently bought with his wife, prompting speculation about his political future. The notion that he would run for president in 2012 seemed far-fetched at the time. But when I asked him about it, he replied with a calculated coyness: “I think we may have one final run left in our bones.” Within a few months, he had resigned and announced his candidacy.

The resulting presidential campaign was short-lived, and Huntsman has made clear to friends that he has no interest in running for the office again. But he’s been heard using the same “one final run” phrase more recently when asked about the gubernatorial race.

Some Utah political observers are skeptical that Huntsman will actually choose to run when the time comes. And even those close to him stress that any number of outside factors could change his thinking in the coming months. Last year, he acknowledged that he’d been diagnosed with skin cancer. (“It’s just Stage 1,” he told the Deseret News. “So we’ll probably get it taken care of, and we’ll be fine.”)"
Justice Dept. Agrees to Turn Over Key Mueller Evidence to House,https://www.nytimes.com,['Nicholas Fandos'],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/us/politics/mueller-judiciary-committee.html,"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department, after weeks of tense negotiations, has agreed to provide Congress with key evidence collected by Robert S. Mueller III that House Judiciary Committee members said could shed light on possible obstruction of justice and abuse of power by President Trump, the House Judiciary Committee said on Monday.

The exact scope of the material the Justice Department has agreed to provide was not immediately clear, but the committee signaled that it was a breakthrough after weeks of wrangling over those materials and others that the Judiciary panel demanded under subpoena.

The announcement appeared to provide a rationale for House Democrats’ choice, announced last week, to back away from threats to hold Attorney General William P. Barr in contempt of Congress. The House will still proceed on Tuesday with a vote to empower the Judiciary Committee to take Mr. Barr to court to fully enforce its subpoena, but even that may no longer be necessary, the panel’s leader said.

“We have agreed to allow the department time to demonstrate compliance with this agreement. If the Department proceeds in good faith and we are able to obtain everything that we need, then there will be no need to take further steps,” Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the committee chairman, said in a statement. “If important information is held back, then we will have no choice but to enforce our subpoena in court and consider other remedies.”"
Trump appoints Social Security Administration watchdog to also oversee Interior,https://thehill.com,[],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/447713-trump-appoints-social-security-administration-watchdog-to-also,"President Trump Donald John TrumpHouse panel seeks to block Pentagon funds for border wall Giuliani evokes Joseph McCarthy in criticism of Pelosi Giuliani evokes Joseph McCarthy in criticism of Pelosi MORE has quietly appointed his Social Security Administration (SSA) inspector general to also oversee a much different agency: the Interior Department.

On May 28, Gail Ennis began her second job overseeing the Interior Department’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG), a role she will keep for the foreseeable future, the OIG confirmed to The Hill.

The Trump administration is still awaiting the confirmation of Mark Greenblatt, the former assistant inspector general for investigations at the Commerce Department, to formally head the Interior’s OIG office.

Ennis was sworn into the SSA role just five months ago, her first time serving as an inspector general. Her professional background is in securities litigation, working previously as a partner at the Washington, D.C.-based law firm WilmerHale, where she reportedly earned $2 million a year.

At the SSA, Ennis has most recently led efforts to thwart scam Social Security phone calls, at the Interior department she will oversee investigations into Interior’s newly appointed Secretary David Bernhardt's lobbying ties and two ongoing Justice Department investigations into former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke Ryan Keith ZinkeOvernight Energy: Investigators found Zinke's MAGA socks violated Hatch Act | Major union endorses Green New Deal | Group sues Trump over fishing permits said to endanger sea turtles Overnight Energy: Investigators found Zinke's MAGA socks violated Hatch Act | Major union endorses Green New Deal | Group sues Trump over fishing permits said to endanger sea turtles Federal investigators concluded Ryan Zinke's MAGA socks violated Hatch Act MORE. One of those investigations has reportedly made it to the grand jury.

The appointment of Ennis to Interior was not formally announced by the White House, however, the Interior Department’s website was updated last week to reflect her new position.

Ennis replaces former acting Inspector General Mary Kendall, who retired from the office at the end of May. Kendall oversaw multiple ethics investigations into Zinke, including recommending a number of them to the Justice Department for further investigation. Those investigations reportedly played a heavy factor in Zinke’s decision to leave the administration early this year.

Ennis is the second Trump political appointee whom the administration has attempted to put in the Interior OIG role.

Earlier this year, Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson Benjamin (Ben) Solomon CarsonBen Carson decries 'gotcha' politics: 'Give me a break' Ben Carson decries 'gotcha' politics: 'Give me a break' Trump administration to make it easier for adoption agencies to reject same-sex couples: report MORE announced to staff that Assistant HUD Secretary Suzanne Israel Tufts would replace Kendall. Because Tufts had been previously confirmed by the Senate, she would not have to go through another confirmation process for the role.

However, following backlash to that announcement, the Interior Department later said the announcement was a misunderstanding and Carson reversed the move. Tufts resigned not long after.

“On May 28th, Social Security [Inspector General] Gail S. Ennis started at [Department of Interior] OIG as Acting Inspector General. Continuing with her responsibilities as SSA IG, Ms. Ennis will also lead our organization while Mark Greenblatt’s nomination continues to progress in the Senate,” an OIG spokesperson said in a statement to The Hill.

The White House referred comment to the Interior OIG. The Interior Department did not return a request for comment.

In addition to the ongoing investigations into Interior's current and former secretaries, the OIG is also investigating six high-ranking interior officials for ethics concerns.

Wilmer Hale, the law firm where Ennis previously worked as a partner, lobbies for a number of clients with business before Interior. For example, the law firm represents Twin Metals a Minnesota based mineral mining company that is lobbing to build a hotly debated copper-nickel mine near the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. In May, the Trump administration moved to renew one of the mine's mineral leases, reversing a decision from the Obama administration.

Ennis, who was not a registered lobbyist, said the Interior OIG ethics office is currently reviewing her former clients.

""DOI OIG General Counsel is conducting a thorough ethics review that will ensure that I do not participate in any matter that would create a conflict of interest or an appearance of a conflict of interest,"" Ennis told the Hill in a statement.

VA owes $190 million to disabled veterans improperly charged home loan fees,https://www.foxnews.com,['Robert Gearty'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/va-owes-190-million-to-disabled-veterans-improperly-charged-home-loan-fees,"The Department of Veterans Affairs owes about $189 million to 53,000 disabled veterans who were charged home loan fees they were exempt from having to pay, an investigation has found.

These veterans were charged the fees under the VA’s Home Loan Guaranty Program and now may be entitled to refunds ranging from $5,000 to $20,000, a VA Inspector General audit released Thursday found.

VA loan managers knew disabled vets were being charged the fees improperly since 2014 but never did anything about it, VA IG auditors determined.

“OIG finds it troubling that senior (Veterans Benefits Administration) management was aware that thousands of veterans were potentially owed more than $150 million yet did not take adequate actions to ensure refunds were issued,” the IG report says.

DOZENS OF ATTORNEYS GENERAL ASK BETSY DEVOS TO FORGIVE DISABLED VETS STUDENTS LOANS

The loan managers told the IG they were focused on other priorities, including processing high volumes of applications, USA Today reported.

The report faulted the Veterans Benefits Administration for placing the burden on a disabled vet to submit a claim for a refund.

The VA announced last month that it was notifying veterans when they buy homes through the Home Loan program that they are exempt from the fees if they are disabled or later determined to be disabled, the paper reported.

“Through an internal quality improvement effort, VA has put a plan in place to better inform veterans through key communications when the law allows VA to waive the fee for a veteran,” the announcement quoted VA Secretary Robert Wilkie as saying.

The Veterans Benefits Administration told the IG that it would identify exempt veterans who paid the fees and issue them refunds and that the financial impact to the veterans was minimal over the life of the loan, The Washington Post reported.

No stranger to controversy himself, the former deputy attorney general stressed to the New York Times that Barr made the right call when he determined there was insufficient evidence to initiate criminal prosecution against President Trump for obstruction of justice.

“A few years from now, after all of this is resolved, some of Barr’s critics might conclude that his approach was a reasonable way to navigate through a difficult situation,” he said.

A redacted version of the report Mueller's report laid out 10 instances in which Trump might have obstructed justice, but Mueller declined to make a determination on the matter, citing a Justice Department guideline that sitting presidents cannot be indicted. Mueller also did not find sufficient evidence to establish criminal conspiracy took place between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.

Before the report's release in April, Barr released a summary of its principal conclusions which said he and Rosenstein decided there was not sufficient evidence to establish an obstruction crime had occurred. Still, although Trump says he has been vindicated, Democrats argue Mueller's refusal to clear Trump on obstruction provides them a road map to continue to investigate and possibly seek impeachment.

In a CBS News interview last month, Barr contradicted the reasoning Mueller gave about why he did not make a determination on the question of whether Trump obstructed justice. “I personally felt he could’ve reached a decision,"" Barr said, adding that the special counsel “had his reasons for not doing it” but declined to explain. “I’m not going to, you know, argue about those reasons,” he said.

Rosenstein was the official who appointed Mueller to be special counsel in May 2017, after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey. Trump heavily criticized Rosenstein and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions because of the Russia investigation, which he called a ""witch hunt.""

But by the time Rosenstein left the Justice Department last month, he appeared to patch things up with the president and has been a vocal defender of Barr, who has become a target of Democrats amid a fight over access to materials and people related to the Mueller investigation.

Barr is now looking into the origins of the counterintelligence investigation into Trump's campaign, which began in the summer of 2016 and was wrapped into Mueller's inquiry, due to misconduct concerns by Justice Department and FBI officials, including Comey, and has tasked U.S. Attorney John Durham with leading a review.

“He dives right into things,” Rosenstein said. “He doesn’t act like somebody who just arrived recently. He acts like someone who has been here all along for 30 years.”

Barr previously served a stint as attorney general in the early 1990s under former President George H.W. Bush."
The White House reportedly blocked climate testimony warning of a 'possibly catastrophic' future because it didn't 'jibe' with Trump's policy,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Aria Bendix'],06-08-2019,2019,6,https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-blocked-climate-testimony-trump2019-6,"The White House is engaged in a war of words about climate change.

Last Wednesday, Rod Schoonover, a senior analyst at the US State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, was barred from submitting his written assessment of the effects of a warming world to the House Intelligence Committee, the Washington Post reported.

Schoonover was scheduled to testify on behalf of the bureau at a climate change hearing held on June 5. Though he was permitted to speak in person, his office's written statement was blocked by White House officials, who thought his scientific claims contradicted the policies of the Trump administration.

In his written testimony, Schoonover predicted that the ""the compounded effects of climate change"" would produce ""significant,"" ""possibly catastrophic,"" harm to the planet. The ability to prevent this future, he wrote, will depend partly on humanity's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

A White House aide told the Washington Post that the testimony didn't ""jibe"" with the administration's official stance on climate change.

The testimony was reportedly opposed by members of the White House's Office of Legislative Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, and National Security Council, including William Happer, a National Security Council senior director. Happer, who was dismissed from his post at the Department of Energy in 1993, has stated that most of Earth's warming ""has probably been due to natural causes.""

Before the White House barred Schoonover's written testimony, the Bureau of Intelligence and Research reportedly refused a request from the Trump administration to eliminate certain scientific claims.

Here are a few claims from the written document, first obtained by the Washington Post:

Extreme high temperatures are increasing worldwide, and will continue to increase, due ""largely"" to greenhouse gas emissions.

Today's levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere haven't been seen in ""at least 800,000 years.""

Oceans are becoming more acidic due to increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

Climate change will amplify ""stresses"" such as droughts, floods, and fires.

The effects of climate change could undermine trade routes, the global economy, and the world's food supply.

Climate change will ""almost certainly"" threaten national security in the coming decades.

The crackdown on Schoonover's testimony reflects a larger effort on behalf of the Trump administration to police government reports related to climate change.

In May, the New York Times reported that the administration planned to prevent the federally-funded National Climate Assessment from outlining the ""worst-case scenarios"" if climate change went unchecked.

The Times also reported that the White House aimed to prevent the US Geological Survey from making climate predictions beyond 2040. Scientists expect the worst effects of global emissions to manifest after that time period.

U.S. government debt yields rose Monday after President Donald Trump said U.S. tariffs on goods from Mexico would be suspended.

U.S. President Donald Trump announced Sunday that proposed tariffs on Mexican imports would be suspended indefinitely. Trump said in a Twitter post Sunday that he has ""full confidence"" that Mexico will crack down on migration from Central America, after the two neighbors reached a consensus. The New York Times reported Saturday that the deal to avert tariffs largely comprised actions Mexico had already agreed to take.

Meanwhile, investors will be watching trade developments between the U.S. and China ahead of a key meeting between the leaders of the two countries. Speaking to CNBC on Sunday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said President Trump will decide about further Chinese tariffs after he meets his Chinese counterpart later this month."
Why former Defense Secretary Ash Carter wouldn't work for Trump,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Emily Tillett'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ash-carter-former-defense-secretary-would-not-work-for-trump/,"While he previously swore he would stay outside of politics, former Secretary of Defense Ash Carter says he wouldn't work for President Trump. Carter describes the commander-in-chief and his administration in his new book ""inside the Five-Sided Box: Lessons from a Lifetime of Leadership in the Pentagon"" as ""offensive, racist and divisive.""

""It's not politics, it's personal conduct,"" Carter said on ""CBS This Morning"" on Monday. Carter explained that he used to tell officers and soldiers in the military that they ""needed to behave themselves"" and would have fired an officer for acting as the president has.

""It's not just the president, it's the kind of behavior and personal conduct that you see everywhere in Washington today is not the kind of thing we tolerated in the military. I fired people for doing that and subordinates fired people for doing even less,"" Carter said.

Carter, who first began working for the Department of Defense in 1981, said he would not work under Mr. Trump if asked because he ""wouldn't know how to help him."" The Obama-era Defense chief said Mr. Trump appears to not take the advice of his Cabinet secretaries. That lack of concern for expert opinion is exactly what led Carter's successor, former Secretary of Defense James Mattis, to step down from the post in December, who cited vast differences in viewpoints with Mr. Trump as a sticking point.

""Your first duty as a Cabinet secretary is to serve the president, to help him...I couldn't take a job knowing that what I know and what I brought to the job, I wouldn't be able to apply to helping him,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Carter said the most urgent threats posed to the United States include China, Russia, Iran, North Korea and general terrorism.

""The future is more concerning to me, it's a competitive world,"" he said. ""All five of those are potential opponents are focused on us and we have to deal with all five of them and its a fast-moving world in technology, and so we need to make sure we stay competitive, because being the best, which we are, isn't a birthright, you got to keep earning it.""

He noted, however, that he was ""confident in our plans and capabilities with respect to all five of those today."""
"Treasury Secretary Mnuchin says the bond market is telegraphing a Fed rate cut, not a recession",https://www.cnbc.com,['Michael Sheetz'],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/10/mnuchin-bond-market-telegraphing-a-fed-rate-cut-not-a-recession.html,"Investors have been warning that the bond market is indicating a deteriorating economic outlook, but Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin disputed that interpretation in CNBC interview.

Mnuchin believes that falling bond yields, rather than warning of a recession, are indicating that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in the coming months. Bond yields fell to 20-month lows last week after government data showed U.S. job creation slowed more than expected in May.

""I would say that the bond markets are predicting ... a lowering of interest rates,"" Mnuchin said in an interview Sunday on CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia. ""

Mnuchin noted that he did not intend to comment on whether interest rates should be lowered, saying that he wants ""to respect"" the independence of the Federal Reserve. Mnuchin meets weekly with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. On Monday, President Donald Trump told CNBC the Fed made a mistake raising rates in December and is ""very disrputive"" to the economy.

Investor expectations of a June rate cut from the Fed rose last week to 27.5%, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. The market gives July a 79% chance of a Fed rate cut.

Mnuchin said the global economy is now in an environment where ""interest rates are very low around the world,"" which is what investors are ""seeing in the U.S. bond markets."" But the Treasury sees ""no signs of a recession"" in the U.S. economy, Mnuchin said, even as his department is ""somewhat concerned about what we see as a slowdown in Europe, China and other areas of the world.""

""We still see the growth in the U.S. as really quite strong,"" Mnuchin added."

Boyd wrote that Durham, the U.S. attorney from Connecticut, is receiving assistance from a “number of U.S. Attorney’s Office personnel and other Department employees.”

“The Department has made existing office space in Washington available for this work,” Boyd wrote in a letter to House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler Jerrold (Jerry) Lewis NadlerJudiciary Democrat: 'I don't have any difficulty' with Pelosi 'prison' comment Judiciary Democrat: 'I don't have any difficulty' with Pelosi 'prison' comment Who are the House Democrats backing Trump impeachment? MORE (D-N.Y.). “Mr. Durham’s Review will be funded out of the U.S. Attorney’s Salaries and Expenses appropriation.”

Barr said earlier this year that he intended to review the origins of the counterintelligence investigation into Russia's election interference and intelligence collection directed at members and associates of the Trump campaign. It later became known that he tapped Durham to lead the review.

Barr has said he believes the campaign was spied on and that he’s interested in ensuring that the investigative steps were adequately predicated. Barr has faced blowback for his use of the word “spying” from Democrats and other Trump administration critics who argued he was amplifying a conspiracy theory.

In the letter Monday, Boyd described Barr’s review as “broad in scope and multifaceted"" and said it is ""intended to illuminate open questions regarding the activities of U.S. and foreign intelligence services as well as non-governmental organizations and individuals.”

“As the Attorney General has stated publicly at congressional hearings and elsewhere, there remain open questions relating to the origins of this counter-intelligence investigation and the U.S. and foreign intelligence activities that took place prior to and during that investigation,” Boyd wrote.

“The purpose of the Review is to more fully understand the efficacy and propriety of those steps and to answer, to the satisfaction of the Attorney General, those open questions. Among other things, the Review will seek to determine whether the investigation complied with applicable policies and laws,” he wrote.

The letter comes weeks after Trump ordered U.S. intelligence leaders to cooperate with Barr’s investigation. Trump also gave Barr broad authorities to declassify and potentially release sensitive documents related to the probe.

Boyd described the review as a “collaborative” effort between the department and the intelligence community as well as “certain foreign actors.”

He also wrote that the department had requested certain unnamed intelligence community entities preserve relevant records, make available witnesses who may be “pertinent” to the inquiry and begin “identifying and assembling materials” relevant to the review consistent with Trump’s order and federal law.

Boyd also wrote that, while Barr had been granted the declassification powers, “it is of great importance to the Department to protect classified information by preventing the unwarranted disclosure of sensitive sources, methods, techniques and materials where such disclosure would endanger personal safety of U.S. government employees or friendly foreign partners, harm U.S. national security interests, or compromise the ability of U.S. government agencies to conduct their important work to protect the American people.”"
Ken Cuccinelli named acting head of DHS's legal immigration division,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Stephen Dinan']",06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jun/10/ken-cuccinelli-named-acting-head-dhss-legal-immigr/,"Former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli was officially named acting director at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services on Monday, putting him in charge of some of the most important behind-the-scene immigration initiatives of the Trump administration.

Foremost among his tasks will be to speed changes to a major guest-worker program and to finalize the new “public charge” rules, which are designed to push legal immigrants to prove they can be self-sustaining without becoming dependent on public assistance.

Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan announced Mr. Cuccinelli’s accession to the USCIS job in a statement Monday.

Mr. Cuccinelli had been under consideration for a job as immigration “czar” at the White House, but instead President Trump deputed him over to Homeland Security as an adviser.

Now he lands in a specific job, taking over for Director Francis Cissna, who had fallen out of favor with the White House for not moving fast enough on what top presidential advisers said were their top priorities.

Democrats were upset by the move.

“Mr. Cuccinelli is an anti-immigrant fringe figure that has no business leading a component that is supposed to administer our nation’s legal immigration system,” said Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, chair of the House Homeland Security Committee.

The Mississippi Democrat predicted Mr. Cuccinelli would be a force for chaos at the agency, undermining its mission.

And he said there’s no chance Mr. Cuccinelli would be confirmed to the position if nominated to it, so it makes no sense to install him as the acting director.

Mr. Thompson didn’t say which Republicans he had in mind as opposing Mr. Cuccinelli, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell earlier this year told reporters he did not want Mr. Trump to select Mr. Cuccinelli.

Mr. Cuccinelli, as head of a conservative activist organization, backed a challenger to Mr. McConnell in his 2014 election, and in 2017 Mr. Cuccinelli signed onto a letter urging Mr. McConnell to give up the leader’s post. “America is too good for you to lead it,” Mr. Cuccinelli and fellow conservatives wrote.

Though USCIS gets less attention than the other two immigration agencies, Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, it is instrumental in the enforcement of immigration laws, deciding on legal immigration applications and some visitor visas.

Though it gets less attention than the other two immigration agencies, Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, USCIS handles the processing of legal immigration applications and some visitor visas.

The agency is under fire from Democrats who say that it has slow-walked legal immigration under Mr. Trump, erecting what activists have labeled an “invisible wall” to prevent migration.

Yet USCIS points to increased processing of citizenship applications and to the border crisis, which has spawned a massive surge in asylum petitions, both of which fall to the agency’s officers to adjudicate.

The White House has been demanding stricter asylum standards out of USCIS, saying it could help cut down on the flow of illegal immigrants if it took a more critical eye of the initial claims migrants make at the U.S.-Mexico border.

“One of the biggest frustrations is the fact that USCIS has not been able to change agency culture about ‘credible fear’ and asylum from the Obama years,” a White House official told reporters two months ago, predicting changes at the agency.

Those comments came as Mr. Trump had ousted Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and acting ICE Director Ronald D. Vitiello, seeking a tougher direction from his leaders.

Mr. Cissna survived the initial culling, but White House officials made clear he was on the hot seat.

Battle over science roils EPA,https://thehill.com,[],06-09-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/447520-battle-over-science-roils-epa,"Environmental Protection Agency is battling its own board of science advisers over its controversial plan to dismiss certain types of scientific research from consideration when issuing rules.

A meeting this week between the agency and some of the nation’s top scientists highlighted the growing rift between the EPA and the scientific community, with members of the Science Advisory Board (SAB) pushing back on the administration's efforts to bar consideration of studies that don't make their underlying data public.

Critics say the move would omit important research from EPA consideration and lead to a dramatic rollback of existing regulations.

The SAB, a team of more than 40 of the nation’s top scientists, have been asking to weigh in on the controversial proposal since it was unveiled more than a year ago.

On Wednesday, it said it would do so —despite a request from the agency to review a narrow portion of the rule.

There’s mistrust between the scientific community and EPA’s leaders in the Trump administration.

Then-EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott PruittBattle over science roils EPA EPA head accuses reporters, green group of 'colluding' on press coverage EPA head accuses reporters, green group of 'colluding' on press coverage MORE said the proposal, called Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science, would battle “secret science” when it was first introduced. That spurred scientists to call the proposal “censored science.”

EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler Andrew WheelerBattle over science roils EPA Overnight Energy: Inslee says DNC won't hold climate debate | Democrats fear Trump opening door to mining in Grand Canyon | Interior pick gets surprising support from greens | Ocasio-Cortez says effective climate plan needs T Overnight Energy: Inslee says DNC won't hold climate debate | Democrats fear Trump opening door to mining in Grand Canyon | Interior pick gets surprising support from greens | Ocasio-Cortez says effective climate plan needs T MORE on Wednesday appeared before the board, vowing to improve the relationship between it and the agency.

“I’ll be the first to admit that we have not utilized you in ways that we should. We can and we will do better,” Wheeler said.

But many in the science and environmental community walked away from the meeting disheartened at what they see is the agency’s plan to amplify pet policies and the voices of industry over those from scientists.

“I would say the way that the meeting proceeded kind of contradicted a lot of Administrator Wheeler’s statement at the beginning of the meeting,” said Genna Reed, lead science and policy analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists. “Their discussion showed that EPA has not really involved the Science Advisory Board and gotten their advice on several of the deregulatory actions they’ve proposed.”

Scientists have had a number of concerns over how the Trump administration values science, but things really came to a head when the EPA announced the science transparency rule without first consulting the SAB.

The group didn’t find out about the rule until it was publicly announced — a sign, scientists and environmentalists say, the EPA was not interested in meaningful feedback.

The proposal has since proven to be one of the most controversial EPA has written, prompting 600,000 comments. Critics say the rule will exclude some of the most important research from consideration simply because it does not rely on data that can be shared publicly.

The board sent a letter in May of 2018 with a number of questions and asking to weigh in on the rule but it took almost 11 months before the agency responded in April of this year.

Wheeler apologized for the delay Wednesday, saying it was the result of the agency taking time to rethink how it wants to work with the board going forward.

He asked the board to give its thoughts on how the agency can deal with studies that don’t make their data public because it includes confidential business information or personally identifiable information.

The board bucked that request and instead voted to review the proposal in its entirety.

“I’m wondering if any of the comments the EPA received gave you pause about proceeding with that rule?” asked Barbara Morrissey, chair of a separate EPA panel, the Children’s Health Protection Advisory Committee.

“I agree the confidentiality issue in an important and a thorny one so I’m glad that you referred that to us, but I’m concerned about whether the best available science can be ignored because it can’t be replicated for obvious reasons,” she said, nodding to studies of people who were exposed to harmful chemicals.

Watchers of the board were surprised by the vote given how the makeup of the board has changed under the Trump administration.

Fears that the EPA planned to sideline scientists started under Pruitt when he announced that scientists who receive grants from the EPA would not be allowed to serve on the board—a move that knocked out about half of the members sitting on the Science Advisory Board.

Reed with the Union of Concerned Scientists said there are pretty much two types of grants available to scientists—those from the EPA and those from industry. She didn’t understand why getting an EPA grant would present a conflict of interest when an industry grant wouldn’t.

“People who received these no strings attached grants and are experts on some of the most pressing environmental issues are kept from serving on the board,” she said. “It’s clearly a political maneuver to change the composition of these advisory committees.”

Twenty six of the 45 current board members were appointed during the Trump Administration, a huge amount of turnover in a board that otherwise loses under a fifth of its members each year due to term limits.

“I was pleasantly surprised,” Chris Zarba, who served as the former staff coordinators for SAB until last year, said of the vote to review the entire science transparency rule. It’s not that the Trump administration picks aren’t qualified, he said, but a good board needs diversity.

“Think of it this way. If I was picking a world class football team, and I only picked people that were world class, top-ranked players — if all those people I picked were field goal kickers, I’d never win a game,” he said. “It’s hard to question any single member on the board, and by law the administrator can pick anyone they want and any member that is qualified, but the bigger question is: is the entire team well equipped and accurately representing mainstream science? I think we will see how it turns out...There are certainly picks I wouldn't have recommended to the administrator.”

Robert Phalen is one Trump administration pick that has been questioned by scientists for views of air pollution that are out of line with most mainstream scientists. The University of California Irvine professor told the American Association for the Advancement of Science that “modern air is a little too clean for optimum health.""

Phalen was one of the few at the meeting to vote against reviewing the science transparency rule in its entirety.

“I can see and respect both sides of the debate on transparency,” he told The Hill in an email. “We need to know if the research used for regulations is free of serious errors, and that requires other scientists having access to the data. On the other hand if the data were widely available it could be improperly used, such as for disclosing private information. So both sides have validity.”

Wheeler said the agency will move forward with something, assuring the board that the administrator will always have the power to give an exemption to an important study, even if it can’t disclose all its data.

“I do fundamentally believe the more information we put out to the public as far as what is the basis for our regulatory decisions, the more sound our decision will be and the more easily understood and accepted by the public our decision will be because they see all the science we are using,” he told the board."
"Acting DHS secretary praises White House deal with Mexico on immigration, defends Trump's tariff threat",https://www.foxnews.com,"[""Andrew O'Reilly""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/acting-dhs-secretary-praises-white-house-deal-with-mexico-on-immigration-defends-trumps-tariff-threat,"Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan on Sunday praised the recent deal reached by the United States and Mexico to handle the migration situation along the two countries’ shared border, while downplaying the criticism of President Trump for threatening to impose tariffs on the U.S.’ neighbor.

Speaking on “Fox News Sunday,” McAleenan said that while people can disagree with Trump’s tactics, the fact remains that Mexico approached the White House with “real proposals” on how to handle the immigration crisis. “Mexico came to the table with real proposals,” McAleenan said. “We have an agreement that, if they implement, will be effective.”

The agreement — announced late Friday in a tweet by Trump — ended a showdown that business leaders warned would have disastrous economic consequences for both the U.S. and one of its largest trading partners, driving up consumer prices and driving a wedge between the two allies. And it represented a win for members of Trump's own party who had flooded the White House with pleading calls as well as aides who had been eager to convince the president to back down.

PELOSI NEEDS TO ADDRESS 'INVASION' AT BORDER, CONGRESS' INACTION 'SHAMEFUL,' GOP REP SAYS

“I think, just in general, Republicans understand that tariffs are a tax on American consumers,” Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said during a separate interview on “Fox News Sunday.” “And we don't want to see them in place long-term, nor do I believe President Trump does either. He's using tariffs as leverage in trade negotiations and I think he used them as leverage in this situation brilliantly, quite honestly.”

A ""U.S.-Mexico Joint Declaration"" released by the State Department said the U.S. ""will immediately expand the implementation"" of a program that returns asylum-seekers who cross the southern border to Mexico while their claims are adjudicated. Mexico will ""offer jobs, health care and education"" to those people, the agreement stated.

Mexico has also agreed, it said, to take ""unprecedented steps to increase enforcement to curb irregular migration,"" including the deployment of the Mexican National Guard throughout the country, especially on its southern border with Guatemala. And Mexico is taking ""decisive action to dismantle human smuggling and trafficking organizations as well as their illicit financial and transportation networks,"" the State Department said.

Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador tweeted, ""Thanks to the support of all Mexicans, the imposition of tariffs on Mexican products exported to the USA has been avoided."" He called for a gathering to celebrate in Tijuana Saturday.

TRUMP DEFENDS DEAL WITH MEXICO TO STEM MIGRANT FLOWS, PREVENT TARIFFS

The changes, in part, continue steps the Trump administration was already taking. The U.S. announced in December that it would make some asylum seekers wait in Mexico while their cases were being proceeded — a begrudging agreement with Mexico that has taken months to scale and that has been plagued with glitches, including wrong court dates, travel problems and issues with lawyers reaching their clients.

Homeland Security officials have been ramping up slowly, and were already working to spread the program along the border before the latest blowup. About 10,000 people have been returned to Mexico to wait out the processing of their immigration cases since the program began Jan. 29.

More than 100,000 migrants are currently crossing the U.S. border each month, but not everyone claims asylum and migrants can wait an entire year before making a claim.

“We need to change the asylum standard, so that that front bar, where we assign credible fear, is not so automatic, so that 85-95 percent of people get that, while only 10 percent get asylum at the end of a court proceeding,” McAleenan said. “We need to align that more closely with what might actually be a successful claim.”

Trump had announced the tariff plan last week, declaring in a tweet that, on June 10, the U.S. would ""impose a 5 percent Tariff on all goods coming into our Country from Mexico, until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico, and into our Country, STOP."" U.S. officials had laid out steps Mexico could take to prevent the tariffs, but many had doubts that even those steps would be enough to satisfy Trump on illegal immigration, a signature issue of his presidency and one that he sees as crucial to his 2020 re-election campaign.

After returning from Europe Friday, though, Trump tweeted, ""I am pleased to inform you that The United States of America has reached a signed agreement with Mexico."" He wrote that the ""Tariffs scheduled to be implemented by the U.S. on Monday, against Mexico, are hereby indefinitely suspended.""

Trump said Mexico has agreed to work to ""stem the tide of Migration through Mexico, and to our Southern Border"" and said those steps would ""greatly reduce, or eliminate, Illegal Immigration coming from Mexico and into the United States.""

The 5 percent tax on all Mexican goods, which would increase every month up to 25 percent under Trump's plan, would have had enormous economic implications for both countries. Americans bought $378 billion worth of Mexican imports last year, led by cars and auto parts.

Many members of Trump's Republican Party and business allies had urged him to reconsider — or at least postpone actually implementing the tariffs as talks continue — citing the potential harm to American consumers and manufactures.

Plan to Reclassify Radioactive Nuclear Waste Spurs Anger,https://www.usnews.com,[],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2019-06-10/energy-department-plan-to-reclassify-radioactive-nuclear-waste-spurs-anger,"A welcome sign outside the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, May 10, 2017, in Richland, Wash. (Young Kwak/The Washington Post/Getty Images)

A Department of Energy plan to reclassify some of the country's radioactive waste to lesser threat levels in order to save time and money is angering environmental groups and raising questions among experts.

Last week, the Energy Department put into place its new interpretation for high-level radioactive waste, saying that the updated definition will allow the agency to more easily move less hazardous waste from old nuclear weapons facilities where it has languished without a permanent disposal solution.

The agency's previous classification efforts managed hazardous waste based on how it was produced instead of its radioactivity. For example, the use of uranium fuel in a nuclear reactor produces high-level radioactive waste. Classifications for the waste determine disposal methods, which can vary in things like how deeply such material is buried in the ground or how thick the protective material in which it is encased.

The Energy Department said its past approach cost billions of dollars and led to decades of delays.

""Recognizing this failure, this Administration is proposing a responsible, results-driven solution that will finally open potential avenues for the safe treatment and removal of the lower level waste currently housed in three states,"" the Energy Department's Undersecretary for Science Paul Dabbar said.

By changing the process to allow for some high-level radioactive waste to be categorized as low-level, the agency said it will be able to start moving waste that has been trapped in Energy Department facilities in Washington state, South Carolina and Idaho.

Management of high-level radioactive waste has effectively been at a standstill as Nevada's Yucca Mountain, which houses a deep geological repository storage facility, awaits proper licensing.

Yucca Mountain has suffered from ""technical and political disagreement"" for decades, says Rod Ewing, a professor in nuclear security at Stanford University.

""There's an understandable pressure to do something with at least some of the waste,"" Ewing says.

Under the proposal, waste newly deemed less harmful that is currently housed at Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington state, the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina and the Idaho National Laboratory could be removed for disposal.

But the National Resources Defense Council says reclassifying the waste is akin to the Energy Department giving itself the authority to declare victory and abandon cleanup at these sites.

""The Trump administration is moving to fundamentally alter more than 50 years of national consensus on how the most toxic and radioactive waste in the world is managed and ultimately disposed of,"" Geoff Fettus, a senior attorney at the environmental group, said in a statement. ""No matter what they call it, this waste needs a permanent, well-protected disposal option to guard it for generations to come.""

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said he would not stop state efforts to clean up the Hanford site to a higher standard and challenged the legality of the federal change.

""By taking this action, the administration seeks to cut out state input and move towards disposal options of their choosing, including those already deemed to be unsafe by their own assessments and in violation of the existing legally binding agreement,"" he said. ""We will consider all options to stop this reckless and dangerous action.""

Experts agreed that reclassification is a valid issue for the Energy Department to examine but had questions about the agency's process.

""In principle, it does make sense to try to tie these definitions more closely to hazards,"" says Edwin Lyman, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. However, the agency ""would have to do a much more rigorous job defining their methodology,"" he says.

Determining the class of radioactive waste involves assessments that can be ""highly controversial,"" Ewing says.

The assessment process can allow for some leeway, which ""opens the door for monkey business,"" Lyman says.

The Energy Department paired its announcement with a notice that the agency is starting an environmental impact analysis for an alternative disposal method for low-level radioactive waste at the Savannah River Site.

Tom Clements, the director of non-profit public interest group Savannah River Site Watch, pushed back against the agency's move."
Meadows predicts DOJ inspector general FISA abuse report will be late due to new developments,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-09-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/meadows-predicts-doj-inspector-general-fisa-abuse-report-will-be-late-due-to-new-developments,"A top Republican on the House Oversight Committee predicted on Sunday that the highly anticipated Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse report from the Justice Department’s inspector general will be released later than expected due to new developments.

On Fox News Rep. Mark Meadows told ""Sunday Morning Futures"" host Maria Bartiromo that he is ""not as optimistic now"" after Attorney General William Barr said he anticipated Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s investigation to be complete by early June.

Horowitz and his team have been investigating alleged FISA abuse by the Justice Department and the FBI since March 2018. The inquiry includes a focus on the FBI’s handling of the unverified dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele and its extensive use in the FBI's FISA applications and renewals to target former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

Barr said in April that Horowitz would be wrapped up “in probably May or June” but an end-of-the-month deadline looks increasingly unlikely.

“Only Michael Horowitz knows the exact time frame of when it’s coming out. Obviously the attorney general indicated that he hoped to see it in June. I’m not as optimistic now,” Meadows said on Sunday. “One of the reasons for that is additional information has been given to the inspector general for them to investigate.”

One significant piece of new potential information could be Steele’s interest in being interviewed by Horowitz’s team. Steele has conditions for an interview, including that the inspector general's team needs to come to London, where he lives and runs his private investigative firm Orbis Business Intelligence, they can only focus on his relationship with the FBI, for whom he was a confidential source, and the U.S. has to get permission from the U.K. government first.

As recently as April it was reported that Steele declined to meet with Horowitz’s team due to concerns about being undermined. Although he has apparently come around to speaking with Horowitz, Steele still appears dead set against meeting with officials connected to Barr’s own investigation into the origins of the Russia investigation, led by U.S. Attorney John Durham.

Steele was hired by the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which was itself being paid by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee through the Perkins Coie law firm. The fact that the dossier had Democratic funding was not revealed to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.

Meadows stressed that his prediction about Horowitz's inquiry was just his own opinion based on the reports he has seen. “I can tell you Inspector Horowitz obviously hasn't communicated that to my knowledge to anybody on Capitol Hill,” the North Carolina congressman said. “But based on what I'm seeing in terms of additional information being shared with him I think it'll be a while.”"

Commerce Department official killed in apparent murder-suicide: DC police,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Sam Dorman', 'Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News. You Can Follow Him On Facebook']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/commerce-official-killed-in-apparent-murder-suicide-dc-police,"An official for the U.S. Commerce Department died on Friday in what a preliminary investigation said was a murder-suicide involving her husband, the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department reported on Friday.

According to police, officers conducted a welfare check at the couple's home in Northwest D.C. on Friday. When they arrived they found a man, identified as 51-year-old Jason Rieff, with a handgun who appeared to fire a self-inflicted shot while they were on the scene. Authorities said they also found an unresponsive adult female identified as 45-year-old Lola Gulomova.

HOMICIDES SPIKE IN DC AND BALTIMORE, DEFYING DOWNWARD TREND IN OTHER BIG CITIES

In their preliminary investigation, detectives from the Homicide Branch said the incident was ""domestic in nature."" The couple had two children who weren't present during the shooting, BNO News reported.

Rieff was pronounced dead after he was rushed to an area hospital. Gulomova has worked in a variety of public servant positions for the U.S. government. Originally from Tajikistan, she came to the United States where she eventually worked as NASA Deputy Russia Representative at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.

While working at the Commerce Department, she took diplomatic posts in India, China, and Taiwan.

“We lost a true friend of Uzbekistan. My deepest sympathies to her close ones,” Javlon Vakhabov, the Uzbek Ambassador to the United States, reportedly said.

"U.S. embassies still hoisting rainbow flags, despite advisory from Washington",https://www.pressherald.com,['Email Writer'],06-08-2019,2019,6,https://www.pressherald.com/2019/06/08/u-s-embassies-still-hoisting-rainbow-flags-despite-advisory-from-washington/,"Since the State Department began rejecting all embassy requests to hoist rainbow flags outside the mission buildings during Gay Pride Month this year, some U.S. diplomats have been finding ways to defy, or at least get around, the new policy.

The facades of the U.S. missions in Seoul and Chennai, India, are partially hidden behind large rainbow flags, while the embassy in New Delhi is aglow in rainbow colored lights. The website for the embassy in Santiago, Chile, shows a video of the chief diplomat raising a rainbow flag last month for the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia.

The Vienna Embassy’s website features a photo of a rainbow flag flying below Old Glory on a mast jutting from the building, a statement by Diplomats for Equality and a story about a professor lecturing on the visibility and growth of LGBT rights.

U.S. diplomats in Jerusalem joined a March for Pride and Tolerance, and several ambassadors have tweeted photos of themselves in local Pride parades or standing outside the embassies surrounded by employees holding up letters spelling PRIDE.

“This is a category one insurrection,” said one diplomat, who like others interviewed about the sentiment over the rejections, which were not made in writing, spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of being fired.

A practice routinely approved for most of the decade at many embassies now requires top-level approval from the State Department. But this year, as first reported by NBC News, all requests were nixed.

The flap over the flags started when the State Department did not send out an official cable this year with guidelines for marking Pride Month, as it has in years past. In 2011, the Obama administration directed agencies involved with foreign policy to promote LGBT rights, a striking policy for an agency that, up to the early 1990s, considered homosexuality a security risk and cause for termination.

The Obama administration’s Pride Month guidelines included rules for flying rainbow flags from poles outside embassies – they had to be smaller than the American flag and fly beneath it. But permission was granted with no fuss. By 2016, approvals were left up to each ambassador or chief of mission.

That process changed last year, after Mike Pompeo became secretary of state. An evangelical Christian who believes marriage should be defined as between a man and woman, Pompeo has said gay employees will be respected and treated like everyone else. But he has downplayed some symbols of LGBT rights, while introducing several new panels and envoys specializing in religious freedom issues.

The advisory cable that came out last year said diplomats are required to obtain top-level approval from the State Department’s Office of Management to fly a rainbow flag.

The State Department declined to answer questions about the Pride Month advisory and rainbow flag ban. But two diplomats familiar with the events said all requests last year were approved.

This year, there was a shift. Embassies in Israel, Germany, Brazil and Latvia, plus a handful of other posts, asked to fly rainbow flags. All were denied, said a person at the State Department who was familiar with what happened.

Although most embassies seem to be towing the line, the policy shift appears to have sparked something of a revolt among diplomats.

Some embassies that have flown the flag in previous years opted this year to commemorate the month by posting on their websites President Trump’s statement affirming LGBT rights and inviting nations to join a global campaign to decriminalize homosexuality. The initiative was the idea of Richard Grenell, the U.S. ambassador to Germany, who is gay.

Some embassies got playful with the display of Trump’s statement. In Brasilia, for example, the statement is topped by a photo of two hands holding six Play-Doh letters in rainbow colors: LGBTQ. But some did not mention Trump’s statement at all, an absence made more glaring by the juxtaposition with statements by ambassadors and secretaries of states left over from previous years.

Some gay employees in the foreign and civil service say the ban on flying the rainbow flag is just the tip of an iceberg of slights.

Pompeo has not issued a statement for Pride Month, as he did last year. He did not attend the State Department’s annual Pride Day event for two years running as his predecessors usually did, though he was traveling in Europe this year. Instead, he dispatched Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, a veteran diplomat who promised that the State Department will advocate for gay diplomats and their families.

“Day by day, a death by a thousand cuts, our rights as lgbt+ Americans are being eroded with the removal of a guidance here, the rewriting of a policy there, or just the quiet disappearance of a web site,” Robyn McCutcheon, a transgender woman who has served in several posts abroad, wrote in her blog “Transgender at State,” lamenting what she has observed throughout the government in the past two years. “It should come as no surprise that this erosion would happen also at the U.S. Department of State.”

Some acknowledge that their worst fears have not been borne out.

The administration has appointed several gay ambassadors. Trump became the first Republican president to make a statement celebrating Pride Month. No one has been fired for sexual orientation, but some said they have felt more vulnerable after Trump tried to ban transgender people from the military.

Better, they said, to not even discuss LGBT issues publicly and risk the consequences of drawing attention to themselves.

“We fly below the radar,” one employee said. “We survive because they don’t realize we’re here.”

"Daily on Defense: HASC chairman lays down his mark, Republicans cry foul, US-Turkey alliance unwinds over F-35, United Technology and Raytheon join forces",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/house-committee-members-deeply-divided-on-presidents-pentagon-budget-request,"OFF THE MARK: House Armed Services Chairman Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., is drawing clear battle lines with President Trump’s proposed defense budget and its Republican backers in Congress with his “Chairman’s Mark” of the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, released early this morning.

The plan proposed by the House committee controlled by Democrats would trim Trump’s $750 billion request to $733 billion, eliminate funding for low-yield nuclear weapons, bar the use of military construction funds for border barriers, prohibit Trump from pulling U.S. troops out of South Korea or send more prisoners to Guantanamo. Nor would it support a separate Space Force, a top priority for the president.

The plan not only conflicts with the administration’s Pentagon proposal but also the Senate version of the NDAA. That plan, passed with little fanfare by the Senate Armed Services Committee last month, enjoyed bipartisan support.

BY THE NUMBERS: Here’s the House FY 2020 proposal:



Department of Defense base: $632.9 billion

Department of Energy base: $22.6 billion

Other defense-related activities: $0.3 billion

Defense topline: $655.9 billion

Overseas contingency operations: $69 billion

Defense topline: $724.9 billion

Authorizations outside of HASC jurisdiction: $8.2 billion

Total defense authorization: $733 billion

For comparison here are the Senate numbers from two weeks ago:



Department of Defense base: $642.5 billion

Department of Energy base: $23.2 billion

Overseas contingency operations: $75.9 billion

Defense topline: $741.5 billion

Other defense: $8.4 billion

Total defense authorization: $750 billion



BORDER RESTRICTIONS: House Democrats, who have been fuming about President’s Trump’s legal use of emergency powers to divert military construction funds for his border wall, want to specifically bar the practice in the future.

The House NDAA includes a blanket prohibition on the use of DoD, military construction or counter-drug funds to build a “wall, fence, or physical barrier” along the southern border. It also specifically denies $7.2 billion in funding that the Trump administration planned to pay back to the construction fund to make up for the money shifted to border barriers this year.

DEEP PARTISAN DIVIDE: The ranking member on the committee, former chairman Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, weighed in with his objections, noting the move away from what he called the traditional “broad bipartisan support” the NDAA usually enjoys. “There are a number of provisions in the bill that meet that standard,” he said. “There are others that are troubling.”

What troubles Thornberry:



The $17 billion cut from Trump’s budget, which he says doesn’t provide the 3%-5% in real growth to continue readiness restoration

No Space Force, despite bipartisan support on the committee

A $1.2 billion cut in military personnel funds, which he says will hurt service members and their families

Nuclear weapons restrictions. “In addition to prohibiting the deployment of new low-yield weapons, the Chairman’s Mark weakens our deterrent posture against Russia and China and defers essential safety upgrades,” Thornberry says.

A $2.3 billion shortfall in disaster relief funds for Offutt and Tyndall Air Force bases and Marine Corps bases at Cherry Point Camp Lejeune.

Guantanamo restrictions he argues “will ultimately lead to the transfer of current detainees to the U.S.”

Too many reports. The NDAA imposes 240 new reporting requirements, a 34% increase over last year.

The differences will ultimately have to be hammered out in a conference committee.

Tomorrow, Mac Thornberry will do the Defense Writers Group breakfast at 8 a.m. to present the Republican case for more defense spending and fewer restrictions on the Pentagon.

CAN THIS MARRIAGE BE SAVED? The U.S.-Turkey alliance is being strained to the breaking point over Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s insistence that he should be able to buy both U.S. F-35s and Russian S-400 air defenses.

Friday the U.S. restated its position after learning Turkey had sent personnel to Russia for training on the S-400 system. “The S-400 is incompatible with the F-35,” said Ellen Lord, undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment at Pentagon briefing. “Turkey will not receive the F-35 if Turkey takes delivery of the S-400 system. Thus, we need to begin unwinding Turkey's participation in the F-35 program.”

Lord said Turkey would be disinvited from future program management activities, and she set a deadline of the end of next month for Turkey to capitulate to U.S. demands or be booted from the F-35 program. “If the United States and Turkey cannot reach a mutually agreeable resolution to this issue by July 31, all Turkish F-35 students and instructor pilots currently in the United States will be required to depart the country,” she said. “Turkey will receive no new workshare in the F-35 program. Its current workshare will be transitioned to alternate sources.”

But at the same time, Lord said the U.S. “greatly values,” the “strategic partnership,” with Turkey and is “trying to be respectful,” with the long-time NATO ally. ““None of the steps we are taking are irreversible. If Turkey chooses to forgo delivery of the S-400, we look forward to restoring normal program activity,” she said.

‘A MERGER OF EQUALS’: Raytheon Company and United Technologies Corp announced Sunday they agreed to an all-stock merger that it called “a merger or equals.”

The combined company, which will be named Raytheon Technologies Corporation, will have approximately $74 billion is 2019 sales, which would make it the second-largest defense and aerospace company in the U.S. after Boeing.

“The transaction will create a premier systems provider with advanced technologies to address rapidly growing segments within aerospace and defense,” said a release from the two companies. More on the merger from the Associated Press here.

‘WE’LL DÉMARCHE THEM’: On Friday, acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan called actions of the Russian navy “unsafe and unprofessional,” and said the U.S. would file a formal protest after a Russian destroyer nearly collided with the U.S. guided missile cruiser USS Chancellorsville in international waters in the Philippine Sea.

""We’ll have military-to-military conversations with the Russians, and of course we'll démarche them,” Shanahan said in a brief exchange with reporters at the Pentagon.

The Navy released video Friday of the encounter showing the Russian warship coming within 50 to 100 feet of the American ship, forcing it to reverse its engine to avoid contact with the Russian vessel.

The Navy’s top admiral, John Richardson, chief of naval operations, also released a statement condemning the Russian actions as “irresponsible and reckless.”

""This unwise maneuver, combined with the unsafe maneuvers by the Russian aircraft in the eastern Mediterranean earlier this week, make it clear that these dangerous actions by Russian military forces across the globe do not match what the world expects from a responsible and trustworthy world power,” Richardson said. “The U.S. Navy will not be deterred from supporting the free and open use of the seas and skies where international law clearly allows all to operate.”

55 SYRIAN HOSPITALS BOMBED: The Union of Medical Care and Relief Organization says the Russian-backed air campaign of Syrian leader Bashar Assad against opposition forces in northern Syria has devastated the regions hospital system, causing widespread misery among the civilian population.

“The entire medical system of Northern Hama and Southern Idlib, Syria, is in a state of emergency, with 55 medical facilities shut down after a month of continuous bombing,” said the humanitarian group in a statement. “Since April 28, 25 medical facilities have been bombed, with some hospitals hit by airstrikes on multiple days. “

“In a region of Southern Idlib, only one hospital is left serving a population of over 500,000. The use of phosphorous (incendiary weapons) and barrel bombs in addition to airstrikes has created an apocalyptic landscape for civilians,” the statement continues. “UOSSM staff on the ground in conjunction with local health directorates report 347 civilians have been killed (including at least 75 children), over 1,000 have been injured and 400,000 IDPs displaced by bombardment on civilian areas.”

RECRUITING BY TWITTER: The RAND Corporation is out with a new report that finds while the Army’s @GoArmy’s Twitter feed helps build awareness of Army culture, it’s not so great at convincing young people to join up.

The report, “Social Media and the Army: Implications for Outreach and Recruiting,” analyzes social media and the Army web presence to see if and how potential recruits and others are engaging.

RAND found that GoArmy.com visitors are interested in career information and the site is used more intensively in densely populated areas and in immigrant and ethnic communities.

It called @GoArmy’s Twitter feed “a good source for building awareness of Army culture,” but concluded the platform appears to be less effective at producing recruits.

And it said GoArmy’s Facebook page “has an audience made up of the general public, soldiers, veterans, military families and potential recruits – and has substantial potential for creating a positive image of an Army career for precisely the people who are in a position to influence recruits.”

ARCTIC STRATEGY: The Pentagon has released updated Arctic Strategy in a report sent to Congress last week. The mission statement says the desired end-state for the Arctic is “a secure and stable region in which U.S. national security interests are safeguarded, the U.S. homeland is defended, and nations work cooperatively to address shared challenges.”

The strategy outlines three objectives:



Building Arctic awareness

Enhancing Arctic operations

Strengthening the rules-based order in the Arctic

NO CASUATIES IN NIGER BOMBING: A U.S. military vehicle struck a roadside bomb in Niger while on the way to a training exercise Saturday, but the U.S. Africa Command says all of the soldiers inside survived the attack.

“There are no reported U.S. casualties, however, as a precaution, U.S. service members are being evaluated,” AFRICOM said in a statement.

The U.S. troops were riding in a Mine Resistant Ambush Protected All-Terrain Vehicle when it triggered an improvised explosive device while entering a firing range in the vicinity of Ouallam, Niger.

U.S. forces are in the north-central African country assisting Nigerien troops in their fight against violent extremist groups like Boko Haram.

CADET IDENTIFIED: West Point has identified the cadet killed in last Thursday’s military vehicle accident. ""Cadet Christopher J. Morgan, Class of 2020, died due to injuries sustained from a military vehicle accident in the U.S. Military Academy’s training area,"" the school said in a press release.

Morgan, 22, of West Orange, N.J., was a Law and Legal Studies major and was part of the Army Wrestling Team.

""Cadet Morgan was a valued member of the Corps of Cadets and will be missed by all. The entire community is ensuring that our cadets are being cared for physically, emotionally, and spiritually,” Superintendent Lt. Gen. Darryl Williams said. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the Morgan family.”

But that doesn’t mean Google is headed for a breakup and, at least for now, there are way more questions than answers.

Which parts of Google’s sprawling business will the DOJ look into? Will it delve beyond Google’s search practices, which have been a major sticking point for regulators in Europe? How deep will the DOJ poke into the twisted innards of Google’s ad tech stack? Where does YouTube come into it? Can and will Google make its own proactive moves to try and stave off potential regulatory action?

If it comes to it, is a breakup of Google even the right remedy?

“So much is speculative right now,” said Brian Wieser, global president of business intelligence at GroupM. “It all depends on what issues they decide to focus on – and if they even get to the point where they decide it is an issue.”

But the breakup movement is energized in a way we haven’t seen before, said Fatemeh Khatibloo, a VP and principal analyst at Forrester.

Whether that enthusiasm leads to action depends on how much noise constituents make and to what extent the investigation reveals anticompetitive business practices, she said.

Why now?

It’s the DOJ’s policy to be very secretive about its work – a spokesperson told AdExchanger that “as a matter of policy, the Department of Justice does not confirm, deny or otherwise comment on the existence or nonexistence of investigations.” So, it’s noteworthy that there was a leak at all. The Wall Street Journal first reported news of the probe late last Friday.

This isn’t the first time that Google is in the antitrust crosshairs, but considering all the saber rattling in Washington, DC right now, and the fact that multiple presidential candidates are calling out Big Tech, it’s not surprising that government agencies like the DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission, which is taking responsibility for potential antitrust probes of Facebook and Amazon, are digging in.

“There has been enough public attention on these entities that the DOJ and FTC decided they better get on top of this,” said George Hay, a Cornell law professor and expert on antitrust. “It’s prudent, even if it’s just smoke and no fire right now, because they need to understand the objections to Google’s behavior to see if there’s even a there there.”

Is there a there there?

Being big isn’t a crime. But it’s illegal to monopolize.

“And the test for monopolization is pretty stringent,” Hay said.

Most antitrust enforcement revolves around a concept known as the consumer welfare standard, which basically says that more competition means good outcomes for consumers, said Dina Srinivasan, an antitrust scholar and former WPP digital ad executive.

Price and quality are often used as a proxy for consumer welfare. But most of Google’s services are free, and consumers aren’t harmed in terms of pricing. “The real moat Google has built is identity, [and] from the perspective of today’s mobile-first consumer, Google’s suite of services is great, from search through browsing to maps and YouTube, it seems pretty amazing that we get all that for free,” said Ana Milicevic, principal and co-founder of Sparrow Advisers. “Hence, the average consumer isn’t going to think too much about what is being traded in return.” But while there's an ongoing debate as to whether privacy and data collection/use are antitrust issues, the law does explicitly extend beyond consumer harm to protect against company-on-company anti-competitive action. Google in recent years has had “a suppressing effect on companies in the mar tech/ad tech space,” said Centro CEO Shawn Riegsecker. “Many investors are afraid of Google’s hegemony and are unwilling to invest in companies they see attempting to compete anywhere near the Google ecosystem.” AppNexus founder and former CEO Brian O’Kelley has firsthand experience of what it feels like to get roiled by Google, like when Google closed YouTube to third-party ad tech, he said. “There are a lot of folks they’ve stepped on throughout the years,” said O’Kelley, who just a few weeks ago called for the breakup of Google while testifying before Congress. What if Google is broken up?

Breaking up a company is rare. The normal remedy, said Hay, is for a company to just stop doing whatever problematic thing it’s doing.

Even Margrethe Vestager, the European Union’s competition commissioner – and the driving force behind multiple multibillion-dollar fines against Google – isn’t a cheerleader for the breakup of Big Tech. Splitting up companies is “a measure of last resort,” Vestager said at SXSW in March.

But fast forward through the multiple years it’ll take for the DOJ to complete its investigation. If a Google breakup does happen, what would it look like?

Google has spent the better part of a decade integrating all of its buy-side services, which would make that part of the business quite difficult to break up, said Justin Scarborough, programmatic media director at PMG.

But it could be feasible to separate Google’s buy-side and sell-side products “to create true separation between both parties of the transaction,” he said.

Another, perhaps more impactful option, could split Google Ads from Google’s consumer-facing products, such as Chrome and Android. “Google maintains a big advantage on the advertising front given their ability to control user identity and device information,” Scarborough said. “Seamless integrations with these products are a huge selling point for their ad services over independent players.”

Walled gardens get much of their power from the vast amounts of user data they control, and from their ability to leverage it with abandon, noted Forrester’s Khatibloo.

Carving off YouTube into a separate entity could also be enough by dint of giving buyers more than a single entry point into YouTube inventory.

But the smartest move would be for Google to preemptively divide off some of its units internally before the government even has a chance to do anything, said O’Kelley. “If I were Google, I’d strategically cede a small handful of areas where I’m vulnerable from an antitrust perspective – like operating YouTube at arm’s length, the same for DoubleClick – and try to preempt any full-on investigation,” O’Kelly said. “They’d probably take some short-term pain in their earnings, but it would be worth it in the end.” What about media buyers?

But how would a breakup of Google affect media buyers who daily toil in its myriad ad systems?

If it’s Google’s ad stack on the chopping block, that would be disruptive at first, said Varick CEO Paul Dolan, but ultimately not that big a deal. The stack isn’t as integrated, at least from a UI perspective, as you might think, and most media buyers are already used to logging in to multiple systems to manage search, display campaigns, YouTube through DV 360 and various open exchange partners on top of that.

After the dust settled, media buyers would simply adjust their day-to-day doings and get on with the business of buying media.

But media buyers would also lose something in the event of a breakup.

Because, unpopular opinion, there are actually a lot of good things (with a lot of catches) about the Google ad stack and its hooks into the rest of the Google machine: the ability to tie audience data with consented Google user data, to easily action it using Google’s demand-side platform and to have access to it all in an ad server for reporting.

Despite the whiff of monopoly, the loss of transparency in that process is part of a tradeoff that many buyers willingly make when they use Google products or run on Google-owned properties, Dolan said. They go in with their eyes open.

So rather than going on about hypothetical breakups, regulators should focus on enacting strong consumer data rights and usage protections, Sparrow’s Milicevic said.

“Then,” she said, “consumers can be the ones with a say in how the data they generate is actually used.”"

""As we've been watching the coverage of June 6, 1944 D-Day, I had the thought that my arrival this time felt a little bit, I think, like jumping into Sainte-Mère-Église on the morning of June 5, trying to figure out where you could land without getting shot,"" he said at the FBI Academy on Friday.

Thursday marked the 75th anniversary of D-Day, the day when Allied soldiers stormed the beaches of Normandy in an effort to challenge the Nazi stronghold in Northern Europe.

DEMS UNVEIL CONTEMPT RESOLUTION FOR BARR, MCGAHN OVER SUBPOENA SNUB

President Trump spent that day at Normandy, commemorating the sacrifice of American veterans as he faced impeachment calls and investigations from Democrats in Congress.

“To more than one hundred and seventy veterans of the Second World War who join us today – you are among the very greatest Americans who will ever live,"" he said.

While in Normandy, Trump also spoke with Fox News about the Russia investigation and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who resisted impeachment but also reportedly said she wanted to see Trump in ""prison.""

“She’s incapable of doing deals, she’s a nasty, vindictive, horrible person, the Mueller report came out, it was a disaster for them,"" he said of Pelosi.

ADAM SCHIFF CONTINUES ATTACK ON BARR, SAYS AG IS 'SECOND MOST DANGEROUS MAN' IN US

Pelosi, who also visited Normandy, refused to discuss impeachment during an interview on D-Day but has repeatedly criticized the administration, especially the attorney general.

Barr, who also served as AG under former President George W. Bush, returned to the Justice Department as Pelosi's party continued pressing the Russia issue and his department faced intense questioning surrounding the investigation.

From the start, Barr was suspected of bias due to a memo he wrote which said he thought Trump was well within his powers when he fired former FBI Director James Comey -- one of the main issues in suspicions surrounding whether the president obstructed justice.

Since his arrival, Barr has taken actions that prompted both media figures and congressional Democrats to accuse him of shielding the president from warranted scrutiny. Barr has also come under fire for pursuing the president's directive to de-classify intelligence material in order to uncover information related to the Russia probe's origins.

HOUSE DEMS TO VOTE ON HOLDING BARR, MCGAHN IN CONTEMPT, SEEKING TO KEEP MUELLER SPOTLIGHT ALIVE

That prompted an inquiry from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who blasted the AG as unworthy of that title. Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., who also serves on that committee, said that while he was reluctant to impeach Trump, he was ready to pursue that path with both Barr and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.

Democrats seemed poised to at least hold Barr in contempt as his Department refused to comply with House Democrats request for more information surrounding the investigation.

Citing Barr's refusal, House Democrats proposed giving congressional investigators the power to ""“to initiate or intervene in any judicial proceeding before a Federal Court."" Rules Committee Chairman James McGovern, D-Mass., whose committee would take up the resolution, vowed to hold the administration accountable.

“We will not allow this president and his administration to turn a blind eye to the rule of law,"" he said."

Re “Elizabeth Warren Wants Congress to Ensure Presidents Can Be Indicted” (nytimes.com, May 31 ):

Contrary to Senator Warren’s view, the mere fact that the current occupant of the White House has engaged in deplorable, and perhaps criminal, conduct provides no basis for revoking the Justice Department’s longstanding rule that a sitting president cannot be indicted.

Senator Warren’s desire to use the criminal justice system against a president the Democrats find objectionable is shortsighted: Given our polarized times, if she were to succeed, it would surely not be long before we would see efforts to use the same tool against a Democratic president.

Moreover, the Justice Department policy, which has remained in force through Democratic and Republican administrations alike, is firmly rooted in the constitutional provision establishing impeachment as the course for dealing with presidential misconduct.

Lastly, as a practical matter, it is likely that the Supreme Court rues the day that it naïvely ruled, in Clinton v. Jones, that a sitting president can simultaneously handle his or her constitutional duties and defend against civil litigation. We saw how the Paula Jones litigation consumed President Bill Clinton’s second term, and having to defend against criminal charges would surely hamstring President Trump to a far greater degree."

"Did Trump Administration ‘Purge’ 200,000 VA Health Care Applications?",https://www.snopes.com,['Bethania Palma'],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.snopes.com/news/2019/06/07/trump-admin-va-applications/,"Five years have passed since Scott Davis testified before Congress about mismanagement at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), a condition that resulted in almost a million backlogged applications and a sometimes deadly state of limbo for veterans waiting to get health care. On 13 May 2019, Davis penned a widely read opinion piece for the Washington Examiner in which he stated that despite a whirlwind of media attention in years past, the problem had hardly been resolved.

Despite President Donald Trump’s blasting the administration of his predecessor for the problem, Davis wrote, “The Trump administration has decided to execute a plan to purge 200,000 applications for VA healthcare caused by known administrative errors within VA’s enrollment process and enrollment system — problems that had already been documented by the Office of the Inspector General in 2015 and 2017.”

“I tried in a very non-partisan way to say, two years after you made a big deal about this, this is happening on your watch,” Davis told us by phone. Davis is a former public affairs officer for VA Member Services, which deals with enrollment. Although he currently works in a different department, Davis is still employed by the VA.

The VA has taken issue with Davis’ use of the word “purge” in reference to applications, with spokeswoman Susan Carter telling us by email that it’s a “loaded term” and calling Davis’ opinion piece “misleading.” However, the VA confirmed that 208,272 veterans’ applications for health care had been moved from “pending” status to “closed” status between January and February (she did not specify the year). Once an application has been closed, the veteran must reapply for health care benefits.

Davis maintained taking issue with his terminology was just wordplay, and that no functional difference existed between “closing” and “purging” an application from the veteran’s perspective. “Offering the person the opportunity to reapply is not offering them anything,” Davis told us. “Intake is a very basic function of any government organization. If you can’t do that, that’s a problem. And that’s a problem that people in my opinion, from the president on down, should be concerned with, because this is the nation’s largest health care system.”

If a veteran applies to receive VA benefits but the application is incomplete, the person has a year to submit necessary additional information. During that time, the application is placed in “pending” status. After a year, in accordance with federal law, the application is placed in “closed” status by the VA, and the veteran is notified by letter how to reapply. The VA states it notified all veterans with incomplete applications via letter “that they are in pending status and that they have 365 days to complete their applications.”

Between January and May 2019, a total of 21,881 applications have been moved to “pending” status, according to Carter’s email. Davis sent us a copy of the VA’s Fiscal Year 2019 briefing book showing more than 317,000 applications currently in “pending” status. That same book shows over 270,000 applications in “closed” status.

Davis told us that known issues exist with the VA’s notification process dating back to a 2014 scandal that prompted Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki to resign. As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump had been critical of the scandal. The VA Office of Inspector General determined in 2015 that “extensive, persistent problems with veterans’ health care enrollment records maintained by the [Health Eligibility Center or HEC]” existed.

Whistleblower Allegations

The 2015 report confirmed whistleblower allegations that the VA had 867,000 “pending” applications, and that of that backlog more than 307,000 were records associated with deceased veterans. But auditors were unable to determine how many of those were people who died while awaiting health care because of sloppy record-keeping by the VA. (The issue was widely misreported, and Trump asserted that all 307,000 cases were veterans who died awaiting care while their applications were pending.)

In 2017, auditors reported that the VA lacked an adequate, uniform system for enrolling veterans at the point of contact, VA health-care facilities. We asked the VA whether a national enrollment policy was enacted in response to that report, and spokeswoman Susan Carter told us a policy was “still under development.”

Carter also said that the VA makes thousands of attempts to reach veterans in “pending” status. The VA “regularly reaches out to Veterans both by mail and by phone. In this fiscal year alone, VA has made over 200,000 call attempts to Veterans with pending applications, and over 300,000 attempts to newly enrolled Veterans. On average over 27,000 calls are placed each month to Veterans with a pending [Veterans Health Administration] application to assist them with completing anything that is missing in order to reach an enrollment determination. VA makes six attempts with each Veteran over the course of one year.”

We asked how many of those attempts yielded verifiable contacts with veterans but have not yet received an answer to that question.

Letters by Mail

Davis questioned whether veterans ever received the letters or calls. He provided us an internal memo dated 30 November 2016 in which Health Eligibility Center (HEC) officials cautioned that tens of thousands of addresses had been flagged as potentially bad, while acknowledging that “although a letter was never returned by the postal service, we cannot say that the Veteran received it.”

“How many times do we all miss one letter in the mail? In 2019, that’s how they’re communicating? It’s ridiculous,” Davis said. “To say, ‘We sent a letter to people’ in 2019 — I know people in government don’t know how the internet works, but people under 60 aren’t running to the mailbox every day.”

The quality of VA health care for veterans, and the agency’s mismanagement of processes that help them get it, have for years been a focal point of public concern, but the controversy rose to the surface again in April 2019 amid news reports that four veterans had committed suicide at VA facilities in the span of one month. On that issue, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote:

Veteran suicide is an acute crisis wrapped in a national crisis. Between 2005 and 2016, suicide rates in the general population climbed 21%. For veterans, already taking their lives at twice the U.S. rate, it climbed 26%. More than 6,000 veterans are dying by their own hands each year – nearly 20 a day. The latest deaths renew questions about whether the VA, criticized and investigated for failing to provide timely or sufficient help to veterans, is doing enough to solve the problem. That is despite making suicide prevention a high priority in recent years.

We asked the VA how many veterans committed suicide while their applications were in “pending” status between January 2012 and May 2019 but received no response to that question."

STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL CITED STEELE IN EMAILS WITH OHR AFTER FLAGGING CREDIBILITY ISSUES TO FBI, DOCS REVEAL

A Justice Department spokesman on Friday did not immediately return an inquiry from Fox News about the bonuses.

The conservative group Judicial Watch, known for suing for public records, released the documents related to Ohr’s salary Friday, saying they obtained them from the Justice Department through a Freedom of Information Act request.

Ohr’s actions during that time have been of interest to investigators, as it’s believed Ohr was the back channel between Trump dossier author Christopher Steele and the FBI. It was also revealed that his wife, Nellie Ohr, conducted opposition research on Trump for the firm Fusion GPS – the same company that commissioned the dossier – raising conflict of interest questions.

Judicial Watch is questioning why Ohr, who was later demoted at DOJ, was given a bonus.

“These documents will raise questions as to whether the conflicted Bruce Ohr, who the FBI used to launder information from Christopher Steele was rewarded for his role in the illicit targeting of President Trump,” Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said in a statement.

Even though Ohr was removed from his position as Associate Deputy Attorney General in 2017, he later received a $2,600 pay increase in 2018, the records indicate, showing Ohr earned $189,000 that year.

The U.S. Agriculture Department has good news it seemingly wants nobody to know about.

On April 23, the USDA released its “School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study,” with no news release, no fanfare. The link on the USDA website disappeared for several days after that and was altogether inaccessible before reappearing under a different URL.

The USDA says the study was “the first nationally representative, comprehensive assessment” of school meals after the implementation of the 2010 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, a key initiative of the Obama administration that mandated healthy changes in food at schools.

The best news was that the Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2010), a multicomponent measure of diet quality, shot up dramatically for both school-provided breakfasts and lunches.

For the 2009-2010 school year, the score for breakfast was an abysmal 49.6 out of 100 (even lower than the overall American average of 59), rising to 71.3 by the 2014-2015 school year. In that same time frame, the lunch score went from 57.9 to 81.5. The score for whole grains in school meals went from 25 to 95 percent of the maximum score, and the score for greens and beans rose from 21 to 72 percent.

In addition, there was greater participation in school meal programs at schools with the highest healthy food standards. And the study found food waste, a troubling national problem in the lunchroom, remained relatively unchanged.

[Why banning ‘meal shaming’ isn’t enough]

The 52-page summary of study findings is chockablock with other good news, so why isn’t Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue crowing about it?

The USDA did not respond directly when asked about the rollout beyond a statement that said it conducts studies like this to inform choices on policies and program operations, and that “we intend to use it to make these great programs even better.”

“It seems fairly outside of the norm for a federal agency to release a study that directly contradicts what the administration’s position is,” explained Elizabeth Balkan, food waste director of the Natural Resources Defense Council. “That’s why it was released very quietly.”

In December, Perdue announced the USDA was weakening school nutrition standards for whole grain, nonfat milk and sodium, all of which had been tightened during the Obama administration. He cited food waste and nonparticipation as key rationales for the shift.

“If kids are not eating what is being served, they are not benefiting, and food is being wasted,” he said at the time.

About two-thirds of the 30 million children who eat school meals every day qualify as low-income and are getting meals free or for a reduced price. Low-income kids are disproportionately affected by obesity and are less likely to be fed healthy meals at home, so the nutritional makeup of those school meals is impactful. Kids can get more than half of their daily calories from school meals.

[Spray cheese, beef jerky and stuffed olives to be counted as staples under Trump administration food stamp proposal]

“As a nutrition and public-health policymaker, what’s extraordinary is for a policy to have that large an effect, to affect tens of millions of school kids. If you consider the crisis that we face — people living shorter, less healthy lives — solutions usually take decades,” said Jerry Mande, a senior USDA official during the Obama administration who was involved in developing the standards. “Within two years there’s a dramatic change. This demonstrates the power the USDA has to change the way kids eat. We should be doubling down on this.”

Advocates say the push to roll back stricter requirements is consistent with President Trump’s overall mission of deregulation.

“Waste was the smokescreen,” said Margo Wootan, vice president for nutrition at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. “There have been several studies that showed that food waste hadn’t increased.”

[Big Money Joins Fight Against $1 Trillion in Wasted Food]

Wootan enumerates many things that can be done — beyond making food saltier, fattier or more processed — to reduce food waste in schools. Have recess before lunch to work up hunger and don’t schedule lunch times midmorning before kids are peckish. Cut up apples instead of offering them whole. Offer taste tests and share tables and give students opportunities to provide more input. Perhaps most importantly, adopt an “offer versus serve” approach at elementary schools and middle schools (it is required at high schools). This means that students can select three out of five meal components and avoid things they don’t like and are likely to discard.

“The Trump administration wants to tick off the maximum number of regulations it can say it rolled back,” Wootan said. “It’s another tick mark on the deregulatory agenda.”

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 13.7 million, or 18.5 percent, of children aged 2 to 19 are obese. That percentage is higher for Hispanics (25.8 percent) and non-Hispanic blacks (22 percent).

The American Medical Association changed the term obesity from a condition into a disease in 2013. The CDC says obesity puts people at an increased risk for all causes of death, but it is linked to high blood pressure and cholesterol, Type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke and some cancers.

The School Nutrition Association, the trade group for school food-service manufacturers and school food professionals, has commended Perdue for seeking regulatory flexibility.

Diane Pratt-Heavner, spokeswoman for the association, says that although the study findings are very positive, the new standards have presented challenges for school districts.

“We’re seeing a lot of schools struggle with cultural preferences with students. Like white rice — some cultures don’t eat brown rice. And in the Southwest, there are students who are not familiar with a whole-grain tortilla.”

She also says that participation in school lunch programs has dropped, from 32 million to 30 million, under the new standards, and that as a result, costs per student have increased.

Schools are forced to rely more heavily on a la carte items (a sandwich, rather than the full meal with fruits, veggies and milk) to stay solvent.

Schools have also looked to restaurant practices, offering more customizable meals such as burritos made to order, to boost participation, and catering programs on the side to bolster revenue. Bottom line, she says: The cost of preparing the new style of meals frequently exceeds the cost of reimbursement.

However, that runs counter to the study’s finding that healthier meals did not impose a greater financial burden.

“There was no significant association between reported cost per NSLP (National School Lunch Program) lunch and the nutritional quality of the meals,” the study said. “That is, mean reported costs per NSLP lunch were not significantly higher in schools that prepared more-nutritious meals . . . than in schools that produced the least-nutritious meals.”"
"VA may owe veterans millions in refunds but knowingly hasn't paid them for years, probe finds",https://www.usatoday.com,"['Donovan Slack', 'Published P.M. Et June']",06-06-2019,2019,6,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/06/06/va-may-owe-disabled-veterans-millions-refunds-home-loan-fees/1367679001/,"CLOSE

WASHINGTON – More than 50,000 disabled veterans could be owed as much as $190 million in refunds from the Department of Veterans Affairs for home loan fees they were wrongly charged or no longer owe, an investigation has found.

Senior leaders knew about the problem for years but didn’t ensure veterans received what they are due, the investigation by the VA inspector general found.

Veterans pay the fees when they buy homes with the help of VA's Home Loan Guaranty Program, but they are supposed to be exempt if they are disabled. Fees can total up to 3.3% of a home's value.

In cases where veterans improperly paid the fees or the VA later determined they were disabled, the agency is supposed to issue refunds.

But the VA didn’t do that in thousands of cases dating back more than a decade because the veterans didn't ask for the refunds.

VA loan managers, who knew about outstanding debts to veterans since at least 2014, told investigators that they had been focused on other priorities, including processing high volumes of applications.

Investigators from the inspector general’s office said in their report released Thursday that they found it “troubling” that the managers were “aware that thousands of veterans were potentially owed more than $150 million yet did not take adequate actions to ensure refunds were issued.”

“It is the review team’s opinion that requiring a veteran to submit a claim for a refund improperly places the burden and responsibility solely upon the veteran,” investigators said.

'Internal quality improvement'

The VA issued a press release last month – as the inspector general was preparing to release the investigation results – announcing that the agency is now notifying veterans when they buy homes under the program that they are exempt from the fees if they are disabled or later determined to be disabled.

“Through an internal quality improvement effort, VA has put a plan in place to better inform veterans through key communications when the law allows VA to waive the fee for a veteran,” VA Secretary Robert Wilkie said in the release.

The release did not say what is being done to ensure veterans due refunds from loans in prior years are paid. The inspector general found the amounts owed in its review ranged from $5,000 to $20,000.

The VA said veterans who believe they are owed a refund should consult the agency’s website for more information about VA home loan funding fees.

Between 2012 and 2017, the VA collected roughly $10 billion in fees from veterans under the loan program.

The inspector general estimated disabled veterans who were wrongly charged accounted for $286 million of those fees. But the VA only refunded about $100 million, leaving an estimated $190 million that may still be due to 53,200 veterans.

The Loan Guaranty program was established in 1944 to help veterans finance home purchases. Loans are provided by private lenders, but the VA guarantees a portion of the loans for eligible buyers. The lenders collect the fees and transmit them to the VA.

If a veteran wrongly paid the fees, the VA can refund the money directly to the veteran. If the fees were included as part of a loan, the VA pays the lender, which applies it to the loan balance.

'Other priorities'

In 2014, regional VA loan officials in St. Paul, Minnesota, notified senior VA managers that an analysis found nearly $150 million may be due in refunds to disabled veterans for fees on 48,000 loans issued between 2006 and 2014.

“As of January 2019, the review team received no indication that a large-scale effort had been initiated to issue refunds to these veterans,” the inspector general said.

The director of the Loan Guaranty program since 2017, Jeffrey London, told investigators he “considered contracting out the task of issuing refunds, but never requested the award of a contract because other priorities…took precedence,” the investigators wrote.

The inspector general recommended the agency identify and pay all the veterans owed refunds. In addition, the VA should implement procedures to minimize the number of veterans who are wrongly charged fees and conduct periodic reviews to ensure those who are receive prompt refunds.

The VA told investigators some of the fees were incorrectly assessed by lenders, not the VA. But agency officials said in their response to the report that they “generally agreed” with the investigation’s findings and are consulting lawyers about complexities related to issuing refunds.

The agency “has drafted a plan with contingencies ready for implementation depending on the (legal) opinion,” the VA response said. The agency did not elaborate on what the plan is or when refunds will be issued.

DOJ to hand over important Mueller evidence to Congress,https://www.thedenverchannel.com,[],06-10-2019,2019,6,https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/national/doj-to-hand-over-important-mueller-evidence-to-house-committee,"House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler on Monday said he has struck a deal with the Justice Department to begin providing Congress with some documents from the Mueller Report related to obstruction of justice.

Nadler announced the agreement ahead of a vote scheduled for Tuesday, when the House is expected to approve a resolution to go to court to enforce its subpoenas of Attorney General William Barr and former White House counsel Don McGahn .

But a court fight appears to be no longer necessary for the Barr subpoena -- at least for the time being -- as a result of the agreement the committee struck with the Justice Department. The details of which documents would be provided to the committee were not disclosed, but Nadler said the agreement would allow all Judiciary Committee members to see ""Robert Mueller's most important files ... providing us with key evidence that the Special Counsel used to assess whether the President and others obstructed justice or were engaged in other misconduct.""

""These documents will allow us to perform our constitutional duties and decide how to respond to the allegations laid out against the President by the Special Counsel,"" Nadler said.

The agreement is the first sign of a thaw between the House Judiciary Committee and the Justice Department, which have been battling over the special counsel's report since Robert Mueller ended his investigation in March .

The House Judiciary Committee had issued a subpoena for Mueller's unredacted report and all of the special counsel's evidence, and then voted to hold Barr in contempt last month . The committee also fought with Barr over the format of his hearing, prompting the attorney general to skip his appearance .

In a letter last month, Nadler said he was willing negotiate over the scope of the subpoena and accept a smaller subset of documents out of Mueller's evidence, including FBI summaries of key interviews with witnesses. The Justice Department responded it would also be willing to negotiate so long as the House called off its contempt vote against Barr.

Nadler said in the statement that he would ""hold the criminal contempt process in abeyance for now"" as a result of the agreement. But House Democrats were not voting on Tuesday on a criminal contempt citation against Barr -- they have drafted a resolution to go to court under the so-called civil contempt process to enforce their subpoenas of Barr and McGahn.

Nadler said that vote would still happen on Tuesday, pointing to the fact that the resolution also included language authorizing court action against McGahn.

He said as long as the Justice Department ""proceeds in good faith"" there would be no further steps taken against Barr, but added: ""If important information is held back, then we will have no choice but to enforce our subpoena in court and consider other remedies."""

FUKUOKA, Japan (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Saturday that the U.S.-Mexico immigration deal met President Donald Trump’s objectives of fixing immigration problems on the southern U.S. border, but Trump will retain the authority to impose tariffs if Mexico fails to live up to it.

The deal averts a 5% tariff on all Mexican goods that was due to start on Monday, with Mexico agreeing to rapidly expand a controversial asylum program and deploy security forces to stem the flow of illegal Central American migrants.

“We now have an agreement that we believe is going to fix the immigration issue. And that was extremely important to the president,” Mnuchin told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of a G20 finance meeting in Fukuoka, Japan.

Mnuchin, who said he participated in a call with Trump just before the deal was announced, said the president would retain the right to impose tariffs if Mexico did not keep its commitments.

“Our expectation is that Mexico will do what they’ve committed to do and our expectation is that we won’t need to put tariffs in place, but obviously if that’s not the case, the president retains that authority.”"
"At Trump’s Agriculture Department, science is being plowed under",https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Gale A. Buchanan', 'Catherine E. Woteki']",06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/06/07/trumps-agriculture-department-science-is-being-plowed-under/,"

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. (Al Drago/Bloomberg)

Gale A. Buchanan and Catherine E. Woteki are former chief scientists of the Agriculture Department, where they served (2006-2009 and 2010-2017, respectively) as undersecretary for research, education and economics.

For the second year in a row, Trump administration leadership at the Agriculture Department proposed budget cuts and took other steps that hamper agencies within the department that supply the data and science needed to inform farm and food policy.

Whether the actions at the USDA reflect malice or ignorance, the results are the same: Policymakers in Congress and America’s farmers will lack the sound science they need to make decisions about how best to feed the nation, improve the rural economy and bolster U.S. agricultural exports.

As the USDA’s chief scientists from the previous two administrations, we are deeply concerned about the harm being done to scientific integrity at the department. We won’t speculate on the motives of the Trump administration’s leaders at the USDA, but we can say that these proposals came only after objective studies and analyses produced by economists and scientists at the USDA’s Economic Research Service, or ERS, conflicted with Trump administration policies.

For example, analysis by ERS economists on the effects of the December 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act stated, “Farm households with income between the 20th to 80th percentile see a modest reduction in their effective income tax rates, while wealthier households, the top 10 percent and top 1 percent, see the biggest decreases in their rates.”

The attempt to defund the ERS also offers some clues about what type of research the Trump administration seems to dislike. The budget suggested cuts to research into food assistance and nutrition, food safety, and analysis of farm, conservation and trade policy.

Numbers don’t lie, but you can attempt to hide them from Congress and the public, undermine them just enough to cast doubt or make them disappear altogether.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue appears to be taking a multipronged approach toward dismantling the science that for years has undergirded policy decisions.

First, Perdue tried the direct approach: simply cutting the ERS budget. That approach failed last year when Congress restored the funds. The administration is trying again with its 2020 budget, proposing to cut $42 million — about 50 percent — from the ERS programs and reduce the number of full-time employees to 160 from 331.

Next, the Perdue-led USDA pushed a policy that required all published research from the department to be labeled “preliminary.” When scientists and economists publish in scientific journals, it is only after rigorous peer review. The “preliminary” label appears designed to undermine the research and strike a blow against evidence-based policymaking.

Finally, late last summer, Perdue shocked many researchers in food and agriculture with his decision to move the ERS and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture out of the Washington area. The USDA sidestepped the usual processes for relocation, such as conducting a search through the government’s General Services Administration, and selected potential homes in North Carolina, Indiana and Kansas City, Mo..

Employees learned earlier this year that after the USDA chooses the relocation site, they would have 120 days to move or quit. Many of the economists that would be affected instead found new jobs at other agencies in the District — creating the sort of brain drain that the administration has seemed intent on prompting with its proposed budget cuts.

Perdue also proposed moving oversight of the ERS to the chief economist in his office. We strongly oppose this move because it makes the unit vulnerable to political pressure.

The agency now reports to the chief scientist — a post that remains unfilled after President Trump’s nominee, Sam Clovis, a conservative radio talk show host and former Iowa campaign aide with no background in science, withdrew from consideration in November 2017. Congress should demand that the Trump administration nominate, as soon as possible, a new, independent chief scientist who can obtain swift and broad, bipartisan support.

Food and agriculture in the United States face perennial challenges from a multitude of sources: pests, diseases, droughts, flooding, brutally competitive markets and trade disputes. It is disheartening to think that the science underpinning these vital contributors to the U.S. economy, and to the health and well-being of every American, is under threat from the very government department overseeing them.

Someday the U.S. Will Have to Actually Deal With Its Nuclear Waste Problem,https://slate.com,['Jane C. Hu'],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://slate.com/technology/2019/06/department-of-energy-nuclear-waste-reclassification-yucca.html,"Photo illustration by Slate. Photo by Jeff J. Mitchell—WPA Pool/Getty Images.

Of all the things in the world to worry about, nuclear waste management is not at the top of most people’s lists. We trust (or hope, at least) that expert scientists and policymakers will make good decisions about how to make sure radioactive byproducts stay far, far away from us, by whatever means possible. But, many of those experts say, we’re going to need to figure out a new way to manage our country’s nuclear waste—and soon.

To that end, the Department of Energy announced Wednesday that they are reclassifying the definition of “high-level,” or highly radioactive, waste stored in underground tanks at Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington state, the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina, and the Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho Falls. The DOE hopes that the redefinition will expedite cleanup of the waste. Currently, the high-level waste stored at these sites is waiting for the government to open a secure waste repository (like Yucca Mountain in Nevada, which has been in limbo for decades). But if some of the less radioactive waste qualifies under the new definition, it might instead be shipped off to other sites, like one in Texas, where it could be mixed with “concrete-like grout.” The cleanup at Hanford has already cost the country billions of dollars and is projected to cost billions more as we continue the search for the waste’s final home. (Adding some urgency to developing a new plan is the risk that containers could leak and contaminate the environment, especially if there’s an earthquake in Washington.)

The DOE’s new plan could be cost-effective, sure, but the question is whether it’s safe. When the agency first announced reclassification plans in October 2018 and solicited public comment, the proposal received thousands of responses. And Washington state officials are not happy; Gov. Jay Inslee and Department of Ecology Director Maia Bellon have both sent letters of concern to the DOE. “I am gravely concerned with DOE forging ahead with a new interpretation of HLW that does not comport with federal law, despite objections from Washington state,” wrote Bellon.

Some countries tried storing barrels of waste in ice sheets, which turns out to be less than ideal given that ice both moves and melts.

In addition to the waste we already have sitting around at Hanford and other old nuclear weapons facilities (charmingly called “legacy waste”), nearly 100 commercial nuclear reactors at 60 facilities around the U.S. are creating new waste every day. The type of waste produced by those two types of facility contains different radioactive materials with varying half-lives, but the same storage issues remain: What will we eventually do with all this radioactive stuff?

The lack of solution is not from lack of discussion. There have been all sorts of wacky ideas floated about where to store nuclear waste. Some have proposed we shoot it all into space, maybe have it orbit Venus. But given how spacecraft are prone to explosions, which would effectively mean showering the world with bits of radioactive waste, that idea stalled. In the ’90s, the idea of burying waste in deep ocean seabeds seemed promising, but it never really got off the ground. And some countries tried storing barrels of waste in ice sheets, which turns out to be less than ideal given that ice both moves and melts. As the earth thaws out, old waste becomes uncovered.

Here in the U.S., we’re running out of space, and experts are concerned about the lack of long-term solutions. “Instead of a planned, coherent system, we have the confusion of an unplanned, less than optimal system,” nuclear experts wrote in a 2018 report on nuclear waste management strategy and policy, calling the U.S. program “an ever-tightening Gordian Knot” subject to technical, scientific, logistical, regulatory, legal, financial, social, and political challenges. “This is not a situation that builds public confidence.”

Currently, we’re at a standstill. In 1987, the government designated Yucca Mountain in southern Nevada as the storage facility for waste, but more than three decades later, proper approvals are still pending. Buckets of radioactive waste are still sitting around at the various facilities around the U.S., waiting for a place to go. While critics from environmental advocacy organizations like Columbia Riverkeeper and National Resource Defense Council have condemned the DOE’s reclassification, calling it “irresponsible,” “outrageous,” and an “attempt to cut corners,” local government welcomed the new policy. Richland, Washington, Mayor Bob Thompson told the Tri-City Herald that the decision was a “fantastic opportunity” to speed up Hanford’s cleanup.

We could avoid adding to the problem by trying to reduce the amount of waste generated. One way to do that is to recycle. By separating out uranium and plutonium from used nuclear fuel, engineers can reuse those in reactors to generate additional energy and throw out the rest. “Ninety-five percent of original energy is in the unused fuel,” says Kathryn Huff, an assistant professor of nuclear engineering at the University of Illinois, who likens the process to recycling a soda can: You wash out the sugar and dirt to reuse the aluminum. By reusing fuel, nuclear plants could cut down on the amount of space they need for waste containment by an order or two of magnitude.

On that front, countries like France, the U.K., and Japan are way ahead of us. France, in particular, leads the game; it generates about 80 percent of its energy through nuclear plants, but thanks to its recycling site, called La Hague, the waste currently fits “in a room not significantly bigger than a basketball court,” says Huff. Of course, the U.S. is a far bigger country than France, we’ve run our reactors for longer, and we have a lot more waste already sitting around, so we’ll never shrink our waste pile to that size. But La Hague is a testament to how the amount of true waste can be reduced through reprocessing.

Adopting recycling is subject to many of the same logistical and regulatory pitfalls as building a repository. For one, recycling is more expensive, and without regulatory pressure to change existing systems, commercial nuclear energy plants may not want to pony up the cash. (Opponents of reprocessing, like the Union of Concerned Scientists, also point to high costs of reprocessing, estimating it could cost tens or even hundreds of billions to implement.) Beyond the costs of just reprocessing waste, we’d also have to build critical infrastructure, like recycling facilities and retrofitting of existing reactors to accept recycled fuel. France’s energy system is government-run, and its government has decided to invest the money to have less waste sitting around in the long term.

To make progress on recycling, or building a repository, or even having a coherent plan for the roughly 80,000 metric tons of waste in our country, experts say any decisions about nuclear management need to be removed from the political cycle. “The instability in the dynamics of American politics makes it a challenge to develop a sustainable program,” says Huff. The Blue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future, a group of experts assembled by the Obama administration in 2012, brought up similar concerns in its recommendations and suggested that the government establish an entirely new government entity to oversee nuclear waste policy. “The overall record of DOE and of the federal government as a whole, however, has not inspired widespread confidence or trust in our nation’s nuclear waste management program,” the commission wrote in the final report. “The Commission concludes that a new, single-purpose organization is needed … to get the waste program back on track.” Members recommended also that this organization would solicit active consent from affected communities and implement policies that would provide continuity from administration to administration.

But until then, it seems inevitable that the rules will keep shifting, and we’ll keep passing the buck on the problem of waste management. What’s now “high-level” waste seems destined to be reclassified, but it’s also possible that the next administration could change the definition right back. Unless the government moves toward a longer-term solution, we’ll likely be stuck in limbo until something catastrophic happens, the waste’s radioactivity decreases over thousands of years, or the world ends—whichever comes first.

U.S. and Mexico Issue Joint Declaration on Migration and Tariffs,https://www.nytimes.com,['Liam Stack'],06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/07/us/state-department-mexico-trump.html,"President Trump pulled back from his plan to impose tariffs on all Mexican imports, saying on Friday night on Twitter that the United States and Mexico had reached an agreement to reduce the number of migrants entering the United States over the southwestern border.

The tariffs, which could have been potentially crippling for Mexico, were to go into effect on Monday. Mr. Trump’s announcement came after several days of intense negotiations between the two countries in Washington.

“The Tariffs scheduled to be implemented by the U.S. on Monday, against Mexico, are hereby indefinitely suspended,” Mr. Trump wrote just before 8:30 p.m. “Mexico, in turn, has agreed to take strong measures to stem the tide of Migration through Mexico, and to our Southern Border.”

Here is a joint statement by the United States and Mexico released by the State Department on Friday night:

“The United States and Mexico met this week to address the shared challenges of irregular migration, to include the entry of migrants into the United States in violation of U.S. law. Given the dramatic increase in migrants moving from Central America through Mexico to the United States, both countries recognize the vital importance of rapidly resolving the humanitarian emergency and security situation. The Governments of the United States and Mexico will work together to immediately implement a durable solution."
"DHS watchdog finds spoiled food, nooses at multiple immigration detention centers",https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/dhs-oig-watchdog-spoiled-food-nooses-immigration-detention-centers-b5796c0ff257/,"The Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) released a report Thursday detailing the horrific conditions at immigration detention centers across the United States. Inspectors found “immediate risks or egregious violations of detention standards” including nooses in detainee cells, overuse of solitary confinement, and spoiled food, among other issues.

DHS OIG inspected four Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities, including the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in California, the Aurora ICE Processing Center in Colorado, the LaSalle ICE Processing Center in Louisiana, and the Essex County Correctional Facility in New Jersey.

According to the report, the “inspections of the four detention facilities revealed violations of ICE’s detention standards and raised concerns about the environment in which detainees are held.”

OIG described the food service issues at Adelanto and Essex as “egregious.” At Adelanto, “lunch meat and cheese were mixed and stored uncovered in

large walk-in refrigerators,” while chicken “smelled foul and appeared to be spoiled.” Food in the freezer was also expired. At Essex, “open packages of raw chicken leaked blood all over refrigeration units” and “lunch meat was slimy, foulsmelling and appeared to be spoiled.”

All of the facilities demonstrated “serious issues with the administrative and disciplinary segregation of detainees” that violate ICE detention standards and infringe on detainee rights, the report read.

The findings confirm what most immigration activist groups and some progressive members of Congress have been clamoring about for months: ICE is routinely violating the human rights of the individuals in its custody.

“The report’s findings reveal that issues in ICE detention are not isolated — they are systemic,” Freedom for Immigrants, a non-profit that has been monitoring the conditions at Adelanto and other ICE facilities for years, said in a statement. “And yet, not one single entity in this detention apparatus is ever held accountable for these human rights violations. This is outrageous. More and more evidence points to the fact that ICE and private prison companies like GEO are incapable of providing for the well-being of immigrants. That’s why we must abolish detention. It’s time to implement humane community-based alternatives that treat people with dignity and respect.”

While ICE standards require facilities to place detainees in disciplinary segregation only after they have committed a prohibited act, Adelanto, Essex, and Aurora punished immigrant detainees with solitary confinement for unproven disciplinary violations. Detainees in solitary were found to have limited access to recreation and even showers despite ICE standards mandating that individuals have access to these basic resources.

At the facility’s bathrooms, OIG observed mold throughout all the

walls in the bathroom area, including ceilings, vents, mirrors, and shower

stalls. Prolonged exposure to mold and mildew can lead to allergic reactions and long-term health issues.

Immigrants in detention are required to receive toiletries including including shampoo, toothbrushes, toothpaste, lotion, and soap. At Essex, however, detainees reported not having received any toiletries. Staff at the facility told inspectors that toiletries must be purchased through the commissary, which is against ICE standards.

(Credit: DHS OIG)

At Aurora, visitation rooms go unused. DHS OIG found that while the facility is capable of hosting in-person visitation, it only allows “non-contact visits” — even to children and family.

ICE standards mandate “that detainees shall be able to maintain morale and ties through visitation with their families, the community, legal representatives and consular officials, within the constraints of the safety, security and good order of the facility.”

Three of the four detention centers that were inspected are operated by GEO Group, a private prison company that contracts with the federal government.

GEO Group, among other similar companies like CoreCivic, has greatly benefited from the Trump administration’s increase in immigration enforcement. ICE is detaining more people than ever before, a record-breaking 52,000, and GEO Group is making money off of it. Just this week the private prison company announced a 314 bed expansion at the Montgomery Processing Center in Conroe, Texas. The expansion would bring the total bed count to 1,314. The company is expected to rake in $10 million as a result."

Scott Applewhite/AP Photo legal DOJ, Commerce reject Dem subpoenas for census docs

The Justice and Commerce departments on Thursday rejected House Democratic demands for more documents about the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census, likely leading to contempt citations for Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.

In a letter to Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd said the documents the panel subpoenaed are protected by attorney-client privilege and therefore cannot be disclosed.

Story Continued Below

“[T]he committee’s insistence that the department immediately turn over these documents ... is improper,” Boyd wrote, adding that the Justice Department has already turned over tens of thousands of documents and made officials available for interviews.

A Commerce Department spokesperson accused the committee of trying to interfere with ongoing litigation that centers on the constitutionality of the citizenship question appearing on the census.

“In its zeal to influence the Supreme Court’s decision, the committee is poised to hold Secretary Ross in contempt,” the spokesperson said. “Holding the secretary in contempt is an empty stunt, and it shows that the committee is simply interested in playing politics.”

The Democrat-led committee gave the Justice Department and the Commerce Department until 5 p.m. on Thursday to comply with its subpoenas, threatening to initiate contempt proceedings absent compliance.

Cummings said his committee gave Barr and Ross every opportunity to provide the documents but they didn’t cooperate and made no counteroffers.

“They seem determined to continue the Trump Administration’s cover-up,” he said in a statement.

The committee has been investigating the decision to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census, with lawmakers accusing the Trump administration — Ross in particular — of lying about its origins.

New evidence emerged last week that the administration allegedly “concealed” the role of now-deceased Republican gerrymandering expert Thomas Hofeller, who believed that adding a citizenship question to the census would boost Republicans in future elections.

The Trump administration has said it is simply trying to enforce the Voting Rights Act, but Democrats have argued that such a question would create an undercount of ethnic and racial minorities, resulting in newly drawn congressional districts that would diminish their influence in American elections.

Cummings said this week that the Trump administration was seeking “to gerrymander congressional districts in overtly racist, partisan and unconstitutional ways,” and he accused the Trump administration of a “coverup.” Republicans on the committee have said that holding Barr and Ross in contempt is an effort to improperly interfere with ongoing court proceedings about the census question.

The subpoenas, which were first authorized in April, required the Justice and Commerce departments to turn over all communications with the White House, the Republican National Committee, and President Donald Trump’s campaign, among other entities. The subpoenas also sought memos and witness testimony.

One of those witnesses, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Gore, refused to answer lawmakers’ specific questions about his role in drafting a DOJ memo, requesting the addition of a citizenship question, and he later skipped a scheduled deposition with the committee.

In a statement, the Justice Department said Gore had “never heard of” Hofeller’s work, and added that it “played no role in the department’s December 2017 request to reinstate a citizenship question.”

Barr is expected to be formally held in contempt of Congress in a separate matter on Tuesday, when the House is scheduled to vote on a contempt citation for his refusal to turn over former special counsel Robert Mueller’s unredacted report and underlying evidence, allowing the House Judiciary Committee to enforce its subpoena in federal court.

The contempt resolution will also allow other committees to enforce their subpoenas without requiring a full House vote.

Phil Mudd was responding on CNN to reports that Steele agreed to be questioned by investigators about his salacious and unverified dossier on Trump's ties to Russia.

Steele's interview would reportedly happen within weeks in London and it would come on the heels of Attorney General Bill Barr appointing a U.S. attorney to review the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation.

The DOJ inspector general is also looking into how Steele's Democrat-funded dossier was used by the FBI to secure surveillance warrants for a former Trump campaign adviser in 2016, despite questions about its credibility.

Mudd said this could turn into a ""car wreck"" for Steele if he goes forward.

""If you go to car races looking for car wrecks, this is significant. This will be a car wreck,"" said Mudd, doubting whether Steele will have sufficient answers on how he compiled the dossier.

“I can’t believe he has perfect answers about the origins of the Steele dossier. I’m not even sure why he’s showing up. If I were him, I’d go to Disney World. I would not go to the Department of Justice, because it will not end up well,"" he said.

Mudd then speculated that Steele wants to be interviewed in an attempt to clear his name so he can resume doing the same kind of work in the private sector.

“Let me give you how this game ends. Christopher Steele shows up in front of the Department of Justice and I’m guessing doesn’t have terrific answers for the quality of the information in that Steele dossier,” said Mudd.

VA watchdog report finds veterans are owed refunds for incorrect fees,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/va-watchdog-report-finds-veterans-owed-refunds-incorrect/story?id=63546615,"For years, disabled veterans were mistakenly charged fees when taking out home loans and the federal government now owes millions of dollars in refunds, a watchdog report revealed this week.

The Department of Veterans Affairs issued more than $280 million in excessive fess between 2012 and 2017, and took no action despite knowing that veterans were owed refunds, the VA Inspector General report found.

In many cases, third-party lenders rely on the VA to certify that a veteran is exempt from certain fees when applying for a home loan. But its exemption certificates were “outdated, incorrect, or missing exemption status resulting in veterans being incorrectly charged a funding fee,” according to the report.

The Washington Post via Getty Images, FILE

The Under Secretary for Benefits responded to the report by saying the problem would be corrected by the end of July.

Although most cases involved veterans becoming exempt from the fees only after they were issued, investigators found the VA did not implement its own policy to identify and refund the charges.

“Requiring a veteran to submit a claim for a refund improperly places the burden and responsibility solely upon the veteran,” the report stated.

The fees averaged $4,000 and some were considerably higher. One was for $19,470.

More than half of the 72,900 veterans who are entitled to refunds have yet to be paid by the VA.

When the issue was first identified in 2014, an analysis estimated that 48,000 veterans were owed as much as $151 million in overpaid fees.

When asked why corrective action wasn’t taken at the time, current and former leaders of the loan office said they were “focused on other competing priorities” and said they faced “historically high loan volumes” in the following years, according to the inspector general."
"More Than 100,000 Americans Urge EPA To Restrict Unnecessary Use of Monsanto’s Weedkiller on Oats",https://www.ewg.org,[],,,,https://www.ewg.org/release/more-100000-americans-urge-epa-restrict-unnecessary-use-monsanto-s-weedkiller-oats,"WASHINGTON – This week, more than 100,000 Americans officially joined EWG and 20 companies calling on the Environmental Protection Agency to significantly restrict the use of Monsanto’s weedkiller glyphosate on oats as a pre-harvest drying agent.

A coalition of companies and public interest groups, led by EWG and Megafood, gathered 104,952 signatures on online petitions to the EPA, urging the agency to lower the tolerance limit of glyphosate in oats and prohibit its pre-harvest use. The names of those who signed the petitions were submitted to EPA on Wednesday.

The EPA’s legal limit for glyphosate residues on oats is 30 parts per million, or ppm. The petition, first filed last September, asks the agency to set a more protective standard of 0.1 ppm, which was the legal limit in 1993.

“Administrator Andrew Wheeler and the EPA could quickly remove one of the more concerning routes of dietary exposure to glyphosate for children by restricting the unnecessary use of glyphosate on oats,” said EWG Legislative Director Colin O’Neil. “Americans are demanding the agency act to protect the public and the food supply from being contaminated with this toxic weedkiller linked to cancer.”

“It’s hard to find 100,000 people who agree on anything,” O’Neil said. “But when it comes to feeding themselves and their families, they agree that we should not have to worry whether eating healthy, oat-based foods for breakfast could come with a dose of glyphosate.”

The petition was amended this week and submitted to the EPA docket to include additional companies that have signed on since last year.

Glyphosate, the active ingredient in Bayer-Monsanto’s Roundup, is the most widely used pesticide in the world. It is largely used as a weedkiller on genetically modified corn and soybeans. But it is increasingly being used for crop management and applied pre-harvest to a number of non-genetically engineered crops, including oats.

Glyphosate kills the crop, drying it out so it can be harvested sooner than if the plant were allowed to die naturally. This is very likely one of the leading sources of dietary exposure for people who consume foods made with oat-based foods, like cereal and oatmeal.

Two rounds of laboratory tests commissioned by EWG found glyphosate in nearly every sample of oat-based cereal and other breakfast products at levels higher than what EWG scientists consider protective for children’s health with an adequate margin of safety.

On June 12, EWG will release results of its latest tests, which will include additional oat-based cereals and other foods that were not analyzed for glyphosate in the two earlier rounds.

A 2017 study by a team of California scientists estimate that between 2014 and 2016, at least 70 percent of American adults surveyed had detectable levels of the cancer-causing weedkiller in their bodies. That compares to 12 percent in American adults between 1993 and 1996, just before the use of glyphosate started to surge with the advent of GMO crops designed to withstand direct application of the chemical.

In 2015, 17 of the world’s top cancer researchers convened by the International Agency for Research on Cancer reviewed hundreds of studies on glyphosate and voted unanimously to classify the weedkiller as “probably carcinogenic to humans.” In 2017, California added glyphosate to its official list of chemicals known to cause cancer.

These companies are cosigners of the petition to the EPA: MegaFood, Ben & Jerry’s, Stonyfield Farm, MOM’s Organic Market, Nature’s Path, One Degree Organic Foods, National Co+op Grocers, Happy Family Organics, Amy’s Kitchen, Clif Bar & Company, Earth’s Best Organic, GrandyOats, INFRA, KIND Healthy Snacks, Lundberg Family Farms, Organic Valley, Patagonia Provisions, PCC Community Markets, Foodstirs and Kamut International, Ltd.

Watchdog will get an outside review after flawed FEMA disaster response reports,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Lisa Rein', 'Reporter Covering Federal Agencies', 'The Management Of Government In The Trump Administration']",06-07-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/homeland-security-watchdog-will-get-an-outside-review-after-flawed-disaster-response-reports/2019/06/07/ebca0b2a-8922-11e9-a870-b9c411dc4312_story.html,"Leslie Andermann Gallagher surveys the flood damage to her home on Aug. 17, 2016, in Sorrento, La.

The Homeland Security watchdog has agreed to an outside review of its performance following missteps that led it to retract 13 audits of disaster responses that hid problems and instead flattered the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

The outside review will be done by another federal inspector general’s office to ensure that Homeland Security’s monitor has improved its overall operations and oversight of FEMA, officials said.

The peer review, to be completed next year, comes after an unusual internal investigation uncovered a disturbing pattern at the oversight agency responsible for rooting out waste, fraud and abuse in the sprawling Department of Homeland Security.

John V. Kelly, now the acting inspector general, overrode auditors who flew to communities affected by hurricanes, floods, wildfires and other disasters from 2011 to 2016 to assess how well FEMA helped local residents recover, according to the internal investigation. It said auditors often discovered problems with the response, but Kelly, then in charge of the auditing teams, instead directed them to write what the staff dubbed “feel-good reports.”

[How the DHS watchdog whitewashed its oversight of FEMA’s disaster response with ‘feel good’ reports]

Under pressure from Congress, the inspector general’s office purged the faulty reports from its website in 2017 and 2018 and acknowledged they did not comply with federal auditing standards. Then the watchdog spent 14 months examining what went wrong.

It released an internal investigation in May that found fault with Kelly, his managers and their oversight of a staff that was supposed to offer real-time oversight from the ground of FEMA’s disaster response.

Kelly apologized to his staff of 600 auditors and investigators and took responsibility for failing to “set a tone that all of our products need to be fully objective.”

Federal inspectors general are traditionally evaluated by their peers every three years. The Homeland Security inspector general asked to have its next review in 2020, a year early.

Following a report Thursday in The Washington Post, two top Democrats in Congress called on the inspector general’s office to do better.

“We rely on [the office] for fact-based products that are invaluable in conducting oversight, and these reports did not meet the standard,” Rep. Bennie Thompson (Miss.), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said in a statement.

Sen. Gary Peters (Mich.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said the failures underscore the urgency for the Senate to confirm a permanent inspector general.

“Any effort to gloss over real challenges . . . limits the ability of federal, state and local governments to learn from their mistakes and improve performance for future disasters,” Peters said in a statement.

President Trump this spring nominated Joseph V. Cuffari, a policy adviser to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R), to lead the office.

The office said it is making changes that include more rigorous training of auditors to improve their objectivity, more reliance on direct sources to document their findings and rotating assignments.

The internal review also prompted the agency to address poor employee morale. Deputy Inspector General Jennifer Costello, in her written response, said she wanted “equal measures of self-awareness and accountability” and acknowledged a need for stronger leadership.

The office ranked 303 of 415 of departments that operate as part of larger agencies in last year’s Best Places to Work in the Federal Government survey, and has hovered at the bottom for years.

Charles K. Edwards, the acting inspector general under President Barack Obama, was found by a Senate oversight panel in 2014 to have altered and delayed investigations at the request of senior administration officials, compromising his role as an independent watchdog.

Edwards routinely socialized with department leaders and gave them inside information about the timing and findings of investigations, the report found. And he improperly acquiesced to requests from top political advisers to then-Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to change the wording and timing of three separate reports.

In an email Thursday, inspector general spokeswoman Erica Paulson said the office is addressing poor morale, appointing an ombudsman, creating an employee advisory council and encouraging more communication between managers and their staffs.

The inspector general “workforce remains focused and dedicated to our mission: rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse in DHS programs and operations and issuing high-impact, high-value oversight reports,” Paulson said in a statement.

“While disheartening, the mistakes on this small percentage of our work should not diminish confidence in the great work that this office has done and continues to do on behalf of the American taxpayers.”

Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency watchdog gave Homeland Security a rating of “pass with deficiencies” after reviewing a sample of audits. The black mark came primarily from one audit: The assessment of FEMA’s performance after catastrophic flooding in southern Louisiana in 2016.

The EPA review identified a variety of shortcomings with the audit, including poor supervision and issues with how the staff assessed FEMA’s performance.

“As a result, the audit report may not present a complete assessment of the issues affecting the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA’s) response to the 2016 Louisiana,” reviewers found. The internal investigation supported EPA’s conclusions."

""These are the boys of Pointe du Hoc. These are the men who took the cliffs. These are the champions who helped free a continent. These are the heroes who helped end a war,"" Reagan said in a speech on the 40th anniversary.

Reagan’s predecessor, President Jimmy Carter, actually was the first U.S. president to visit the site, in 1978, but his visit did not coincide with the anniversary.

Many presidents since Reagan have continued the tradition of visiting on the anniversary, an act of remembrance for the lives lost that day and to celebrate their contribution to the ultimate victory of the allied forces.

Ten years after Reagan’s visit marking the 40th anniversary, President Bill Clinton also made the pilgrimage.

Key figure that Mueller report linked to Russia was a State Department intel source,https://thehill.com,[],06-06-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/447394-key-figure-that-mueller-report-linked-to-russia-was-a-state-department,"In a key finding of the Mueller report, Ukrainian businessman Konstantin KilimnikKonstantin KilimnikKey figure that Mueller report linked to Russia was a State Department intel source Key figure that Mueller report linked to Russia was a State Department intel source Ex-GOP lawmaker says Trump 'illegitimate president,' should be impeached MORE, who worked for Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort Paul John ManafortKey figure that Mueller report linked to Russia was a State Department intel source Key figure that Mueller report linked to Russia was a State Department intel source Ocasio-Cortez says Manafort, others should be released from solitary confinement MORE, is tied to Russian intelligence.

But hundreds of pages of government documents — which special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerSchiff says Intel panel will hold 'series' of hearings on Mueller report Schiff says Intel panel will hold 'series' of hearings on Mueller report Key House panel faces pivotal week on Trump MORE possessed since 2018 — describe Kilimnik as a “sensitive” intelligence source for the U.S. State Department who informed on Ukrainian and Russian matters.

Why Mueller’s team omitted that part of the Kilimnik narrative from its report and related court filings is not known. But the revelation of it comes as the accuracy of Mueller’s Russia conclusions face increased scrutiny.

The incomplete portrayal of Kilimnik is so important to Mueller’s overall narrative that it is raised in the opening of his report. “The FBI assesses” Kilimnik “to have ties to Russian intelligence,” Mueller’s team wrote on Page 6, putting a sinister light on every contact Kilimnik had with Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman.

What it doesn’t state is that Kilimnik was a “sensitive” intelligence source for State going back to at least 2013 while he was still working for Manafort, according to FBI and State Department memos I reviewed.

Kilimnik was not just any run-of-the-mill source, either.

He interacted with the chief political officer at the U.S. Embassy in Kiev, sometimes meeting several times a week to provide information on the Ukraine government. He relayed messages back to Ukraine’s leaders and delivered written reports to U.S. officials via emails that stretched on for thousands of words, the memos show.

The FBI knew all of this, well before the Mueller investigation concluded.

Alan Purcell, the chief political officer at the Kiev embassy from 2014 to 2017, told FBI agents that State officials, including senior embassy officials Alexander Kasanof and Eric Schultz, deemed Kilimnik to be such a valuable asset that they kept his name out of cables for fear he would be compromised by leaks to WikiLeaks.

“Purcell described what he considered an unusual level of discretion that was taken with handling Kilimnik,” states one FBI interview report that I reviewed. “Normally the head of the political section would not handle sources, but Kasanof informed Purcell that KILIMNIK was a sensitive source.”

Purcell told the FBI that Kilimnik provided “detailed information about OB (Ukraine’s opposition bloc) inner workings” that sometimes was so valuable it was forwarded immediately to the ambassador. Purcell learned that other Western governments relied on Kilimnik as a source, too.

“One time, in a meeting with the Italian embassy, Purcell heard the Italian ambassador echo a talking point that was strikingly familiar to the point Kilimnik had shared with Purcell,” the FBI report states.

Kasanof, who preceded Purcell as the U.S. Embassy political officer, told the FBI he knew Kilimnik worked for Manafort’s lobbying firm and the administration of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, whose Party of Regions hired Manafort’s firm.

Kasanof described Kilimnik as one of the few reliable insiders the U.S. Embassy had informing on Yanukovych. Kilimnik began his relationship as an informant with the U.S. deputy chief of mission in 2012–13, before being handed off to the embassy’s political office, the records suggest.

“Kilimnik was one of the only people within the administration who was willing to talk to USEMB,” referring to the U.S. Embassy, and he “provided information about the inner workings of Yanukovych’s administration,” Kasanof told the FBI agents.

“Kasanof met with Kilimnik at least bi-weekly and occasionally multiple times in the same week,” always outside the embassy to avoid detection, the FBI wrote. “Kasanof allowed Kilimnik to take the lead on operational security” for their meetings.

State officials told the FBI that although Kilimnik had Ukrainian and Russian residences, he did not appear to hold any allegiance to Moscow and was critical of Russia’s invasion of the Crimean territory of Ukraine.

“Most sources of information in Ukraine were slanted in one direction or another,” Kasanof told agents. “Kilimnik came across as less slanted than others.”

“Kilimnik was flabbergasted at the Russian invasion of Crimea,” the FBI added, summarizing Kasanof’s interview with agents.

Three sources with direct knowledge of the inner workings of Mueller’s office confirmed to me that the special prosecutor’s team had all of the FBI interviews with State officials, as well as Kilimnik’s intelligence reports to the U.S. Embassy, well before they portrayed him as a Russian sympathizer tied to Moscow intelligence or charged Kilimnik with participating with Manafort in a scheme to obstruct the Russia investigation.

Kasanof’s and Purcell’s interviews are corroborated by scores of State Department emails I reviewed that contain regular intelligence from Kilimnik on happenings inside the Yanukovych administration, the Crimea conflict and Ukrainian and Russian politics. For example, the memos show Kilimnik provided real-time intelligence on everything from whose star in the administration was rising or falling to efforts at stuffing ballot boxes in Ukrainian elections.

Those emails raise further doubt about the Mueller report’s portrayal of Kilimnik as a Russian agent. They show Kilimnik was allowed to visit the United States twice in 2016 to meet with State officials, a clear sign he wasn’t flagged in visa databases as a foreign intelligence threat.

The emails also show how misleading, by omission, the Mueller report’s public portrayal of Kilimnik turns out to be.

For instance, the report makes a big deal about Kilimnik’s meeting with Manafort in August 2016 at the Trump Tower in New York.

By that time, Manafort had served as Trump’s campaign chairman for several months but was about to resign because of a growing controversy about the millions of dollars Manafort accepted as a foreign lobbyist for Yanukovych’s party.

Specifically, the Mueller report flagged Kilimnik’s delivery of a peace plan to the Trump campaign for settling the two-year-old Crimea conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

“Kilimnik requested the meeting to deliver in person a peace plan for Ukraine that Manafort acknowledged to the Special Counsel’s Office was a ‘backdoor’ way for Russia to control part of eastern Ukraine,” the Mueller report stated.

But State emails showed Kilimnik first delivered a version of his peace plan in May 2016 to the Obama administration during a visit to Washington. Kasanof, his former handler at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, had been promoted to a top policy position at State, and the two met for dinner on May 5, 2016.

The day after the dinner, Kilimnik sent an email to Kasanof’s official State email address recounting the peace plan they had discussed the night before.

Russia wanted “a quick settlement” to get “Ukraine out of the way and get rid of sanctions and move to economic stuff they are interested in,” Kilimnik wrote Kasanof. The email offered eight bullet points for the peace plan — starting with a ceasefire, a law creating economic recovery zones to rebuild war-torn Ukrainian regions, and a “presidential decree on amnesty” for anyone involved in the conflict on both sides.

Kilimnik also provided a valuable piece of intelligence, stating that the old Yanukovych political party aligned with Russia was dead. “Party of Regions cannot be reincarnated. It is over,” he wrote, deriding as “stupid” a Russian-backed politician who wanted to restart the party.

Kasanof replied the next day that, although he was skeptical of some of the intelligence on Russian intentions, it was “very important for us to know.”

He thanked Kilimnik for the detailed plan and added, “I passed the info to my bosses, who are chewing it over.” Kasanof told the FBI that he believed he sent Kilimnik’s peace plan to two senior State officials, including Victoria Nuland, President Obama’s assistant secretary of State for European and Eurasian affairs.

So Kilimnik’s delivery of the peace plan to the Trump campaign in August 2016 was flagged by Mueller as potentially nefarious, but its earlier delivery to the Obama administration wasn’t mentioned. That’s what many in the intelligence world might call “deception by omission.”

Lest you wonder, the documents I reviewed included evidence that Kasanof’s interview with the FBI and Kilimnik’s emails to State about the peace plan were in Mueller’s possession by early 2018, more than a year before the final report.

Officials for the State Department, the FBI, the Justice Department and Mueller’s office did not respond to requests for comment. Kilimnik did not respond to an email seeking comment but, in an email last month to The Washington Post, he slammed the Mueller report’s “made-up narrative” about him. “I have no ties to Russian or, for that matter, any intelligence operation,” he wrote.

Kilimnik holds Ukrainian and Russian citizenship, served in the Soviet military, attended a prestigious Russian language academy and had contacts with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. So it is likely he had contacts over the years with Russian intelligence figures. There also is evidence Kilimnik left the U.S.-funded International Republican Institute (IRI) in 2005 because of concerns about his past connections to Russia, though at least one IRI witness disputed that evidence to the FBI, the memos show.

Yet, omitting his extensive, trusted assistance to the State Department seems inexplicable.

If Mueller’s team can cast such a misleading portrayal of Kilimnik, however, it begs the question of what else might be incorrect or omitted in the report.

Attorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrDemocrats needle Trump with Watergate witness Democrats needle Trump with Watergate witness Barr compares his return to DOJ to D-Day invasion MORE has said some of the Mueller report’s legal reasoning conflicts with Justice Department policies. And former Trump attorney John Dowd made a compelling case that Mueller’s report wrongly portrayed a phone message he left for a witness.

A few more such errors and omissions, and Americans may begin to wonder if the Mueller report is worth the paper on which it was printed.
