MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski fails to get panel to bash Trump during Memorial Day segment,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Joseph Wulfsohn', 'Joseph A. Wulfsohn Is A Media Reporter For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/morning-joe-mika-brzezinski-trump-memorial-day,"MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski made a failed attempt on Monday morning to rile up her ""Morning Joe"" panel to bash President Trump on a segment dedicated to Memorial Day.

In the segment, Brzezinski began by asking the ""reflections"" of MSNBC commentator Mike Barnicle by invoking Trump's deployment of troops at the southern border.

“I want to ask you what your reflections are during this time in terms of our attitudes in America, our knowledge and our understanding of people who serve in the military, who serve multiple tours of duty, who have taken part in wars on behalf of this country, and also, are being deployed by this President by -- let’s say maybe perhaps controversial means in terms of their deployments at the southern border for caravans that are coming in. It’s a convoluting time, is it not?” Brzezinski said.

Barnicle responded by expressing a ""sadness"" that now surrounds Memorial Day, one that had nothing to do with the president.

“There’s a certain sadness with me, about Memorial Day, because you think of the word memorial, and part of that word incorporates memory,” Barnicle told Brzezinski. He talked about the tendency to forget on a day dedicated to remembrance, about the cultural steps backward of technological steps forward like Twitter, how it used to be there was almost no one in America whose life hadn’t been touched by the loss of an American servicemember.""

Brzezinski then pivoted to SiriusXM host and combat veteran Paul Rieckhoff in hopes that he would take the opportunity to slam Trump. He didn't.

“And Paul, I would love for you to reflect on what Mike Barnicle just said,” Brzezinski told Rieckhoff, “And also, given the work that you have done, how you’re feeling about the way the military perhaps is beings used by this presidency? Does it really match their role in history?”

""I think sadly that's right, Mika, but I think as a starting point Memorial Day still can be a time where we come together as a nation at this time when we are so divided,” Rieckhoff responded. ""Even if you take just one minute on the a moment of silence... just take one minute and reflect on someone that you know that has died or even if you don't know someone that has died, someone that has died on your behalf to give you the opportunity to go have a barbeque or go to the beach..."""
James Comey: No ‘treason.’ No coup. Just lies — and dumb lies at that.,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['James Comey', 'May At Pm']",05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/james-comey-no-treason-no-coup-just-lies--and-dumb-lies-at-that/2019/05/28/45f8d802-8175-11e9-bce7-40b4105f7ca0_story.html,"James Comey is a former director of the FBI and a former deputy attorney general.

It is tempting for normal people to ignore our president when he starts ranting about treason and corruption at the FBI. I understand the temptation. I’m the object of many of his rants, and even I try to ignore him.

But we shouldn’t, because millions of good people believe what a president of the United States says. In normal times, that’s healthy. But not now, when the president is a liar who doesn’t care what damage he does to vital institutions. We must call out his lies that the FBI was corrupt and committed treason, that we spied on the Trump campaign and tried to defeat Donald Trump. We must constantly return to the stubborn facts.

Russia engaged in a massive effort to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. Near as I can tell, there is only one U.S. leader who still denies that fact. The FBI saw the attack starting in mid-June 2016, with the first dumping of stolen emails. In late July, when we were hard at work trying to understand the scope of the effort, we learned that one of Trump’s foreign policy advisers knew about the Russian effort seven weeks before we did.

In April 2016, that adviser talked to a Russian agent in London, learned that the Russians had obtained “dirt” on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands of emails and that the Russians could assist the Trump campaign through the anonymous release of information damaging to Clinton. Of course, nobody from the Trump campaign told us this (or about later Russian approaches); we had to learn it, months after the fact, from an allied ambassador.

But when we finally learned of it in late July, what should the FBI have done? Let it go? Go tell the Trump campaign? Tell the press? No. Investigate, to see what the facts were. We didn’t know what was true. Maybe there was nothing to it, or maybe Americans were actively conspiring with the Russians. To find out, the FBI would live up to its name and investigate.

As director, I was determined that the work would be done carefully, professionally and discreetly. We were just starting. If there was nothing to it, we didn’t want to smear Americans. If there was something to it, we didn’t want to let corrupt Americans know we were onto them. So, we kept it secret. That’s how the FBI approaches all counterintelligence cases.

And there’s the first problem with Trump’s whole “treason” narrative. If we were “deep state” Clinton loyalists bent on stopping him, why would we keep it secret? Why wouldn’t the much-maligned FBI supervisor Peter Strzok — the alleged kingpin of the “treasonous” plot to stop Trump — tell anyone? He was one of the very few people who knew what we were investigating.

We investigated. We didn’t gather information about the campaign’s strategy. We didn’t “spy” on anyone’s campaign. We investigated to see whether it was true that Americans associated with the campaign had taken the Russians up on any offer of help. By late October, the investigators thought they had probable cause to get a federal court order to conduct electronic surveillance of a former Trump campaign adviser named Carter Page. Page was no longer with the campaign, but there was reason to believe he was acting as an agent of the Russian government. We asked a federal judge for permission to surveil him and then we did it, all without revealing our work, despite the fact that it was late October and a leak would have been very harmful to candidate Trump. Worst deep-state conspiracy ever.

But wait, the conspiracy idea gets dumber. On Oct. 28, after agonizing deliberation over two terrible options, I concluded I had no choice but to inform Congress that we had reopened the Clinton email investigation. I judged that hiding that fact — after having told Congress repeatedly and under oath that the case was finished — would be worse than telling Congress the truth. It was a decision William Barr praised and Hillary Clinton blamed for her loss 11 days later. Strzok, alleged architect of the treasonous plot to stop Trump, drafted the letter I sent Congress.

And there’s still more to the dumbness of the conspiracy allegation. At the center of the alleged FBI “corruption” we hear so much about was the conclusion that Deputy Director Andrew McCabe lied to internal investigators about a disclosure to the press in late October 2016. McCabe was fired over it. And what was that disclosure? Some stop-Trump election-eve screed? No. McCabe authorized a disclosure that revealed the FBI was actively investigating the Clinton Foundation, a disclosure that was harmful to Clinton.

There is a reason the non-fringe media doesn’t spend much time on this “treason” and “corruption” business. The conspiracy theory makes no sense. The FBI wasn’t out to get Donald Trump. It also wasn’t out to get Hillary Clinton. It was out to do its best to investigate serious matters while walking through a vicious political minefield.

But go ahead, investigate the investigators, if you must. When those investigations are over, you will find the work was done appropriately and focused only on discerning the truth of very serious allegations. There was no corruption. There was no treason. There was no attempted coup. Those are lies, and dumb lies at that. There were just good people trying to figure out what was true, under unprecedented circumstances."
"CNN's Jim Acosta says media 'neutrality' doesn't serve us in the age of Trump, admits to 'showboating' and 'grandstanding'",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Joseph Wulfsohn', 'Joseph A. Wulfsohn Is A Media Reporter For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/cnn-jim-acosta-trump-media-neutrality,"CNN's White House star, and frequent Trump foil, Jim Acosta has declared that media 'neutrality' is no longer a possibility under this president.

In his new book, ""The Enemy of the People: A Dangerous Time to Tell the Truth in America,"" Acosta admits to occasionally ""grandstanding” and “showboating” during White House press briefings and that he “opts for the bait.""

“Neutrality for the sake of neutrality doesn’t really serve us in the age of Trump,” Acosta writes, according to excerpts from his upcoming book obtained by The Guardian.

CNN's chief White House correspondent claims in the book how high-ranking Trump administration officials trash the president with one ""senior White House official"" even allegedly go so far as to tell him that president ""is insane"". Another ""former White House national security official"" alleged that staffers weren't sure if the president was ""compromised"" by Russia, according to the excerpts.

JIM ACOSTA'S CNN ROLE FURTHER MUDDIED BY UPCOMING BOOK: 'YOU CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIM AND A PAID PUNDIT'

Acosta also recalled the aftermath of a contentious February 2017 press conference where he confronted Trump about Russia's meddling in the 2016 election and the president slammed the CNN reporter, calling him ""very fake news.""

“When he called us ‘fake news’ it was, in his mind, an act,” Acosta says.

Acosta is facing some backlash from other journalists who object the notion that ""neutrality"" cannot exist in the Trump era, including MSNBC media reporter Dylan Byers.

TRUMP SCOLDS CNN’S JIM ACOSTA, AS ANGEL MOMS CONFRONT REPORTER IN ROSE GARDEN: ‘YOU HAVE AN AGENDA’

""There are a lot of really, really hardworking journalists at CNN who strive to be fair, impartial, responsible journalists and I’m guessing some of them aren’t crazy about this from @Acosta,"" Byers tweeted.

It comes after one current CNN employee told Fox News that threats to the free press should obviously be taken seriously and reporters need to seek the truth and report it – but Acosta may no longer be right for the job.

“Jim Acosta is, a lot of times, asking the right questions but it doesn’t always need to be about him and his grandstanding,” the CNN staffer said. “People get tired of it. Acosta is supposed to be a correspondent reporting the facts but you can’t tell the difference between him and a paid pundit.”

The CNNer said Acosta’s actions have resulted in some “eye rolling” around CNN, but the temperamental correspondent’s colleagues haven’t thought too much about the upcoming book.

“If we don’t have to talk about Jim Acosta, we don’t talk about Jim Acosta,” the employee added.

Acosta's new book is set to be released June 11.

U.S. service members seen wearing MAGA-inspired patches at Trump speech may have violated DOD rules,https://www.cbsnews.com,"['Emily Tillett', 'Emily Tillett Is A Politics Reporter', 'Video Editor For Cbs News Digital']",,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/u-s-service-members-seen-with-maga-patches-on-jumpsuits-at-trump-speech/,"U.S. service members attending a Memorial Day address by President Trump during his overseas trip to Japan were photographed wearing patches inspired by his campaign slogan, and this may have violated the Pentagon's strict rules barring soldiers from showing political preferences.

Navy spokesman Samuel Boyle said in a statement to CBS News, ""Navy leadership is currently reviewing this instance to ensure that the wearing of the patch does not violate DoD policy or regulations.""

The group of service members aboard the USS Wasp in Yokosuka, Japan, were photographed by Wall Street Journal reporter Vivian Salama. The airmen posing for the photo all donned matching patches showing what appears to be the president, along with the text, ""Make Aircrew Great Again."" Wire services photographers also captured images of the same military members.

The patches may not be in compliance with longstanding Pentagon guidance that dictates that active-duty military personnel should not engage in partisan political activities.

""All military personnel will avoid the inference that their political activities imply or appear to imply DoD sponsorship, approval or endorsement of a political candidate, campaign or cause,"" the policy states.

Examples of banned political activities include actively campaigning for a candidate, soliciting contributions, marching in a partisan parade or wearing uniforms to a partisan event. Certain political activities are allowed and encouraged — like voting in an election and making personal campaign donations.

While it's not clear whether the crew members belonged to the Navy or the Marines, CBS News' David Martin reports that in either case, the Department of the Navy bears responsibility.

During Mr. Trump's remarks to the approximately 1,000 uniformed sailors and Marines, he remarked that the troops assembled were ""such good-looking people"" that they could leave the military and ""end up in Hollywood."""
Don Jr. warns Roy Moore: Stay out of Alabama Senate race,https://www.politico.com,['James Arkin'],05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/28/don-jr-roy-moore-alabama-senate-1346089,"“You are literally the only candidate who could lose a GOP seat in pro-Trump, pro-USA ALABAMA,” Donald Trump Jr. tweeted at Rob Moore. | Darren Hauck/Getty Images elections Don Jr. warns Roy Moore: Stay out of Alabama Senate race

Donald Trump Jr. on Tuesday warned Roy Moore not to run for Senate again in Alabama, calling him the only candidate who could lose the race for Republicans.

Moore lost the 2017 special Senate election to Democrat Doug Jones after the former judge faced allegations of decades-old inappropriate sexual interactions with young girls. He has expressed interest in running again next year, and many Republicans expect him to mount another campaign for Senate, a worst-case scenario for the party’s hopes of winning back the seat.

“You are literally the only candidate who could lose a GOP seat in pro-Trump, pro-USA ALABAMA,” Trump Jr. tweeted at Moore on Tuesday. “Running for office should never become a business model. If you actually care about #MAGA more than your own ego, it’s time to ride off into the sunset, Judge.”

Trump Jr. was responding to a tweet in which Moore taunted Rep. Bradley Byrne, one of the Republicans running to face Jones next fall. Byrne told The Hill that he expects Moore to enter the race soon but didn’t think he could win the nomination because of the baggage from his previous run.

“What is Bradley so worried about?” Moore tweeted. “He knows that if I run I will beat Doug Jones.”

Republicans in Washington have vowed to oppose Moore and think the former judge would put the Alabama race in jeopardy again. Jones won by less than 2 percentage points in 2017 and is the most vulnerable incumbent senator on the ballot in 2020. Earlier this year, Jones taunted Moore about running again, saying, “Let’s just do it again.”"
"Savior of G.M. Lordstown Plant, Hailed by Trump, Is a Corporate Cipher",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Nelson D. Schwartz', 'Matthew Goldstein', 'Neal E. Boudette']",05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/business/economy/trump-gm-workhorse-lordstown.html,"For months, President Trump had been putting pressure on the chief executive of General Motors, Mary T. Barra, because she had decided to idle an Ohio factory and lay off 1,600 workers. “I am not happy that it is closed when everything else in our Country is BOOMING,” he said on Twitter. “I asked her to sell it or do something quickly.”

In early May, it seemed an answer was at hand. From her spacious office on the 39th floor of the Renaissance Center in Detroit, Ms. Barra called the president on May 8 to update him. The automaker was in negotiations to sell the plant in Lordstown, Ohio, to a new company affiliated with a little-known electrical vehicle maker called Workhorse.

G.M. planned to announce the talks that afternoon along with a $700 million investment elsewhere in Ohio. But Mr. Trump beat the company to the punch, posting on Twitter that the Lordstown sale was practically a done deal. It wasn’t — but that was the least of the problems with what the president said.

The new venture, whose name remains secret, exists almost entirely on paper. Headed by the founder and former chief executive of Workhorse, Steve Burns, the business would have to raise at least $300 million to get Lordstown running again."
"DOJ agrees to make Mueller court activity public, with some redactions",https://www.cnn.com,['Katelyn Polantz'],05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/28/politics/mueller-court-activity-public/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Justice Department said Tuesday it agrees that a federal court in Washington can make public lists describing potentially hundreds of miscellaneous court actions, like search warrants, used in the Mueller investigation.

The department asked for three weeks to make redactions on ""a few entries"" because of ongoing law enforcement efforts, and a judge said she would give the agency that time.

CNN had asked the court to make the lists public. The unsealing would not necessarily reveal the details of the court filings, but instead give the public a broader overview of how, when and for what Mueller was going to the federal court to gather evidence.

Mueller said in his final report that his team had received almost 800 search, seizure and communications warrants from federal courts in the investigation, yet his office wouldn't give more detail. It's still unknown exactly how many of those were approved by judges in federal court in DC.

Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the DC District Court has shown the government three lists of unknown length that give limited information about these matters. It is possible that the lists will reveal how often Mueller approached technology and communications companies for access to information -- with the targets of many of the warrants not named in these lists.

"States Can’t Block Legal Hemp Shipments Within Their Borders, USDA Says",https://www.marijuanamoment.net,"['Kyle Jaeger', 'Natalie Fertig']",05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.marijuanamoment.net/states-cant-block-legal-hemp-shipments-within-their-borders-usda-says/,"The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said on Tuesday that hemp can be transported across state lines—even through states that haven’t enacted laws allowing the crop’s production—and that the descheduling of the plant and its derivatives under the 2018 Farm Bill are already in effect because they are self-executing and do not require further action by federal agencies.

In a four-point legal opinion issued by the agency, USDA specified that hemp has been removed from the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), states and Indian tribes may not prohibit the interstate transportation of lawfully marketed hemp products—including those that fall under the more limited research-focused provisions of the previous 2014 Farm Bill—and that restrictions on participation in the hemp industry apply for individuals with felony drug convictions.

The USDA Office of the General Counsel said that while states and Indian tribes can still control the production of hemp in their respective jurisdictions, interstate commerce must be permitted following the implementation of the agency’s hemp regulations.

In the meantime, before any businesses can begin planting, harvesting and processing hemp crops under the new Farm Bill’s provisions, however, the USDA must first enact implementing regulations and then approve state-submitted regulatory plans.

“It is also important to emphasize that the 2018 Farm Bill does not affect or modify the authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services or Commissioner of Food and Drugs to regulate hemp under applicable U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) laws,” the agency added, perhaps referring to confusion that has surrounded the question of including hemp-derived CBD in food products and dietary supplements. “USDA expects to issue regulations implementing new hemp production authorities in 2019.”

The memo also indicates that people with felony drug convictions—who would otherwise be prohibited from participating in the legal hemp industry for 10 years—are exempted from the ban if their participation began following the passage of the 2014 version of the agriculture legislation but prior to the enactment of the broader 2018 bill.

Another notable aspect of the memo concerns THC derived from hemp.

“Congress has removed hemp from Schedule I and removed it entirely from the CSA,” USDA wrote. “In other words, hemp is no longer a controlled substance. Also, by amending Schedule I to exclude THC in hemp, Congress has likewise removed THC in hemp from the CSA.”

The 2018 Farm Bill definition of hemp stipulates that a cannabis crop must not contain more than 0.3 percent THC to qualify. THC derived from marijuana remains federally prohibited.

The agriculture bill shifted regulatory responsibility for hemp from the Justice Department to USDA. As such, USDA noted in its legal opinion that “this decontrolling of hemp (and THC in hemp) is self-executing.”

“Although the CSA implementing regulations must be updated to reflect the 2018 Farm Bill amendments to the CSA, neither the publication of those updated regulations nor any other action is necessary to execute this removal,” USDA wrote. In other words, the Justice Department doesn’t have to update its guidance on hemp and its derivatives for the policies to be in effect.

These are some of the most concrete updates that the USDA has offered since the 2018 Farm Bill was signed into law in December 2018. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has indicated that his department wouldn’t be expediting the rulemaking process, but he said that hemp regulations would be implemented ahead of the 2020 planting season.

One of the more consequential takeaways from the legal opinion for industry stakeholders concerns interstate transportation of hemp and its derivatives. USDA explained that a provision of the agriculture legislation “preempts State law to the extent that State law prohibits the interstate transportation or shipment of hemp that has been produced in accordance with” the Farm Bill.

Hemp produced under the 2014 version of the bill also qualifies for the interstate transportation protection, USDA further explained.

A separate memo released on Tuesday clarifies that Indian tribes can continue to engage with states that authorize hemp pilot programs for research purposes but that they, unlike states, cannot themselves authorize hemp research programs.

That second memo doesn’t touch on the 2018 version of the bill, but it states that the “law remains unchanged in that Indian tribes, individuals, and entities located in States that do no permit hemp production are ineligible to participate in the growing or cultivation of hemp under the 2014 Farm Bill program.”

Return of the State Department news briefing,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Carol Morello', 'National Reporter Focusing On Foreign Policy', 'State Department', 'May At Pm']",05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/return-of-the-state-department-news-briefing/2019/05/28/60b804ef-d4d5-4073-b5b0-ee4e370d9a57_story.html,"The State Department spokeswoman was at the lectern again Tuesday, fielding questions from reporters about hot spots causing diplomatic agita.

Morgan Ortagus had some dismissive words for Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and the Iranian regime. She referred questions about a Middle East peace plan to the White House. She called Secretary of State Mike Pompeo “incredibly supportive” of President Trump and his foreign policy agenda.

Nothing Ortagus said was particularly groundbreaking. But the fact she was answering reporters’ questions at all was news in itself.

Ending an intermittent hiatus, the State Department’s regular news briefing is coming back. After a couple of off-camera practice runs such as Tuesday’s, on-camera briefings are expected to resume later this week, possibly as early as Wednesday.

Ortagus has promised to try to answer questions almost every weekday when she is not traveling with Pompeo. That will come as a relief to diplomats posted at embassies around Washington who follow the briefings closely, listening for any admonitions of their government’s transgressions.

The resumption of news briefings also sets the State Department apart in an administration in which many normal practices have been abandoned.

The Defense Department has gone almost a year without a press-secretary briefing, though Kiss frontman Gene Simmons and actor Gerard Butler have both done star turns on the Pentagon podium.

The White House briefing room has been gathering dust since press secretary Sarah Sanders last showed up March 11 for only her second briefing of 2019. Trump has said he directed Sanders “not to bother” with the tradition, calling the press corps rude and inaccurate.

The State Department briefings, a fixture since the Eisenhower administration, have served a small, targeted audience looking for gleanings of a shift in U.S. foreign policy and reaction to events around the world. They amplify the United States’ message, provide guidance to embassies and diplomats in Foggy Bottom and underscore the American belief in transparency even in the case of questions from Tass and Pravda.

The State Department used to brief daily. But in the Trump administration, the timetable shrank to no more than twice a week, and often less.

Robert Palladino, the deputy spokesman, held the last briefing on April 11. That was barely a week after Ortagus was named as a replacement for Heather Nauert.

Ortagus is a Navy Reserve officer who was the spokeswoman for the U.S. Agency for International Development during the George W. Bush administration and worked in public diplomacy in Baghdad. She was an intelligence analyst and most recently a contributor on Fox News.

Ortagus describes herself as a foreign policy wonk who watched the televised State Department briefings when she was in college and had a printout portrait of former secretary Condoleezza Rice on her dorm-room wall.

In recent months, State Department officials have tried to “widen the aperture” of news organizations that cover Pompeo’s diplomacy, as Palladino was overheard telling a Christian broadcaster he invited to a briefing last month. They have invited reporters from Breitbart and the conservative website Townhall to accompany them on overseas trips while limiting the number of seats available to other media outlets."
Kamala Harris proposes having DOJ approve new abortion laws in certain states,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/kamala-harris-proposes-having-doj-approve-new-abortion-laws-in-certain-states,"Presidential hopeful Sen. Kamala Harris released a plan Tuesday that would mandate states where past anti-abortion laws have been overturned by the courts to have any new ones approved by the Department of Justice

“Under the plan, states and localities will be subject to the preclearance requirement if they have a pattern of violating Roe v. Wade in the preceding 25 years,” the California Democrat said.

“Any change with respect to abortion in a covered jurisdiction will remain legally unenforceable until DOJ determines it comports with the standards laid out by the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade,” she said.

Harris termed her plan the Reproduction Rights Act and wants to codify abortion into state laws nationwide. The plan also allows women and healthcare providers to sue the Department of Justice if “hostile administrations” seek to approve anti-abortion laws.

The plan, which would be similar to the Voting Rights Act, is a response to a slew of anti-abortion laws passed this year in a dozen conservative states, including Georgia, Alabama, and Missouri.

The presidential hopeful’s competitor Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., called this month for Congress to pass legislation to guarantee abortion protections if Roe v. Wade is overturned."
Treasury Dept. Declines to Label China a Currency Manipulator,https://www.nytimes.com,['Alan Rappeport'],05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/us/politics/treasury-declines-to-label-china-currency-manipulator.html,"In addition, if a country actively intervenes in foreign exchange markets for six out of 12 months, rather than the current eight-month threshold, it will be closer to being flagged for manipulation.

A Treasury Department official said that even with the new thresholds, no country in recent years would have been designated. China meets only one of the thresholds, but the department used its discretion to add it to the watch list because of the size of its trade surplus.

Last week, the Commerce Department proposed a rule change that would allow the United States to expand its ability to penalize countries that manipulate their currencies.

It proposed expanding a type of remedy that is typically used to levy tariffs on products that are determined to be unfairly subsidized by foreign governments. Under the proposed rule, so-called countervailing duties could be imposed when foreign governments “subsidize” their products by weakening their currencies relative to the United States dollar, the department said.

A senior Treasury Department official said the Commerce Department proposal was a separate matter that would not affect how the Treasury executed its designations.

Although the Trump administration has complained about China’s currency practices, the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said during a congressional hearing last week that the weakening of China’s currency would help minimize the impact of Mr. Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods.

As a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump made labeling China a currency manipulator a central plank of his economic policy, promising in his “contract” with American voters that he would direct the secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator in the first 100 days of his presidency."

The EPA responded to the Hill's request for comment by referring to a recent court filing where the agency allowed for the agency's rules to stay in effect.

Foxconn's investment in Wisconsin has been one of the Trump administration's most touted economic victories, as the company originally pledged to create more than 10,000 jobs and invest billions in a manufacturing plant in the state.

“Indiscriminate attacks on civilians and public infrastructure such as schools, markets and hospitals is a reckless escalation of the conflict and is unacceptable,” State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said.

“The violence must end,” she added.

Recent government airstrikes, backed by Assad’s allies in Moscow, have uprooted more than 300,000 people and killed 229 civilians, according to the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations.

The statement came nearly a week after the State Department said it had seen signs that Assad may have renewed his use of chemical weapons in northwest Syria, warning Damascus of a quick response if such an attack were proved.

Idlib is home to thousands of anti-government fighters and has been a focal point of clashes as Assad seeks to wipe out any remaining opposition to his government.

Syria's civil war first began in 2011 and has left hundreds of thousands of civilians dead and forced millions of Syrians to flee violence.

From The Reading List

Bloomberg Environment: ""EPA Curbs Use of 12 Bee-Harming Pesticides"" — ""The Environmental Protection Agency has canceled registration of a dozen pesticides, from a class of chemicals known to harm bees.

""The cancellations are effective as of May 20 for 12 neonicotinoid-based products produced by Syngenta, Valent, and Bayer.

""The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act requires pesticides sold or distributed in the U.S. to be registered by the EPA.

""Under a December settlement agreement linked to an Endangered Species Act challenge by environmental groups, the companies voluntarily agreed to petition EPA to cancel 12 out of 59 products containing the active ingredients clothianidin and thiamethoxam.

""Developed as an alternative to organophosphate and carbamate pesticides, neonicotinoids are chemically related to nicotine, and attack the nervous system of insects.""

Washington Post: ""The Energy 202: EPA blocks a dozen products containing pesticides thought harmful to bees"" — ""The Environmental Protection Agency is pulling from the market a dozen products containing pesticides known to be toxic to a linchpin of the U.S. food system — the honeybee.

""The agency announced Monday it has canceled the registrations of 12 pest-killing products with compounds belonging to a class of chemicals known as neonicotinoids, as part of a legal settlement.

""For years, beekeepers and wildlife conversationalists alike have voiced concern that the widespread use of neonics, as the chemicals are commonly called, is imperiling wild and domesticated bees crucial to pollinating commercial fruit, nut and vegetable crops.""

PBS NewsHour: ""Neonicotinoid pesticides are slowly killing bees"" — ""Neonicotinoid pesticides commonly found in agricultural areas kill bees and hurt their ability to reproduce, two separate large-scale studies confirmed for the first time Thursday.

""The two studies — one that examined honeybees in Canada and the other that looked at three bee species in the United Kingdom, Germany and Hungary — were the first large-scale investigations to test the popular agrochemicals influence on bees in real world settings.

""The work also turns many preconceived notions about bees and pesticides on their heads.""

Thankfully, the Cold War is over, and has little chance of returning: Neither Russia nor China will ever challenge us in the way the Soviet Union did. Yet our confrontation with an ideological and strategic superpower did produce some useful practices in the art of American diplomacy — norms that President Trump violated during his trip to Japan this week. It’s time we recall why our leaders once followed certain unspoken rules during the Cold War — and to consider re-adopting those same standards of behavior.

First and most importantly, U.S. presidents — be they Democrats or Republicans — never expressed personal approval of our communist adversaries. They never talked about Communist Party leaders as friends. They never “fell in love” with Leonid Brezhnev or Nikita Khrushchev. Of course, U.S. presidents engaged directly with their Soviet counterparts in the pursuit of U.S. national interests. But they did so without personalizing these ties and without excusing dictatorship.

Trump has practiced the opposite policy. During his visit to Japan this week, Trump again expressed affection for Kim Jong Un, tweeting about his “confidence” in the North Korean leader. Perhaps Trump’s personalized praise of autocratic adversaries will one day produce tangible outcomes for U.S. security and economic interests. So far, it has not.

Second, U.S. presidents engaged not only with governments of our enemies, but also sought to appeal directly to the people who live under these autocratic regimes, including especially Soviet citizens. This dual-track diplomacy was animated by the belief that those living in captive nations deserved our moral support even when we engaged with their oppressors on issues like arms control or trade. President Ronald Reagan and his administration were particularly effective in signaling to Soviet leaders that they were not going to check their values at the door in government-to-government negotiating sessions. But Reagan was not alone in this practice. Even Richard M. Nixon spoke directly to the Soviet people to explain our intentions.

To date, Trump has demonstrated very little interest in connecting with the oppressed peoples of North Korea, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Egypt or even Iran. (The only possible exception: Venezuela.) By the third year of his presidency, President Barack Obama already had met with hundreds — maybe thousands — of Russian students, entrepreneurs, civil society activists, journalists, and opposition leaders, both in Moscow and Washington. He even played basketball at the outdoor White House court with some Russian high-school players visiting Washington.

By contrast, to the best of my knowledge, Trump has had zero contact with Russian society. Even regarding Iran, Trump (perhaps inadvertently) offended many Iranians and Iranian Americans hostile to the dictatorship in Tehran when he vowed to bring about “the official end of Iran” in case of war. He ought to have threatened the Islamic Republic, its ruling mullahs or its theocracy, but he also ought to have expressed that the United States did not see the Iranian people as its enemy. Lower-level officials in the Trump administration made the distinction; Trump must do so as well.

Third, U.S. presidents and other politicians have embraced the practice of leaving our domestic squabbles at home when traveling abroad. They wanted to project a unified American voice beyond the borders of the country. In 1947, at the beginning of the Cold War, Republican Sen. Arthur Vandenberg (Mich.) delivered a stirring speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate that included the following remark: “We must stop partisan politics at the water’s edge.”

President Harry S. Truman echoed the phrase a year later while accepting his party’s nomination: “As I have said time and time again, foreign policy should be the policy of the whole Nation and not the policy of one party or the other. Partisanship should stop at the water’s edge.”

During the Cold War, especially during the Vietnam War, some U.S. politicians violated this norm. But the norm remained, nonetheless, and well past the end of the Cold War. While serving as the U.S. ambassador to the Russian Federation during the Obama administration, I saw admiringly how bipartisan congressional delegations spoke with one voice while meeting with Russian government officials, even if they sometimes fell back into factionalism behind closed doors. That commitment to our national interest — not Republican or Democratic interests — served our nation well.

That’s why Trump’s ridicule of a former two-term vice president while visiting Japan was so disheartening. Trump tweeted approvingly that Kim had “called Swampman Joe Biden a low IQ individual, & worse.” Any national leader writing such inflammatory comments about another U.S. public figure (and siding with a foreign adversary in the process) is unacceptable. The president of the United States flinging such insults at a former fellow White House official while in Japan is wrong. Doing so while also expressing affection for a North Korean murderer and dictator is disgusting.

We need a return to Cold War decorum in the conduct of presidential diplomacy. Leaders from the party of Reagan could take the lead in pressing for this return to thoughtful and ethical presidential conduct, especially while traveling abroad. If they don’t, then maybe voters in 2020 will be have to complete the task.

Amy Klobuchar Amy Jean KlobucharMeghan McCain to Amy Klobuchar: Leave my father 'out of presidential politics' 2020 Democrats jockey over surging college costs Democratic senator says McCain listed off names of dictators during Trump inaugural MORE (D-Minn.), a 2020 presidential candidate, is proposing changes to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) biofuel regulations that could help her win over support in Iowa.

Speaking at a campaign stop over the weekend in Iowa, the country's top corn producer, Klobuchar called for the EPA to give away fewer of its waivers that allow oil refineries to avoid mixing their fuel with ethanol, according to Reuters.

ADVERTISEMENT

The waivers, aimed at helping small refineries meet fuel standards, exempt some refineries from the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which requires oil refiners to blend ethanol with their gasoline pool or purchase credits from refiners that do.

Smaller refineries with a capacity of less than 75,000 barrels per day can obtain a waiver after proving that complying with the rule could cause financial stress. But ethanol groups and politicians representing corn-producing states have long called for the EPA to reconsider how it grants the waivers.

Klobuchar called the EPA’s waivers “misguided” and said the biofuels trading market is manipulated by financial institutions, according to Reuters.

She called for new compliance standards and oversight, a stance likely to drum up support from ethanol groups and leaders in Iowa, a key battleground state in the 2020 race.

Ethanol makers have long argued that too many companies qualify for waivers and that the process is not transparent. While the Trump administration has voiced support for the ethanol industry’s plea to extend the use of gas mixed with 15 percent ethanol year-round, it has also made extensive use of small refinery waivers. Even major companies like Exxon Mobil Corp received exemptions for certain facilities."
#Plant19 Still Has a Long Way to Go,https://www.agriculture.com,[],05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.agriculture.com/news/crops/plant19-still-has-a-long-way-to-go,"The nation’s corn and soybean farmers have a long way to go to wrap up #Plant19, according to USDA’s most recent Crop Progress Report, which shows that U.S. corn planting is just 58% complete – a gain of only 9% in the last week.

The report was released Tuesday – a day later than normal due to the Memorial Day Weekend. The report estimates planting and emergence progress through Sunday, May 26.

Corn

U.S. corn planting is just 58% complete, compared with 49% last week and the five-year average of 90%.

As of Sunday, corn planting was just 35%, 22%, and 76% complete in Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa, respectively – three states that account for the bulk of the nation’s corn crop. In the last five years, the crop in those states was 95%, 85%, and 96% complete by this time, signaling that farmers have a long way to go to get the 2019 crop in the ground.

Of the 18 key corn-producing states that USDA tracks in the weekly Crop Progress Report, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas are the furthest along, with 95%, 93%, and 93% of corn plantings complete.

USDA estimates that 32% of the 2019 crop has emerged, compared with 69% vs. the five-year average. Emergence in Illinois, Indiana. and Iowa are 20%, 10%, and 42%, compared with the five-year averages of 84%, 65%, and 77%.

Soybeans

If corn crop progress is behind, soybean planting is falling way back. Soybean plantings in the 18 states that represent 95% of the 2018 soybean acreage are only 29% complete, vs. the five-year average of 66%.

Iowa has 32% of its crop planted, well off the five-year pace of 77% and only a 5% improvement over the May 19 crop report. Illinois has just 14% of its crop planted, compared with 70% from 2014-18; and Indiana is just 11% complete, vs. its five-year average of 63%.

Only 11% of the nation’s crop has emerged, whereas the five-year average is 66%.

Wheat

The 2019 winter wheat harvest has kicked off in Texas, with combines rolling in central Texas.

The crop is 66% headed in key winter wheat producing states, vs. the five-year average of 76%. Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas lead the way in wheat-heading progress among major wheat-growing states, with 96%, 96%, and 84%, respectively. The crop is generally in good to excellent condition, with 61% of the nation’s crop earning those scores, compared with just 38% last year."
"DHS assessment of foreign VPN apps finds security risk real, data lacking",https://www.cyberscoop.com,['Sean Lyngaas'],05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.cyberscoop.com/dhs-mobile-vpn-apps-chris-krebs-ron-wyden/,"Written by Sean Lyngaas

The risk posed by foreign-made virtual private network (VPN) applications must be accounted for — even if government device users have avoided such apps — because adversaries are interested in exploiting the software, according to a senior Department of Homeland Security official.

“Open-source reporting indicates nation-state actors have demonstrated intent and capability to leverage VPN services and vulnerable users for malicious purposes,” Chris Krebs, director of DHS’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), wrote in a May 22 letter to Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., obtained by CyberScoop. There is no overarching U.S. policy preventing government mobile device users from downloading foreign VPN apps, according to Krebs.

“Even with the implementation of technical solutions, if a U.S. government employee downloaded a foreign VPN application originating from an adversary nation, foreign exploitation of that data would be somewhat or highly likely,” Krebs wrote. “This exploitation could lead to loss of data integrity and confidentiality of communications transmitted over the application.” Exposed phone data would likely include geolocation, contacts, and user history, he added.

There is no indication that foreign-made apps are widely used in the U.S. government, and there may not be any government-operated devices that have downloaded foreign VPN apps, Krebs wrote. But a lack of data leaves that question unanswered, and Krebs conceded that CISA had “limited visibility” on the usage. Moreover, it is unclear how widely deployed defensive measures such as sandboxing and application whitelisting are across government, according to Krebs.

The CISA director was replying to a February letter sent by Wyden and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., asking him for a security assessment of foreign VPN apps. The senators had expressed concern that some apps send a phone’s web-browsing data to servers in countries interested in targeting federal personnel. VPN providers promise to obfuscate the physical location of a web browser, but users are generally at the mercy of those companies’ decisions to collect and log data.

As evidence of the risk posed by foreign-made VPN apps, Krebs cited a November 2017 Russian law that allows the Russian government to access VPN providers based in Russia, and an advisory later that year from the Indian government warning that the Chinese government used popular Chinese mobile applications to collect user data.

“DHS has confirmed my fears: that using Chinese or Russian VPN services is essentially just taking your private data, wrapping it in a bow and then sending it directly to foreign spies in Beijing or Moscow,” Wyden told CyberScoop. “U.S government employees should not be using these apps, and I hope that DHS will take steps to prohibit their use on government-issued smartphones.”

CISA will continue to monitor the risk posed by foreign VPN apps and work with agencies to mitigate that risk through measures such as training and technical guidance, Krebs wrote.

DoJ Should Butt Out of the Qualcomm Case,https://www.eetimes.com,"['George Leopold', 'Brian Santo']",,,,https://www.eetimes.com/author.asp?section_id=36&doc_id=1334751,"By , 0

The United States Department of Justice, whose mission is to enforce the law and administer justice (however elusive) is meddling in an antitrust case in which a federal judge struck down the core of dominant wireless chip maker Qualcomm’s business model.

The landmark ruling issued earlier this month by U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh prohibits Qualcomm from cutting exclusive licensing deals. Judge Koh also decided Qualcomm must make key modem chip IP available under license to its chip rivals. The ruling comes as the rollout of 5G wireless technology emerges as a national security cause célèbre for the Trump administration that has effectively blacklisted 5G first-mover and modem chip also-ran Huawei.

DoJ Weighs in on FTC vs. Qcomm

“There is a sufficient likelihood that Qualcomm will hold monopoly power in the 5G modem chip market such that exclusive dealing agreements for the supply of modem chips could foreclose competition in that emerging market,” Judge Koh wrote.

Judge Lucy Koh is being pressured by the feds.

The Justice Department inappropriately sought to sway Koh’s ruling when it undertook the unusual and highly political step of filing a “statement of interest” that constitutes another shot across the bow of an independent American judiciary. Judge Koh was essentially being pressured to think twice before ruling against Qualcomm, which few would dispute has a stranglehold in the 5G modem chip market.

Not even mighty Intel Corp. is willing to take on Qualcomm in the 5G silicon race, exiting the market as soon as Qualcomm settled a cellular patent dispute with Apple last month. (Judge Koh’s ruling invalidates that deal.)

There was a time in conservative economic theory when the government kept its paws off of emerging markets. In those days, the government dared not pick “winners and losers.” Just as what is left of the Republican Party in the Trump era no longer cares about federal budget deficits, the bedrock principle of not favoring one corporation or technology over another has gone the way of the dodo bird.

It is widely assumed DoJ will keep up the pressure on Judge Koh to go easy on Qualcomm, citing U.S. national security concerns as the Trump Administration continues to target 5G competitor Huawei. In so doing, it reinforces a troubling pattern by politicizing the administration of justice. Mark A. Lemley, a law professor at Stanford University, hardly a bastion of antitrust fervor, told our Rick Merritt: “This is a very surprising move by the DOJ. It is extremely rare for them to interfere in the Federal Trade Commission’s cases.”

Back in the 1990s, we interviewed Huawei officials at its sprawling headquarters in Shenzhen. At the time, there was growing suspicion that Huawei had pilfered key networking technologies from its U.S. partner Cisco Systems. During our interview, Huawei managers sized us up, sticking with strictly technical subjects and the marketing spiels they had just learned to master.

Finally, we asked about the Cisco allegations. Interview over!

Huawei’s unwillingness to even address the IP theft issue was telling. We had hit a raw nerve. As the Trump administration targets Huawei, one cannot help but think the country standing for free enterprise and unprecedented technological innovation is behaving in much the same way as those Huawei bosses.

Justice Department meddling in the Federal Trade Commission case against Qualcomm isn’t just troubling. It threatens to undermine the rule of law and the principle of an independent judiciary.

From an antitrust standpoint, FTC actions are often about changing corporate behavior. A decade ago, Intel wisely settled when the agency alleged anticompetitive behavior. The chip maker moved on and the processor market continued to thrive.

Qualcomm can appeal Judge Koh’s ruling, as it promises to do. Fine. That’s how our judicial system works. Meantime, the Justice Department should butt out and let justice takes its course.

Emails show Trump EPA overruled career staff on Wisconsin air pollution,https://www.reuters.com,"['Timothy Gardner', 'Min Read']",05-29-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-epa-smog/emails-show-trump-epa-overruled-career-staff-on-wisconsin-air-pollution-idUSKCN1SY2BP,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Politically appointed U.S. environmental officials last year overruled concerns of career scientists about air pollution in a Wisconsin county where U.S. President Donald Trump has pushed for a factory to be built by Foxconn Technology Co, newly released internal emails show.

FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump (C) takes part in a groundbreaking with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker (L) and Foxconn Chairman Terry Gou during a visit to Foxconn's new site in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, U.S., June 28, 2018. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque

Trump has been a supporter of the Taiwanese technology giant Foxconn building a flat screen factory in Racine County Wisconsin, a project the company said could create up to 13,000 jobs. He announced the project at a ceremony in 2017 and has claimed it is proof of his ability to revive U.S. manufacturing. Former Wisconsin governor Scott Walker, a Republican, helped secure about $4 billion in tax breaks for the project.

But Racine County has suffered some of the state’s worst cases of smog, also known as ozone, pollution that causes premature deaths from lung and heart complications.

The emails obtained by the Sierra Club and Clean Wisconsin under a freedom of information request show Trump administration officials, including then-administrator Scott Pruitt, overruled career EPA scientists to exempt Racine County from a list of counties that break smog standards. That has freed Foxconn from having to make millions of dollars in pollution control devices, if the project is eventually built.

The Racine County case is latest example of the administration overlooking concerns flagged by agency scientists over other issues such as climate change or hazardous chemicals.

“My background is in air pollution health effects and more specifically on acute exposures, so for me personally this is hard to digest and support,” Lars Perlmutt, an EPA scientist, wrote to colleagues in an April email last year about pressure to make the exemption, one of the emails shows.

Jenny Liljegren, a scientist in the air and radiation division in EPA’s Midwest region, said she was “in disbelief” about the pressure from officials to make the exemptions. “I do not see a sound technical basis for the areas we are being directed to finalize in Wisconsin.”

In an exchange of emails with Liljegren, another EPA scientist, Eric Svingen, complained that Wisconsin “cherry picked” air quality data over wider areas of the state to suggest that emissions that form smog were not ultimately doing so within the Wisconsin borders.

“These emails show is that the political leadership appeared to be injecting itself in this process in a way that’s contrary to having fact-based decisions,” said Janet McCabe, head of air quality at the EPA under former President Barack Obama.

Foxconn did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In April the company, an Apple Inc supplier, said it was committed to its contract to build the flat screen plant and research facilities in Wisconsin.

EPA spokesman Michael Abboud referred questions about the emails to a brief the agency filed May 10 in the case. The brief said that EPA considers a wide range of information in deciding which areas are in compliance with air pollution rules and that “each designation is intensely fact-driven.”

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Illinois, which neighbors Wisconsin and could see greater levels of pollution, sued the EPA last year over the exemption in Racine County and the agency is also under pressure from lawsuits from environmental groups.

In the May 10 brief, the EPA asked a federal appeals court to take another look at the smog exemption decisions under Pruitt, but until the court makes any ruling companies do not have to purchase the pollution equipment."
Department of Homeland Security Detains Miami Activist at Homestead Facility for Migrant Children UPDATED,https://www.miaminewtimes.com,['Brittany Shammas'],05-27-2019,2019,5,https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/homestead-shelter-for-migrant-children-alessandra-mondolfi-detained-by-homeland-security-11181156,"Alessandra Mondolfi was painting hearts on a poster board outside the Homestead child migrant camp last Friday when she spotted a pair of law enforcement officers walking toward her. An artist and activist who's part of a group of protesters maintaining a daily presence outside the facility, Mondolfi was working on a memorial to migrant children who have died in custody. ""Here they come,"" one of the other activists said as the officers approached.

The two men — one in a Department of Homeland Security police uniform, the other in plainclothes — asked Mondolfi her name, then pushed her against a car and cuffed her, she says. They then allegedly put her in the back of a car and questioned her for about an hour, asking, bizarrely, whether she had aliases or a neck tattoo, and if she knew the names of the other protesters. Then, about an hour after first approaching Mondolfi, the officers let her go.

Days later, it's still unclear why she was detained. DHS did not respond to a request for comment. Mondolfi says the Miami-Dade Police Department and, weirdly, the Miami-Dade Schools Police, sent squad cars to the scene. The El Paso Police Department has a warrant out for Mondolfi's arrest over a protest she and other activists held at the U.S. Border Patrol Museum. But why would DHS be involved in a city-level case?

Mondolfi has a theory for why she was detained: It was done to rattle her after months of protesting. She notes it was her group that spotted John Kelly — former Homeland Security chief and White House chief of staff under President Donald Trump — touring the Homestead shelter last month, around the same time congresswomen were being denied entry. Soon after Kelly's visit became public, CBS News confirmed he had joined the board of Caliburn International, the for-profit company that runs the place.

""They are trying to scare me, intimidate me,"" Mondolfi says.

Her detainment comes amidst a series of instances of the government watching and prosecuting protesters. Earlier this year, the Intercept revealed that DHS had monitored anti-family separation protests held across the country, treating them as if they were security threats. A contractor working with the agency reviewed demonstrations across South Florida, from West Palm Beach to Miami. The information was shared with DHS and state-level law enforcement.

Meanwhile, two University of Arizona students were arrested in late March for protesting the appearance of Customs and Border Protection officers. The Arizona Republic reported they were among people who stood outside the event calling the officials “murderers” and “an extension of the KKK.” A group of protesters followed the agents as they left the presentation, calling them ""Murder Patrol."" Anti-Dakota Access Pipeline protesters have also been arrested.

At the Homestead shelter, another protester was detained on April 24. That day, MDPD officers handcuffed a New York man named Joshua Rubin and put him in the back of a squad car. Rubin said the cops told him he was being stopped on suspicion of trespassing. He refused to give them his name, he said, because he was on a county road. Eventually he identified himself and was released. MDPD told New Times it had no record of Rubin's detainment.

""You have to expect, when you're protesting, that people are going to try and get you to go away,"" said Rubin, who for months held a one-man vigil outside a camp for migrant teenagers in Texas. ""But the extent to which it's happening here is more extreme.""

Mondolfi says Homeland Security officers began showing up at the facility several weeks ago. When the two men approached her last Friday, they asked for her ID, but it was in her car. She says she asked to go get it, but instead ended up being questioned in the back of a police car. The MDPD and schools police cars showed up.

Daisy Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for Miami-Dade County Public Schools, tells New Times there is no record of a call for service on that date, and questioned whether a photo provided by protesters was actually taken on the date in question. After publication, she said a school officer responded after the Department of Homeland Security ""put out an emergency call for back-up."" When the officer arrived, the situation had already been handled, so he cleared the incident without taking action. MDPD did not respond to a request for information.

For her part, Mondolfi says she hasn't been back to the shelter since the day she was detained.

""I am not in Homestead; I have not been all week,"" she says. ""I'm not able to do the work that I'm doing. And I am scared, which is all the things they want. They want you to be scared, they want you to be intimidated... and at this point, they're winning, and that's angering me."""

TRI-CITIES (WJHL) - The United States Department of Labor has accepted a letter from the USDA, saying the Forest Service will withdraw from operating Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers (CCC).

According to a release from the U.S. Labor Department, ""this action creates an opportunity to serve a greater number of students at higher performing centers at a lower cost to taxpayers by modernizing and reforming part of the Job Corps program.""

The USDA says the mission for CCCs is to ""train eligible youth, ages 16 to 24 with educational, social and vocational skills, while assisting in the conservation of the Nation's public natural resources.""

A review was performed at all CCCs going over outcome measurements, internal controls, ongoing needs, and other items.

According to the department, 16 centers will continue under a new contract operator or partnership.

Trump climbs into a sumo ring to present a 60-pound ‘President’s Cup’ in highlight of Japan trip,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Ashley Parker', 'White House Reporter', 'Simon Denyer', 'Tokyo Bureau Chief Covering Japan', 'North Korea', 'South Korea.']",05-26-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-presents-gilded-presidents-cup-to-sumo-champion-in-a-highlight-of-his-japan-trip/2019/05/26/fca43394-7e37-11e9-8bb7-0fc796cf2ec0_story.html,"Finally, after a full day of matches, perhaps the biggest star of all — weighing in at 243 pounds, according to his most recent physical — climbed into the sumo ring.

President Trump stepped into the dohyo shortly after 5:30 p.m. Sunday to present the “President’s Cup” — a roughly 4½ -foot, more than 60-pound trophy that served as a physical manifestation of the gilded, ceremonial nature of Trump’s four-day trip here.

The president seemed to enjoy his low-key star turn at Ryogoku Kokugikan stadium, exclaiming afterward, “That was an incredible evening at sumo.”

“Sumo wrestling,” he marveled later.

[Trump is presenting a sumo trophy in Japan. France beat him to it nearly 20 years ago.]

Trump took in just five matches — some lasting but several seconds — alongside Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Sunday evening. But he spent the morning putting on a show of his own; at roughly 7:30 a.m. local time, the president fired off a tweet that, in a single social media missive, undercut his national security adviser, reaffirmed his ties with a dictator and attacked a domestic political rival on foreign soil, while misspelling the rival’s name.

“North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me,” Trump wrote, in a second tweet that corrected his initial misspelling of former vice president Joe Biden’s last name. “I have confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me, & also smiled when he called Swampman Joe Biden a low IQ individual, & worse. Perhaps that’s sending me a signal?”

Less than a day earlier, Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, had argued the opposite to reporters here, warning there is “no doubt” North Korea’s missile tests violated United Nations Security Council resolutions and adding that Trump was determined to maintain sanctions pressure on the regime until it backs down.

In a conference call with reporters before Trump departed for Japan, a senior administration official had promised a “substantive” trip, with “some substantive things to announce.” But until the president made news with his impromptu tweet Sunday morning, Trump’s appearance at the sumo championship seemed to be one of the main events of his visit.

Indeed, Trump spent his first full day in Japan largely as a tourist. Earlier in the day, the president and Abe had played golf at Mobara Country Club in Chiba — complete with selfies and double cheeseburgers made with U.S. beef — and after the sumo championship, the two leaders and their wives headed for dinner of traditional Japanese grilled fare known as robatayaki. (The menu seemed specifically designed for Trump’s generally bland tastes — a five-course meal that included buttered potatoes, grilled chicken, Wagyu beef with vegetables and vanilla ice cream).

Trump’s planned appearance at the sumo match was relatively restrained for a president who became a household name as a reality TV star and often seems to thrive amid chaos and even encourage it. Gone were his days as a World Wrestling Entertainment personality who, in 2007, clotheslined WWE Chairman Vince McMahon and faux-pounded him, ringside, before shaving him bald in a viral pay-per-view moment.

Instead, Trump entered the sumo ring after donning slippers — no shoes are allowed in the dohyo — and read from a scroll, the “certificate of commemoration” in honor of the 25-year-old victor, Asanoyama.

“In honor of your outstanding achievement as sumo grand champion, I hereby award you the President’s Cup,” Trump said.

A sumo official helped him lift the heavy cup and hand it to Asanoyama, who bowed several times. The president shook his hand, clapped, at one point bowed slightly himself, and exited the ring.

Perhaps the most dramatic moment of Trump’s award presentation came before the president was even onstage; the silver trophy — which features an eagle atop it, wings high, and which was displayed Sunday afternoon to some fanfare in the lobby of the hotel where the president is staying — was brought out draped in white cloth, and the crowd gasped when its covering was removed.

Jaime Tiktin, 54, a tourist from Mexico City, said it was a “strange surprise” to learn that Trump would be attending the sumo match. Tiktin said he read in the Japan Times that the Japanese “kind of made up this prize to make him feel good,” but he noted that Trump seemed subdued.

“He didn’t smile at all; he didn’t do any gestures,” Tiktin said. “It was kind of strange to see him not moving his lips at all.”

Tiktin and his wife — who came bearing a homemade “Viva Mexico” sign — said they are not fans of Trump because of the way he has treated Mexicans, but they added that Trump was apparently trying to abide by sumo protocol. “I think he was being respectful,” Tiktin said. “I hate to say that, but I think he was respectful.”

In the run-up to the sumo championship, Trump prompted some griping among the Japanese. Some were annoyed that he and his wife, Melania, received special treatment and were allowed to sit in chairs close to the ring. Normally, attendees on the lower levels sit on cushions, called zabutons, and VIPs opt for seats on the second floor designed specifically for them. There was also concern the president’s entourage and large security detail would take away seats from Japanese sumo fans.

One widely shared article in the Japanese news media pointed out that the Japan Sumo Association is happy to follow many anachronistic traditions, such as forbidding women from standing in the ring. The article asked rhetorically, “Is not it against their traditions to let Trump sit on a seat by the ring and wear slippers into the ring to present his cup?” (Sumo wrestlers fight barefoot, though slippers were an acceptable alternative to shoes for Trump.)

The zabutons — which spectators often throw into the air to cheer or show their dissatisfaction after a spectacular match — also posed a potential security headache. Sankei, a Japanese daily, even featured a story, complete with a photo of a flying zabuton, headlined, “Mr. Trump to watch the final day matches. Fear of zabuton.”

But in the end, Trump proved more a curiosity than a nuisance, the mere mention of his name almost invariably prompting giggles among the spectators.

“He’s a crazy guy, yeah?” said Ryugo Kato, 45, a Tokyo resident.

Kato said he thought Trump should have sat on the floor if he wanted to be close to the ring. “That’s the way this place is set up,” Kato said. “He should respect the custom. It’s the culture.”

Nonetheless, he also welcomed Trump to the match. “If he wants to come, fine,” Kato said. “There’s nothing wrong with watching the sport and paying some respect to Japan’s national sport.”

Asanoyama, for his part, seemed to be a potential Trump convert. According to Nikkan Sports, in an interview Saturday, the champion said, “I am going to check Wikipedia for Trump-san,” apparently to be better prepared.

By Sunday, asked after his victory about being the first person to receive the “President’s Cup,” Asanoyama was emotional.

“I was overjoyed,” he said. “It was almost too much to say in words.”

47 States Call On Betsy Devos To Forgive Student Loans For Disabled Veterans,https://www.npr.org,['Cat Schuknecht'],05-25-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/25/727002406/47-states-call-on-betsy-devos-to-forgive-student-loans-for-disabled-veterans,"47 States Call On Betsy Devos To Forgive Student Loans For Disabled Veterans

Enlarge this image toggle caption Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images

Updated Sunday at 2:14 p.m. ET

On Friday, three days before Memorial Day, attorneys general for 47 states wrote to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos asking her to automatically forgive student loans for eligible disabled veterans.

The Department of Education has identified more than 42,000 veterans who qualify for a federal program known as Total and Permanent Disability Discharge, or TPD, that offers to relieve borrowers from repaying certain government student loans. These veterans, the letter says, shoulder over $1 billion in education debt that could be forgiven.

To get the benefit, veterans must first apply for the program. According to information obtained by the group Veterans Education Success through a Freedom of Information Act request, almost 60 percent of eligible veterans had defaulted on a loan payment as of April 2018. Yet only about 20 percent had applied to the loan forgiveness program.

The attorneys general want that to change. In the letter — which was also signed by attorneys general for the District of Columbia and three U.S. territories — they propose making the forgiveness program automatic for veterans who have been identified by the Department of Education.

""As a nation, we have a moral obligation to assist those who have put their lives on the line to defend us,"" the letter reads. ""There is no statutory or legal requirement that the Department of Education demand that eligible veterans affirmatively apply for TPD discharges before the Department will forgive their loans.""

In a statement to NPR, the Education Department said it recognized the sacrifices that veterans make for their country, adding that it has worked to streamline the TPD discharge process.

""While we have worked to make this process as easy and as seamless as possible for veterans, the last thing we want to do is cause unintended consequences for them,"" according to the statement.

The department said discharges could raise veterans' tax bills or inhibit them from taking out more student loans.

In their letter to DeVos, the attorneys general dismissed the department's concern about increasing borrowers' tax bills.

""[F]ederal tax law now excludes loan discharges for disabled borrowers from taxable income, and most states' tax codes do likewise,"" said the letter. ""Moreover, we think it likely that most borrowers would prefer to have one hundred percent of their outstanding loans discharged, even if this resulted in an increase to their state tax bill.""

The letter from the attorneys general follows at least two other similar letters that Republican and Democratic members of Congress sent to DeVos last year."
Mark Meadows views fresh 'Strzok coverup' material at DOJ,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-24-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/mark-meadows-views-fresh-strzok-coverup-material-at-doj,"Rep. Mark Meadows said he was at the Justice Department to review new information about former FBI agent Peter Strzok.

The North Carolina Republican was spotted at Justice Department headquarters in D.C. with Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, on Thursday.

Asked by a reporter why he was there, Meadows said, ""I was reviewing text messages and new correspondence that pertains to the Strzok coverup.""

Hours after their visit, President Trump gave Attorney General William Barr ""full and complete authority to declassify information"" related to the origins of the federal investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.

Meadows and Jordan's visit to the Justice Department also comes after House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes said he learned that an August 2016 text from Strzok about an ""insurance policy"" had to do with the FBI's use of an unverified dossier compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele to obtain Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants to wiretap Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

Strzok was the lead investigator of the Hillary Clinton emails inquiry and opened the counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia in the summer of 2016.

Text messages between Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, in which they displayed a negative opinion of Trump, were uncovered over the course of the Justice Department's inspector general investigation into the DOJ and FBI's conduct during the investigation into Hillary Clinton's unauthorized private email server.

The report, which came out in the summer of 2018, said their text messages ""potentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations. But the inspector general determined that there was no evidence “improper considerations, including political bias, directly affected the specific investigative decisions.""

Both Strzok and Lisa Page, who are no longer with the FBI, have been a focus of GOP investigators concerned about potential bias within the Justice Department and FBI."

USDA staffers quit en masse as Trump administration eyes moving offices out of DC,https://www.foxnews.com,"[""Andrew O'Reilly""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/usda-staffers-quit-en-masse-as-trump-administration-eyes-moving-offices-out-of-dc,"Employees at the U.S. Department of Agriculture are quitting at a rapid clip as Secretary Sonny Perdue prepares to move forward with plans to relocate two offices far outside the Washington, D.C., Beltway.

Federal employees at the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) – two small but important agencies within the USDA – are unhappy with Perdue’s plan, announced last August, to move the majority of their staff from current offices in the capital to an area closer the country’s agricultural centers.

“This move does not serve a public purpose,” Peter Winch, a representative for the American Federation of Government Employees, a union that represents ERS workers, told Fox News. “Employees don’t want to move, and it doesn’t make sense for them to move.”

US FARMERS HURT BY TRADE WAR GETTING $16 BILLION BOOST, US AGRICULTURE SECRETARY SAYS

Winch added that since ERS employees joined AFGE earlier this month, six employees have already quit their jobs with the government agency in response to the planned move. He said overall staffing is down to 209 from 300 during the Obama administration.

A Washington Post report cited an estimate that the ERS used to see roughly one “non-retirement” departure per month – but that pace has doubled since October. NIFA reportedly has also seen people leave.

Perdue said in a statement to Fox News that the move was meant “to improve performance and the services these agencies provide.” The secretary of agriculture added that the planned move would bring the department’s scientists closer to “stakeholders” and “customers” such as Midwest farmers.

“It’s been our goal to make USDA the most effective, efficient, and customer-focused department in the entire federal government,” Perdue said. “We don’t undertake these relocations lightly, and we are doing it to improve performance and the services these agencies provide.”

Perdue added: “We will be placing important USDA resources closer to many stakeholders, most of whom live and work far from Washington, D.C. We will be saving money for the taxpayers and improving our ability to retain more employees in the long run.”

The goal of the ERS, however, is to provide statistical information to lawmakers in Washington, while NIFA works to fund hundreds of millions of dollar annually in research in the agricultural sector.

HISTORIC FLOODS IN MIDWEST HAVE FARMERS WORRIED ABOUT THEIR FUTURE

Congressional Democrats are scrambling to try and block the move.

“This parochial idea of, like, ‘Washington messes everything up. Let’s move it out of town’ overlooks the important role that this agency plays,” Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-Maine, a member of the House Agriculture Committee, told The Washington Post. “There’s just a heightened level of concern about this administration, generally, about data collection and science.”

Critics, including former USDA officials, say the move would weaken the agencies, reduce their influence with lawmakers and provide little benefit to the farming community.

Winch argued that weakening the agencies' influence in Washington is at least part of the point. The NIFA funds grants that go into researching the effects the agriculture sector has on climate change – which the Trump administration has tried to downplay – and Perdue was allegedly upset by NIFA’s policy to support LGBT members of the 4-H youth farming organization.

The president’s 2020 budget has also proposed slashing funding to ERS research from $87 million to $61 million and cutting 160 jobs, while Perdue has suggested moving the agency from under the USDA’s science arm to being supervised by the USDA’s chief economist, a political wing of the department.

“There is some sort of punitive motivation,” Winch said. “Someone has made a negative judgment about these agencies.”

Perdue and his staff have narrowed the list of places where the two agencies could go down to three from an original 130 -- with Kansas City, the state of Indiana and North Carolina’s research triangle in the Raleigh-Durham area on the shortlist. St. Louis, Mo., and Madison, Wis., are two alternate locations.

Perdue is expected to make the announcement of where the agencies will move as soon as Friday, but it remains unclear whether the two agencies will actually leave Washington.

The USDA’s own inspector general is currently looking into whether Perdue has the legal authority to move these agencies, while the House Appropriations Committee’s draft bill of agricultural appropriations, which was released earlier this week, prohibits the USDA from using funds to move agencies outside of the Washington area. Trump’s 2020 budget proposal wants $15.5 million to relocate ERS and $9.5 million to relocate NIFA.

“We continue to believe that the USDA lacks the legal authority to carry out this proposal,” Rep. Steny H. Hoyer, D-Md., and Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., said in a statement earlier this spring. “However, even if it had such authority, USDA has not done the proper analysis of the cost and benefits, and this proposal will harm agriculture research and our constituents.”"
Explainer: Will China dump U.S. bonds as a trade weapon? Not so fast,https://www.reuters.com,"['Richard Leong', 'Min Read']",05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-bonds-explainer/explainer-will-china-dump-u-s-bonds-as-a-trade-weapon-not-so-fast-idUSKCN1SY0BS,"(Reuters) - The trade war between Beijing and Washington has stoked concern in financial markets that China might opt to weaponize its holdings of more than $1.1 trillion worth of U.S. Treasuries in retaliation for the tariffs the Trump administration has imposed on Chinese imports.

FILE PHOTO: A worker gestures as a crane lifts goods for export onto a cargo vessel at a port in Lianyungang, Jiangsu province, China February 13, 2019. REUTERS/Stringer/File Photo

Often referred to as the “nuclear option,” choosing to dump so large a pool of assets would likely destabilize world financial markets, drive interest rates higher and push tensions between the world’s two largest economies into uncharted territory.

China has been slimming its Treasury securities portfolio for some time, but most analysts see an aggressive reduction of its holdings as a remote possibility at most. There is no evidence Beijing is seriously looking to flood markets with its U.S. bonds.

Here are some key points about China’s Treasuries portfolio:

HOW MUCH U.S. DEBT DOES CHINA OWN?

About a decade ago, China overtook Japan as the largest foreign holder of U.S. government debt.

Its holdings stood at more than $1.12 trillion at the end of March, according to U.S. Treasury department data. Japan is a close second with nearly $1.08 trillion.

China’s holdings peaked in late 2013 at nearly $1.32 trillion and have come down by about 15% since then. In March they were the lowest in about two years.

Its share of the Treasury market has fallen even faster, due to the steady issuance of U.S. debt required to finance the growing federal budget deficit.

The world’s second biggest economy owns about 7% of the $16.18 trillion of U.S. public debt outstanding, its lowest share in 14 years, and down from a peak of 14% in 2011. Still, its slice of the pie is exceeded only by the U.S. Federal Reserve, which owns $2.15 trillion of Treasuries, or 13.5% of the market.

Treasury issuance is expected to keep accelerating following a massive tax cut enacted in December 2017, so China’s share of the market will likely drop even further.

WHY DOES CHINA OWN SO MUCH U.S. DEBT?

As a net exporter to the United States and the rest of the world, China has the world’s largest stash of foreign-exchange reserves at more than $3 trillion. Much of that is denominated in U.S. dollars accumulated through its persistent trade surplus with the United States since the early 1990s.

A natural place for China to park a lot of those greenbacks is the U.S. Treasury market, which is by far the largest and most liquid pool of safe assets in the world.

Also, since the financial crisis of 2007-2009, U.S. Treasuries have consistently yielded more than bonds issued by other large developed economies such as Japan and Germany, which has been another lure.

WHAT IS THE RISK TO THE UNITED STATES IF CHINA SELLS?

Most analysts agree that large-scale selling by Beijing would disrupt the Treasury market and other markets.

An abrupt shift in the balance of supply and demand could drive down Treasury prices, and drive up their yields, which move in the opposition direction to prices. That would cause a spike in borrowing costs for the U.S. government.

Also, because Treasury yields are a benchmark for U.S. consumer and business credit, interest rates on everything from corporate bonds to homeowners’ mortgages would rise, likely slowing the economy.

Such a jarring move would also erode global investors’ confidence in the U.S. dollar as the world’s top reserve currency.

WHAT IS THE RISK TO CHINA IF IT DUMPS TREASURIES?

Most analysts argue China has not opted to sell Uncle Sam’s IOUs because a nosedive in U.S. bond prices also would bring down the value of China’s remaining Treasury holdings.

Also, China’s currency, the yuan, is not fully free floating. Beijing uses its Treasury holdings as a key tool to stabilize the yuan within a targeted range, against the dollar in particular.

Some critics have alleged China uses Treasuries and its other currency reserves to hold down the yuan, making its exports more attractive. At the same time, allowing the currency to cheapen too much risks other problems, such as foreign capital flight.

Any sharp depreciation in the greenback might force Beijing to defend the yuan, which may mean shedding more of its Treasuries stake. Back in 2016, China’s Treasuries holdings fell sharply by some $200 billion from May to November of that year as the yuan depreciated on worries about the Chinese economy.

Lastly, any knock-on effect in the U.S. economy would also be felt in China because the United States is the destination for nearly a fifth of Chinese exports."

For those who enjoy heading south of the border for vacations, the U.S. Department of State has updated travel warnings for Mexican states where tourists are more vulnerable to crime.

Ahead of Memorial Day weekend, the Mexican state of Tamaulipas - which borders south Texas - is on the list of Do Not Travel states because of high crime and possible kidnapping.

Violent crime, such as murder, armed robbery, carjacking, kidnapping, extortion, and sexual assault, is common in the state.

RELATED: Scenes from cartel violence and the drug war in Mexico in 2019

The first quarter of 2019 set a new record for homicides in Mexico, where violent crime has claimed more than 250,000 lives since 2006, according to the Associated press.

The State Department cautioned people on where not to go and also offered tips on how to avoid becoming a victim.

The Mexico Travel Advisory is divided into four levels of caution from the least dangerous – the ""exercise normal precautions"" list, to the most dangerous – the ""do not travel"" list.

Rekor Systems Selected by Department of Defense to Provide Automatic License Plate Recognition Software,https://finance.yahoo.com,[],05-28-2019,2019,5,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rekor-systems-selected-department-defense-130000103.html,"DoD selects Rekor's vehicle recognition system solution, powered by industry leading OpenALPR software; purchases 200 licenses to turn existing IP cameras into automatic license plate readers

CHANTILLY, VA / ACCESSWIRE / May 28, 2019 / Rekor Systems, Inc. (REKR) (''Rekor'') announced today it has been selected by the Department of Defense (DoD) to provide automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) solutions. The contract with the DoD is for the purchase of 200 licenses to use Rekor's machine learning-enabled vehicle recognition system, powered by our industry-leading OpenALPR software.

''We are pleased to be selected by the DoD to provide vehicle recognition systems. Our systems are easy to integrate and highly scalable, making them an ideal solution to enhance security and surveillance operations,'' said Robert A. Berman, President and CEO of Rekor. ''Selection by the world's preeminent defense department is a great validation of our technology and one we are proud of. We look forward to working with the DoD to support their important work, and to further showcase the power of our solutions.''

Rekor's OpenALPR software enables automatic license plate and vehicle recognition through virtually any IP camera. Its industry-leading artificial intelligence-based solutions can be hosted locally or in the cloud. Enabled by machine learning from its robust and growing database covering over 60 countries, OpenALPR software can identify in real time vehicle license plate data, color, make, model and body type.

Rather than buying expensive cameras that take weeks or months to ship and install, Rekor's OpenALPR software can be deployed to any existing IP camera immediately. This can represent a potential substantial savings per camera, as well as greater flexibility to expand or decrease usage as needed without large capital expenditures on hardware. It also eliminates the need for two separate cameras, one for LPR functionality and one for general surveillance recording. Rekor's solution can be used to collect license plate data and information such as the make, model, and color of a vehicle using the same camera that provides surveillance monitoring.

''The fact that Rekor's solution can be deployed to any existing IP camera is extremely attractive in the defense sector, particularly where cameras may already be set up for surveillance and the installation of new hardware might prove difficult due to time constraints or location in harsh or remote terrains,'' Berman continued. ''The flexibility of our SaaS model also allows for the easy integration of additional cameras if they are needed in a hurry, rather than having to wait for hardware to be shipped and installed. It provides valuable new capabilities within the defense sector.''

The Justice Department has hit WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange with Espionage Act charges, escalating a legal fight against the high-profile activist and alarming press freedom activists.

DOJ had previously only indicted Assange on a single count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. Thursday’s revelation of the additional 18 charges, filed in the Eastern District of Virginia, means Assange could face significantly more prison time if found guilty.

The alleged Espionage Act violations relate to Assange’s complicity with Chelsea Manning, a former U.S. Army soldier who was convicted in July 2013 of violating the Espionage Act after she shuttled troves of classified government information to WikiLeaks. Officials said Assange solicited the information from and then brazenly published details that put the government's human sources at risk, disregarding explicit warnings from the government.

Traditionally, the Espionage Act has been used against government officials, like Manning, who reveal such classified information, rather than the journalists or foreign nationals who publish the information.

As a result, the use of the Espionage Act against Assange set off alarm bells among press freedom activists on Thursday. While WikiLeaks isn’t a conventional news organization, press advocates have long feared that charging Assange for the publication of government secrets could open the door to prosecuting reporters for doing the same.

""Any government use of the Espionage Act to criminalize the receipt and publication of classified information poses a dire threat to journalists seeking to publish such information in the public interest, irrespective of the Justice Department’s assertion that Assange is not a journalist,"" said Bruce Brown, executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, in a statement.

Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who also touched off a debate about the media's role in publishing secret files when he leaked classified information to reporters in 2013, proclaimed: “the Department of Justice just declared war – not on Wikileaks, but on journalism itself.”

John Demers, head of DOJ’s national security division, pushed back at that argument on Thursday, insisting Assange is “not a journalist,” and alleging that the WikiLeaks founder “purposely published names he knew to be confidential human sources in warzones.”

It's a debate that Justice Department officials have grappled with for years. The Obama administration previously looked into bringing similar charges against Assange, but decided against it.

“We didn’t bring this [Espionage Act] case for a couple of reasons,"" said Matt Miller, an Obama-era DOJ spokesman. ""First, we thought it was a dangerous precedent to prosecute Assange for something that reporters do all the time. We didn’t believe Assange was a journalist, but the Espionage Act doesn’t make any distinction between journalists and others, so if you can apply it to Assange, there’s no real reason you couldn’t apply it to [The New York Times]. Second, and it’s related, it’s not at all clear that charging someone with the publication of classified information could survive court scrutiny.”

Assange’s legal case took off in April after Ecuador revoked its seven-year asylum, forcing him out of the embassy in London and paving the way for his extradition to the United States for one of the biggest ever leaks of classified information. Justice Department officials said they could not comment on how this might affect Assange’s extradition from the U.K. to the U.S.

Among Thursday's charges are three counts that Assange violated the Espionage Act, which prohibits the disclosure of national defense information. The Justice Department alleged that Assange published select State Department cables that contained the unredacted names of human sources in Iran, China and Syria. He also published Afghan activity reports and Iraq activity reports that endangered local Afghans and Iraqis, prosecutors alleged.

“It was explicitly stated in the State Department cables that the identity of sources was to be protected,” a Justice Department official told reporters on Thursday. “Assange was warned by the State Department not to release the names but he did so nevertheless.”

However, the government has not identified any individuals who were directly killed a result of Assange's disclosures. The U.S. counterintelligence official who led the Pentagon's review of the bombshell leaks told a court during Manning’s sentencing hearing in 2013 that investigators had not been able to find any such instances.

Still, Zach Terwilliger, the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, stressed that the government was “not charging Assange for passively obtaining classified information.” Rather, he is being prosecuted for publishing “a narrow set of classified documents in which Assange also published the names of innocent people who risked their safety” to help the United States.

“Assange is not charged simply because he is a publisher,” Terwilliger told reporters on Thursday.

Prosecutors said Manning had contacted Assange as early as November 2009, responding ""to Assange’s solicitation of classified information made through the WikiLeaks website."" The appeal included a “Military and Intelligence Most Wanted Leaks” category that solicited CIA detainee interrogation videos.

Assange also encouraged Manning to transfer him Guantanamo Bay detainee assessment briefs in March 2010, according to chats obtained by the government, as well as Iraq rule of engagement files and 75,000 Afghanistan war-related significant activity reports.

John Brown, the FBI assistant director for counterintelligence, said the indictment was “the result of nearly a decade” of work.

The original Assange indictment, brought in March 2018 and unsealed in April of this year, charged the WikiLeaks founder with conspiring with Manning to hack a government computer to obtain hundreds of thousands of U.S. military reports about U.S. wars in the Middle East. WikiLeaks later published the leaked information.

Assange faces up to 10 years in prison on each count.

Manning was jailed in March after being held in contempt by a judge in Virginia for refusing to testify before a grand jury about Assange. She is still in prison, and DOJ officials would not comment on her situation on Thursday.

USDA to shift some inspector tasks to pork plant workers — in everything but name,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Kimberly Kindy', 'National Investigative Reporter', 'Kimberly Kindy Is A National Investigative Reporter For The Washington Post.

The Agriculture Department is attempting to make the most dramatic changes to federal meat-inspection policy since Congress passed a 1906 landmark law that seized control of food safety from plant owners and made it the province of federal inspectors. (Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News)

At a Smithfield hog plant in central Illinois, federal meat inspectors examine pig carcasses on the slaughter line, remove diseased and contaminated meat, and mark it “condemned.” They have the exclusive responsibility for performing this work.

At another hog plant about 75 miles away, JBS USA Food Co. employees are part of a long-running test program in which they perform tasks similar to those done by federal inspectors. When plant employees do this food safety work, the U.S. Department of Agriculture says they are “sorting” and “removing” or “disposing” of the meat, not inspecting or condemning it.

The shift in language is central to the USDA’s efforts to make the most dramatic changes to federal meat-inspection policy since Congress passed a 1906 landmark law that seized control of food safety from plant owners and made it the province of federal inspectors.

The proposed new inspection system transfers some responsibilities that traditionally have been handled by USDA inspectors to employees of pork plants. The USDA says it has studied the new inspection system for 20 years and that pork products from the test plants are at least as safe as those produced by traditional inspection. They say federal inspectors will spend less time visually assessing pork and more time ensuring sanitary conditions are maintained throughout the plant.

Several food safety lawyers, Democratic members of Congress and a former agriculture official say that the USDA is using sleight-of-hand tactics to get around legal mandates that have been in place for more than a century. Those mandates require federal regulators to inspect — and either pass or condemn — every live hog that arrives at a slaughterhouse and every hog carcass on the slaughter line.

“They are playing these linguistics games,” said Rena Steinzor, a food safety expert who teaches law at the University of Maryland. “What they are doing is illegal. If they have a problem with the statute because they think it’s a waste of energy for federal inspectors to eyeball every single animal, they could go to Congress. . . . The Constitution requires them to do that, not gut the law by regulation.”

The test hog-inspection program is expected to expand this summer after the agency approves new rules. Certain pork plants would have the option of using the new inspection system. Thirty-five plants plan to join the five test plants in using the new program; they would produce 90 percent of the pork consumed in the United States.

The number of federal inspectors on hog slaughter lines at the plants new to the program will be reduced from 365 to 218, a 40 percent cut, according to a USDA analysis published in the Federal Register. The overall number of inspectors at those plants will drop from 400 to 288, a decline of 28 percent, according to figures provided by the USDA.

The new rules will allow slaughter-line speeds to run as fast as the plant desires. The current cap on line speed is 1,106 hogs per hour, or 18 per minute.

Records show there have been no serious public health problems or pork food poisoning outbreaks linked to the test plants. Critics of the test plants say they have more food safety problems than the traditional plants; the USDA disputes that.

A half-dozen food safety groups, along with the USDA inspectors’ union, say they are concerned that increased line speeds and federal staff reductions on those lines will cause diseased and contaminated meat to slip by the remaining inspectors. They also cite an inherent conflict of interest among plant employees because they work for pork producers and not the public. Training for those workers, they point out, is also done entirely at the plant owners’ discretion.

Pat Basu, a former chief veterinarian for the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) who retired in 2018, is critical of the proposed regulation. He says the agency is using semantic tricks as it reassigns duties to plant employees that the law says inspectors should perform.

“These are word games they are playing,” Basu said. “What they are really doing is removing hogs that are diseased and contaminated. Why are these suddenly not inspections?”

USDA officials say that they are modernizing the inspection process and that the new system will not violate existing laws and regulations. They say the agency has the authority to change how federal inspections are performed so long as a carcass-by-carcass inspection is performed on all of the hogs presented by the plant as fit for human consumption.

“In the proposed rules, we are just giving the plant employees the opportunity to more fully execute their [food safety] plan before we make that final verification that the product is safe,” said Phil Bronstein, an assistant administrator with the FSIS.

Bronstein acknowledged that under the proposed rules, the number of USDA inspectors on the slaughter line in most large plants will be reduced from seven to three. Bronstein said the remaining inspectors would be more experienced and have a higher level of training. Also, the number of USDA inspectors who will roam large plants to ensure sanitation procedures are in place and to check on animal welfare will grow from one to two, officials said.

At least 17 members of Congress, all Democrats, have stated their opposition to the new system. “It is appalling to watch the Trump Administration and [USDA] leadership justify their gutting of hog slaughter inspections with meaningless technicalities and semantics,” Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.), vice chair of the House Agriculture Appropriations Committee and chair of the Food Safety Caucus, said in a statement to The Washington Post.

“Who do they think they are fooling? This giveaway to corporate special interests means company-based employees will carry out responsibilities that are currently performed by government inspectors.”

Defining inspection

In addition to the term “condemnation,” other transferred tasks have also been given different names under the proposed new program, records show.

For example, when plant workers have examined a hog’s head and internal organs, looking for and removing signs of disease and contamination, they have “trimmed dressing defects and contamination, and identified pathology defects on the carcasses,” the proposed regulation says. They have not inspected the animal, the USDA says.

“The agency has trivialized what we have done and what we do by calling it sorting and other consumer protections,” said Charles “Stan” Painter, chairman of the National Joint Council of Food Inspection Locals, which represents inspectors. “The plant workers are clearly expected to do food safety inspections.” Painter said that given the increased role plant workers will have on slaughter lines, he believes federal inspectors are “now nothing more than window dressing at the end of the line.”

The USDA has long used different terminology for the same tasks, depending on whether they were performed by federal inspectors or employees in the test plants. But it has become more steadfast in asserting the need for others to adopt its language, and the proposed new inspection system has focused attention on the matter.

The proposed regulation emphasizes that plant employees’ primary jobs involve “non-food safety standards concerned primarily with diseases of no public health significance.”

However, records show that nearly every transferred task involves food safety issues. For example, when plant workers are removing defects, such as blemishes, from a carcass, they might also trim abscesses that could be a sign of a serious disease or trim spots with fecal contamination that may contain dangerous pathogens.

When they remove internal organs and examine them, they are looking for signs of disease such as septicemia, which would mean the entire carcass could be filled with harmful bacteria.

[After outcry, USDA will no longer require scientists to label research ‘preliminary’]

“They are, in a sense, performing part of the inspection process, doing a pre-screening,” said Daniel Kovich, director of science and technology with the National Pork Producers Council. “Yes, they are looking at it, and they are supposed to move things from the line that are not supposed to pass inspection. But only FSIS can inspect an animal.”

In an interview, USDA officials acknowledged that many of the tasks handled by plant workers would be related to food safety but said they are not inspections.

Although there is no cap on how fast line speeds may run, the USDA anticipates about a 12.5 percent increase at the large plants under the new system, records show.

Zach Corrigan, an attorney with the nonprofit advocacy group Food & Water Watch, said that means the fewer remaining inspectors would need to examine an average of 6.1 heads per minute versus about 2.7 heads per minute in the traditional system.

Corrigan said the new system places a heavy burden on the USDA inspectors who remain on the line and must inspect every carcass. He said the new system will sometimes make it impossible for the USDA to comply with the law.

“The definition of inspection is a ‘critical appraisal,’ ” said Corrigan, citing a 2000 court case that dealt with USDA inspections. “That legal threshold cannot be met when you remove inspectors from the lines and you increase the line speeds.” He called the USDA’s varying terms for the same food safety tasks “Orwellian doublespeak.”

The USDA said a 2002 legal ruling found that the hog test program did not violate the Federal Meat Inspection Act. However, that court decision was limited to the test program and said it “may not necessarily foreshadow the outcome of judicial review of such future regulations.”

The USDA says only a federal inspector or veterinarian has the power to place the department’s mark of inspection on the pork — under the traditional and the alternative new system.

The department also says the word “inspection” is a technical term and can be applied only to situations in which a USDA inspector or veterinarian has performed a food safety oversight task. At meat plants, veterinarians are typically the highest-ranking federal official.

In response to a recent Washington Post article that said the proposed rules would shift much of the power and responsibility for food safety inspections at hog plants to plant employees, the USDA wrote: “By law, only federal inspection personnel conduct inspections of animals, carcasses and parts — and USDA inspection personnel inspect every carcass and part before it leaves the slaughterhouse and processing plant.”

However, inside the test pork plants, USDA inspectors use the term “inspector” — as in “TS [trimming and sorting] inspector” — to refer to their plant employee counterparts. For example, in a 2013 citation for a food safety violation, a USDA inspector said a diseased hog had “passed all three of your TS inspectors” without them spotting the problem, and the carcass had to be condemned.

And in job advertisements, owners of the test pork plants consistently call some employees inspectors or use the word inspector in job descriptions. In a recent job posting by JBS, “quality control inspector” was used as a job title, and it said tasks include performing “various quality control functions including but not limited to line inspection, audits.” JBS did not respond to several requests for comment.

Spotting problems

Five USDA inspectors said in sworn affidavits, taken by the nonprofit Government Accountability Project, that plant workers routinely miss problems in the test plants that they believe are potential food hazards.

They also said plant workers aren’t in a position to stand up to plant supervisors when they do spot problems.

“On numerous occasions, I witnessed them fail to spot abscesses, lesions, fecal matter and other defects that would render an animal unsafe or unwholesome,” said one inspector, who was not named. “Furthermore, plant inspectors don’t actually want to shut off the line to deal with the problems they spot on the job. . . . Obviously their employer will terminate them if they do it too many times.”

Outside evaluations of the test plants have exposed problems. The most recent review was done in 2018 by Food & Water Watch. In its assessment, the group compared USDA inspection reports from the five test plants with those of five comparably sized traditional plants.

The group received copies of citations from 2013 to 2016 through a Freedom of Information Act request. In all, more than 3,500 citations were issued by USDA inspectors to the 10 plants. Food & Water Watch determined that 73 percent of citations issued for a carcass contaminated with feces, bile, hair or dirt were at the five test plants.

In the five test plants, 32 citations were issued after inspectors spotted carcasses that were “so infected that consumption of the meat may cause food poisoning.” Five comparably sized traditional hog plants received no citations for this offense, which is considered to be one of the most serious food safety violations because it can lead to possible recalls and food-poisoning outbreaks.

Carmen Rottenberg, who runs the FSIS, said the evaluation was not a meaningful comparison. She said citations to the test plants were higher because plant workers had assumed more responsibilities. When they fail to properly perform these new jobs, she said, the plants are then cited for those failures.

“We are holding the plants accountable for a lot more tasks,” Rottenberg said.

[Pork industry soon will have more power over meat inspections]

Inspection reports illustrate some of the problems USDA inspectors found with the work done by plant employees.

At one test pork plant in Michigan, employees assigned to remove sick and diseased live hogs overlooked one that had collapsed and died, then presented it to USDA inspectors as fit for slaughter.

At an Illinois test plant, its workers failed to identify more than a dozen abscesses in the internal organs of a slaughtered hog — a clear sign that the entire carcass was contaminated with dangerous bacteria.

And in Minnesota, employees at a test plant overlooked patches of yellow and green material on the chest wall and hindquarters of a hog carcass. It was fecal matter that could have contained dangerous pathogens.

The Food & Water Watch evaluation followed two independent government audits of the test program that were critical of the alternative inspection system. In 2013, the USDA’s inspector general found that three of the five test plants were among the worst in the nation for food safety and sanitary problems. Also in 2013, the Government Accountability Office raised food safety concerns due to the faster line speeds in those plants.

In the USDA’s self assessment the following year, the agency said its data showed the test plants “are performing as well as comparable large [traditional] market hog establishments and are meeting FSIS expectations.”

Rep. Marcy Kaptur (Ohio) and 16 other Democratic lawmakers opposed to the new inspection system asked the USDA inspector general’s office last month to investigate whether the department properly disclosed data on worker safety during the public review and comment period for the proposed regulations.

In a statement to The Post, Kaptur cited Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data that say 1 in 6 Americans get sick and 3,000 die because of foodborne diseases each year: “If we are to improve those numbers, we cannot hand over the integrity of inspections to an industry focused more on profit and less on human and animal welfare.”"
Homeland Security to issue spousal H-4 visa changes,https://www.thegazette.com,['Mercury News'],,,,https://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/nation-and-world/homeland-security-to-issue-spousal-h-4-visa-changes-20190528,"The fate of some 200,000 foreign citizens living and working in the United States is resting with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the Trump White House and a federal appeals court.

At issue is work authorization for holders of the H-4 visa, who are spouses of foreign nationals employed in the U.S. under the H-1B visa.

Homeland Security this week updated the schedule for a new rule removing that authorization, saying it would publish the proposed rule this month.

University of Tennessee researchers have estimated that 100,000 people, mostly Indian women, have the work authorization.

Spouses of H-1B workers on track for green cards have been allowed to work in the United States since 2015, when Homeland Security under the administration of former president Barack Obama published a new rule, first proposed in 2011, authorizing their employment.

“Allowing the eligible class of H-4 dependent spouses to work encourages professionals with high demand skills to remain in the country and help spur the innovation and growth of U.S. companies,” the agency said in proposing the rule.

Under the administration of President Donald Trump, Homeland Security has changed its messaging on the work authorization. In proposing to strip the right to work from the H-4 visa holders, the agency said in an online notification late last year that, “Some U.S. workers would benefit from this proposed rule by having a better chance at obtaining jobs that some of the population of the H-4 workers currently hold.”

The move by Homeland Security is part of a broader crackdown by the Trump administration on the H-1B visa. Silicon Valley’s tech industry, including large companies such as Google, Facebook and Apple, rely heavily on the H-1B and have pushed for an expansion of the annual 85,000 cap on new visas, arguing it’s necessary for securing the world’s top talent.

Critics point to reported abuses by outsources, and contend that the visa is used to supplant U.S. workers with cheaper foreign labor, and to drive down wages.

While Homeland Security has said in this week’s notice it will publish its proposed rule this month — which is expected to trigger a public comment period before any final approval — the agency has several times missed its own deadlines for publication since first proposing cutting the work authorization in 2017.

Bay Area software engineer Ranjana Varadarajan, an Indian citizen on the H-4 visa, said the prospect of losing her right to work makes her worried about her professional future.

“In the tech industry we should not have any gaps in our career,” she said. “We have to keep updating ourselves.” If the government bans her and other H-4 holders from employment, she will have no other choice but to leave the U.S. and live apart from her husband because she won’t give up her career, Varadarajan said."

President Donald Trump won’t release White House visitor logs, he refuses to hand over his tax returns, he made staffers sign non-disclosure agreements and he’s balking at congressional investigators.

Yet during a Rose Garden speech on Wednesday, he again proclaimed himself “the most transparent president” in U.S. history, adding to the reporters gathered before him, “I think most of you would agree.”

It may be true that Trump reveals more of his personal thoughts and emotions than any of his predecessors. But by most other measures of presidential transparency, including the congressional oversight at issue during his White House appearance Wednesday, Trump operates behind dark-tinted windows.

The end to White House visitor logs, a way for the public to see who is getting direct access to the most powerful man in America, is a break from Obama administration practice. He’s the first president in decades not to release his tax returns. No modern White House has held as few daily press briefings as Trump’s, a ritual his Pentagon and State Department have also largely phased out. And while many presidents have battled Congressional oversight requests, Trump has dismissed the queries of House Democrats as illegitimate partisan inquests.

All of which has many critics saying that Trump has it backwards.

“It is for sure the least transparent administration in modern history,” said Robert Weissman, the president of Public Citizen, a prominent Washington consumer advocacy group.

Norm Ornstein, a longtime government reform advocate and resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, called the Trump administration “the opposite of transparent.” Trump’s statement, he deadpanned, “made me laugh -- before I cried again.”

Even by the standards of Trump’s penchant for embellishment and falsehoods, Trump’s claim of unprecedented transparency — which he and his aides have made repeatedly — is particularly outrageous to the cadre of outside groups who’ve spent the last 2.5 years clashing with an administration they view as deeply secretive.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201905/2659/1155968404_6039857995001_6039857592001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

There is no universal definition of government transparency. But the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service defines transparency as “the disclosure of government information” that can be used to “hold the federal government more accountable for its actions or inactions.”

Measured by that sort of standard, critics say, Trump has fallen far short.

Within the first year of Trump’s presidency, the federal government denied or censored more public information requests than at any time in the last decade. And Freedom of Information Act lawsuits intended to force the administration to turn over records reached a record high last year, increasing by nearly 70 percent compared with the last full fiscal year of President Barack Obama’s term.

“There’s only one way in which he’s the most transparent president and that’s that we can see him broadcasting his thoughts on Twitter when he gets angry in the morning,” said John Wonderlich, the executive director of the Sunlight Foundation, a government accountability group. “Otherwise, it’s ridiculous.”

White House officials counter that Trump is more accessible than any modern president, broadcasting his thoughts to his millions of followers everyday, answering shouted questions from reporters and granting regular print, television and radio interviews. By that measure, the public likely has a better understanding of Trump’s minute-to-minute opinions than they did of other recent presidents, who were often reluctant to spout off in public until their ideas had been vetted by their advisers.

Though White House aides hold up Trump as a pillar of accessibility, they have also sought to tightly control Trump’s interactions with the media. Trump’s exclusive interviews tend to be with friendly news outlets. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders last appeared in the press briefing room in April to answer children’s questions during “Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day,” and White House officials argued that her answers should be off the record.

Watchdog groups said accessibility alone isn’t enough to claim the transparency mantle.

“I don’t think that’s meaningful transparency,” said Liz Hempowicz, public policy director at the Project on Government Oversight, adding that the true transparency requires a government-wide commitment across federal agencies.

Hempowicz and other experts noted that the lack of transparency at federal agencies has massive consequences for the public, but often gets less attention than Trump’s headline-grabbing statements.

Just this week, for example, the Washington Post disclosed the existence of an internal Defense Department memo restricting the way the Pentagon shares information with Congress. And POLITICO recently detailed efforts by the Agriculture Department to reassign nearly all its researchers who study the economic effects of climate change, trade policy and food stamps, in what employees call a crackdown on economists whose assessments don’t square with Trump’s policies.

Then there is Trump’s categorical rejection of House Democratic oversight requests, including the extraordinary use of lawsuits to fight back against his investigators.

Trump’s claims of unprecedented transparency seem to be increasing as he grows more frustrated with the investigations encircling him. Aides and associates say Trump is furious that the release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report has not dampened appetites for more investigation into subjects like his finances and tax returns.

“The President was fully transparent during the Mueller investigation. He made all requested White House staff available for interviews, produced tens of thousands of documents, and answered questions about the ridiculous ‘collusion’ allegations,” White House spokesman Steven Groves said in a statement. “The White House and the Administration will continue to cooperate with legitimate congressional oversight while protecting Executive Branch rights and privileges. In addition, the President and his staff engage with the press and answer their questions almost every day.”

On Wednesday, Trump lashed out at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for accusing him of engaging in a “cover-up,” countering that his administration had cooperated extensively with Mueller’s inquiries. Trump did give current and former staffers the green-light to participate with Mueller, although he himself refused to sit for an in-person interview, answering written questions instead.

“I think most of you would agree to this,” Trump said after abruptly ending a meeting with Democrats and vowing not to work with them until they end their investigations. “I’m the most transparent president, probably, in the history of this country. And instead of walking in happily to a meeting, I walk in to look at people that had just said I was doing a cover-up. I don’t do cover-ups.”

Trump isn’t the first president to throw around transparency-related superlatives. Soon after winning the presidency, Barack Obama vowed to make his administration the most transparent in history. And he did take steps toward that goal, including through the first-ever release of White House visitor logs. But watchdog groups often complained that Obama was betraying that promise when he blocked access to records or his Justice Department prosecuted government leakers.

“The [Obama] administration’s war on leaks and other efforts to control information are the most aggressive I’ve seen since the Nixon administration,” former Washington Post editor Len Downie wrote in a 2013 report.

“It’s unwise for a president to make a statement like that” unless he can back it up, Hempowicz said of Obama’s boast, noting that good government groups criticized the 44th president throughout his time in office. “It makes it very easy for us to push back.”"
Parrot selected by U.S. Department of Defense to take part in the development of the next-generation of Short Range Reconnaissance drone for the U.S. Army,https://finance.yahoo.com,[],05-28-2019,2019,5,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/parrot-selected-u-department-defense-151300332.html,"PARIS, May 28, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- The U.S. Army Program Executive Officer (PEO) for Aviation's Project Manager, Unmanned Aircraft Systems, partnered with the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) and the Army's Maneuver Center of Excellence to identify and prototype new drone capabilities with commercial companies that specialize in on-demand, ""eye in the sky"" technologies. In this process, the U.S. Army is partnering with the Pentagon's internal startup accelerator to adapt small commercial drones for the battlefield.

Parrot, the leading European drone group, is one of the 6 companies1 that have met the standards set in the solicitation issued in November 20182 to develop and prototype the next generation of small-unit surveillance drone.

The Short Range Reconnaissance (SRR) effort has recently awarded $11 million in funding to six companies to prototype and evaluate drones that can provide the Soldier on the ground with a rapidly deployable scouting capability to gain situational awareness beyond the next terrain feature. The drones would be expected to fly for 30 minutes straight at a range of up to three kilometers, according to the original solicitation. Officials also specified the aircraft should weigh three pounds or less, take less than 2 minutes to assemble and fit inside a soldier's standard-issue rucksack.

""Parrot is proud to have been selected by the Army to work on this highly strategic project,"" said Henri Seydoux, founder and CEO of Parrot. ""The United States has always been a major market for the Parrot Group whether it is for our well-known consumer range or our advanced professional offering. We have always been at the forefront creating advanced, easy to use, compact and reliable drone-based solutions. We also perfectly understand how small unmanned aircraft, such as the Parrot ANAFI platform, has the potential to become a key part of the defense system. We look forward to focusing our advanced R&D on meeting the high standards set by the U.S. Army, to integrate drone efficiency in their day to day operations and support the world leading army defense system.""

Parrot has been the first company to develop the civil drone market and to invest, earlier than any other, in commercial drone solutions creating the leading European drone group.

TCA Registers Technician Program With Department of Labor,https://www.ttnews.com,[],05-28-2019,2019,5,https://www.ttnews.com/articles/tca-registers-technician-program-department-labor,"TravelCenters of America has registered its diesel technician apprenticeship program with the U.S. Department of Labor. At the successful completion of the training, the technician receives recognition by DOL as a journeyman diesel technician.

The apprenticeship program allows participants to work full time at a TA Truck Service facility while completing their training on truck maintenance and repairs, instead of paying to attend a vocational school or training program, according to the Westlake, Ohio-based company.

The TA Truck Service network includes 244 truck service facilities, 1,090 repair bays and nearly 3,000 technicians.

Classes for apprentices are taught by a team of ASE Master-certified technicians and Daimler-certified trainers.

Participation in the apprenticeship program can span from 12 to 36 months, depending on the skill level of the technician enrolled. The program was developed in partnership with Fastport Inc., the DOL industry intermediary for the transportation and logistics sector.

Publicly traded TCA operates in 43 states and Canada, principally under the TA, Petro Stopping Centers and TA Express travel center brands. — Transport Topics"

"E.P.A. Experts Objected to ‘Misleading’ Agency Smog Decision, Emails Show",https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],05-24-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/24/climate/epa-pruitt-wisconsin-foxconn.html,"Want climate news in your inbox?

WASHINGTON — Newly released emails show that Environmental Protection Agency scientists raised strong objections to a 2018 decision by Scott Pruitt, who was head of the agency at the time, to exempt most of southeastern Wisconsin from federal limits on smog.

The decision by Mr. Pruitt was notable because it came as Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, was campaigning for a third term and trying to bring a Foxconn factory, and thousands of new manufacturing jobs, to a part of the state where pollution levels already exceeded federal limits.

Mr. Walker ultimately lost his re-election bid to Tony Evers, a Democrat. And Foxconn , the Taiwanese consumer electronics giant, announced in January that it was reconsidering its plan to build a $10 billion plant in Wisconsin, though the company later said it would build a smaller factory in the state.

But, in spring 2018, as the governor’s race was heating up, Mr. Walker championed the Foxconn deal and the 13,000 jobs it promised to create. The factory, however, also threatened to create a new source of pollution in the region."
USDA ends long-standing Forest Service job training program for at-risk youth,https://www.politico.com,['Catherine Boudreau'],05-24-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/24/agriculture-dept-ends-job-corps-conservation-centers-1472208,"The program — known as the Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers — is being transferred to the Labor Department. Employment USDA ends long-standing Forest Service job training program for at-risk youth

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has decided to end a U.S. Forest Service work program that trains at-risk youth to be first responders to natural disasters, maintain national forests and work on rural infrastructure projects.

The program — known for operating the Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers — is being transferred to the Labor Department. As part of the move, the department intends to close nine of 25 centers, according to a statement released Friday. The action could lead to a significant cut of the number of Forest Service employees.

“There are reasons why the secretary made this decision,” Forest Service Chief Vicki Christiansen told staff members during a conference call announcing the move on Friday morning, less than an hour before the Department of Labor’s news release. She said she learned of the decision only four days ago.

“Perdue has a goal of efficient and effective government,” Christiansen said, adding that the secretary believes the mission of the program better aligns with the Labor Department. The Forest Service’s Civilian Conservation Centers is the only Labor Department Jobs Corps initiative operated by federal employees.

“This was a high-level policy discussion and decision. It in no way reflects on your excellent work and dedication,” Christiansen said.

Perdue, in a letter to Labor Secretary Alex Acosta, wrote the move would help the Forest Service prioritize its “core natural resource mission to improve the condition and resilience of our nation’s forests, and step away from activities and programs that are not essential to that core mission.”

Forest Service officials did not disclose how many employees will be affected by the change, which is expected to be completed by September. However, a spokesperson for the National Federation of Federal Employees, the union representing Forest Service workers, told POLITICO that as many as 1,065 workers could be let go.

Another Forest Service official on the conference call said the agency will request authority for a reduction in force, which must go through the Office of Personnel Management because of the size of the staff cuts. The Civilian Conservation Centers closing are in states such as Montana, Oregon, Washington, Kentucky and North Carolina.

The Forest Service official said that agency will try to help employees find other jobs within the department and push “voluntary separation incentives,” or buyouts.

The Labor Department said 16 of the 25 centers will be replaced by new contract operators or a partnership overseen by DOL. The announcement added that the “new operators will implement new policies and approaches that will offer students the skills they need to earn an independent living and succeed in meaningful in-demand jobs.”

The Civilian Conservation Corps dates to the Great Depression but was disbanded during World War II. The current iteration was designed during the Johnson administration as part of its Jobs Corps effort. Today, thousands of young people aged 16 to 24 from low-income communities participate in the program.

“During hurricanes, wildfires and other natural disasters, these students are some of the first people to respond,” said Brittany Holder, a spokeswoman for the National Federation of Federal Employees. The organization, in a recent review of the Civilian Conservation Corps, found that in 2017, more than 300 students were sent to wildfire assignments, providing about 200,000 hours of support, among a range of other services.

The union argues the program has been a success and that the administration is misrepresenting data to make its case to privatize the centers. The Trump administration — in annual budget requests — and Republican lawmakers have criticized the program as being wasteful of taxpayer money and having little accountability.

“They have no plan for the students, no idea how to stop the loss of 613,000 hours of student service, and are not concerned about the impact on rural jobs and local economies,” Beverly Tobin-Ford, the union’s Forest Service Council vice president, said in April. “It’s as if this administration just decided to do this without reservation or any forethought.”

Top DHS official to depart agency at Trump's request,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-25-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/top-dhs-official-to-depart-agency-at-trumps-request,"The head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is stepping down from his post next month per the request of President Trump, according to a new report.

Lee Francis Cissna notified staff Friday that he would be leaving the Department of Homeland Security on June 1. It’s unclear what his plans are after departing the administration.

“During the past 20 months, every day, I have passionately worked to carry out USCIS’ mission to faithfully administer the nation’s lawful immigration system,” Cissna wrote to staff, according to an email obtained by the Associated Press.

Cissna’s job was in jeopardy last month as the agency coped with a surge of migrants crossing the border and a new caravan assembling. But Republicans including Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa went to bat for Cissna, and he did not leave with former Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen.

Cissna’s position requires Senate confirmation. It’s unknown who will replace Cissna, although the Trump administration announced that former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli would join the agency."
