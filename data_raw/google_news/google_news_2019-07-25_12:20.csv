Mueller’s testimony equals end of any Trump impeachment talk,https://nypost.com,"['Michael Goodwin', 'July']",07-24-2019,2019,7,https://nypost.com/2019/07/24/muellers-testimony-equals-end-of-any-trump-impeachment-talk/,"Among his talents, Donald Trump has a special gift for driving his detractors so crazy that they do really stupid stuff. The decision by Democrats to force Robert Mueller to testify before Congress is Exhibit A.

Bumblin’ Bob was a train wreck of epic proportions. The fallout is immediate, starting with this: impeachment is no longer an option.

It had a slim chance before Wednesday’s painful slog and no chance after it.

Mueller was that bad, seemingly hard of hearing, often confused and contradicted himself several times.

The Dems’ fantasy of having him breathe life into his report backfired.

His dismal performance killed any possibility that his 450-page tome could serve as a road map for overturning the 2016 election and driving Trump from office.

Although Mueller’s general demeanor was disturbing, it was also instructive. He did not project the mental and physical vigor of someone capable of leading the complex two-year probe into Russian meddling, possible Trump collusion and obstruction of justice.

More likely, the 74-year old former FBI director was something of a figure-head for an investigation that was carried out by the team of zealots he ­assembled.

That is not an incidental issue. As Andy McCarthy at National Review has written, and as Trump has repeatedly charged, the prosecutors were ­primarily people who had donated to Hillary Clinton and other Democrats or who otherwise made known their support for her.

Perhaps Mueller’s detachment explains his failure to remedy these obvious conflicts of interest that undercut his credibility from the moment they became known.

Oddly, Mueller removed agent Peter Strzok because his bias against Trump became public, but apparently had no concerns about public reports showing that chief prosecutor Andrew ­Weissman and others were in Clinton’s camp.

Mueller’s detachment may also explain the bizarre standard his team created, where Trump’s presumption of innocence was shredded because they could not find sufficient evidence to “exonerate” him. Several Republicans pointed out that prosecutors either file charges or don’t, but have never imposed the impossible standard of exoneration.

Those flaws are among many that undercut the report, including the fact that much of it reads as if it were written by Trump-hating reporters from The New York Times.

As one GOP member noted, the report cites nearly 200 articles and broadcasts, giving the impression that the media set the probers’ agenda. At the very least, Mueller’s team and the media were joined at the hip from the get-go.

Because of its pro-Clinton bias, the probe was the evil twin of the initial FBI investigation it inherited. Recall that the crooked James Comey relied heavily on the infamous Steele dossier, which Clinton’s team funded.

So from start to finish, Trump was targeted by partisan law enforcement officials who had no business being on the case. And yet, despite a probe that ran a combined three years, involved hundreds of witnesses, thousands of subpoenas and surveillance on Trump associates and maybe the president himself, investigators could find nothing — nothing! — worthy of a criminal charge.

That can only help the president in his re-election campaign. While there is a long way to go, the cloud of possible impeachment, which existed since Mueller was appointed, finally has been lifted.

There are two other major developments growing out of the hearing.

First, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi now has the responsibility to get her party back to its job of governing. She gave the impeachment caucus and its fanatical leaders, Reps. Jerry ­Nadler and Adam Schiff, time to gin up public support, but they have gotten nowhere because the facts were not as they promised.

If Pelosi is as smart and practical as her supporters say, she will make it clear that the hearing was the end of the Mueller era. If, on the other hand, she hesitates and lets the wing nuts chase their fantasies, she will recklessly waste the next year and increase the chances the GOP will retake the House in 2020.

The other development is that Washington’s focus now shifts to the two investigations into the investigators. The first to drop will be the review of the surveillance warrants obtained against Carter Page, which is being carried out by the Inspector General in the Justice Department.

The chief questions center on what Comey and others told the secret court’s judges about the Steele Dossier. Did they disclose it was paid for by Democrats?

Did they concede that Steele said he was motivated to make sure Trump did not become president? And did the judges know the allegations were unverified before granting four warrants?

The ultimate probe, though, is the one Attorney General Bill Barr launched. He said he was appalled at FBI bias against Trump and that he wants to get his hands around the origins and scope of the initial scrutiny.

“The use of foreign-intelligence capabilities and counterintelligence capabilities against an American political campaign to me is unprecedented and it’s a serious red line that’s been crossed,” Barr told CBS in May.

He also warned of the dangers of weaponizing law enforcement against political opponents, saying “the idea of resisting a democratically elected president and basically throwing everything at him” is a real threat to our nation.

There is no known deadline for Barr’s report, but my guess is that he will work relatively fast, certainly faster than the special counsel. And because Mueller’s day in the spotlight turned out to be a dud, Barr’s findings have the potential to be the real bombshell."
"Fox News Poll: Trump approval up, voter ratings on economy best in decades",https://www.foxnews.com,['Dana Blanton'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-poll-trump-approval-up-voter-ratings-on-economy-best-in-decades,"More voters rate the economy positively today than have since 2001, according to the latest Fox News Poll.

In addition, approval of the job President Trump is doing on the economy stands at 52 percent (41 percent disapprove). That’s just one-point off his high of 53 percent last summer, and up from 48-46 percent in May.

That job rating is helped, in part, by the 51 percent of voters now feeling the economy is in positive shape (excellent or good). The last time this many felt that way was almost two decades ago (59 percent, January 2001).

However, it’s unclear whether Trump can count on these ratings come election time. While 33 percent say economic conditions will get better if he is re-elected (39 percent worse), the same number, 33 percent, think it will get better if a Democrat wins the White House (36 percent worse).

In general, voters think Republicans would do a better job handling national security (+10 points) and the economy (+7). They give Democrats the advantage on race relations (+23 points), bringing the country together (+15), health care (+14), and immigration (+5). It’s mostly a draw on some issues that historically fall in the GOP column, such as on foreign policy (D+4), border security (R+3), the federal budget deficit (R+3), and taxes (even).

Despite the rosy economic views, Trump’s overall job approval remains below 50 percent: 46 percent approve, while 51 percent disapprove. Last month, it was 45-53 percent (June 2019). His best ratings, 48-47 percent, came soon after he took office (February 2017).

Here’s why his overall rating remains underwater: He receives net negative marks on border security (44 approve - 52 disapprove), immigration (41-54), international trade (40-49), Iran (39-46), North Korea (39-49), and health care (38-51).

The president’s lowest marks are on race relations (32-57 percent), where more voters disapprove than approve by 25 points. He was underwater by 22 points in October 2018 (35-57 percent).

Over half, 57 percent, don’t believe Trump respects racial minorities, including 73 percent of non-whites.

Some 34 percent think the president does respect minorities, down from 41 percent in 2017. That decline is mostly due to a 14-point drop among Republicans (68 percent now vs. 82 percent in 2017).

Majorities think that Trump went too far in tweets criticizing four minority Democratic Congresswomen, and believe telling a person of color to go back to the country they came from is a racist thing to say.

The new poll, released Wednesday, finds 63 percent think Trump’s tweets crossed the line. Far fewer, 27 percent, see them as an acceptable political attack.

Thirty-three percent of Republicans join 88 percent of Democrats in saying the tweets crossed the line. Some key electoral groups agree: 73 percent of suburban women, 68 percent of independents, and 64 percent of voters living in close counties (where Hillary Clinton and Trump were within 10 points in 2016).

A 53 percent majority of Republicans calls the tweets an acceptable political attack. GOP men (59 percent) are more likely than GOP women (48 percent) to find them acceptable.

Black voters (79 percent), Democrats (88 percent), and Democratic women in particular (91 percent) are among those most likely to believe the tweets went too far.

Overall, 56 percent think it is racist to say “go back” to a person of color, while 23 percent disagree, and 18 percent say it depends.

Most Democrats (85 percent) and blacks (76 percent), over half of independents (57 percent), and half of whites (50 percent) say the “go back” language is racist.

Among Republicans, 21 percent feel it is racist, while more than twice that number disagree (45 percent), and 30 percent say it depends.

One of the Congresswomen of the so-called “Squad” the president criticized, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), is as almost as well-known to voters nationally as long-time congressional leaders. For example, 9 percent have never heard of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, while 12 percent are unfamiliar with Ocasio-Cortez. Only three percent have never heard of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

Ocasio-Cortez and Pelosi are about equally popular among Democrats: Pelosi rates more positively than negatively by 41 points and Ocasio-Cortez by 39. For comparison, McConnell receives a net positive by 9 points among Republicans.

A majority of voters has an unfavorable view of Trump: 45 percent favorable vs. 51 percent unfavorable. Among Republicans, his favorable rating hits 87 percent.

Ocasio-Cortez is underwater among all voters by 7 points (34 favorable - 41 unfavorable), driven by 68 percent of Republicans rating her negatively.

Pelosi is underwater by 11 points (39-50 percent) and McConnell by 22 (25-47 percent).

Another member of the “Squad,” Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), is viewed negatively by 11 points (26-37 percent), while 22 percent have never heard of her.

Pollpourri

Six in 10 voters are concerned about the treatment of migrants detained on the U.S.-Mexico border, including 31 percent who feel “extremely” concerned. Most Democrats (82 percent) are concerned, while a majority of Republicans (58 percent) is not.

Fox News Channel’s Chief White House correspondent John Roberts reports the White House announced Tuesday that between May 13 to July 11, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) arrested more than 900 people who had remained in the country despite being ordered to leave.

Voters have mixed views on the job ICE is doing: 45 percent approve, while 49 percent disapprove. The party divide is stark: 80 percent of Republicans approve, while 80 of Democrats disapprove.

Why Trump swallowed a budget deal that bleeds red ink,https://www.politico.com,"['Nancy Cook', 'Burgess Everett']",07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/25/how-trump-shut-down-the-gop-deficit-hawks-1433475,"President Donald Trump worked to craft a bipartisan budget agreement along with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who gained a reputation this week as a political deal maker. | Alex Wong/Getty Images white house Why Trump swallowed a budget deal that bleeds red ink Trump looked to his friend and Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin to work with Pelosi and McConnell to strike a budget deal that avoids another risky spending fight until after the 2020 election.

President Donald Trump chose the pragmatist over the rabble-rousers.

In deciding who would lead the White House in budget and debt-ceiling negotiations with Capitol Hill, the president learned a lesson from his embarrassing government shutdown earlier this year: Brush aside the budget hawks in his own party, including acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, and focus on minimizing any drama heading into an election year.

Story Continued Below

Trump looked to Steven Mnuchin, his longtime friend, 2016 campaign official and now Cabinet member who earned a new reputation this week as a political deal-maker in Washington and helped Trump postpone any risky financial brinkmanship until after 2020.

The Treasury secretary took the lead in the five-month-long negotiations with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, striking a deal to raise the debt ceiling and set spending levels past the 2020 election. House lawmakers are set to vote on the agreement Thursday and are expected to approve it, despite widespread grumbling within the GOP.

“I was really impressed. It was a really challenging situation,” McConnell said in an interview. Mnuchin “spoke for the administration. And we knew that. So whatever differences they may have had, they resolved internally. And that was helpful, too, because we knew who we were dealing with.”

Trump appears pleased to move on. The president told Senate Republicans, in a meeting in the White House’s State Dining Room on Tuesday about Turkey policy, that he was happy Fox News and other conservative media had largely held their fire on the budget deal, according to two attendees. Mnuchin sat nearby as the president assessed the relatively muted friendly fire. “He was pleased it wasn’t worse. That point was made several times,” said one attendee.

Mnuchin is viewed throughout Washington as more matter-of-fact than ideological — a fact that has annoyed some die-hard members of the Republican Party. Like Trump, he is more interested in solving a problem than adhering to strict conservative principles.

“The president asked Mnuchin to negotiate a deal. And Mnuchin went to Pelosi saying, ‘How much is it going to cost me to get a debt limit increase past the election?’’’ one former senior administration official said sarcastically. “He doesn’t care about the cost. Wall Street is happy. The defense folks are happy. That’s good enough.”

Or, as Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said of the Mnuchin-Pelosi agreement: “There’s not much conservative about it.”

“There’s stories being written that this is the final nail in the coffin of what used to be the tea party movement. That’s sad. But maybe true,” he added.

In getting Trump a deal and sparing him of a crisis, Mnuchin’s standing with both Trump and congressional lawmakers has risen — thanks to his ability to speak on behalf of the mercurial president and the muted opposition to the final deal. It was something that even Vice President Mike Pence could not do in December 2018, when he assured Senate Republicans that Trump would sign a spending bill, only to have Trump backtrack days later and shut down the government.

“I don’t see this as his coming-out moment,” said David Tamasi, a fundraiser for the Trump campaign in 2016 and the reelection effort in 2020, said of Mnuchin. “He has already arrived.”

Mnuchin’s role in negotiating with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has put him at the center of this summer’s action, even if the Treasury Department technically only oversees the machinations around the debt ceiling, one segment of the deal. Next week, Mnuchin also will travel to Shanghai with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to continue trade talks with China.

His ongoing involvement with trade, sanctions and the budget deal makes him one of the most powerful and long-lasting members in Trump’s often-changing Cabinet. He, Lighthizer and National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow form what one Republican called a “strong economic frontline” heading into Trump’s reelection.

A spokesperson for the Treasury Department did not respond to a request for comment.

Senior administration officials said that, while conservatives did not get the extent of the spending cuts they wanted, the president retained the authority to transfer money within the accounts of the Homeland Security and Defense departments — key tools to help him fund his border wall.

The final budget and spending deal came together over the weekend during a flurry of phone calls, according to White House officials and Democratic aides. Pelosi and Mnuchin spoke three times on Sunday, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer joining the second call.

By Sunday night, Mnuchin called the president and other top White House officials to fill them in on the contours of the deal which the president broadly agreed to, according to two senior administration officials. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy also kept in close contact with the White House.

The parties then spent Monday working out the details, with Pelosi negotiating much of the deal via an aisle seat on a very delayed flight from Detroit to Washington, an aide to the House speaker said. At 5 p.m. on Monday, Mnuchin hosted a conference call with the four congressional leaders to review any outstanding issues. On that call, Mnuchin advised the leaders that Trump would tweet in the next hour. The leaders would then follow with their own statements affirming a deal had been reached.

Like clockwork, Trump tweeted out news of the tentative agreement on late Monday afternoon. “I am pleased to announce that a deal has been struck with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy - on a two-year Budget and Debt Ceiling, with no poison pills....” Trump said via Twitter, following the plan Mnuchin laid out with the congressional lawmakers.

....This was a real compromise in order to give another big victory to our Great Military and Vets! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 22, 2019

Mnuchin again gave the Republicans assurances that Trump supported the deal during a weekly Senate lunch, as Republicans waited for a clear signal. After the meeting with Senate Republicans, Trump delivered that endorsement on Twitter, effectively sealing the deal for congressional leaders.

Mnuchin’s performance in front of Republicans on Tuesday seemed to fall on ideological lines: Those who support the deal thought he was great. Those who don’t thought he did a poor job of selling a deal that had Democrats gleeful. Some Republicans thought Mnuchin should have taken a harder line with Pelosi, refusing to negotiate on spending until the debt limit was raised.

“He didn’t do anything. The pay-fors, offsets are a joke. It’s an accounting trick,” said one GOP senator. “It was sad. And he’s gleeful that the president loves him best for the moment.”

Earlier this spring, McConnell had pressed the president to embrace a deal this spring in a one-on-one meeting. Part of that was getting Mnuchin as the lead administration negotiator. Mnuchin seemed to carry less ideological baggage into the negotiations than his counterparts at the White House like Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff who battled for harsh spending cuts as a House lawmaker and Trump’s budget director, and acting director of the Office of Management and Budget Russ Vought, who also built a political career on slashing spending.

“You had the Mulvaney and Vought presence at the table,” said Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.). “Mnuchin represented the view that would lead to an outcome and shared going in that we needed to get a caps deal, whereas, I think some of the others at the table were trying to” freeze spending at current levels.

Conservatives both inside and outside the White House remain disappointed the deal did not go further with spending cuts, but both Mulvaney and Vought are going along with it.

Vought went on Fox News on Tuesday to defend it. “I love the concern of the conservatives who are bringing attention to the problems that we have with fiscal responsibility in this town. This president put forward more spending cuts than any president in history,” Vought said. “We’re now up against a deadline, heading into the August recess, where we need the debt limit extended. We need to continue to rebuild the military.”

The president’s endorsement of the budget deal will almost certainly push it across the finish line, even if the angst among conservatives is real.

“It’s a lot of spending. It makes it difficult,” said Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). “It’s a tough one to swallow. I get it, no one wants a shutdown and I don’t want to see us going over the fiscal cliff, but it’s just a lot of spending.”

Trump has told top White House officials and outside allies he intends to cut spending in his second term if he wins reelection, according to a senior administration official — though he will target discretionary spending and not touch Medicare or Social Security. It’s a vow that will be extremely hard to implement unless Republicans make huge congressional gains in 2020.

But that signal could please Republicans who are more aligned with Vought and Mulvaney.

The fact that Mnuchin was elevated above two true tea party die-hards came as little shock to hard-line conservatives. “I’m not surprised — because the Republicans in the Senate are not going to stand with the president on any kind of spending cut. Republicans are not trying to cut spending,” said former Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.), a forefather of the tea party.

Republicans close to the White House insisted that Trump picked Mnuchin to lead the negotiations because he wanted a deal, whereas Mulvaney might have pushed for deeper cuts and alienated congressional leaders. Back in December, Mulvaney urged the president to shut down the government to fight for more funding for a border wall.

The shutdown lasted for 35 days — giving Republicans no policy victories and forcing Trump to cave under Pelosi’s firm grip over her caucus.

Mnuchin’s shepherding of the deal shows how far he has come politically since he arrived in Washington. Earlier in his tenure, Mnuchin angered House Republicans by visiting Capitol Hill and asking them to vote for the debt ceiling and to do it for him — a move many saw as tone-deaf and arrogant.

But Mnuchin kept at it, strengthening his relationships with some key Senate Republicans during tax reform, hosting small breakfasts at Treasury for lawmakers and growing more comfortable in his political role in Year Three of the Trump presidency.

Mnuchin’s only major disagreement with the president was his backing of Jay Powell to lead the Federal Reserve — a move Trump has held against him as the Fed raised interest rates and dented markets late last year.

The two are now back on good terms, say senior administration officials and outside White House advisers, as the Fed prepares to backtrack and the stock market hovers at record levels.

Opinion | Ilhan Omar: It Is Not Enough to Condemn Trump’s Racism,https://www.nytimes.com,['Ilhan Omar'],07-25-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/opinion/ilhan-omar-trump-racism.html,"The America we arrived in was different from the one my grandfather had hoped to find. The land of opportunity he imagined in 1992 was in fact full of challenges. People identified me in ways that were foreign to me: immigrant, black. I learned that these identities carried stigmas, and I experienced prejudice as a visibly Muslim woman.

But the beauty of this country is not that our democracy is perfect. It’s that embedded in our Constitution and democratic institutions are the tools to make it better. It was in the diverse community of Minneapolis — the very community that welcomed me home with open arms after Mr. Trump’s attacks against me last week — where I learned the true value of democracy. I started attending political caucuses with my grandfather, who cherished democracy as only someone who has experienced its absence could. I soon recognized that the only way to ensure that everyone in my community had a voice was by participating in the democratic process.

Today, that basic promise is under threat. Our democratic institutions have been weaponized. The Trump administration has sought to restrict people from exercising their voting rights. It has sought to undermine the basic checks and balances of our Constitution by not respecting subpoenas from Congress. And the president has used overtly racist rhetoric to strike fear and division in communities of color and religious minorities across the country.

The idea — explicitly expressed by this president and enshrined into law by executive order — that people from certain Muslim-majority countries cannot enter this country is not just bad policy; it is a direct threat to liberal democracy. The chants of “Jews will not replace us,” shouted at a rally in Charlottesville in 2017 by white supremacists, whom this president tacitly accepted , are a direct attack on the values of religious freedom central to the founding of our nation.

The reasons for weaponizing division are not mysterious. Racial fear prevents Americans from building community with one another — and community is the lifeblood of a functioning democratic society. Throughout our history, racist language has been used to turn American against American in order to benefit the wealthy elite. Every time Mr. Trump attacks refugees is a time that could be spent discussing the president’s unwillingness to raise the federal minimum wage for up to 33 million Americans. Every racist attack on four members of Congress is a moment he doesn’t have to address why his choice for labor secretary has spent his career defending Wall Street banks and Walmart at the expense of workers. When he is launching attacks on the free press, he isn’t talking about why his Environmental Protection Agency just refused to ban a pesticide linked to brain damage in children."
Gay couple sues State Department for denying daughter's citizenship,https://www.cnn.com,"['Rebekah Riess', 'Jay Croft']",07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/24/us/gay-couple-daughter-citizenship-lawsuit/index.html,"(CNN) A gay married couple in Georgia sued the US State Department on Wednesday for refusing to recognize their daughter as a citizen.

Derek Mize and Jonathan Gregg, who married in New York in 2015, had their daughter Simone Mize-Gregg via surrogacy in England in 2018, their lawyer said in a statement. Both fathers are listed on the birth certificate.

When they applied for Simone's US citizenship, the US consulate in London rejected their application, the release said. ""The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) states that children of married U.S. citizens born abroad are U.S. citizens from birth so long as one of their parents has lived in the U.S. at some point, but the State Department routinely denies that right to same-sex couples and their children,"" the statement says.

""The State Department's policy is not only cruel, it is unconstitutional. The government refuses to recognize Jonathan and Derek's marriage and all of Simone's rights as a U.S. citizen,"" Aaron C. Morris, one of the couple's attorneys and executive director of Immigration Equality , said.

A State Department spokesperson declined to comment on the lawsuit, saying it does not comment on pending litigation.

The United States Department of Justice (DoJ) announced the indictment in a press release on July 24.

According to the DoJ, the indictment filings and court statements indicate that Green operated a fiat-to-Bitcoin (BTC) conversion service through the website Destination Bitcoin. As such, Green reportedly would receive money from his customers in order to convert their cash to BTC. The findings further indicated that Green had not registered with the Secretary of the United States Treasury in any capacity.

As noted in the announcement, a person is required by federal law to register any money transmitting businesses with the Secretary of the Treasury.

Sentencing

Regarding monetary quantities and compensation, the report says that Green converted over $2 million in fiat money to BTC. Moreover, the maximum penalty for Green’s alleged crime is 5 years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.

According to the DoJ, Green was charged over the same issue in a criminal complaint filed on February 28.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the State of New Jersey filed a complaint last week about purportedly unregistered securities sales within its borders. The State accused blockchain-based online marketplace Pocketinns of selling over $400,000 in securities to investors, without registering with the state’s associated bureau."
"DOJ declines to prosecute Barr, Ross over contempt vote tied to census question",https://www.foxnews.com,['Louis Casiano'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-declines-to-prosecute-barr-ross-over-contempt-vote-tied-to-census-question,"The Justice Department has declined to prosecute Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross for allegedly stonewalling congressional probes into the Trump administration's efforts to place a citizenship question on the 2020 census, the agency said Wednesday.

The House last week voted mostly along party lines, 230-198, to hold Barr and Ross in criminal contempt of Congress for defying congressional subpoenas, in a largely symbolic effort. House Democrats were seeking information about Trump's efforts to add the controversial question.

Trump asserted executive privilege and told Barr and Ross not to release certain documents in response to the subpoenas from the House Oversight and Reform Committee.

BOOKER INTRODUCES BILL TO RESTRICT USE OF CENSUS CITIZENSHIP QUESTION

""The Department of Justice's longstanding position is that we will not prosecute an official for contempt of Congress for declining to provide information subject to a presidential assertion of executive privilege,"" Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen said in a Wednesday letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

Democrats have accused the Trump administration of lying about the origin of the citizenship question. Critics of the question have suggested it was intended to discourage immigrant participation in the census, affecting the population figures that determine legislative representation.

Neither Pelosi nor House Oversight and Reform Committee chairman Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., immediately responded to Fox News for comment Wednesday.

Rosen said the DOJ has taken the same position across several administrations. He cited a 2008 case in which the agency declined to prosecute Joshua Bolten and Harriet Miers, two high-ranking Bush administration officials who refused to testify before a panel investigating the firing of several U.S. attorneys.

TRUMP DECLARES PUSH FOR CENSUS CITIZENSHIP QUESTION NOT OVER, CALLS REPORTS ‘FAKE’

Bush directed Bolten, then the White House chief of staff, and Miers, White House counsel, not to release certain documents or to provide certain testimony related to a congressional subpoena.

The department took a similar position in 2012 when former President Barack Obama directed Attorney General Eric Holder to withhold certain documents related to the government gun-running project, dubbed Operation Fast and Furious.

In accordance with the policy, the department determined the responses by Barr and Ross to the subpoenas ""did not constitute a crime,"" Rosen said.

The Supreme Court last month blocked the Commerce Department from adding the citizenship question.

Trump said earlier this month he would issue an executive order to get an accurate count of non-citizens and citizens in the U.S."
Justice Department launches antitrust probe into big tech,https://arstechnica.com,['Kate Cox'],,,,https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/07/justice-department-launches-antitrust-probe-into-big-tech/,"The Department of Justice is launching an antitrust probe into some of the world's biggest and most influential tech companies, the agency announced Tuesday.

The department's Antitrust Division, which is responsible for reviewing and enforcing issues relating to mergers, monopolies, competition, and price-fixing, said its review would ""consider the widespread concerns that consumers, businesses, and entrepreneurs have expressed about search, social media, and some retail services online.""

“Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands,” Makan Delrahim, head of the Antitrust Division, said. “The Department’s antitrust review will explore these important issues.”

The DOJ didn't name any names, but the list of ""market-leading online platforms"" accused of stifling competition through dishonest tactics, or simply of being too big for competitors to exist against, generally has Amazon, Facebook, and Google at the top; all three companies' stocks immediately tanked following the announcement.

Reports by several media outlets earlier this year, citing the ever-popular ""sources familiar with the matter,"" indicated the DOJ and Federal Trade Commission were planning something of a divide-and-conquer approach to tech sector regulation, with the DOJ digging into Apple and Google, and the FTC handling Amazon and Facebook.

Widespread scrutiny

The Justice Department is just the latest, not the first, body to take a hard look at what the tech sector has gotten up to in the past decade.

Congress kicked off its own probe into big tech's behavior last month, when the House Antitrust Subcommittee launched a bipartisan investigation into ""competition in digital markets."" The subcommittee chair, Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) at the time called the growth of monopolies in the US economy ""one of the most pressing economic and political challenges we face today.""

Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat who is one of the party's leading candidates in the 2020 presidential primary race, in March issued a call to use existing antitrust law to break up Amazon, Google, and Facebook.

Traditional bricks-and-mortar retailers have also been asking regulators to update antitrust policy in order to rein in Google and Amazon, which dominate the online marketplace through what the retailers say are anticompetitive practices.

The DOJ is also lagging behind its international peers. Germany, Austria, Italy, and the European Union have all launched separate antitrust investigations into Amazon's behavior with third-party merchants on its marketplace since November, and the EU has fined Google billions of dollars four separate times in recent years for violations of European monopoly law."

US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin Thinks Outlook for Bitcoin Is Bleak,https://www.coindesk.com,[],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.coindesk.com/ius-treasury-secretary-mnuchin-thinks-outlook-for-bitcoin-is-bleak,"U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin commented on cryptocurrency’s future viability, in an interview on Wednesday.

“I can assure you I will personally not be loaded up on bitcoin in 10 years,” Mnuchin said on CNBC’s Squawk Box. “I would bet even in five to six years I won’t even be talking about bitcoin as Treasury Secretary.”

While Mnuchin’s comments today do not elucidate his specific regulatory policies, he said previously that cryptocurrencies pose “risk to the financial system” if misused like Swiss bank accounts.

To prevent financial crime or monetary distortion, the Secretary has called upon the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to design guidance that will hold cryptocurrencies to the highest standards.

Today he added, “We’re going to make sure we have a unified approach and my guess is that there are going to be more regulations that come out from all these agencies.”

On July 18, Mnuchin erroneously claimed that fiat currencies are not vehicles for money laundering, while “there are billions of dollars of transactions going on in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for illicit purposes.”

Several media outlets – including Squawk Box anchor Joe Kernan, at the time – responded with incredulity. Tom Robinson, CEO of research firm Elliptic, wrote an OpEd for VentureBeat claiming, “Less than 0.5 percent of bitcoin transactions are used for illicit purchases.”

While Mnuchin seems to think crypto’s future is bleak, he continues to bat for the U.S. dollar.

Mnuchin added later in today’s interview, “I think the dollar is the reserve currency in the world. It’s in our interest. We want to maintain it.”

Mueller flubs on which president appointed him to prosecutor post in Massachusetts,https://www.foxnews.com,"[""Andrew O'Reilly""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mueller-flubs-on-which-president-appointed-him-to-prosecutor-post-in-massachusetts,"Former Special Counsel Robert Mueller confused which president appointed him the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts back in the 1980s during his congressional appearance Wednesday.

Answering a question during a lengthy hearing before the House Judiciary Committee, Mueller said he thought President George H. W. Bush appointed him to the post in Massachusetts, but was quickly corrected by Rep. Greg Stanton, D-Ariz., who noted that Mueller was appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1986.

Bush appointed Mueller as United States Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division in 1990.

EX-SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER TESTIFIES TO CONGRESS -- LIVE BLOG

Stanton’s questioning was meant to emphasize Mueller’s long history in government and the respect he garnered from both Democratic and Republican presidents. The former special counsel also served as deputy attorney general under President George W. Bush and later as his FBI director – a post he continued under President Barack Obama.

Mueller’s flub on who appointed him in Massachusetts came after hours of questioning in which Mueller appeared confused or befuddled by questions or references. He was also unwilling or unable to offer crisp sound bites that could reshape already-entrenched public opinions.

He frequently gave terse, one-word answers to lawmakers' questions, even when given opportunities to crystallize allegations of obstruction of justice against the president. He referred time and again to the wording in his report or asked for questions to be repeated. He declined to read aloud hard-hitting statements in the report when prodded by Democrats to do so.

MUELLER REFUSES TO DISCUSS RUSSIA PROBE ORIGINS, STEELE DOSSIER IN TESTIMONY

Although Mueller declared at the outset that he would be limited in what he would say, the hearings nonetheless carried the extraordinary spectacle of a prosecutor discussing in public a criminal investigation he conducted into a sitting U.S. president.

Mueller, known for his taciturn nature, warned that he would not stray beyond what had already been revealed in his report. The Justice Department had instructed him to stay strictly within those parameters, giving him a formal directive to point to if he faced questions he did not want to answer.

The Justice Department will not bring criminal charges against Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross after the Democrat-led House voted last week to hold them in contempt.

In a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen said the Cabinet officials’ defiance of congressional subpoenas seeking information about the 2020 census “did not constitute a crime.”

Story Continued Below

“[A]ccordingly the department will not bring the congressional contempt citations before a grand jury or take any other action to prosecute the attorney general or the secretary,” Rosen wrote, citing legal precedents from administration of both parties.

Lawmakers never expected the Justice Department to prosecute its own leader and another cabinet official, but Rosen’s letter represented the department’s formal response to a House vote that, in effect, referred Barr and Ross for criminal prosecution.

The House Oversight and Reform Committee subpoenaed both departments earlier this year as part of its investigation into the origins of efforts to add a citizenship question to the census. The Justice and Commerce departments refused to provide the documents requested, and President Donald Trump asserted executive privilege to block the release of those materials.

“The Department of Justice’s long-standing position is that we will not prosecute an official for contempt of Congress for declining to provide information subject to a presidential assertion of executive privilege,” Rosen wrote in his two-page letter to Pelosi.

It remains unclear if the House will go to court to enforce the Oversight Committee’s subpoenas.

The Supreme Court last month blocked the Trump administration from adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census, and Trump ultimately backed down from the effort after flirting with an executive order.

Judge Rules Trump’s EPA Flouting Clean Air Act As Denver Ozone Spikes Again,https://www.westword.com,['Chase Woodruff'],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.westword.com/news/judge-rules-trump-epa-flouting-clean-air-act-as-denver-ozone-spikes-again-11422270,"As ozone pollution in the Denver metro area took another turn for the worse this week, a federal judge ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency is violating clean-air laws by delaying a key decision on local air-quality standards.

In a ruling issued Monday, July 22, Judge John Kane of the U.S. District Court in Denver found that EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler has “failed to perform a nondiscretionary duty” by delaying a determination regarding the metro area’s classification under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone pollution. The partial summary judgment came as a result of a lawsuit filed by environmental group WildEarth Guardians against Wheeler and the EPA earlier this year. Court filings show that the agency didn’t object to Kane’s ruling.

“This is the Trump administration’s EPA on full display,” says Jeremy Nichols, WildEarth Guardians’ climate and energy program director. “They just refuse to comply with the law. They’re willing to keep dragging their feet to the point where they get ruled against in court, because they don’t want to comply. They don’t want to have to clamp down.”

The group's lawsuit revolves around a regulatory decision that was due to be made by the EPA earlier this year. For more than a decade now, a nine-county region known as the Denver Metro/North Front Range Nonattainment Area has exceeded federal standards for ozone pollution that were set by the agency in 2008. The state faced a January 2019 deadline to bring the area's air quality into compliance, or be reclassified from ""moderate nonattainment"" to ""serious nonattainment,"" which would require regulators to impose stricter regulations on polluters. The state missed the deadline — air pollution in Denver got worse last year, not better — but the EPA's attainment determination hasn't yet been made.

""This is a simple finding that they need to make,"" says Nichols. ""It's not a complicated action. It's very clear that Colorado failed to meet the 2008 ozone air-quality standards, so this shouldn't be happening. It's a sign of how nuts the Trump administration is, and how they just refuse to take their legal duties seriously. And unfortunately, it's our clean air that suffers.""

The EPA did not respond directly to questions regarding the attainment determination and when it's expected to be made. ""EPA supports the state’s efforts to address ozone issues along the Front Range,"" EPA Region 8 spokesperson Lisa McClain-Vanderpool said in an email. ""The Agency does not comment on ongoing litigation.""

Monday's court ruling came as ozone pollution in Denver began to rise to its highest level of the year so far, reaching an eight-hour Air Quality Index of 133 on Tuesday, July 23. Parts of metro Denver reached one-hour ozone concentrations of 100 parts per billion on Monday and Tuesday, according to state air-quality data — levels that are considered “unhealthy” for all groups on the AQI scale.

High levels of ozone pollution are expected to continue along the Front Range this week. In a forecast issued this morning, officials with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment warned that ""active children and adults, and people with lung disease, such as asthma, should reduce prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion"" in the afternoon and evening, when ozone levels are typically at their daily peak.

Ground-level ozone is a so-called criteria pollutant that can cause a wide variety of negative health effects, from acute symptoms such as coughing and shortness of breath to chronic conditions like asthma and emphysema. It's formed primarily by the interaction between sunlight and ""ozone precursors"" like volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides. In Denver, studies have shown that the two largest sources of ozone-forming pollutants are motor vehicles and oil and gas facilities along the Front Range, both of which can account for up to 40 percent of local ozone production on a given day.

A reclassification to serious nonattainment by the EPA would force CDPHE regulators to subject those emissions sources to a higher degree of scrutiny and regulation. In March, Governor Jared Polis withdrew a state request, made by his predecessor John Hickenlooper, for an extension to meet the federal ozone standards. ""There’s more we can do to protect our air quality and health, and we should do it sooner not later,"" Polis said at the time.

Even if the extension hadn't been withdrawn, it would have expired last week. Nichols and WildEarth Guardians, along with other environmental groups, have launched a campaign to pressure the CDPHE to act now, without waiting for the Trump administration to finally tell state officials what they already know.

""Having the backing of the EPA's finding forces them to [act], but the state shouldn't have to be forced to clean up the air,"" Nichols says. ""They could start to implement more rigorous permitting; they could start to put emissions on track. They could be taking some actions now.""

Gay U.S. Couple Sues State Dept. for Denying Their Baby Citizenship,https://www.nytimes.com,['Sarah Mervosh'],07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/23/us/state-department-assisted-reproductive-citizenship.html,"The State Department’s focus on biological parentage means that if the source of the sperm and egg do not match married parents, the case can be treated as “out of wedlock,” a designation that comes with a higher bar to transmit citizenship.

Mr. Gregg, who moved to the United States to be with his husband, did not meet a five-year residency requirement. His lawyers say that requirement would not have applied if they had been treated as the married couple they are.

For two married United States citizens, “all the law requires is that one of them lived in America for at least one day,” said Aaron Morris, the executive director of Immigration Equality, which has worked on all three lawsuits.

“Marriage is so fundamental to how you define a family,” he said. “To disenfranchise a little girl of citizenship because she has two dads is invidious discrimination that has been struck down time and time again.”

The State Department declined to comment on Tuesday, citing pending litigation. In court documents, the department has argued that the policy does not discriminate and applies to opposite-sex and same-sex couples alike.

But gay couples argue that they are far more likely to be questioned about their conception methods when applying for citizenship. Immigration Equality said that it had heard from at least three dozen families in similar situations since mid-2017; by the organization’s account, most were same-sex couples.

In court documents, the State Department has said that rules for passing down citizenship for children born abroad are important for preventing fraud and ensuring that children born abroad have a sufficient connection to the United States to warrant citizenship."
"After Trump’s DOJ instructed Mueller not to answer questions, House GOP attacks him for complying",https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/trump-doj-instructed-mueller-not-to-answer-questions-house-gop-attacks-him-c5a231353ab7/,"President Donald Trump’s Justice Department wrote to former special counsel Robert Mueller this week, instructing him to limit his congressional testimony to what was in his report. On Wednesday, House Republicans openly attacked him for doing just that.

“Any testimony must remain within the boundaries of your public report because matters within the scope of your investigation were covered by executive privilege, including information protected by law enforcement, deliberative process, attorney work product, and presidential communications privileges,” Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer instructed Mueller in his letter. “These privileges would include discussion about investigative steps or decisions made during your investigation not otherwise described in the public version of your report.”

In his appearance before the House Judiciary Committee Wednesday, Mueller answered questions cautiously, frequently declining to respond to queries that strayed from those boundaries and referring committee members to the written report.

But Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) tweeted out an attack on Mueller during the hearing, calling it “remarkable” that “Mueller can’t answer key questions, seems unaware of basic information.”

This is remarkable. Mueller can’t answer key questions, seems unaware of basic information, and admitted he denied exoneration of Trump over a standard that doesn’t exist. No one needs to discredit this process. Team Mueller and House Democrats are discrediting it by themselves. — Mark Meadows (@RepMarkMeadows) July 24, 2019

Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-SC) tweeted Meadows’ smear.

Rep. Debbie Lesko (R-AZ) also joined in, accusing him of “having trouble answering basic questions.”

Mueller seems to be having trouble answering basic questions. — Debbie Lesko (@DebbieLesko) July 24, 2019

Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) accused Mueller of being “intellectually disheveled.”

“He seemed to not have a strong command of the facts and he seemed unwilling to answer basic questions the American people want to know,” he told the Miami Herald.

DOJ won't prosecute contempt citation against Barr and Ross,https://www.cnn.com,['David Shortell'],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/24/politics/doj-contempt-wont-prosecute-barr-ross/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Department of Justice won't prosecute the attorney general or Commerce secretary after the House voted earlier this month to hold them in criminal contempt, Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen said Wednesday.

In a letter to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Rosen described the department's ""long-standing position"" to not prosecute an official for contempt of Congress ""for declining to provide information subject to a presidential assertion of executive privilege.""

Pelosi tweeted Tuesday that she had signed the contempt citations for Attorney General Bill Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, which were approved mainly along party lines in the House. The citations followed resistance from the Justice and Commerce departments to provide a full range of documents requested by the House Oversight Committee as part of its investigation into the addition of a citizenship question on the 2020 Census.

The move to not prosecute the twin contempt citations was widely expected, and followed a similar move by the Justice Department under President Barack Obama, which declined to pursue contempt charges referred by Congress against then-Attorney General Eric Holder.

Both agencies have maintained that they have already provided thousands of documents to the committee about the census question, and that certain documents which had been withheld were done so in line with a federal court ruling that said that many of the same documents were privileged from disclosure in civil litigation.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)

THE BIG IDEA: Tech investor Peter Thiel, whose long-running hostility toward Google is well known in Silicon Valley, dubiously accused the search giant of committing treason during an interview last week on Fox News. When host Tucker Carlson asked Thiel whether he has any evidence to support his accusation that Google is working in cahoots with the Chinese government, the PayPal co-founder responded that he was just “asking questions.” Moments after “Fox & Friends” aired a clip from that sit-down the next morning, President Trump – who has routinely criticized the company – called Thiel “a great and brilliant guy who knows this subject better than anyone!” He tweeted: “The Trump Administration will take a look!”

The Department of Justice announced last night that it is opening an antitrust review of “market-leading online platforms” to take a look at “widespread concerns … about search, social media, and some retail services.” Prosecutors said they will “seek redress” if their investigation finds that these companies violated any federal competition laws. “Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands,” Makan Delrahim, the DOJ’s assistant attorney general for antitrust, said in a statement.

“It did not mention any major tech giant by name, but its stated interests track closely with Google’s dominance in search, Facebook’s leadership in social media and Amazon’s position as the country’s e-commerce leader,” Tony Romm, Elizabeth Dwoskin and Craig Timberg report. “To start, DOJ officials are planning a meeting this week with attorneys general from states such as Colorado, Nebraska and Iowa to examine the potential for bringing state-level cases against tech giants.”

“Another way to read this is that the administration doesn’t like any of these tech firms because they think they all lean Democratic and stifle conservative voices, and this is just pure, raw-knuckles payback,” said Bob Litan, a former deputy assistant attorney general in the DOJ antitrust division who helped prosecute Microsoft.

Investigations at the DOJ are supposed to be independent of political influence from the White House, and Justice Department officials have been adamant that these inquiries are not politically motivated. But the president has not inspired confidence in this regard by reportedly trying to interfere in past competition-related matters, including AT&T’s purchase of Time Warner Cable, a deal that included CNN, a frequent target of Trump’s attacks. Trump appointees at the Justice Department used a novel antitrust theory to try thwarting that merger, but the government lost in both lower court and on appeal.

The appearance alone that the federal government’s law enforcement apparatus is being marshaled against America’s most successful innovators because Trump doesn’t like them threatens to further erode public confidence that Lady Justice is truly blindfolded. It feels like the plot of a dystopian Ayn Rand novel, with Mark Zuckerberg or Sergey Brin as Hank Rearden. But who is John Galt?

The New Yorker reported in March that Trump pressured Gary Cohn, the former director of the National Economic Council, to tell the Justice Department to block the AT&T-Time Warner deal a few months before DOJ filed that suit. According to the magazine, Trump called Cohn and then-White House Chief of Staff John Kelly into his office and said, “I've been telling Cohn to get this lawsuit filed and nothing's happened! I've mentioned it fifty times. And nothing's happened. I want to make sure it's filed. I want that deal blocked.” Cohn reportedly told Kelly after they left the Oval Office not to follow through with the president's request. As a point of contrast, the Justice Department did not try to stop Trump ally Rupert Murdoch when Disney purchased 21st Century Fox. “Under Trump, the government has consistently furthered Murdoch's business interests, to the detriment of his rivals,” Jane Mayer wrote in her piece.

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post. Trump has repeatedly sought to link the online store and this newspaper, whose coverage he has criticized, even though they are separate entities that operate independently. Last year, Trump personally pushed the U.S. postmaster general to double the rate that the Postal Service charges Amazon to ship packages, which could cost the company billions. The postmaster general pushed back by showing the president how profitable the partnership is for the government.

-- Trump is not just maneuvering behind the scenes to undermine his perceived enemies in tech. There are many examples of the president invoking partisan politics as he explicitly advocates, in sometimes chilling terms, for the heavy hand of the state to be used against private industry.

At the White House social media summit the week before last, for example, Trump ominously threatened to do battle with technology firms who he says treat conservatives unfairly. “They’re not using what we gave them fairly, and they have to do that,” Trump told a crowd of his supporters. “We certainly don’t want to stifle free speech, but that’s no longer free speech. See, I don’t think the mainstream media is free speech either because it’s so crooked. It’s so dishonest. To me, free speech is not when you see something good and then you purposely write something bad. To me, that’s very dangerous speech.”

On June 26, Trump phoned into Fox Business and attacked Google and Twitter for being “totally biased” against him. ""Let me tell you, they're trying to rig the election,"" he alleged. “That's what we should be looking at, not the phony witch hunt.” He added that the companies seek to foment “hatred for the Republicans.”

On June 10, Trump telephoned into CNBC’s “Squawk Box” and said that there is ""something going on in terms of monopoly” vis-a-vis Facebook, Google and Amazon. “I can tell you they discriminate against me,” the president said. “People talk about collusion. The real collusion is between the Democrats and these companies. They were so against me during my election run. Everybody said, ‘If you don't have them, you can't win.’ Well, I won. And I'll win again.”

-- Prominent Democrats have expressed broad-based support for DOJ’s antitrust probe into the major technology companies, which they believe have accumulated too much power. But some prominent lawmakers, including Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), emphasized last night that any investigation by the Justice Department must be entirely free of political interference. A House Judiciary subcommittee is already conducting its own bipartisan investigation of the companies. Elizabeth Warren has made breaking up the big tech companies a central plank of her platform.

-- The tech companies face a multi-front assault from the feds: Attorney General Bill Barr attacked encrypted messaging programs, singling out Facebook-owned WhatsApp, during a blistering speech yesterday at the International Conference on Cyber Security in New York. The attorney general said that one Mexican cartel “started using WhatsApp as their primary communication method, preventing U.S. law enforcement from conducting wiretaps that would enable us to locate fentanyl shipments and seize them at the border.” That same cartel, he said, created a WhatsApp group chat “for the specific purpose of coordinating the murders of Mexico-based police officials. The cartel ended up murdering hundreds of these police officers. Had we been able to gain access to the chat group on a timely basis, we could have saved these lives.”

“It marks a forceful return by the Justice Department to the encryption debate it has shied away from in recent years, after a bruising fight between the FBI and Apple over the locked phone of a dead terrorism suspect,” Devlin Barrett reports. “Last year, the FBI acknowledged that while they had repeatedly claimed investigators were locked out of nearly 7,800 devices connected to crimes, the correct number was much smaller, between 1,000 and 2,000.”

In response, a WhatsApp spokesman sent a statement from Facebook executive Gail Kent: “Cybersecurity experts have repeatedly proven that it’s impossible to create any backdoor that couldn’t be discovered — and exploited — by bad actors. It’s why weakening any part of encryption weakens the whole security ecosystem.”

-- To be sure, the tech companies don’t have totally clean noses: The Federal Trade Commission alleges that Facebook misled billions of users about its handling of their data as part of a wide-ranging complaint that accompanies a $5 billion settlement announced this morning.

“The agency argued that the social-networking company was not upfront about the ways that app developers, advertisers and others gained access to users’ personal data — from the content they ‘liked’ to the phone numbers they stored — in breach of Facebook’s previous promise to improve its privacy protections online,” Romm reports. “As a result, the settlement between the FTC and Facebook includes the largest fine in U.S. history for a privacy violation, and it grants federal regulators unparalleled access to the social-networking giant’s business decisions for the next two decades — allowing regulators to scrutinize the actions of Facebook’s leaders, including chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, and its efforts to launch new products and services. Facebook, however, did not have to admit guilt for its misdeeds.”

Demonstrators clash with police during a protest in San Juan, Puerto Rico. (Marco Bello/Reuters)

-- Puerto Rican newspapers expect Gov. Ricardo Rosselló to resign today after two weeks of mass protests: El Nuevo Día reports that Wanda Vázquez, the justice secretary, will be Rosselló’s successor. Sources told the local newspaper that Rosselló has recorded a goodbye message that will be broadcast today. Another local paper, El Vocero, also says the governor will step down. “Since the disclosure almost two weeks ago of the text messages, the administration has lost its investment officer, press secretary and two fiscal agency heads -- one of whom lasted just five days. The governor’s chief of staff quit Tuesday night,” Bloomberg News reports.

Puerto Rican law enforcement authorities seized cellphones belonging to several people in Rosselló’s inner circle. They are believed to be connected to the exchange of sexist and homophobic messages that triggered the uprising, per the New York Times.

They are believed to be connected to the exchange of sexist and homophobic messages that triggered the uprising, per the New York Times. Civil rights leaders in Puerto Rico want investigations into the use of tear gas on protesters. “Police have fired tear gas at mostly peaceful protesters every night for more than a week, according to the ACLU of Puerto Rico and Amnesty International Puerto Rico, which have both had observers at the protests in San Juan. They said police have also used rubber bullets on some nights,” BuzzFeed News reports.

THERE’S STILL A BEAR IN THE WOODS:

-- Today’s the big day: Former special counsel Robert Mueller is testifying before Congress this morning, and he’s bringing his longtime aide with him. Rachael Bade and Matt Zapotosky report: “Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee agreed to allow Aaron Zebley, a former top deputy to Mueller, to sit beside him and advise him in his answers. The accommodation came after Mueller asked that Zebley be allowed to testify as a witness next to him, a request Judiciary Democrats rejected. The House Intelligence Committee, meanwhile, has agreed to let Zebley be sworn in for its hearing later in the day, according to a committee aide. Zebley was Mueller’s chief of staff when Mueller was FBI director, and he played largely the same role inside the special counsel’s office. … ‘The special counsel’s office has made it clear for some time, they’d like to have him present, they would like to allow him to answer questions,’ said House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.). ‘We want this hearing to be about Director Mueller.’”

Trump didn’t react well to the news of Zebley’s addition: “Just got back only to hear of a last-minute change allowing a Never Trumper attorney to help Robert Mueller with his testimony before Congress tomorrow,” he tweeted. “What a disgrace to our system. Never heard of this before. VERY UNFAIR, SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED. A rigged Witch Hunt!” While many in Mueller’s team gave political donations to Democratic candidates in the past, Zebley has no political donation history and there is no evidence that he is a “Never Trumper.” Bade and Zapotosky reported last night that “one person familiar with the matter said that Mueller made the request to have Zebley be sworn in and testify in the last 24 hours or so. The Justice Department did not authorize Zebley to testify and objects to his doing so, said the individual. Republicans decried the move as an 11th-hour trick, arguing Democrats would have had to announce another witness days ago under traditional procedures in the House.”

-- An adviser to Trump’s transition team was convicted on foreign-agent charges. From Politico: “A federal jury on Tuesday convicted Bijan Rafiekian, a former business partner of Michael Flynn, on a pair of foreign-agent felony charges stemming from work the two men did for Turkish interests during the final months of the Trump presidential campaign in 2016. … Rafiekian, 67, faces up to 15 years in prison on the two felony counts against him: acting as an unregistered foreign agent in the U.S., and conspiracy to violate that law as well as to submit false statements to the Justice Department in a foreign-agent filing. … The Iranian-American businessman, who was Flynn’s main partner in his short-lived consulting firm, also served as an adviser to the Trump transition team on national security issues.”

-- Most Americans still believe Congress should not begin impeachment hearings against Trump. Here are four other takeaways from Emily Guskin on how Americans view Mueller and impeachment going into the hearing:

Americans largely see Mueller as credible, and Republicans’ view of him turned more positive after the investigation ended. A plurality of Americans (46 percent) said Mueller's findings will not change their 2020 vote. Yet most Americans believe that Mueller didn't exonerate Trump and that Trump lied about matters the special counsel investigated. Americans are more divided over whether Trump tried to obstruct Mueller’s probe. An April poll showed that 47 percent of Americans believe Trump tried to interfere in the investigation.

-- Ousted FBI director James Comey expressed hope that House Democrats would ask Mueller about Barr's misleading summary of the former special counsel's report and how the attorney general has ""slimed the FBI.” From Fox News: “Comey insisted that he and everyone at the DOJ ‘should have been fired’ if they didn't pursue an investigation in Russia's meddling in the 2016 election and whether there was an ‘American connection’ in its efforts. … ‘This is a chance for the American people to learn what he found,’ Comey told MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace. ‘It's too bad that having published a 450-page report, that didn't get the job done, but it didn't. Folks don't know what he found. And you can ask him in a simple and straightforward way and get those details in front of the American people.’”

-- What critics, pundits and journalists are expecting from Mueller’s hearing:

The testimony could be revolutionary — or it could put us to sleep. “ The biggest surprise of Robert Mueller’s testimony on Capitol Hill on Wednesday will be if it contains any surprises at all,” writes the New Yorker’s John Cassidy. “We already have a good idea of what Mueller is going to say, because he has told us.” On May 29, Mueller said, “Any testimony from this office would not go beyond our report .” “What we won’t get from Mueller, it is safe to assume, is a straightforward answer to the fundamental question he dodged in his report: Did the President’s behavior detailed in Volume 2 satisfy a prosecutor’s definition of obstruction?” continues Cassidy. “In this, ostensibly his last public act, Mueller could theoretically cast aside his constricted view of a special counsel’s role and state the truth of the matter in plain English.”

Ask the Times’s Peter Baker and Sheryl Gay Stolberg: “For all the anticipation, for all the fighting that it took to get to this day, many in Washington assume it will be more fizzle than sizzle. … That is not to say it will be free of fireworks. Democrats will use Mr. Mueller to argue that Mr. Trump benefited from Russia’s help in the 2016 election even if investigators did not establish a criminal conspiracy and that his efforts to impede the investigation amounted to obstruction of justice even if Justice Department rules bar indictment of a sitting president. Republicans will grill the former special counsel to press their case that the entire investigation represented an illegitimate, partisan coup attempt even though Mr. Mueller himself is a lifelong Republican.”

CNN’s Brian Stelter writes: “I asked new ‘CBS Evening News’ anchor Norah O'Donnell what she's doing to prep -- she replied, ‘Reading, reading, reading. I bought the bound version of the report on Amazon, and the abridged version by Thomas Patterson, and our special events team put together an excellent briefing book ahead of our coverage.’ … How should newsrooms approach hearing? Wednesday's Mueller biographer Garrett Graff told me: ‘The media needs to stay focused on the *substance* of the hearing, not the circus. The GOP is going to try to throw up as much mud and smoke as they can, but we know most of their pet theories (Chris Steele!) have already been debunked. The GOP's goal is to make this as muddy as possible. Don't help them. Don't let them distract.’”

-- You can keep up with The Post’s live coverage of Mueller’s testimony here.

-- The president, while complaining about the Mueller probe, falsely told a room full of teenagers at the Turning Point USA Teen Student Action Summit that the Constitution gives him “the right to do whatever I want.” Michael Brice-Saddler reports: “Trump lamented the duration and cost of the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election led by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, which he has repeatedly said found 'no collusion, no obstruction.' 'Then, I have an Article II, where I have to the right to do whatever I want as president,' he said. 'But I don’t even talk about that.' ... Article II grants the president 'executive power.' It does not indicate the president has total power. Article II is the same part of the Constitution that describes some of Congress’s oversight responsibilities, including over the office of the presidency. It also details how the president may be removed from office via impeachment.”

-- House Democrats are preparing to formally endorse Trump-related subpoenas to strengthen their court case to access the president’s personal financial information. From Politico: “The proposal, filed Tuesday afternoon by Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), would formally declare that any committee subpoenas related to Trump, his family, current and former White House officials and the Trump Organization are presumed to have the blessing of the full House of Representatives. The Rules Committee is expected to advance the measure Tuesday night, and the House is expected to pass it on Wednesday. … The measure, recommended by House counsel Doug Letter, responds to a line of questioning by [former Trump administration official] Neomi Rao, a judge on the federal appeals court in Washington, who is one of three judges weighing a Democratic subpoena to access records from Trump's personal accounting firm. During oral arguments earlier this month, Rao repeatedly wondered why the full House hadn't voted to authorize the probe of Trump's finances, which is being led by the House Oversight Committee.”

-- Democrats are growing more and more frustrated as House investigators struggle to hold Trump accountable. Rachael Bade reports: “In more than seven months of investigating Trump, a half-dozen Democratic-led House committees have struggled to unearth major findings, hold high-profile hearings that move public sentiment or follow up on inquiries they laid out when the party took the majority in January. … Investigators blame Trump’s historic stonewalling for their difficulties. … Two of the committee chairmen leading investigations — Judiciary’s Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) and Ways and Means’ Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.) — have drawn primary challengers who dismiss glacial-paced oversight and demand the ultimate step: impeachment proceedings against Trump. … The bitterness is expressed by party challengers and far-left groups, but it extends beyond the most liberal voices. A core group of aides to President Barack Obama who dealt with relentless GOP investigations of their former boss have questioned whether House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s aversion to impeachment has created what Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to Obama, recently called a ‘bizarre abdication’ of congressional duties.”

-- House investigators blame Trump’s stonewalling for their difficulties making any breaks. Case in point: Trump sued the House Ways and Means Committee, as well as New York's attorney general, to block disclosure of his tax returns. From CNBC: “The president’s lawsuit, which was filed ‘in his capacity as a private citizen,’ came less than a month after the [committee] sued the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service to obtain Trump’s federal returns. … Trump’s lawyers argue that the House panel ‘lacks a legitimate legislative purpose’ to use a recently passed New York state law to get Trump’s returns. They also claim that state law violated the president’s First Amendment rights, because it was enacted to ‘discriminate and retaliate against President Trump for his speech and politics.’”

-- Trump is at odds with Senate Republicans over how to impose sanctions on Turkey for purchasing a Russian antimissile system. Karoun Demirjian, Seung Min Kim and Josh Dawsey report: “Senate Republicans, led by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman James E. Risch (Idaho), are urging Trump not to waive mandatory sanctions against Turkey for purchasing the Russian-made S-400 system, which they argue would jeopardize the security of NATO’s F-35 stealth fighter technology. … Trump appeared to be advocating negotiations with Turkey instead of harsh sanctions — leading to a ‘robust discussion’ and the open dispute between Risch and the president, according to people familiar with the closed-door meeting.”

-- A high-profile Chinese fugitive, billionaire and member of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club is accused of being a Communist spy. From the Miami Herald: “Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui, who also goes by Miles Kwok, fled to the United States four years ago after learning an associate had been arrested on corruption charges. He is now one of China’s most-wanted, accused of myriad crimes by the Chinese government, including paying bribes and sexual assault. He maintains his innocence, saying the charges are politically motivated. Guo, who made his money in real estate, has long promoted himself as a dissident being hunted by the Chinese government for his opposition to the ruling Chinese Communist Party. He is currently seeking political asylum in the United States, where he reportedly avoided deportation by the Trump administration after the president learned Guo was a member of Mar-a-Lago.”

THE IMMIGRATION WARS:

-- A record number of Americans, 27 percent, believe immigration is the top problem facing the country. Since Gallup began regularly polling people's top worries in 1993, immigration has been cited by an average of 6 percent of Americans as their top concern. But that issue has spiked since Trump took office.

-- Francisco Galicia, the American teenager who spent three weeks held in detention by Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, was finally released. From the Dallas Morning News: “Sanjuana Galicia, Francisco’s mother, said Tuesday an ICE official called her around 2 p.m. and told her that they had found his documents and citizenship to be valid and that he had been freed. ‘The first thing he said to me was, 'Mommy, they let me go. I'm free,’’ she said by phone. Galicia's detention appears to have been a bureaucratic mix up related to the fact that he had a U.S. birth certificate and also, years earlier, a Mexican visitor's visa to travel to the U.S. from Mexico.”

-- Thousands of undocumented, unaccompanied migrant children are at risk of spending the rest of their childhoods in custody, according to the head of the Office of Refugee Resettlement. From CBS News: “The federal government is required to pursue ‘prompt and continuous efforts toward family reunification’ of unaccompanied migrant children, according to a landmark court settlement, but for thousands of kids in ORR care, that reunion may never happen. ‘Unfortunately, I have well over 4,000 of those children in my care at this time at the Office of Refugee Resettlement,’ the director, Jonathan Hayes, told CBS News in June. ‘So conceivably someone could come into our care at 15 years old and not have an identifiable sponsor in the United States and remain with us for a few years.’ On their 18th birthdays, many of the children will be taken from ORR's youth holding facilities, referred to as shelters, to adult detention centers operated by (ICE).”

-- Trump vowed to deport “millions” of immigrants. The final tally from the ICE raids that sowed fear in communities across the country: 18 family members detained and 17 “collateral” arrests. Maria Sacchetti reports: “ICE announced the data Tuesday morning, tucking it into a news conference that included information about worksite enforcement and routine criminal arrests. Aside from the 35 immigrants apprehended in the much-anticipated family operation, immigration agents separately picked up nearly 900 adults — most of them convicted criminals — and delivered more than 3,000 notices to companies nationwide that authorities will audit their records to ensure that workers are in the United States legally. Acting ICE Director Matthew T. Albence called the criminal operation successful and said the family operation, Operation Border Resolve, will continue, although the number of arrests were lower than in the past. The first such operation, over New Year’s weekend in 2016 under the Obama administration, led to the arrests of 121 adults and children in Georgia, Texas and North Carolina.”

-- While touting his Senate bid, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach talks often about the nonprofit group he advises aimed at building a border wall with citizen donations. The organization, however, is tangled in problems at all levels of government. From the Wichita Eagle: “In building the first segments of its promised barrier, the group has angered officials in a New Mexico border town and prompted a Florida agency to investigate consumer complaints lodged against it. What’s more, the federal agency tasked with enforcing boundary and water treaties between the United States and Mexico has identified a number of problems with We Build The Wall. … Kobach has said Trump blessed the effort, but the White House continues to decline to confirm that. As his Senate candidacy gears up, Kobach appears likely to remain an ambassador for We Build the Wall. His aides say there is no connection between the campaign and the group. But his continuing involvement creates the potential for blurred lines.”

THE DIVIDED STATES OF AMERICA:

-- The House passed a resolution condemning efforts to boycott and economically isolate Israel over its policies toward Palestinians. Mike DeBonis reports: “The 398-to-17 vote comes after months of turmoil centering on Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), two Muslim freshmen who have stood accused of anti-Semitism over public remarks they have made referencing Israel and the Holocaust. The congresswomen, repeatedly singled out by President Trump in the past week, opposed the resolution, arguing that it infringes on free speech and the right to participate in boycotts for human and civil rights. Trump renewed his attacks on Omar on Tuesday, calling her an ‘America hating anti-Semite’ in a tweet. … ‘You want to criticize the government? That’s your right. You want to stop buying products from a certain country? That’s also your right,’ said House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.). ‘But participating in an international commercial effort that undermines Israel’s legitimacy and scuttles the chances of a two-state solution isn’t the same as an individual exercising First Amendment rights.’”

-- Omar’s Republican challenger in Minneapolis, a special education teacher, appears to be a QAnon conspiracy theorist. Danielle Stella’s Twitter account follows a number of prominent QAnon promoters and twice last week posted using a hashtag referencing the QAnon motto. On Monday, she shared a picture of herself wearing a “Q” necklace, symbolism that didn’t go unnoticed by QAnon trackers. (Daily Beast)

FBI Director Christopher Wray testifies before a Senate committee on Tuesday. (Susan Walsh/AP)

-- FBI Director Chris Wray said that the bureau has recorded about 100 domestic terrorism arrests this year and that most of those investigations involve white supremacy. Matt Zapotosky reports: “Asked for more specific data, an FBI spokeswoman clarified after Wray’s testimony that the bureau has recorded about 90 domestic terrorism arrests, compared with about 100 international terrorism arrests. … Wray said the bureau does not investigate any group merely for its beliefs. But when those beliefs produce violence, he said, ‘we’re all over it.’”

-- Fox News helped radicalize terrorist Cesar Sayoc, who pleaded guilty in March to mailing improvised explosive devices to 13 people, his lawyers claim in a sentencing memo: “Mr. Sayoc began watching Fox News religiously and following Trump supporters on social media. He became a vocal political participant on Facebook, something he had not done previously. He was not discerning of the pro-Trump information he received, and by the time of his arrest, he was ‘connected’ to hundreds of right-wing Facebook groups. Many of these groups promoted various conspiracy theories and, more generally, the idea that Trump’s critics were dangerous, unpatriotic, and evil … They deployed provocative language to depict Democrats as murderous, terroristic, and violent … Fox News furthered these arguments. For example, just days before Mr. Sayoc mailed his packages, Sean Hannity said on his program that a large ‘number of Democratic leaders [were] encouraging mob violence against their political opponents.’” (Erik Wemple)

-- Dallas financier and political schmoozer Ed Butowsky was a central promoter of the Seth Rich conspiracy theory, urging Fox News to dedicate airtime to the inflammatory and unsubstantiated story that Rich leaked Democratic National Committee documents to WikiLeaks and was killed for doing so. Butowsky, who at the time was on friendly terms with former White House officials Steve Bannon and Sean Spicer, pursued and promoted his theory to Fox News and members of the Trump administration as he offered to foot the bill for a private investigator for Rich’s parents.

What do we want?



For Congress to declare a #ClimateEmergency



When do we want it? #ClimateActionNow pic.twitter.com/h57w4mqjAE — Extinction Rebellion Washington DC (@XRebelDC) July 23, 2019

-- A group of environmental activists superglued themselves to the walls of the U.S. Capitol in a call for action on the “climate emergency.” Felicia Sonmez and Mike DeBonis report: “Some of the protesters were draped in bright yellow police tape, while others were wearing placards reading, ‘Due to the climate emergency, Congress is shut down until sufficient action is taken to address the crisis.’ A group of activists had used Gorilla Glue to fasten their hands to the doorjambs of a tunnel connecting the Capitol to the House office buildings, according to a participant who declined to give his full name. About 15 other people were helping, he said. … Members of the group said they are calling for a vote on legislation introduced by Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.) and Earl Blumenauer (Ore.) that would declare a climate emergency. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who is running for president, is also a backer of the measure.”

-- People are throwing buckets of water at New York police officers, and the department’s leaders are blaming politicians’ “anti-police rhetoric” for the attacks. Timothy Bella reports: “Police Department Chief Terence Monahan described the water-tossers as ‘reprehensible.’ New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democratic presidential contender, also condemned the actions. ‘Completely unacceptable,’ de Blasio tweeted on Monday about the Manhattan incident. ‘The NYPD kept New Yorkers safe through the heat wave and last night’s outages. We won’t tolerate this kind of disrespect.’ But some police union leaders seized on the videos as a reason to slam elected leaders, including de Blasio, whom they have frequently criticized for his stance on controversial police shootings and other policy matters.”

-- Sexism watch: The women running for president are constantly being asked how being a woman may affect their chances of winning the race. So far, none of them are emphasizing the “glass ceiling.” From the Times: “In politics, the phrase became associated with the aspirations of Hillary Clinton, who spoke at key moments of success and defeat about cracking the glass ceiling. But in this barrier-breaking field of female candidates, it is noticeably absent. … Nobody has used the allegory quite like Mrs. Clinton, who has for years talked about the ‘highest, hardest glass ceiling’ she was determined to crack … And then, of course, there was the fateful night at the Javits Center in Manhattan, under a literal glass ceiling where confetti shaped like glass shards was supposed to rain from above as Mrs. Clinton acknowledge victory … ‘I remember thinking that the symbolism was going to feel so satisfying,’ said Emma Gray, 31, who reports on women’s issues for HuffPost and remembers staring upward during a quiet moment at the Javits Center on election night. ‘We were under a literal glass ceiling and that ceiling was going to metaphorically shatter. And then it did not.’”

-- Maya Harris, a former ACLU leader and one of the editors of a book about mass incarceration, is exactly the type of person you think would criticize former prosecutor Kamala Harris for her policies. Instead, she’s managing her sister's campaign for president. Ben Terris profiles their relationship: “’If people knew who Kamala was, and really what she believes and really where her heart is,’ Maya said. ‘I think it would be hard not to reach the conclusion that this is the person who would be the most passionate advocate for the things we’ve been fighting for for a long time.’ … Questions of who [Kamala] is, what sits at her core, and why exactly she wants to be president have become central to her campaign and chances of winning. Few, if anyone, have had these concerns about Maya, and Maya doesn’t have these concerns about Kamala. Her trick then, in her own words, is this: ‘How do you bridge the gap between what you know about someone, and what people think about someone?’”

Facebook and Other Big Tech Stocks Are Barely Moving on the DoJ’s New Probe. Here’s Why.,https://www.barrons.com,['Eric J. Savitz'],,,,https://www.barrons.com/articles/doj-investigation-tech-stocks-51563989279,"Text size

Large-cap tech shares are mostly shrugging off the news that the U.S. Department of Justice plans to review “the practices of market-leading online platforms.” Indeed, today’s news is brimming with reports on regulatory actions against tech businesses—but the real market moving news on tech this week will be financial.

Facebook (ticker: FB) reports earnings Wednesday; Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) report Thursday. On Tuesday, Snap (SNAP) reported huge user growth, and the stock is on fire. Investors don’t believe that Washington’s investigations will have a material impact on big tech’s financial results, so they are largely ignoring them for now.

It’s a busy day on the regulatory front, even aside from the DoJ story.

Facebook (FB) reached an agreement with the Federal Trade Commission to pay a $5 billion fine over the company’s data privacy practices. In announcing the penalty, the FTC said the agreement also “requires Facebook to restructure its approach to privacy from the corporate board-level down, and establishes strong new mechanisms to ensure that Facebook executives are accountable for the decisions they make about privacy, and that those decisions are subject to meaningful oversight.”

Facebook said the agreement “provides a comprehensive new framework for protecting people’s privacy and the information they give us.”

But Democrats on the Commission observed that the penalties were more or less meaningless in the larger scheme of things—something investors had already figured out.

“The proposed settlement does little to change [Facebook’s] business model or practices,” writes Commissioner Rohit Chopra in a dissenting opinion. “The settlement imposes no meaningful changes to the company’s structure or financial incentives, which led to these violations. Nor does it include any restrictions on the company’s mass surveillance or advertising tactics. Instead, the order allows Facebook to decide for itself how much information it can harvest from users and what it can do with that information, as long as it creates a paper trail.”

Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter writes in her own dissent that in the interest of shedding a spotlight on Facebook’s behavior, the FTC should have litigated the matter. “The Commission would better serve the public interest and be more likely to effectively change Facebook by fighting for the right outcome in a public court of law,” she writes.

Meanwhile, Facebook yesterday also reached a deal with the Securities and Exchange Commission to pay a $100 million fine “for making misleading disclosures regarding the risk of misuse of Facebook user data,” a case tied to the Cambridge Analytica scandal. (On Wednesday, Netflix happened to unveil a new documentary on Facebook and the Cambridge Analytica story called The Great Hack.)

Additionally, The Wall Street Journal reports that Apple (APPL) appears to be favoring its own apps in App Store searches. The Journal writes that “the company’s apps ranked first in more than 60% of basic searches, such as for ‘maps,’ the analysis showed. Apple apps that generate revenue through subscriptions or sales, like Music or Books, showed up first in 95% of searches related to those apps.”

While the DoJ announcement Tuesday didn’t name names, there’s little mystery about which companies the government has in mind.

“The Department’s review will consider the widespread concerns that consumers, businesses, and entrepreneurs have expressed about search, social media, and some retail services online,” the government said in a press release.

“The goal of the Department’s review is to assess the competitive conditions in the online marketplace in an objective and fair-minded manner and to ensure Americans have access to free markets in which companies compete on the merits to provide services that users want. If violations of law are identified, the Department will proceed appropriately to seek redress.”

The language suggests they are going after four of the world’s largest companies by market cap—Alphabet’s Google unit dominates search, Facebook rules social media, and Amazon.com is synonymous with online retail. Apple likely falls under the online retail rubric, as well, given its dominant App Store platform.

A spokesman for Google declined to comment on the DoJ announcement directly, and instead pointed to testimony last week by Adam Cohen, Google’s director of economic policy, during a House subcommittee hearing on online platforms. “In the face of intense competition, we are proud of our record of continued innovation,” he said. “We have helped reduce prices and expand choice for consumers and merchants in the U.S. and around the world. We have created new competition in many sectors, and new competitive pressures often lead to concerns from rivals. We have consistently shown how our business is designed and operated to benefit our customers.”

Apple declined to comment on the DoJ announcement, while Facebook and Amazon didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

Microsoft (MSFT), largely a cloud play now and the world’s most valuable public company, was once the government’s favorite tech target. It appears to have avoided the investigators this time around.

It’s not entirely clear how the DoJ announcement relates to previous news that the FTC and the Justice Department had agreed to divvy up their investigatory responsibilities, with Justice taking on Apple and Google, and the FTC focusing on Amazon and Facebook. But the overall intent seems the same—to curb the behavior of tech giants.

So how is this likely to play out?

Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a research note Wednesday that any push to break up the companies is likely to fail. Current antitrust law is intended to protect consumers against predatory pricing, not punish companies for being big and successful.

In the cases of Google and Facebook, the companies don’t charge for their primary products—so there’s no pricing, let alone predatory pricing. To assess the market effect of the companies on other measures isn’t impossible, but, Ives notes, it would likely require changes in antitrust law, and in the current political mood in Washington, that seems “exceedingly unlikely.”

Legislation could have a more immediate impact, though, particularly the pending California Consumer Privacy Act, which Barron’srecently covered. The law goes into effect in January and is intended to force changes in the way companies collect and sell personal information. For Google and Facebook, and increasingly for Apple and Amazon, the ability to sell targeted ads is of huge value. Federal legislation to do the same could be the route to real change in the tech business, with a higher probability of success than antitrust enforcement.

Ives predicts that Congress and the DoJ will investigate, and find “no harm, no foul.” He thinks investors should buy all of the big four stocks on any weakness relating to the investigations.

In afternoon trading, Facebook is down 0.4% to $201.51; Alphabet is down 1.2%, to $1,134.75; Apple is down 0.4%, to $208.03; and Amazon is 0.3%, to $1988.95. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is up 0.4%.

A crackdown on working from home is pushing the EPA’s workforce in Boston to the brink,https://www.bostonglobe.com,[],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2019/07/24/limits-telework-could-last-straw-embattled-epa-workers-say/eD4WGzT3XQ2NFV1198xcKL/story.html,"“There’s a lot of things this administration has done that makes it difficult to work here, but this is the first thing that’s really hit staff on a personal level,” said a public liaison for superfund site cleanups who moved to Exeter, N.H. — a nearly two-hour train ride from Boston — in part because of her ability to work from home two days a week, which allows her to pick up her 2-year-old from day care.

The Trump administration’s disregard for the Environmental Protection Agency’s mission has riled many agency veterans, particularly when it comes to sustainability and climate change. But a new crackdown on working from home is pushing the already beleaguered workforce in Boston to the brink.

Like other EPA employees who talked to the Globe, she asked that her name not be used.

The directive has left some staff members scrambling to find last-minute help with child care, the employee said. Others are looking for new jobs.

“This could be the last straw,” she said.

The new policy on remote work requires that, as of Aug. 4, the 10,000 EPA employees around the country who are members of the American Federation of Government Employees must be in the office at least four days a week, including those with compressed work schedules. The directive is part of a widespread attempt to reduce the federal workforce by eroding workers’ rights and driving out career employees who may disagree with President Trump’s beliefs, labor analysts say.

The limits on remote work, which was previously allowed two days a week, are part of a new contract that management refers to as a collective bargaining agreement and the union, which was not involved in any bargaining, calls an illegal “unilateral edict.” The contract also puts new restrictions on union activity, curtailing the amount of time union representatives can spend helping employees during the workday; prohibits union officials from using EPA office space and e-mail addresses for official union work; limits the grievance process; and makes it easier for the agency to fire and discipline workers.

These restrictions align with three executive orders issued by Trump in 2018 to curb the power of federal unions. With these orders being challenged in court, labor analysts say, the administration appears to be trying to instead implement them agency by agency.

Similar contract fights are roiling other government agencies, along with directives that labor analysts say are intended to weaken and reduce the government workforce, such as moving two Department of Agriculture scientific offices from Washington, D.C., to Kansas City and relocating the majority of the staff at Bureau of Land Management headquarters from D.C. to west of the Rockies.

Two-thirds of the roughly 400 employees affected by the USDA move to the Kansas City area have said they would not move, according to the department.

EPA employees are well aware of Trump’s disdain for their agency. During his presidential campaign, Trump said he wanted to eliminate the EPA; after he was elected, officials talked of reducing the workforce by half.

Boston EPA employees held a rally July 16 to protest the policy changes, and railed at managers during a meeting the same day. The fact that the agency did not provide any explanation about their decision to reduce telework, simply saying it was going to improve efficiency, infuriated the staff. “To not provide any evidence in a science organization is not acceptable,” one person said, according to employees in the meeting.

In the Boston office, union president Steve Calder estimates that around 90 percent of the 450 employees in his bargaining unit work from home one or two days a week. Those who work four days a week will no longer be allowed to work from home at all.

“Morale is in the toilet,” said Calder, noting that some workers are blaming the union for the loss of remote work days because it refused to negotiate. “The Trump administration loves chaos. . . . That’s part of their MO: chaos, infighting, fear.”

Talks between the EPA and the union ground to a halt in mid-June, when AFGE filed a grievance over the agency’s effort to renegotiate the entire contract and walked away from the bargaining table. On July 8, the EPA implemented a new contract, a spokesperson said, “as is the agency’s right following the union’s refusal to bargain.”

“The contract provides more accountability and efficiency in dealings between the union, employees, and management, consistent with the direction set by the Administration,” the spokesperson said.

Already, so many longtime employees have left the EPA nationwide that there is a significant experience gap among the ranks, according to a scientist in the Boston office. And the recent changes will only add to the brain drain. “There will be more longer term damage in the loss of institutional knowledge,” she said.

And that is exactly the point, said David Madland, senior fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress. Anyone who has scientific evidence showing that climate change is caused by humans and is capable of causing significant harm, for instance, is a threat to Trump’s beliefs, Madland said. Earlier this month, a State Department intelligence analyst resigned after the White House blocked parts of his written testimony to Congress citing evidence that climate change is a threat to national security.

“By weakening unions and undermining expertise, it gives Trump greater power to do what he wants without anyone having the ability to challenge him on it,” Madland said.

But according to John York, a policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, federal unions are in need of reform. Public sector employees already have more statutory protections than workers in the private sector, he said.

Federal unions are pushing back particularly hard since the Supreme Court’s Janus decision, he said, which reduced unions’ ability to collect fees from workers and put them on the defensive.

“Many of the forgotten men in Trump’s base see federal employees as more protected, higher paid, less hard-working than they are,” said York, who nonetheless insisted that the union changes were not politically motivated. “I think Trump’s efforts are trying to get federal personnel practices more in line with the rest of the labor market.”

An attorney at the Boston EPA office noted that, like other employees, she could have made more money in the private sector. But, in addition to believing in the mission, the attorney valued the benefits and flexibility of working for the government. Now all of that is under fire.

The administration’s attitude seems to be: “We’re going to make it difficult for you to carry out your mission of using science and the law to protect the environment,” said the attorney, who lives an hour south of Boston and had been planning to increase her remote-work schedule so she could do more day care drop-offs and pickups. “And now we’re also going to make it difficult for you to spend time with your families.”

The clampdown at the EPA is part of an “unmistakable pattern” of hostility toward public servants, said Sharon Block, a former labor adviser to former president Barack Obama who runs the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard Law School.

And the repercussions could go far beyond the current workforce.

“There’s just a point at which you can’t help but impact the level of service,” she said, “when you’ve so degraded those who provide the service.”

Ethics Office Examines Allegations That Interior Dept. Officials Violated Transparency Laws,https://www.nytimes.com,['Coral Davenport'],07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/23/climate/interior-department-freedom-of-information.html,"Mr. Trump’s first appointee to head the E.P.A., Scott Pruitt, and his first appointee to head the Interior Department, Ryan Zinke, resigned last year after thousands of pages of documents released under Freedom of Information Act requests raised questions about matters such Mr. Pruitt’s alleged spending abuses, first-class travel and relationships with lobbyists, and Mr. Zinke’s efforts to secure taxpayer-funded perks for his wife.

Both men have said that the criticism of their actions was politically and personally motivated, and that they did nothing wrong.

Last year, the Interior Department implemented a new “awareness policy” regarding requests for information and public records under the Freedom of Information Act. The new policy requires career staff reviewing such requests to notify politically appointed officials if their names or email addresses appear in documents that have been designated to be released.

That policy, watchdog groups say, has allowed top officials appointed by President Trump to then withhold or delay the release of such information. “The upshot is that, in practice, the policy has morphed from a procedure that provides awareness to political appointees to one that allows political appointees to unlawfully withhold and delay documents,” said Travis Annatoyn, senior counsel at Democracy Forward, a watchdog group that has requested an Interior Department investigation into the matter.

A spokeswoman for the Interior Department, Molly Block, declined to comment and referred to the Interior Department’s website, which includes a document describing the policy. The page says the policy is intended to streamline the process of the agency’s response to increased Freedom of Information Act requests."

The full House vote came after the House Oversight and Reform Committee subpoenaed the Commerce and Justice departments earlier this year for documents relating to since-abandoned efforts to put a citizenship question on the 2020 census.

The panel voted largely along party lines last month to hold Barr and Ross in contempt for failing to comply with those subpoenas.

Madoff Seeks Sentence Reduction for Epic Ponzi Scheme,https://time.com,['Associated Press'],,,,https://time.com/5634469/bernie-madoff-sentence-reduction-doj/,"NEW YORK — Epic Ponzi schemer Bernard Madoff is seeking an early release from prison after a decade behind bars.

The Department of Justice confirmed Wednesday that Madoff has a pending request to get a reduction of the 150-year sentence that a federal judge in Manhattan imposed in 2009 with the public furor over his multibillion-dollar fraud at its height.

It was unclear when the 81-year-old Madoff filed papers asking President Donald Trump, who has final say on clemency, to commute his term he’s serving at a North Carolina prison. Ira Sorkin, the lawyer who represented Madoff in his criminal case, declined comment on Wednesday.

Madoff pleaded guilty to orchestrating the largest Ponzi scheme in history. He admitted swindling thousands of clients out of billions of dollars in investments over decades.

A court-appointed trustee has recovered more than $13 billion of an estimated $17.5 billion that investors put into Madoff’s business. At the time of his arrest, fake account statements were telling clients they had holdings worth $60 billion.

The justice department’s website signals commutation of a sentence is a longshot, calling it “an extraordinary remedy.” Grounds for granting it “have traditionally included disparity or undue severity of sentence, critical illness or old age, and meritorious service rendered to the government by the petitioner,” it says.

Victims of the petitioner can submit objections before clemency is granted or denied by the president.

Without clemency, Madoff is almost certain to die in custody. The Bureau of Prisons lists his release date as Nov. 14, 2139.

Brooklyn resident Arleigh Louison, 53, was arrested by Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) agents who executed a federal search warrant at his office, the press release said.

Louison’s arrest comes less than a week after a federal grand jury returned a 12-count indictment, charging him with presenting false adjustment of status petitions to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services Service Center in St. Albans, Vt.

The Office of the United States Attorney for the District of Vermont, which conducted the probe, said Louison made false statements in connection with Form I-360 petitions for status adjustments under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), a law that enables immigrants to become lawful permanent residents (LPRs) of the U.S. if they were abused by a relative who is a U.S. citizen or LPR.

Louison allegedly submitted false information in the VAWA petitions so petitioners could secure work authorization permits. Last week’s indictment charged that the petitioners – who paid Louison for his services – were not abused as described in the petitions and never discussed abuse with Louison.

"The Justice Department’s new Big Tech investigation was announced with unusual fanfare, and some antitrust experts say it might not herald as big of a crackdown as it seems",https://www.businessinsider.com,['Troy Wolverton'],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.businessinsider.com/doj-unusual-antitrust-announcement-could-be-good-for-big-tech-2019-7,"The US Department of Justice's surprise press release Tuesday of its Big Tech investigation was designed to send a signal to a lot of groups — but tech companies were not really one of them.

The announcement was an unusually public performance by a federal regulator which typically prizes confidentiality in such matters. That's because it was basically a notice, intended particularly to a key figure in Congress, that the Justice Department will now be spearheading the antitrust investigations into the big tech companies, said David Balto, an antitrust lawyer in Washington D.C. with decades of experience working for and with competition regulators officials there.

For tech companies, the DOJs' announcement was if anything, a subtle indication that the government may not come down as hard on them as it might seem, he said.

""This is good news for the companies,"" Balto said.

That may seem a bit ironic, given the substance of the announcement. In its statement, the Justice Department said it would review the market power of the ""leading online platforms"" to see if they have thwarted competition or harmed consumers. The agency vowed to ""seek redress"" if it found violations, essentially threatening to sue the companies.

Read this: The Department of Justice just launched a broad probe into whether big tech companies like Amazon, Facebook, and others illegally harm competition

The announcement came as something of a surprise. Numerous reports have indicated that the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission were starting to look into the competitive practices of the big tech companies. But the agencies had declined to comment on the record for those reports. In fact, federal enforcement agencies rarely acknowledge ongoing investigations into particular people or companies.

The agency is likely responding to political pressure

Unusual as it was, the Justice Department's move didn't come out of nowhere. Political figures on the left and right, including senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders and President Donald Trump, have been calling for increased scrutiny of the market power of the big tech companies and even, in many cases, for breaking them up.

""There is enormous political pressure on the agencies in Washington to be seen as doing something about big tech,"" said Daniel Crane, a professor at the University of Michigan's law school who focuses on antitrust issues. He continued: ""This is their way of responding to the political pressure.""

But Balto thinks there something more going on. Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported that the FTC and the Justice Department had divvied up oversight over the tech giants. Under the agreement, the FTC was to get authority over Facebook and Amazon, while the Department of Justice would oversee Apple and Google parent Alphabet.

The problem with that arrangement was that Mike Lee, who serves as chairman of Senate Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on antitrust, competition policy and consumer rights, objected to it, Balto noted. In an opinion piece published by the Washington Examiner last month, Lee lambasted the idea that the agencies would split oversight duties over the big tech companies. The two agencies risked duplicating efforts and causing a divergence in enforcement, he said.

""These investigations will clearly cover much of the same ground,"" Lee said in his op-ed. ""Splitting antitrust investigations of these firms between two agencies,"" he continued, ""is just analytically inefficient.""

The Justice Department is saying it's in charge

Lee's subcommittee was scheduled to hold a hearing on Tuesday with top antitrust regulators in the Trump administration at which he was expected to question them over the decision to split up oversight of the tech companies. That hearing ended up being postponed, but, in Balto's view, the Justice Department's announcement was its way of responding to Lee's concerns by staking out its turf.

""This is really the (Justice Department) saying, 'thank you, it's my football, and I plan to play with it,'"" he said.

The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the Justice Department's review would not pre-empt the investigations already underway by the FTC into the companies under its purview.

Balto says that while the Justice Department may leave some issues to the FTC, Tuesday's announcement indicates that the DOJ is laying claim to all inquiries involving online platform and marketplace issues — the core of the antitrust charges made against the big tech companies. Senator Elizabeth Warren and others have raised concerns about how those companies use their control over their platforms and marketplaces to give their own products and services a leg up over rivals.

""These issues are incredibly complex, time consuming, and really difficult, and to have two agencies looking at the same conduct really didn't make sense,"" Balto said.

Lee's office did not respond to calls or an email seeking comment. Likewise, the Justice Department did not respond to an email seeking comment.

The move could be good news for the tech giants

The news that the Justice Department was opening up its review was seen as a negative sign on Wall Street Tuesday. The big four companies' stock prices all fell following the announcement.

But having the Justice Department take point on antitrust review is actually a good thing for the tech companies, Balto said. The Department of Justice hasn't filed a major suit under the Sherman Antitrust Act since the Microsoft case two decades ago. And the agency actually has fewer legal options when it comes to policing competition than does the FTC, he said.

""I don't think anybody's going to lose any more sleep that this is all with the Justice Department,"" Balto said. ""If anything, they'll feel more comfortable in their legal position.""

For his part, Crane is dubious that anything much will come of the investigations in the near future, regardless of which agency is leading the charge. When it comes to antitrust enforcement, the FTC's track record is not much better than the Department of Justice in recent decades, despite theoretically having enhanced enforcement powers, he said.

The courts have made it difficult for regulators to win antitrust cases, and even when such cases are successful, they tend to take many years to play out. Because of that, there's little chance the big tech companies will be broken up anytime soon, despite the political pressure on them, he said.

""The kind of blockbuster, 'let's break them up' case that is being trumpeted politically, I just don't see that being in the offing,"" Crane said.

White House nixed DHS chief McAleenan Refugee Day border welcome for migrants,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/dhs-chief-mcaleenan-wanted-to-visit-border-and-welcome-migrants-for-refugee-day-white-house-said-no,"The White House communications team and the Department of Homeland Security's acting secretary office engaged in a tense argument last month after acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan proposed traveling down to the U.S.-Mexico border on World Refugee Day to celebrate and welcome migrants, including those who entered illegally, two senior administration officials told the Washington Examiner.

A senior public affairs official at DHS asked the White House in early June for permission to go down to the southern border with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar on June 20. One person identified the official as acting DHS Assistant Secretary of Public Affairs Andrew Meehan.

""The wildly off base proposal was met with immediate concern as not being thought through,"" one official told the Washington Examiner Monday evening.

A second official said the White House was concerned about the ""optics"" if two Cabinet officials were welcoming people who had illegally crossed into the country when President Trump has taken a hard stance against any type of illegal immigration, including against those who are seeking asylum on the southern border.

The DHS official trying to advance McAleenan's proposal refused to accept the White House's decision and ""sparred with"" several members of the White House strategic communications team, including then-director Mercedes Schlapp, over ""multiple contentious phone calls,"" the first source said. The second official said the fight lasted ""weeks.""

""The obvious glaring concern was that the border crisis was about migrants and asylums, not refugees, DHS disagreed,"" the first official wrote in a text, suggesting the the appearance would seem supportive of the people abusing the system instead of legitimate refugees.

The same official said Azar was not supportive of McAleenan's idea and was not planning to go along for the trip. The second official said Azar was on board, but added neither secretary ""understood the ramifications"" of such a trip.

The June 20 World Refugee Day celebration may not have been greenlighted but McAleenan did go to the border on that date. He flew with a Washington Post reporter on Thursday. It's not clear if Azar traveled down separately. An HHS spokeswoman would only say: ""In the past year and a half, Secretary Azar has visited numerous Office of Refugee Resettlement facilities and seen the quality of care provided to unaccompanied alien children.

DHS did not deny that McAleenan's office requested a trip on World Refugee Day and instead shared a schedule of events he took part in while on the border that day.

""On June 20, 2019, Acting Secretary McAleenan hosted the first ladies of Guatemala and Honduras for a tour of the Rio Grande Valley Border Patrol Sector,"" a DHS official wrote in an email Thursday. ""The trip included an overview of how transnational criminal and human smuggling organizations pair adult aliens with children they are not related to with the intent of posing as family units to help secure release into the U.S.""

The day after, June 21, the Washington Post published a story leaking confidential details of a nationwide Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation, which five current and former senior administration officials charged to the Washington Examiner that McAleenan leaked because he did not approve of the raids and sought to sabotage them.

""This is a DHS leadership team who has been at odds with the administration from the beginning. It’s a difference of world view,"" the first official said Monday.

The DHS Office of Inspector General has taken up the formal investigation into the leak of government information in late June, which forced ICE to call off a nationwide operation, the Washington Examiner was first to report.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

"Crackdown on food stamps could worsen hunger, USDA acknowledges",https://www.politico.com,['Helena Bottemiller Evich'],07-23-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/23/food-stamp-crackdown-usda-3625454,"The Trump administration's proposed rule would cut 3.1 million people from the SNAP food stamps program, saving taxpayers about $1.9 billion a year. | Justin Sullivan/Getty Images agriculture Crackdown on food stamps could worsen hunger, USDA acknowledges

The Agriculture Department acknowledged Tuesday that its latest push to cut back on who is eligible for food stamp benefits may worsen food insecurity in the U.S.

The Trump administration has just released a proposed rule seeking to rein in what's known as broad-based categorical eligibility. That policy has allowed 43 states to expand the number of low-income people who qualify for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps.

Story Continued Below

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said the policy is a ""loophole"" that needs to be closed because it's allowed states to bypass ""important eligibility guidelines.""

In a cost-benefit analysis, USDA estimates that tightening the policy would cut 3.1 million people from the program, saving taxpayers about $1.9 billion a year. The department also clearly states that the proposed change ""may also negatively impact food security.""

According to USDA, nearly 12 percent of U.S. households are already food insecure, which means they do not always have access to enough food as a result of a lack of resources.

The proposal is part of a broader Trump administration bid to cut federal aid programs, something conservatives have long argued is necessary as the federal deficit grows.

Broad-based categorical eligibility allows states to confer SNAP eligibility to households if they're receiving some kind of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF. The option allows states to get around the typical asset limits and expands the income limits for SNAP in some cases.

For example, the typical gross income limit for SNAP is 130 percent of the federal poverty level. That comes out to be about $27,000 for a family of three.

By using broad-based categorical eligibility, many states are able to offer SNAP benefits to households with gross income of up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level, which is about $42,000 for a family of three.

""Too often, states have misused this flexibility without restraint,” Perdue said in a statement released as part of the announcement. “The American people expect their government to be fair, efficient, and to have integrity — just as they do in their own homes, businesses, and communities.""

The department now wants to have the expanded eligibility option for states only if the household is receiving a TANF benefit such as subsidized employment, work supports or child care benefits.

USDA acknowledges that millions could lose assistance if the eligibility rule is changed, potentially worsening hunger among many low-income households.

""The proposed rule may also negatively impact food security and reduce the savings rates among those individuals who do not meet the income and resource eligibility requirements for SNAP or the substantial and ongoing requirements for expanded categorical eligibility,"" the department says in its impact analysis.

USDA estimates that about 9 percent of SNAP households would no longer qualify for the program.

The department also estimates that more than 13 percent of all SNAP households with elderly members would lose benefits.

""The proposed rule is relatively less likely to affect households with children — only 7.4 percent are expected to no longer meet eligibility requirements,"" the department said.

The plan would also hurt grocery retailers, according to USDA. The total loss in SNAP benefits would be $3 billion per year, which would be a hit to business at large and small retailers alike, the department said.

For a small retailer, the potential benefit loss might make up less than 5 percent of their typical SNAP business, USDA said.

House Republicans had sought a similar crackdown on broad-based categorical eligibility during the 2018 farm bill debate, but the changes were rejected in the final bipartisan deal.

Anti-hunger advocates and Democrats on Capitol Hill blasted the administration on Tuesday over the proposal, arguing that USDA is essentially going around Congress to enact a policy lawmakers already rejected.

""It is yet another attack on hungry Americans that ignores the clearly stated will of Congress,"" said Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio), chairwoman of the House Agriculture Nutrition Subcommittee.

""The ugly truth no one in this administration wants to admit is this: The economy isn’t working for our most vulnerable,"" Fudge added. ""They still need a hand up, not a heartless, mean-spirited policy.”"
State AGs say EPA violated law with fuel efficiency rollback,https://thehill.com,[],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/454591-state-ags-say-epa-violated-law-with-fuel-efficiency-rollback,"Several state attorneys general said the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) violated the law by informing them as it planned to scale back fuel efficiency requirements for vehicles.

The attorneys say an executive order from the Clinton administration requires the agency to consult with states before proposing standards that would freeze Obama-era fuel requirements for new vehicles.

“The Trump Administration is not only paving the way for polluters, it is doing so illegally. For decades, states have stepped up to protect our planet with cost-saving, pollution-fighting clean car regulations. Trump’s Administration wants to overturn these standards, and failed to follow basic accountability measures in proposing new rules,” New York Attorney General Leticia James said in a statement.

Some states have opposed to the Trump administration's fuel economy rollback because it would prevent them from adopting the stricter fuel efficiency standards currently allowed in California.

New York, along with 11 other states, say they discovered through a Freedom of Information Act request that the agency was discussing the rollback long before they were alerted and asked EPA to open the rule back up for comment.

“The FOIA responses now confirm that the agencies have not complied with the Executive Order. The agencies should accept this supplemental comment into their rulemaking dockets because the delay in submitting the comment is attributable entirely to the agencies’ late responses to the FOIA requests,” the states said in a letter to EPA.

An EPA spokesperson said the agency would respond to the letter through the proper channels.

“As the Administration has long stated, we are pursuing one national standard to provide safe, affordable vehicles for consumers while also improving environmental outcomes,"" the agency said in an email to The Hill.

The letter was signed by Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Washington in addition to New York."
Adam Schiff says DOJ inspector general's work is 'tainted' ahead of FISA abuse report,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-22-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/adam-schiff-says-doj-inspector-generals-work-is-tainted-ahead-of-fisa-abuse-report,"House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz got roped into a politically-motivated scheme to protect President Trump, laying the groundwork to discredit the government watchdog's work as he nears completion of a report on alleged surveillance abuses by the DOJ and FBI.

At the Aspen Security Forum this weekend, Schiff accused top Justice Department officials of pandering to Trump by instigating a ""fast track"" report last year about former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. His comments came as part of a broader answer to a question about whether he has concerns about Attorney General William Barr's review of the origins of the Russia investigation.

Schiff claimed the president wanted McCabe, who briefly took over as acting FBI director after Trump fired James Comey in May 2017, investigated and his pension taken away and suggested someone such as former Attorney General Rod Rosenstein obliged the president by making a referral.

""The inspector general found that McCabe was untruthful. He may very well have been untruthful,"" the California Democrat said, but noted that is not where main his concern lies.

""I have no reason to question the inspector general's conclusion, but that investigation was put on a fast track. It was separated from a broader inspector general investigation, which is still ongoing,"" he said. ""Why was that done? It was done so he could be fired to not get a pension. It was done to please the president when the initiation investigation is tainted. So are the results of that investigation.""

McCabe was fired from the FBI on March 16, 2018, less than two days before he planned to retire on his 50th birthday and collect a full pension, after the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General determined he misled investigators about the role he had in leaking information to the Wall Street Journal in October 2016 about the investigation into the Clinton Foundation.

In April 2018, it was revealed that the Justice Department inspector general referred its findings to the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington for possible criminal charges, and his lawyer confirmed as recently as February that McCabe was still under investigation.

McCabe, whom Trump has accused of planning to carry out an ""illegal and treasonous"" plan to oust him as president, has argued that his firing was an attempt to discredit the FBI and special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

The initiation of the inspector general's inquiry in McCabe happened, Schiff said, ""because the president wanted it politically."" He added, ""Once you go down that road, it leads to disaster.""

Horowitz is nearing the end of another investigation that Trump and his allies are eagerly anticipating. The inspector general announced his investigation into whether the FBI and Justice Department filing of four FISA applications and renewals to surveil former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page was an abuse of the FISA process in March 2018, following requests by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions and members of Congress. House Judiciary Committee ranking member Doug Collins said he expects the inspector general's report to be released this fall after some delays.

This matters because now that Mueller's work is complete, Barr's ""investigation into the investigators"" is underway, and the attorney general has said he is working very closely with Horowitz. The inspector general can recommend prosecutions, and U.S. Attorney John Durham, whom Barr tasked to lead the review, has the ability to convene a grand jury and subpoena people outside of the government. Beyond that, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, has promised a ""deep dive"" into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation after Horowitz completes his work.

Wary of the churning cycle of investigations, Schiff tied Horowitz to Barr, saying, ""this is tainted from the start because it is motivated for a political end and the damage it will do in terms of a chilling impact is of deep concern, um, the damage it will do in terms of trying to cast doubt on things that are not in doubt.""

The question Schiff was asked by and audience member focused on whether he was concerned about how Durham's team reportedly wanted to talk to at least one senior CIA counterintelligence official and a senior CIA analyst who examined Russia's role in meddling in the 2016 election.

He said the inquiries that question ""well substantiated conclusions to essentially politicize the intelligence process and tell analysts that the work will be scrutinized with a political perspective if it runs contrary to the desires of the president. That's a terrible, terrible precedent."""
‘It’s a disaster over there’: Commerce reaches new heights of dysfunction,https://www.politico.com,['Daniel Lippman'],07-22-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/22/wilbur-ross-commerce-department-dysfunction-1424427,"Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross doesn’t hold routine meetings with senior staffers, according to a person familiar with the department’s inner workings, ""Because he tends to fall asleep in meetings."" | Win McNamee/Getty Images Finance & Tax ‘It’s a disaster over there’: Commerce reaches new heights of dysfunction Under Secretary Wilbur Ross, the department is chaotic and adrift.

Constant infighting among top officials. Sudden departures of senior staffers without explanation. A leader who is disengaged and prone to falling asleep in meetings.

The Commerce Department has reached its apex of dysfunction under Wilbur Ross, according to four people with knowledge of the inner workings of the department. The 81-year-old Commerce secretary, who has for months endured whispers that he is on the outs, spends much of his time at the White House to try to retain President Donald Trump’s favor, the sources said, leaving his department adrift.

Story Continued Below

He’s hardly the only top Trump official to seek the president’s approval. But department insiders say they’ve rarely seen Commerce so rudderless — and they say Ross’ penchant for managing upward at the expense of his staff is leading to what one plugged-in observer described as “a disaster over there.”

“With our ongoing trade wars and the census looming, Commerce needs functional leadership to be effective, and right now they just don’t have it,” said Theo LeCompte, a former top Commerce official in the Obama administration who speaks often with former colleagues.

One common complaint: Ross, a successful investor before Trump tapped him as secretary of Commerce, isn’t frequently seen in the building talking to employees or rallying them to do good work.

“He’s sort of seen as kind of irrelevant. The morale is very low there because there’s not a lot of confidence in the secretary,” said a former outside adviser to Commerce who is still in touch with many employees at the department. “He’s not respected in the building.”

Ross doesn’t hold routine meetings with senior staffers, according to a person familiar with the department’s inner workings and a former outside adviser — a departure from past practice that one source attributed to the secretary’s lack of stamina.

“Because he tends to fall asleep in meetings, they try not to put him in a position where that could happen so they’re very careful and conscious about how they schedule certain meetings,” said the former outside adviser. “There’s a small window where he’s able to focus and pay attention and not fall asleep.”

A Commerce official disputed that criticsm, saying that Ross has frequent afternoon meetings, including “long” meetings on the census.

“Secretary Ross is a tireless worker who is the sole decision-maker at the department,"" said Commerce press secretary Kevin Manning. ""He routinely works 12-hour days and travels often, with visits to seven countries and eight states in the last three months to advance the president’s agenda.""

Yet top Commerce officials have pushed to not have Ross called to testify at congressional oversight hearings, according to two sources close to the department, because they fear he isn’t up to the task. “There’s a great deal of effort to shield him from testifying ever again,” said one of the sources.

A Commerce official disputed that and said, “He’s obviously going to have to testify again. … You can’t get through the rest of [congressional appropriations] season without testifying again.”

Ross did testify at an oversight hearing on the census for nearly seven hours in March, and emerged through the ordeal generally unscathed. But according to one person familiar with the department, the consensus among the top ranks of the administration was that it would be best to avoid a repeat appearance.

“There was a great deal of concern to not have him testify expressed from the White House,” this person said, characterizing the instructions as: “‘Don’t do this, people. Don’t do this, he’s probably not the right guy to go there.’”

Ross certainly has other reasons to avoid Congress — namely, the heated dispute between Hill Democrats and the administration over adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201906/3704/1155968404_6052147728001_6051795407001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

In April, Ross offered to send aides to testify on his behalf before a House Appropriations subcommittee, an offer the panel’s Democratic chairman, José Serrano, said showed “stunning disrespect.” Serrano’s Republican counterpart, Robert Aderholt, told Reuters that Ross refused to testify out of “concern that this hearing might focus more on political or legal issues than the budget itself.”

“His relationship with the Hill has deteriorated more and more, and he’s just not interested in dealing with the Hill if he can avoid it,” said a person familiar with the department’s internal discussions.

A Commerce official noted that Ross talked to Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) two weeks ago, and held a party two months ago that a number of senators attended. Another Commerce employee observed, “This administration is very hesitant to do oversight in general or to comply with oversight requests in general.”

There are public signs, however, of apparent unease with Ross as a spokesperson for the administration. At an appearance at the White House in mid-July on an announcement on abandoning the citizenship question in the census, the Commerce secretary stood next to Trump the entire time and was one of three people who didn’t speak. Attorney General Bill Barr, on the other hand, spoke at length.

Ross’ relationship with the White House and with Trump was also damaged by stories that came out in the past 18 months showing that he wasn’t as rich as he had claimed and hadn’t fully divested some stock as he had promised, according to the former outside adviser. (The Commerce official disputed that, arguing that the White House has not cared about these issues.)

Ross’s deputies, meanwhile, are coming under fire of their own as tensions rise withini the department.

Political appointees sometimes close doors right in front of career employees to keep them out of meetings, one former Commerce official in touch with former colleagues said.

Meanwhile, “it’s totally infighting among the politicals,” said another person familiar with the department. “It’s just everybody fighting everybody.” In particular, the relationship between Ross’ office and the legislative affairs team is “clearly broken,” this person said.

Charles “Kolo” Rathburn, who had been acting head of legislative affairs, “was unceremoniously let go” and abruptly left earlier in July, according to a person familiar with Commerce and the outside adviser, who said it had to do with issues of professional conduct in the workplace. Another person familiar with Commerce also confirmed his departure.

“He wasn’t allowed to clean out his office,” said one of the people. Rathburn had replaced Mike Platt, who had left in early May.

A Commerce official said Rathburn, who didn’t respond to requests for comment, is working to pass the bar exam and has an offer for a higher-paying position at a law firm if he does.

Ross Branson, who had been deputy assistant secretary of legislative affairs and was Platt’s deputy, also left Commerce on Friday, according to two people familiar with his departure. He had become “collateral damage,” according to one of the people, and was told that he had to look for a new job. He starts on Monday as head of legislative affairs at the Export-Import Bank, a position that a Commerce official described as “definitely a promotion.” Branson and the Ex-Im Bank did not respond to a request for comment.

Much of the tension inside the building has centered on Earl Comstock, who shepherded Ross’ confirmation on Capitol Hill and is one of the secretary’s top lieutenants as the department's policy director.

The disarray inside Commerce is drawing an intervention from chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and other White House officials, who are trying to figure out how to wrest control from Comstock, who increasingly seems to be involved in everything that happens inside the department.

“Things come to a screeching halt because he demands to be the final decision on everything whether it’s an email that goes out to the Hill or a letter to respond to X, Y and Z,” said a person familiar with Commerce.

Comstock, who didn’t respond to requests for comment, has also been at the center of many of the spectrum battles between the Federal Communications Commission and the departments of Transportation, Education, Commerce and NASA and NOAA, according to an administration official. He has “literally been seeding bad intel and bad information to get other people agitated,” said the official.

He also tried to scuttle a joint White House-FCC summit on 5G, the wireless technology, in April by “calling everyone he could 24 hours before the event trying to get it to be canceled,” this person said. Comstock clashed in particular with former National Telecommunications and Information Administration chief David Redl, who left his post abruptly in May.

Critics of Ross’ leadership at Commerce also have a new target of concern: chief of staff Michael Walsh, who is described by some as inexperienced on policy and difficult to work with.

Walsh didn’t respond to a request for comment, but the Commerce official said that he has good relationships throughout the administration and on the Hill and visits the White House frequently. A second person familiar with Commerce also claimed, “People want his job so they’re spreading bad stuff on him.”

The chaos inside the department has had consequences for some employees.

“There’s great frustration among people who really want to use their skills and talents to help this country and are being marginalized by a White House who doesn’t need to ask any questions because it already thinks it has the answers,” said Roger Fisk, a Commerce official in the Obama administration. “All of that expertise is just lying dormant hiding in plain sight.""

At a time when tourism fears have escalated in the Caribbean, the State Department has stopped publishing crime data involving Americans harmed in Jamaica — but it won't say why.

For the first time in seven years, the State Department did not list how many Americans were sexually assaulted, robbed, murdered or kidnapped in Jamaica in its 2019 Crime and Safety Report. That information was previously published in reports that were cited in a 2018 Free Press investigation, which found that sexual assaults of U.S. tourists in Jamaica is an historic and unchecked problem, with an estimated one American raped a month.

That's according to State Department data that was publicly available for seven straight years — until now.

The Free Press, which interviewed numerous U.S. victims who said they were sexually assaulted in Jamaica, including four Michigan tourists, asked the State Department multiple times why the 2019 report omits data involving American crime victims in Jamaica. The agency wouldn't explain, beyond saying: “We do not have any other information to share at this time.""

These are the choke marks that an 18-year-old South African au pair says she suffered after being drugged and raped at a Sandals-owned beaches resort in Jamaica on July 4, 2018. She says Sandals paid her American host family $25,000 and silenced them with a non-disclosure agreement (Photo: South African au pair)

But the State Department did warn in its 2019 report that ""rape and sexual assault are serious problems throughout Jamaica, including at resorts and hotels. The use of date rape drugs is possible, even at private parties and resorts.""

The Jamaica 2019 Crime and Safety Report was released in the wake of a tourism scare involving the Dominican Republic, where 10 American tourist deaths have been reported since May. Several more U.S. tourists have reported becoming severely ill while on vacation there, including a Detroit man who landed in Harper Hospital's ICU following his May vacation to the DR.

Jamaica and the Dominican Republic are among nine Caribbean and Central American destinations that the U.S. State Department has issued Level 2 travel advisories for, citing violence and crime. Level 2 means “Exercise Increased Caution.” The other countries on the Level 2 travel advisory list are: The Bahamas, Belize, Colombia, Cuba, Turks and Caicos, Mexico and Guatemala.

There are four categories of travel advisories: “Level 1: Exercise Normal Precautions”; “Level Two: Exercise Increased Caution”; “Level 3: Reconsider Travel” and “Level 4: Do Not Travel.”

Caribbean destinations that are currently deemed safe for travel — they have no travel advisory — include:

Anguilla, Antigua, Aruba, Barbados, Bonaire

British Virgin Islands

Cayman Islands

Costa Rica, Curaçao, Grenada

French West Indies, which include Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Saint Martin, and Saint Barthélemy.

Saint Kitts and Nevis

Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines

Countries on the “Level 3, Reconsider Travel” list are:

El Salvador

Honduras

Nicaragua

Haiti

Countries on the “Level 4, Do Not Travel” list are:

Venezuela

While the FBI investigates the Dominican Republic deaths, tourism officials there are working feverishly to dispel concerns about travel safety. So are officials in Jamaica, where an island-wide security audit of resorts was ordered in the wake of the Free Press investigation, which detailed the rapes of two Detroit women who were attacked at gunpoint by a Jamaican resort employee last fall.

Jamaica's Minister of Tourism Edmund Bartlett said in early July that the months-long security audit is complete and that his office is reviewing it. Findings have not yet been released.

“The issue of safety and security is very central to us. We will have further discussions with the (Jamaica Hotel and Tourist Association) as it relates to the recommendations, and together we will craft the new architecture in Jamaica,” Bartlett said at a June tourism meeting.

The audit sought to uncover, among other things, non-compliance by resorts regarding safety incidents. It focused on building safety, personnel, security measures, communication devices and security incident history.

Meanwhile, State Department warnings about sexual violence against women tourists in Jamaica continue.

""If you are a victim of a sexual assault, contact the police and the U.S. Embassy in Kingston as soon as possible,"" the State Department states in its 2019 report, reminding victims that Jamaican hotels and resorts ""should assist you with these communications.""

That message highlighted a key finding in the Free Press investigation.

Numerous victims told the Free Press the resorts ignored or downplayed their fears, discouraged them from going to the police, and in some cases silenced them with free travel in exchange for them signing non-disclosure agreements.

The 2019 State Department report also highlighted this finding by the Free Press: tourists who are sexually assaulted in Jamaica feel justice is out of reach. As one mother told the Free Press three years after her daughter was allegedly raped in a laundry room by a resort lifeguard: ""My daughter will never have justice.""

CLOSE The rapes of two Detroit women at a Jamaican resort has highlighted a pervasive problem on the island getaway: sexual assaults are ignored. Tresa Baldas, Detroit Free Press

Four and a half years after the alleged rapes of the girl and her friend, the case is finally going to trial in Jamaica in December. The victims will testify from a location in the U.S.

The State Department warns about such delays.

""Victims of sexual assault in Jamaica should not expect the same assistance routinely offered in the United States,"" the State Department writes in its 2019 report. ""Rape kits are not always available, and victims must often ask for medication to avoid STD transmission and reduce the chances of pregnancy. An offer of counseling is unlikely.""

Police resources are also limited, the government says.

""Law enforcement shortcomings exist in collection of evidence. Prosecution of rape cases moves very slowly,"" the State Department states, adding: ""Victims may need to return to Jamaica during the legal process.""

WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency’s inspector general will investigate allegations that William L. Wehrum, the agency’s former air quality chief, violated ethics rules when he met with former clients from his days as a lawyer and lobbyist for the oil, gas and coal industries.

The inquiry will look into whether Mr. Wehrum’s efforts at the E.P.A. to weaken climate change and air pollution standards improperly benefited those former clients, a congressional aide said .

At issue are Mr. Wehrum’s ties to the Utility Air Regulatory Group, a coalition of utilities and trade groups that lobbies on behalf of coal-fired power plants, which he represented as a lawyer at his former firm, Hunton & Williams.

That relationship first drew scrutiny last year after Politico reported that the 25 power companies and six trade groups that make up the coalition paid the firm more than $8 million in 2017 just before President Trump appointed Mr. Wehrum. (The law firm is now known as Hunton Andrews Kurth. The Utility Air Regulatory Group announced in May that it would disband after winding down operations.)"

Justice Department officials have communicated to Robert Mueller that the department expects him to limit his congressional testimony this week to the public findings of his 448-page report, according to one current and one former U.S. official familiar with the preparations.

In extensive discussions since the former special counsel was subpoenaed on June 25 to testify, department officials have emphasized that they consider any evidence he gathered throughout the course of his investigation to be “presumptively privileged” and shielded from public disclosure.

Story Continued Below

The Justice Department is “taking the position that anything outside the written pages of the report are things about which presidential privilege hasn’t been waived,” the former U.S. official said.

The White House and the Justice Department, however, have signaled they don’t intend to place lawyers in the room during Mueller’s highly anticipated testimony before the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees on Wednesday.

Without a presence at the hearing, administration officials would have little recourse to prevent Mueller from going off-script and revealing details of his investigation that the White House considers off-limits. They are poised instead to rely on Mueller to self-police his remarks, indicating that they are confident the former special counsel will stick to carefully planned comments that mirror the already disclosed findings of his investigation.

Their stance cuts against President Donald Trump’s own protestation that Mueller shouldn’t be allowed to testify, which he reiterated on Monday. “Highly conflicted Robert Mueller should not be given another bite at the apple,” Trump tweeted on Monday morning.

poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201907/866/1155968404_6062886093001_6062880936001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true

The president has accused Democrats of trying to conduct a “do-over” of Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election — a probe that he has falsely claimed “exonerates” him.

Mueller’s posture will likely deprive Democrats of an opportunity to get a clear answer from Mueller about whether he would have charged Trump with obstruction of justice if he were not the president, among other burning questions. Mueller said publicly after the report’s release that he adhered to a Justice Department policy prohibiting the indictment of a sitting president.

But some Democrats have said that even if Mueller simply reads from his report word for word, it would educate the American public about Trump’s attempts to thwart the Russia probe.

Jim Popkin, a spokesman for Mueller, said he was unsure whether Mueller was in contact with the Justice Department about aspects of his investigation that the administration believes would be off-limits during his testimony.

“In terms of DOJ and the Hill, there have been discussions for purposes of scheduling and clearly … to understand what the expectations are,” Popkin told POLITICO. “But they have not seen the [opening] statement. They’ve not provided the statement to either DOJ or anyone in the House.”

Popkin emphasized that Mueller’s opening statement would stay within “the four walls of the report as much as that is possible.”

Mueller has stated that his congressional testimony would not go beyond what is contained within his report.

The report “contains our findings and analysis, and the reasons for the decisions we made,” Mueller said on May 29. “We chose those words carefully, and the work speaks for itself. The report is my testimony.”

Jay Sekulow, one of Trump’s personal attorneys, said on his radio show Monday that he, too, believes Mueller will not speak publicly about matters outside of his report.

“I think that would be completely unethical to go beyond the report,” Sekulow said, adding that he expects Republicans — who say they are essentially seeking to cross-examine Mueller and press him on the origins of the probe — to also face roadblocks.

The Justice Department’s deference to Mueller cuts against the administration’s handling of efforts by Congress to interview former officials who were crucial witnesses in the special counsel investigation.

White House lawyers have accompanied those high-level witnesses subpoenaed by Congress, including Trump’s former communications director Hope Hicks, to their hearings, objecting to hundreds of questions lobbed at them by Democratic lawmakers on the grounds that any conversations that took place during their time in the White House are subject to presidential privilege claims. The White House has consistently pushed the idea that some current and former advisers are “absolutely immune” from answering questions about their White House tenures.

Negotiations over the scope of Mueller’s testimony have taken place under a veil of secrecy. Justice Department officials have been discussing the parameters of Mueller’s testimony with him and his team ever since the former special counsel was subpoenaed last month.

Attorney General William Barr has said publicly that Mueller is free to testify on Capitol Hill, but he has also said that he would support Mueller if he decides to skip the hearing. The Justice Department has not indicated publicly whether it will direct Mueller to limit his remarks in any way, but a spokesperson said in a cryptic statement that the department expects Mueller to keep his testimony within the bounds of the report.

“As the attorney general has said, we support special counsel Mueller if he wants to testify or if he doesn’t want to testify,” a Justice Department official said. “He has said publicly that his report is his testimony and that is our expectation. We support that approach.”

As a private citizen, Mueller is not bound by assertions of presidential privilege, but he is known as a rule-follower who is unlikely to defy the administration’s direction.

A Judiciary Committee official said the panel does not anticipate that lawmakers will spar with Mueller over matters of presidential privilege.

“[T]hese are private individuals who no longer work at the Department of Justice. And although we acknowledge that these are career department officials who give quite a bit of deference to what the department says, the department cannot order them to do anything,” the Judiciary Committee official said.

Even though Trump and his aides are projecting a hands-off approach, they’ve signaled that they expect Mueller to closely guard the voluminous evidence he gathered about the inner workings of the Trump White House.

Trump’s former counsel Emmet Flood warned the Justice Department in April that it considers any of Mueller’s evidence, other than what’s contained in the public version of his report, “presumptively privileged” and forbidden from public disclosure.

In May, Trump asserted executive privilege over the entirety of Mueller’s report and the underlying evidence as part of a bid to block the House Judiciary Committee’s access to the complete, unredacted report.

Trump invoked the broad privilege claim just minutes before the committee voted to hold Barr in contempt of Congress — a move that came after hours of exhaustive negotiations between the committee and the Justice Department over how to delay the contempt proceedings. The White House later called the committee’s demands “unlawful and reckless.”

"US DOJ Launches Antitrust Review of Amazon, Facebook, Other Tech Giants",https://www.tomshardware.com,"['Lucian Armasu', ""Lucian Armasu Is A Contributing Writer For Tom'S Hardware Us. He Covers Software News"", 'The Issues Surrounding Privacy']",07-24-2019,2019,7,"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/doj-antiturst-review-facebook-amazon-google-apple-tech,40004.html","Credit: Shutterstock

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced this week that the Department’s Antitrust Division is reviewing “whether and how market-leading online platforms have achieved market power and are engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers.” The investigation will look into large technology companies with online services, including Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook.

The DOJ noted in a press release that over the past few years, concerns about search, social media, advertising-related tracking technologies and the practices of some online retail companies have grown significantly.

Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim of the Antitrust Division said:

“Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands.”

This Isn't Tech Giants' First Antitrust Rodeo

Some of these tech giants have already been involved in other antitrust cases. For instance, Google was reviewed in 2011, and the FTC’s investigators ended up recommending antitrust action against the company over their findings, which included anti-competitive tactics that allegedly led to the death of Google Maps competitor Skyhook. However, Google escaped an antitrust lawsuit at the last minute, with FTC Chairman at the time Jon Leibowit ruling against the lawsuit.

Google wasn’t so fortunate in the European Union (EU), where the European Commission launched not one, but three antitrust cases against the company related to its shopping comparison service, Android domination and Google Ads' anti-competitive practices.

Facebook’s largest privacy scandal exploded last year with the revelations about its relationship with Cambridge Analytica, a firm that exploited Facebook’s data APIs to build political profiles on users and manipulate them through ads.

The FTC has now found that Facebook violated its previous settlement with the FTC on multiple occasions, including when it lied to users about facial recognition being turned off and when it was asking users for phone numbers for “security purposes” and then using those numbers for advertising purposes.

The DOJ may also review Amazon’s e-commerce practices. Meanwhile, the EU has recently announced its own antitrust investigation into Amazon, accusing the company of anti-competitive tactics against sellers of its own platform, as well as data collection practices that may violate the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

The Supreme Court recently ruled that Apple can be sued by its own customers (and not just iOS developers, as Apple would have preferred) over antitrust issues connected to its App Store. The Supreme Court said that Apple’s 30% fee on each application is an abuse of monopoly power, because the fee is passed down to its customers, inflating prices.

Usually, it's the FTC that prosecutes antitrust cases; the DOJ hasn't had a high-profile antitrust case since it prosecuted Microsoft in 2011. This could be read in different ways: perhaps the DOJ is as serious about these cases as it was about the Microsoft case. Or maybe it's trying to gain points with a public growing weary of the power of tech giants."

Documents obtained by the AP show a memorandum of understanding between the governor's office and DHS was signed on June 19, two days after Jerry Foxhoven was asked to resign.

State Department: Europeans ‘making a real mistake’ by delaying Maduro sanctions,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/state-department-europeans-making-a-real-mistake-by-delaying-maduro-sanctions,"Leading European allies are undermining negotiations to oust Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro because of their hesitance to impose sanctions on the regime, according to a top U.S. official.

“Many of the Europeans are making a real mistake here, because many of them take the position, while these negotiations are ongoing, we shouldn’t do sanctions,” Elliott Abrams, the State Department’s special representative for the Venezuela crisis, said Wednesday. “And this is exactly wrong, because while they are ongoing, if you want them to succeed, you need to increase the pressure on the regime to compromise.”

Maduro’s envoys have been meeting in Barbados with representatives of top opposition lawmaker Juan Guaidó, whom President Trump and other western powers recognized as the legitimate interim president in January. The U.S. is not a direct party to the talks, which have been mediated by Norway, but the administration has been trying to rally international pressure against the regime while offering amnesty if Maduro steps aside peacefully.

“The United States is not in this for some kind of vengeance,” Abrams said during a discussion at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based think tank with close ties to the administration. “We are attempting to help Venezuelans recover their democracy.”

Guaidó’s team is using the Barbados talks to push for Maduro to step aside and permit free elections to form a new government, the lawmaker’s envoy in Washington confirmed, while endorsing Abrams’ criticism of the European allies.

“We need to increase that pressure from the European countries,” Ambassador Carlos Vecchio said at the forum. “In a certain way, they have been bypassing the sanctions from the U.S. using Europe and we need to close that door.”

Most European Union countries recognize Guaidó, but a handful of nations have thwarted a consensus to crack down on Maduro. The opposition leader’s position has strengthened in recent weeks, however. Greece cut ties with Maduro earlier this month, after a center-right coalition defeated the left-wing leadership that had refused to recognize Guaidó. Maduro was also weakened by a report from the United Nations’ top human rights watchdog, Michelle Bachelet, who confirmed that regime “registered 5,287 killings, purportedly for ‘resistance to authority’” in 2018.

That report “had a real impact on Western Europe,” according to Abrams, who thinks his efforts to convince holdouts such as Italy to back new sanctions might soon bear fruit.

“I hope they do a robust list of individuals involved in human rights violations,” he said. ""We’d also like to see them [impose] travel restrictions, because a lot of the ill-gotten stolen funds of the Venezuelan people are being spent living the high life in Europe, and they should stop that.”

Abrams emphasized that these sanctions should be perceived as part of an effort to convince Maduro to step aside peacefully in exchange for the amnesty offer, even if that deal seems unsatisfying in light of the regime’s apparent crimes.

“If you look at every Latin American transition to democracy that I can think of in the last 30-40 years, there is a negotiation, and there is a kind of transitional justice that isn’t really justice,” he said. “There is always some kind of compromise in which there is no perfect justice because country after country chooses peace, democracy, development over justice, frankly. It’s a compromise. And I think that that will happen in Venezuela."""

Council approves $2B agreement with EPA to upgrade Houston’s sanitary sewers,https://www.houstonchronicle.com,"['Jasper Scherer', 'City Hall Reporter', 'Mike Morris', 'Houston Chronicle', 'Follow Jasper On', 'Follow Mike On', 'Http', 'Joe Graedon', 'M.S.', 'And Teresa Graedon']",07-24-2019,2019,7,https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Council-approves-2B-agreement-with-EPA-to-14121965.php,"Houston agreed to repair or replace at least 150 miles of sanitary sewer pipe each year and install 2,500 “smart” manhole covers in the next five years under a $2 billion consent decree approved by city council Wednesday.

Prompted by hundreds of sewage spills from broken or overwhelmed pipes each year, the agreement with the federal Environmental Protection Agency requires the city to more aggressively inspect, clean, replace or upgrade its sanitary sewer pipes, lift stations and treatment plants during the next 15 years.

The city also must address nine areas that see voluminous sewage spills during rainstorms, and launch a citywide assessment to better prioritize future projects in neighborhoods across the city as part of the consent decree approved by council by a 15-1 vote.

The agreement is expected to result in additional water rate hikes, starting next year.

A rate study incorporating costs related to the decree — a key method by which the EPA enforces the Clean Water Act — is underway.

“We tried to craft a cost-efficient consent decree that will minimize the impact on our ratepayers,” Mayor Sylvester Turner said Wednesday. “This is not one of those issues that we could have just said 'no' and walked away from.”

The measure passed with opposition only from District G Councilman Greg Travis, who said he was concerned the decree did not cap rate increases or how much the city could spend under the agreement.

Travis also said he was told rates would increase 4 percent annually. Turner said that figure is ""factually incorrect"" and suggested the number may have stemmed from an initial proposal in which the city would have spent $5 billion on sewage repairs, an assertion Travis has disputed.

The mayor has said costs will remain ""well below"" 2 percent of the citywide median household income, a threshold set by the EPA to measure affordability. Experts have said the guideline has been ""discredited"" because it obscures the burden on poor families.

For now, city officials are compiling options for how to structure the rate hikes, a process that Public Works Director Carol Haddock said would take until the end of the year. The proposed rate hikes will go before a council committee and include a chance for residents to weigh in publicly, Haddock said.

City council then will vote on the rate hikes, which Turner said would go into effect next April at the earliest. Houston’s water rates typically rise each April to adjust for inflation, per city ordinance.

The consent decree dictates how the city must reduce spills across its more than 6,200 miles of sewers, and details projects Houston must tackle in the first few years at its larger facilities, including 384 lift stations and 39 treatment plants.

To guide future repairs in neighborhoods that struggle with backups, the decree mandates that Houston’s entire sewer system be inspected each decade, beginning in the first two years with 1,500 miles of gravity-fed pipes typically in areas with known spill problems. The mandate also commits the city to clean all gravity pipes smaller than two feet in diameter every decade.

The citywide inspections are meant to help the city choose which items to repair first under the decree’s other mandates. They force the city each year to:

repair or replace at least 2.5 percent (today, about 150 miles) of its gravity-fed pipes and associated manholes and 5 percent (today, 18) of its lift stations, and

preventively clean at least 275 miles of gravity pipes smaller than two feet in diameter in areas with known spill problems.

The proposal also commits the city to:

come up with plans to reduce spills in nine areas where large spills occur during heavy rains, and to fix seven of them within a decade; these sites include areas near Denver Harbor, NRG Stadium, Gulfgate, Alief, the University of Houston-Downtown and near the intersection of Parker and Interstate 69.

study whether to install larger pipes anytime a pipe is scheduled for repair or replacement, and in any area where more than three spills or any spills topping 100,000 gallons were reported in the prior three years;

expand the number of “smart manholes” — which track rising water levels in the pipes to flag blockages — from 300 to 3,000 within 5 years; and

continue its program of educating the public not to pour oil, fats and grease down the drain.

Council approved the decree Wednesday despite reservations from Bayou City Waterkeeper, an environmental nonprofit that urged the city to adopt a “community engagement plan” to seek more public input before passing the agreement. The group also wants the city to support tripling the default 30-day comment period that will begin once the decree is filed in federal court; it is a legal document and does not take effect until a judge approves it.

“While a week allowed our organization a chance to review and begin to understand the decree, a week is not enough to minimally engage the residents of Houston about the way the consent decree will impact their lives — from fixing sewage pollution in neighborhoods across Houston to explaining the need for rate increases across the city,” Executive Director Jordan Macha wrote in a letter to city officials.

As part of the decree, the city also must pay $4.6 million in penalties, including attorney’s fees to the Texas attorney general’s office.
