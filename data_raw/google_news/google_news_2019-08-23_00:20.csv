The 38 most bizarre lines from Donald Trump's wild impromptu news conference,https://www.cnn.com,"['Analysis Chris Cillizza', 'Cnn Editor-At-Large']",08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/22/politics/trump-press-conference-best-lines/index.html,"(CNN) There's nothing President Donald Trump likes more than bantering with the media.

Witness his nearly hour-long impromptu news conference Wednesday at the White House -- all while his aides stood waiting for him to board Marine One for a speech to a veterans group in Kentucky. Trump prowled up and down the line of reporters -- bullying some, cajoling others and taking question after question after question.

In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!

I went through the entire transcript of Trump's press conference and picked out the ""best"" lines. They're below.

1. ""But our economy is the strongest in the world, by far. Nothing even close. And a lot of good things are happening.""

2. ""I was right, and just about everybody admits that. I was right.""

Trump is talking here about the Federal Reserve but, really, he could be talking about anything in the world and he would still believe it.

3. ""[Fed Chair Jerome Powell] raised interest rates too fast, too furious.""

""I live my life a quarter-mile at a time."" -- Dominic Toretto/Vin Diesel

4. ""Oh, I have an appetite for background checks. We're going to be doing background checks.""

""Trump cools on background check push in recent lawmaker conversations"" -- CNN, August 20

5. ""But there are certain weaknesses, and we want to fix the weaknesses. And I think that'll happen. Let's see what happens.""

Trump's answer on whether background checks will be expanded should be in the vague answers Hall of Fame.

6. ""Denmark, I looked forward to going, but I thought that the Prime Minister's statement -- that it was absurd; that it was an absurd idea -- it was nasty. I thought it was an inappropriate statement. All she had to do is say, 'No, we wouldn't be interested.'""

OK, so. Trump wanted to buy Greenland, which is owned by Denmark. The Danes said no. But it was the way they said ""no"" that pissed Trump off. Everyone knows ""absurd"" is fighting words, right? RIGHT?

7. ""But all they had to do is say, 'No, we'd rather not do that,' or 'We'd rather not talk about it.' Don't say, 'What an absurd idea that is.'""

Did someone just say ""absurd""?!?!?! [Looks around for someone to fight]

8. ""I want guns to be in the hands of people that are mentally stable. And those people, I want them to easily be able to get a gun. But people that are insane, people that are sick up here [points to head], I don't want them to be able to get a gun.""

The President of the United States on guns: Sane people = good. Insane people = bad? Trump's take on gun policy is, uh, pretty rudimentary.

9. ""We're working on background checks. There are things we can do. But we already have very serious background checks. We have strong background checks. We can close up the gaps. We can do things that are very good and things that, frankly, gun owners want to have done. But we also have to remember the gun doesn't pull the trigger, a person does. And we have great mental illness.""

I dare you to figure out what Trump actually wants to do on guns from this word salad. And I know what he meant, but ""we have great mental illness"" doesn't sound all that good.

10. ""We're looking at a lot of different things relative to Antifa. Antifa, in my opinion, is a terrorist organization. You see what they've been doing. We've had great support on that. We're looking at various different things.""

""Great support"" on what, exactly?

11. ""No President has ever done anywhere close to what I've done between Golan Heights, Jerusalem, Iran -- and other things.""

He is always the first. And the best. Especially on those all-important ""other things.""

12. ""No President has done what I've done.""

FACT CHECK: True!

13. ""[Rep. Rashida Tlaib] had a plan to greatly embarrass Israel by going there with the fact that she wanted to see her grandmother. I assume that's true. I hope that's true. But it was very bad.""

In which Trump, as he so often does, questions whether the Democratic Michigan congresswoman was actually going to Israel to visit her grandmother without actually asserting that she wasn't.

14. ""In my opinion, you vote for a Democrat, you're being very disloyal to Jewish people and you're being very disloyal to Israel. And only weak people would say anything other than that.""

Yes, Trump is doubling down on his very controversial ""dual loyalty"" claims here. But he's also revealing what he believes to be the worst trait in a person: Being ""weak.""

15. ""I think that if you vote for a Democrat, you're very, very disloyal to Israel and to the Jewish people.""

He never, ever backs down . No matter what. He believes it to be a sign of, wait for it, weakness.

16. ""That was outsmarting Obama. So, Russia outsmarted President Obama. They took over during his term, not during mine -- Crimea.""

OK, so Russia seized Crimea from the Ukraine by force. But that was really because President Barack Obama was ... not smart? Huh!

17. ""They were taken out because Putin outsmarted -- on Crimea, on the red line, on other things -- totally outsmarted Obama. Obama was upset; they took them out.""

This is a stunning rewrite of history. Russia was removed from the G8 because they annexed land controlled by another country. They were not removed from the G8 because Obama was mad that Russian President Vladimir Putin had somehow outsmarted him.

18. ""The fake news, of which many of you are members, is trying to convince the public to have a recession. 'Let's have a recession.'""

This is obviously just Trump saying stuff. BUT: The idea that reporters are rooting for a recession, which would undoubtedly cost people their jobs in our industry and practically every other one, is patently ridiculous.

19. ""This isn't my trade war. This is a trade war that should have taken place a long time ago by a lot of other Presidents.""

20. ""Somebody had to do it. I am the chosen one. Somebody had to do it.""

21. ""I was put here by people -- I was put here by people to do a great job. And that's what I'm doing. And nobody has done a job like I've done.""

A totally normal statement from the President of the United States!

22. ""The Prime Minister used a terrible word when describing something that we've been talking about for years with our country.""

[narrator voice] The word was ""absurd.""

23. ""She shouldn't treat the United States that way by saying, 'What an abs-...' She said 'absurd.' That's not the right word to use: 'absurd.'""

Look, I warned you guys about using that word! So now it's on. [Jumps into crowd like Amir Garrett taking on the entire Pirates team

24. ""We're building tremendous numbers of miles of wall right now in different locations. It all comes together likes a beautiful puzzle.""

25. ""This guy is the most biased reporter. NBC. You know, I made a lot of money for NBC with 'The Apprentice' and I used to like them, but they are the most biased.""

The person in question is NBC's White House reporter Peter Alexander. What did he say that set Trump off? ""Joe Biden's gaffes."" Yes, that's it.

26. ""I am the least racist person ever to serve in office, OK? I am the least racist person.""

The least racist person doesn't spend a ton of time talking about how they are the least racist person.

27. ""In six years, when I'm not here, The New York Times goes out of business very quickly.""

Put a pin in this. I'll take any and all bets of people willing to gamble that in 2025 The New York Times is out of business. Literally, set the line at five years from 2020. I will take the over on every bet.

28. ""There are many, many things in play. People are talking about videos. People are talking about lots of different things. But we do have a way of bringing what we already have, because we have many, many -- as you know, we have many, many people that are unable to buy guns right now. Many people are unable to buy guns.""

Trump regularly talks in circles. But when he talks about guns and the way forward on gun control(or not) he takes it to a whole other level.

29. ""And you know, we can't let that slope go so easy that we're talking about background checks, then all of a sudden we're talking about, 'Let's take everybody's gun away.'""

This is a favorite argument of the NRA but bears very little connection to reality. Making sure everyone who buys a gun has to submit to a background check isn't even on the same planet as the government coming to peoples' houses and demanding they turn their guns over. Ridiculous.

30. ""You approve one thing, then another thing, then another thing, then all of a sudden you're on that slope, and all of a sudden nobody has any legal protection.""

Donald Trump on slippery slopes. Very detailed stuff here.

31. ""We wiped out the caliphate, 100%. I did in record time.""

Was there a previous record for wiping out ISIS that I am unaware of? Also, this

32. ""I went to the hospitals. It was totally falsely reported. There were beautiful, beautiful, very sad, you know, horrible moments. But there were beautiful moments, in the sense that these people -- the families and also the people that were so badly injured that I was with -- they love our country.""

This is Trump on his hospital visit to victims of mass shootings in Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso, Texas. Very beautiful. Also sad. And horrible. But also beautiful.

33. ""So when I went to Dayton, and when I went to El Paso, and I went into those hospitals, the love for me -- and me, maybe, as a representative of the country -- but for me -- and my love for them was unparalleled.""

So, the big takeaway from Trump's visits to mass shooting victims was that they really loved him. Like, a lot.

34. ""The doctors were coming out of the operating rooms. There were hundreds and hundreds of people all over the floor. You couldn't even walk on it.""

So, according to the President, doctors stopped operating on patients in order to come out and meet him? OK! Very legal and very cool!

35. ""I think the Fed has been very late and very early.""

36. ""Plus, we're building large sections of the wall.""

37. ""It's only in your head. It's only anti-Semitic in your head.""

Real quote from the President of the United States.

38. ""You'll find out. ...You're going to find out."""
Jewish model who came to Trump's defense speaks out,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Fox News Staff', 'This Article Was Written Fox News Staff.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/jewish-model-who-came-to-trumps-defense-speaks-out,"Model and founder of The Exodus Movement, Elizabeth Pipko, joined a panel of guests on Thursday to discuss the choice that Jewish Democrats will face in 2020.

""Look, the Democrats have shown with their words and actions over the last several years that they are taking Jews and their support totally for granted,"" Pipko said in an earlier interview.

Pipko is a former Trump 2016 campaign staffer, who made headlines earlier this year when she announced her support for President Trump, and co-founded Jexodus -- now known as The Exodus Movement. According to their website, The Exodus Movement is comprised of ""proud Jewish Americans who reject the hypocrisy, anti-Americanism, and anti-Semitism of the rising far-left.""

OPINION: DEMS ABANDONED ISRAEL, JEWS SHOULD ABANDON THEM

Appearing in the latest episode of Fox Nation's ""Deep Dive,"" Pipko, 24, is speaking out in defense of President Trump after he suggested that Jewish Americans who vote for Democrats show a lack of knowledge or “great disloyalty” to Israel. The President has since doubled down on his comments accusing Reps. Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar of ""hating Israel"" and the Jewish people.

Both Congresswomen have been outspoken in their support for a movement to boycott, divest, and sanction Israel, and have championed the movement in the House.

TRUMP RIPS DEMS' EMOTIONAL PRESS CONFERENCE ON ISRAEL: ‘I DON’T BUY REP. TLAIB’S TEARS’

""The BDS movement wants to boycott and cancel out Israel, the only Jewish state in the world,"" said Pipko. ""That is blatantly antisemitic.""

""Israel also has contributed so much to the world, in technology and medicine and it's a huge ally to America,"" Pipko continued.

""And despite what Ilhan Omar says, and the air quotes she uses when she says it, Israel is the only true democracy in the Middle-East,"" she explained.

""To try to cut our relationship with Israel and help towards the destruction of Israel is something I never thought I'd see, and really just disgusting to watch.""

FOUNDER OF EXODUS MOVEMENT DEFENDS TRUMP

Pipko believes the Republican party is well-positioned to win over Jewish voters in 2020, because, until recently, ""supporting Israel was not controversial.""

""Both sides, no matter what side of the aisle you were on, supported Israel -- and now the Democratic party has chosen to blatantly disregard Israel,"" she said, explaining that ""the obvious shift"" may lead to an increase in Jewish Americans voting Republican.

""I don't think Democratic Jews ever saw this coming for Israel and they're going to have to make a very difficult decision in 2020,"" Pipko concluded.

Ivanka and Jared publicly missing in action again amid Trump's 'disloyal' claim,https://www.cnn.com,"['Kaitlan Collins', 'Betsy Klein']",08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/22/politics/ivanka-trump-jared-kushner-trump-jewish-disloyal-claim/index.html,"Washington (CNN) As President Donald Trump has rotated between controversies for the last few days, two of his top advisers have been notably publicly absent -- again.

The couple was on vacation in Wyoming with their children over the weekend, and, on Monday, participated in a Trump Victory fundraiser alongside his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. They returned to Washington this week but with a limited presence in the West Wing, people familiar with the situation said.

The President's daughter and son-in-law -- who are Modern Orthodox Jews -- stayed silent publicly as Trump caused a firestorm by questioning the loyalty of some Jewish Americans to Israel. Trump has recently decided that branding the Democratic Party as anti-Semitic would be savvy political strategy -- and aides have largely supported the fight, but when he questioned the intelligence and loyalty of Jewish people who support Democrats, some inside the West Wing privately conceded to CNN he had gone too far. The comments prompted criticism from many groups that what he said was anti-Semitic, but Trump dug in during the days that followed.

""I haven't heard anybody say that; it's just the opposite,"" he claimed to reporters Wednesday. ""I think that if you vote for a Democrat, you're very, very disloyal to Israel and to the Jewish people.""

Emails released from Veterans Affairs senior staff show the outsized influence of three of the club's members in the agency's planning for veteran health care. | Wilfredo Lee/AP Photo Ehealth Emails show Veterans Affairs officials' scorn for 'Mar-a-Lago 3'

Emails from senior Veterans Affairs staff released Thursday reveal the frustration and scorn they felt at having to deal with the intrusion of three wealthy members of President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in the agency’s plans to create a new digital health platform.

The 2017 and 2018 emails, which Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, show the outsized influence of the Mar-a-Lago members, Marvel Entertainment Chairman Ike Perlmutter, attorney Marc Sherman and internist Bruce Moskowitz.

Story Continued Below

The emails reveal how senior staff responded to what they saw as unhelpful meddling in their work. Essentially, they humored the three Trump friends while ignoring their advice, which they considered misinformed and potentially disruptive to veteran health care.

In one email, project head John Windom describes a meeting with the three as a “grin and bear it session.” Another calls them ""clearly out of their depth"" in demanding changes in the department's 2018 EHR contract with Cerner that the officials felt were unreasonable.

“Mr. Sherman does not understand the culture of VA or the federal government,” Windom said in another email with a colleague. “He appears to be a ‘big bang’ theory guy. The problem is, we must continue to deliver uninterrupted and quality care to our Veterans during the transformation within the parameters of the law and other regulations/policies.”

But a senior VA official involved in the EHR project, former Trump campaign official Camilo Sandoval, kept a list of the requests made by the three Mar-a-Lago members on a posterboard that he checked off from time to time, according to an official who worked directly with him.

The influence of the three Mar-a-Lago members was revealed by POLITICO in 2018, with additional details surfacing in FOIA documents requested by ProPublica. Congress is still investigating the group's interactions with department.

VA Secretary Robert Wilkie said last year that he had not spoken with any of the three since taking office. The VA on Thursday did not respond to an email inquiring into whether they are still involved in agency policymaking.

Two legal advocacy groups on Wednesday sued Wilkie for allegedly failing to preserve emails that they allege his predecessor, David Shulkin, sent from a personal account to conduct business with the Mar-a-Lago figures — activity that the suit claims was illegal.

“Despite misgivings, career VA employees were obligated to waste taxpayer time and resources to respond to the trio of Mar-a-Lago members, purely because of their connections to Trump,” the ethics group CREW said in a news release with the documents.

In one email released by CREW, a top VA official forwarded questions to another staffer that he said came from ""a POTUS friend/doctor.""

""We need to handle sensitively and with facts,"" acting Chief Information Officer Scott Blackburn said in the email. Ashwini Zenooz, a senior medical staffer on the project, responded that the requests are “just ridiculous. They don’t make sense and there is a basic lack of understanding… I’m just baffled.”

In another email, a staffer refers to Moskowitz as “the Dr from W Palm that is connected to Trump. ... He is outdated in his understanding of system but we need to be responsive here.”"

Acting DHS chief's top aide resigns amid White House tensions: report,https://thehill.com,[],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/458441-acting-dhs-chiefs-top-aide-resigns-amid-white-house-tensions-report,"Andrew Meehan, a top aide and spokesman to acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan, will reportedly leave the department amid friction between it and the White House.

President Trump Donald John TrumpSarah Huckabee Sanders becomes Fox News contributor The US-Iranian scuffle over a ship is a sideshow to events in the Gulf South Korea: US, North Korea to resume nuclear talks 'soon' MORE reportedly is suspicious of McAleenan, who served as deputy commissioner of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) under then-President Obama from 2014 to 2017 before Trump nominated him to head CBP, as well as his inner circle.

""Meehan, who was in Panama in advance of the secretary's visit during the Flores rollout, made the decision to leave government a couple of weeks ago,"" a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official told Axios.

The White House has also been increasingly frustrated by what it views as the botched DHS rollout of a proposal to reverse the Flores Settlement Agreement, which limits how long the government may detain minors with their parents, according to Axios, citing sources with direct knowledge.

Administration officials reportedly feel McAleenan missed an opportunity by announcing the policy shift at the Reagan Center in Washington, D.C., rather than a location that would have drawn more media attention.

""[McAleenan] could have been on all the TVs if he wanted to. But not everybody's taking live coverage from the Reagan Center at the last minute. At some point something has got to go right at DHS with their messaging and rollouts,” a senior official told Axios.

Trump himself was also irritated with coverage of raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in July, specifically Breitbart and New York Times stories reporting only 35 of the 2,000 migrants targeted had been detained.

The president reportedly has no intention of nominating McAleenan for permanent DHS head and has far more positive views of acting U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Ken Cuccinelli and acting ICE Director Mark Morgan, both of whom frequently appear on television to defend his immigration policies.

The Hill has reached out to the White House and DHS for comment."
"Justice: 64% of federal arrests are noncitizens, with a 200% increase",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/justice-64-of-federal-arrests-are-non-citizens-200-increase,"Federal arrests of noncitizens have jumped over 200% in the last 20 years and now account for 64% of those arrested, according to the Justice Department.

The Bureau of Justice Statistics said that federal arrests of non-Americans rose 234% from 1998-2018. For U.S. citizens, the percentage rose just 10% over those 20 years.

The newly released statistics feed the Trump administration’s narrative that an increase in immigration, especially illegal immigration, has fed a spike in crime.

Immigration expert Jessica M. Vaughan said the increase in arrests is due to increasing prosecution of illegal entry and re-entry by migrants. ""Experience has taught the immigration agencies and DOJ that this works to reduce recidivism – in other words, when illegal crossers face some more severe consequence than just being sent back home, they don’t keep doing it,"" she explained.

Over that 20-year period, groups such as MS-13 have surged, first in urban areas and recently into rural communities, and drug and human trafficking have also increased over the U.S.-Mexico border.

Justice was very pointed in comparing U.S. citizens arrested to noncitizens. For example, it noted that while they make up just 7% of the U.S. population, noncitizens account for 15% of the arrests by federal authorities, 24% of drug arrests, 25% of federal property arrests, including 28% of all federal fraud arrests.

Also over that period, illegal immigration has surged off and on and the bureau said that immigration crimes account for the bulk of arrests. In the past, Department of Homeland Security authorities have accounted for a majority of the arrests.

“20 years, 95% of the increase in federal arrests was due to immigration crimes. From 1998 to 2018, federal immigration arrests increased 5-fold (from 20,942 to 108,667), rising more than 50,000 in one year from 2017 to 2018,” said the Justice Department.

Vaughan, the director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies, said that the statistics and types of crimes disprove claims by pro-immigration advocates that illegal immigrants aren't involved in crimes.

""Opponents of immigration enforcement are obsessed with trying to establish that illegal aliens and legal immigrants commit fewer crimes than Americans, and so, as their narrative goes, local law enforcement agencies should not cooperate with ICE and should adopt sanctuary policies. This is first of all not true, but is off-point and a dangerous conclusion. What these numbers show is that there are certain types of crime that are disproportionately associated with illegal aliens: drug trafficking, certain gang crimes, and identity theft and document fraud,"" she told Secrets."
Rudy Giuliani presses Ukraine to investigate Biden family,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/rudy-giuliani-presses-ukraine-to-investigate-biden-family,"Rudy Giuliani revived an effort to convince the Ukrainian government to investigate a matter related to Joe Biden, the front-runner in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary.

Giuliani, who is President Trump's personal attorney, encouraged a top representative of the new Ukrainian President Volodymy Zelensky to look into whether there was any improper overlap between the former vice president's diplomatic overtures in Ukraine, and his son Hunter Biden's ties to an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch, according to the New York Times.

He also asked Andriy Yermak, a close ally of Zelensky, to look into whether Ukrainian officials tried to undermine Trump's 2016 campaign.

Giuliani has called for Biden to be investigated for a trip he made in 2016 when he threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees if Ukraine did not dismiss Viktor Shokin, the country’s then-prosecutor general. Biden’s son, Hunter, stood to gain financially from having Shokin removed.

Giuliani said he ""strongly urged"" Yermak to “just investigate the darn things."" These discussions included a recent in person meeting in Madrid.

In May, Giuliani was subject to intense criticism for a planned trip to Ukraine to meet with then-elect Zelensky to ask that Ukraine pursue these investigations. He called it off after facing pushback from the State Department and concerns about 2020 election meddling, complaining that he was the victim of a ""setup.""

This time around, Giuliani claims he was not acting on Trump's behalf, but rather as a private citizen, and arranged the correspondence with the help of the State Department. Yermak, whose government wants a Trump-Zelensky meeting, said it was unclear whether Giuliani was acting on his own.

During a visit to Washington last month, an aide to House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Democrat from Maryland, urged Yermak not to work with Giuliani.

Yermak said he did not interpret that conversation as a warning and told Giuliani and congressional staff that the Ukrainian government is committed to fair investigations into possible crimes once a new top prosecutor is confirmed by parliament."
Acting DHS Secretary McAleenan: New immigration policies are key to addressing border crisis,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Julia Musto', ""Julia Musto Works With Fox News Channel'S"", ""America'S Newsroom.""]",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/acting-dhs-secretary-mcaleenan-new-immigration-policies-are-key,"Newly introduced legal changes would be a significant step in addressing the “core aspect” of the immigration crisis at the southern border, Acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan said Wednesday.

Appearing on “America’s Newsroom,” McAleenan made the case that after implementing the policies and repatriating those without “meritorious” claims, “we’re going to see a reduction in that flow significantly at the border.”

“It’s a key aspect of our multilayered strategy,” he told anchors Sandra Smith and Jon Scott.

The new legislation was unveiled in a press release and news conference Wednesday morning. The administration is moving to end a federal agreement that limits how long migrant children can be held in detention. They would also establish family residential facilities that he described as “campus-like” with educational, medical, and dining centers. A court fight is expected to follow.

EXCLUSIVE: ON THE BORDER, OFFICIALS SEE DIVIDENDS FROM TRUMP'S DEAL WITH MEXICO

On the release, President Trump is quoted as saying: “To protect these children from abuse, and stop this illegal flow, we must close these loopholes. This is an urgent humanitarian necessity.”

“Through July we saw 475,000 family units. That’s more than three times any previous full year arriving at our border in just ten months,” McAleenan said. “And, they’ve been coming to exploit a vulnerability in our immigration framework that says if you have a child with you, you cannot be held for more than 20 days.”

McAleenan argued that the current immigration system is incentivizing. He pointed to a recent conversation with a Guatemalan father who “basically said everybody knows that bringing a child is a passport for migration and release into the U.S. This helps us change that dynamic.”

He also cited the influx of migrants from 2014 to 2015 -- 68,000 migrants according to McAleenan -- in the “first family crisis” under the Obama administration: “When the initial decision was made to detain families through their proceedings by the Department of Homeland Security at that time…the message went out.”

DHS MOVES TO END LIMITS ON MIGRANT FAMILY DETENTIONS

“Families knew that they couldn’t just cross the border and be released and the numbers dropped 90 percent overnight. We do expect a very similar deterrent effect when we can demonstrate that integrity in the system and actually get immigration results,” he stated.

McAleenan also pushed back on almost immediate negative criticism from 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Julián Castro, who tweeted: “Separating migrant children from their parents is appalling—but indefinitely detaining families isn’t a better alternative.”

“He’s criticizing what the prior Democratic administration did to help establish the integrity of the administration system and address what was then an unchecked flow,” he told Smith and Scott.

The president told a gaggle of reporters at the White House on Wednesday afternoon: “President Obama had separation; I'm the one that brought [families] together.”

“The incentives that our system has provided for families and criminal organizations to profit off of them is a much worse situation than completing an immigration proceeding in a fair and appropriate setting,” McAleenan said."

The nonpartisan veterans' service organization, also known as American Veterans, listened to the president speak about suicide prevention and access to health care, along with education and other issues of concern to veterans.

The highlight of the speech came near the end when President Trump announced an executive action that eliminates student loan debt for permanently disabled veterans. More than 25,000 are eligible.

""They have made a sacrifice that’s so great, and they never complain. They never complain,"" Trump said. ""That’s hundreds of millions of dollars of student debt held by our severely wounded warriors. It’s gone forever.""

Trump's Kentucky visit also included a fundraising stop for Gov. Matt Bevin as he is facing Democratic nominee Andy Beshear in November's gubernatorial election.

Congress pumps brakes on Interior push to relocate Bureau of Land Management,https://thehill.com,[],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/458352-congress-pumps-brakes-on-interior-push-to-move-bureau-of-land,"The Interior Department says it is moving ahead with plans to relocate a Washington-based agency to Colorado after getting the green light from Congress, but lawmakers say no such approval has been granted.

The Department of the Interior is preparing to move 27 top officials at the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to new headquarters in Grand Junction, Colo., while scattering other D.C.-based employees to existing offices out West.

The House Appropriations Committee was given 30 days to submit questions to Interior about the move and the reallocation of $5 million to cover related costs.

Lawmakers had a number of questions: What are the benefits to Interior and the American public? What problem will this solve? Why was BLM singled out for this move?

The 30-day period ended on Aug. 15, and Interior says it will now proceed with plans to move about 300 employees to Western states after answering all questions from lawmakers.

But some lawmakers beg to differ.

“The administration’s characterization of Congress having ‘blessed’ BLM’s relocation plan is false,” Amanda Yanchury, spokeswoman for Rep. Betty McCollum Betty Louise McCollumCongress pumps brakes on Interior push to relocate Bureau of Land Management Here are the 95 Democrats who voted to support impeachment Clean water or mining pollution for the nation's favorite wilderness? MORE (D-Minn.), chairwoman of the House Appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over the Interior Department, said in a statement to The Hill.

“Interior’s initial relocation plan was significantly lacking in the details necessary for the Committee to evaluate this proposal. That’s why Congress, in a bipartisan and bicameral manner, requested more information — to ensure the transparency and accountability of the administration’s actions,” she added.

BLM argues the move will position its staff closer to the lands the agency manages, but critics contend it will simply move high-level career staff out of D.C. and further away from the corridors of power, following a similar decision to relocate Department of Agriculture (USDA) research staff to a new outpost in the Kansas City area.

“As we’ve seen with affected USDA researchers, uprooting employees is this administration’s strategy for eliminating branches of government since it creates hardship and people are forced to quit,” she added. “It’s outrageous that this administration has now targeted BLM employees because the Interior Secretary— a former coal and mining lobbyist—doesn’t believe in the agency’s mission of preserving public lands.”

BLM retirees penned a letter to lawmakers on Tuesday arguing the move would “functionally dismantle” the agency. They also asked the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to hold a hearing on the move.

About 4 percent of BLM’s 10,000 employees are based in Washington. Nearly all of them would be transferred elsewhere under Interior’s plan, leaving just 61 workers in Washington, according to a memo to Congress from Interior.

""Now that the Department of the Interior has met its commitment to provide Congress with an opportunity to review its reorganization plan for the Bureau of Land Management, we look forward to moving ahead with a thoughtfully considered and carefully developed plan that will place the BLM's leadership closer to the lands and resources they manage,” an Interior spokesperson said in a statement to The Hill.

""We have answered every single question asked by the Committee. No additional follow up questions were received,"" the agency said.

But details beyond what is covered by Interior’s July 16 memo have been sparse.

Lawmakers say their questions range from basic logistics like finding office space and the overall timeline to bigger picture questions like whether it is even legal to move the agency’s headquarters without congressional approval.

Those concerns were expressed in a “four corners letter” signed by majority and minority appropriations leaders in both chambers.

“It’s absurd for the administration to assume Congressional approval when the Committee has not yet received sufficient answers to outstanding questions about the plan’s feasibility, costs, legality, and personnel issues. This is clearly an attempt by the Trump administration to steamroll ahead with this plan without regard to the concerns of a co-equal branch of government,” said Yanchury, McCollum's spokeswoman.

House Appropriations Committee staffers say talks with BLM about the request are ongoing and that the congressional panels were under no obligation to meet a 30-day timeline for approving BLM’s financial plans related to the relocation effort.

Interior has brushed aside legal concerns surrounding the move and has not answered several questions about when employees will have to decide whether they will accept the reassignment and when the new headquarters in Grand Junction will be open.

William Pendley, the top official at BLM, told staff in an email obtained by The Hill that they can expect more details soon.

“During the last 30 days, we have continued to develop an implementation plan for the move while ensuring the continuity of operations across the Bureau of Land Management. This email is to let you know that more information will be forthcoming shortly,” Pendley wrote on Aug. 16. “We look forward to working with you to make the process as smooth and transparent for everyone as possible.”

Democrats also have questions over whether the move is legal.

McCollum’s office pointed to a section of federal law that says “all offices attached to the seat of government shall be exercised in the District of Columbia, and not elsewhere, except as otherwise provided by law.”

In a response to McCollum shared with The Hill, Interior noted that agencies like the Food and Drug Administration are headquartered outside D.C., in the nearby suburbs.

Interior said an office attached to the seat of government should be interpreted as “an executive department, a term defined elsewhere in the U.S. Code to include the Department of the Interior, but not its component parts.”

“The provision referenced by your staff is not a bar to making this change, which will promote greater efficiency and use of taxpayer resources,” Cole Rojewski, director of Interior’s Office of Congressional and Legislative Affairs, wrote to McCollum, adding that having every federal government office located in D.C. would be “impractical and unreasonable.”

Disagreement over the move is expected to spill into September as lawmakers work on appropriations for fiscal 2020, which begins on Oct 1. The House Natural Resources Committee will also hold a hearing in September to discuss the planning process behind BLM’s move.

"Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who's in charge of U.S. nukes, falls for seven-year-old Instagram hoax",https://www.salon.com,[],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.salon.com/2019/08/22/energy-secretary-rick-perry-whos-in-charge-of-u-s-nukes-falls-for-seven-year-old-instagram-hoax/,"Energy Secretary Rick Perry on Tuesday became the latest victim of an Instagram hoax that dates back years.

Perry, who is tasked with overseeing the entire American nuclear arsenal, reposted a message that falsely claimed that a new Instagram privacy policy would make all user posts, including deleted posts, public and would allow the company to “use your photos.”

Advertisement:

The message, which previously targeted Facebook users as early as 2012 and has been debunked by Snopes, also falsely claimed that users could opt out of the new policy by reposting the message.

""With this statement, I give notice to Instagram it is strictly forbidden to disclose, copy, distribute, or take any other action against me based on this profile and/or its contents,"" the post said. ""Instagram DOES NOT HAVE MY PERMISSION TO SHARE PHOTOS OR MESSAGES.”

Perry, a former ""Dancing With the Stars"" contestant, posted the message to his personal Instagram account as well as on Twitter. Other celebrities, like actresses Julia Roberts, Julianne Moore and Debra Messing and the pop singer Usher, fell for the hoax as well. But Perry was roundly mocked on social media because of his position overseeing all of America’s nuclear power plants and weapons.

""How the hell are you in charge of the department of energy when you fall for the social media version of chain email,"" one commenter wrote.

""I’d like to introduce you to a Nigerian prince,” offered another commenter.

Hours after the post, Perry commented, “OMG … seriously, you mean this is fake!!”

“I’ll be darned!!” he added. “First time I’ve seen anything fake on the internet!!”

Perry finally deleted the post nearly 12 hours later and replaced it with a satirical version allowing Instagram to use his photos of dachshunds and “backstage selfies with Vanilla Ice.”

“This post I made on my phone shall stand as a legally binding document, in perpetuity throughout the universe,” the post said.

Perry is one of the few Trump administration officials who has served since the beginning of Trump’s presidency. The New York Times reported in 2017 that Perry had no idea the Energy Department was charged with overseeing the country’s nuclear arsenal and did not learn that he would be in charge of it until days after accepting the job. Perry, who studied animal husbandry at Texas A&M University, replaced Ernest Moniz, the former chairman of the MIT physics department who directed the linear accelerator at MIT’s Laboratory for Nuclear Science. Moniz’s predecessor, Steven Chu, earned a Nobel Prize in Physics.

Perry actually ran for president in 2012 on a platform of eliminating the Energy Department, though he famously forgot its name while listing off all the departments he would cut.

""The third one, I can’t,"" Perry said during a Republican primary debate in 2011. ""Sorry. Oops.""

Perry had a change of heart after being tasked with leading the agency.

“My past statements made over five years ago about abolishing the Department of Energy do not reflect my current thinking,"" he told the Senate in 2017. ""In fact, after being briefed on so many of the vital functions of the Department of Energy, I regret recommending its elimination.”"
"Tour Results Show Best-Case Scenario For Corn, Worst-Case For Soybeans",https://www.agweb.com,[],,,,https://www.agweb.com/article/tour-results-show-best-case-scenario-corn-worst-case-soybeans,"Each night of the Pro Farmer Midwest Crop Tour, scout sample data is compiled and released. While the data is an extremely accurate representation of what scouts saw in the field for that day, it will not be exactly the same as the official Pro Farmer yield estimates released on Friday.

According to AgriTalk host and Crop Tour veteran, Chip Flory, in a year like 2019, the tour data measures the best-case scenario for corn and the worst-case scenario for soybeans.

“When we're out on tour, and we're looking at a mature corn crop, we are measuring actual yield,” he explained on AgriTalk Thursday. “When we're looking a crop that is as immature and as far behind and still has as much work to do as this one has to do. We are measuring that, yield potential.”

If samples are pulled from two fields, with one planted at the end of April and one planted in June, the later would be just past blister stage and the earlier would be entering the dent stage.

“When we measure that grain length, when we count the kernel rows and the populations, we're not accounting for any of the difference in the maturity in those basic raw numbers,” he said. “We need to understand that, and likely make some adjustments [in the official Pro Farmer estimate] to what the what this crop is going to be able to do going forward.”

Without a crystal ball to know exactly what the weather will do over the next five weeks, Flory said we must assume a normal finish to the crop.

“In some cases, that means we're going to take the top end off both the corn and potentially some of the soybeans out there,” he said adding a normal first frost date in Minnesota, South Dakota, northwest Iowa, northeast Nebraska, Ohio, Indiana and eastern Illinois could change the yield picture.

Worst-case for soybeans

While tour data shows the best-case scenario on corn, in soybeans the data shows the worst-case scenario because the tour looks at the number of pods in a 3x3 square, according to Flory.

“We're looking at how much of the bean production factory is up and running,” he says. “When we get these low pod counts on a slow-to-develop, late-planted bean crop, you've got to understand that this bean crop, if you give it the right conditions, can do more than what the pod counts are indicating.”

All of these factors including, maturity and other observations, made by scouts throughout the week are included in Pro Farmer’s official yield estimates.

“We need to keep that in mind, so I think we're measuring a worst-case scenario with pod counts, best case scenario with the yields,” he says. “There's lots of observations that go into the Pro Farmer crop estimate that are not in the very sterile numbers that we put out from crop tour.”

Justice Department sent white nationalist content to immigration court employees: report,https://thehill.com,[],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/458481-justice-department-sent-white-nationalist-content-to,"A union for immigration judges alleged that the Department of Justice sent an email to all immigration court employees that included a link to an article from a white nationalist website that “directly attacks sitting immigration judges with racial and ethnically tinged slurs,” BuzzFeed News reported Thursday.

The National Association of Immigration Judges said the DOJ’s Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) sent court employees a link to an article from VDare, a white nationalist website, in its morning news briefing Monday that included anti-Semitic references to judges.

The emails are sent to court employees on weekdays, and they include links to news articles about immigration. The blog post in question includes reporting about the DOJ taking steps to decertify the immigration judges' union, and it allegedly includes pictures of some judges with the label “Kritarch” before their names, an anti-Semitic slur.

“The post features links and content that directly attacks sitting immigration judges with racial and ethnically tinged slurs and the label ‘Kritarch.’ The reference to Kritarch in a negative tone is deeply offensive and Anti-Semitic,” union chief Ashley Tabaddor wrote in a Thursday letter to James McHenry, the director of the EOIR.

“VDare’s use of the term in a pejorative manner casts Jewish history in a negative light as an Anti-Semitic trope of Jews seeking power and control,” she continued.

A former senior Department of Justice official, who was not named, explained to BuzzFeed News that the email was ""generated by a third-party vendor that utilizes keyword searches to produce news clippings for staff.""

""It is not reviewed or approved by staff before it is transmitted,"" the official added.

Tabaddor demanded that McHenry take immediate action for the shared post, withdrawing the email and issuing an apology, BuzzFeed News reported. She also called on the EOIR to take “all appropriate safety and security measures.”

“Publication and dissemination of a white supremacist, anti-semitic website throughout the EOIR is antithetical to the goals and ideals of the Department of Justice,” Tabbaddor wrote.

EOIR assistant press secretary Kathryn Mattingly said in a statement to The Hill that the news briefings ""are compiled by a contractor and the blog post should not have been included.""

""The Department of Justice condemns Anti-Semitism in the strongest terms,"" Mattingly said.

Trump says his mileage rules make cars safer. His EPA was worried they will kill more people.,https://www.vox.com,['Aug'],08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.vox.com/2019/8/21/20826601/trump-auto-company-fuel-economy-california,"President Trump on Wednesday tweeted a defense of his administration’s weakening of fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks, citing safety benefits. It’s a change that automakers have already said they don’t want. And according to internal emails from the Environmental Protection Agency released in 2018, the rule change would increase highway fatalities.

In fact, four car companies — Volkswagen, BMW, Ford, and Honda — signed a surprise deal with the state of California earlier this summer to set stricter mileage rules for themselves than what the Trump administration proposed.

My proposal to the politically correct Automobile Companies would lower the average price of a car to consumers by more than $3000, while at the same time making the cars substantially safer. Engines would run smoother. Very little impact on the environment! Foolish executives! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 21, 2019

According to the New York Times, this sudden side deal with California so infuriated the White House that a senior official summoned leaders from Toyota, Fiat Chrysler, and General Motors in July to pressure them to support the administration’s policy.

But once the deal was announced, several other car companies said they were open to signing on as well. Mercedes-Benz is now preparing to join the California accord, the New York Times reported.

The California agreement would put car companies on course to average 51 miles per gallon across all their sales by 2026. This is weaker than the standard set under President Obama, but much stronger than Trump’s proposal.

The Obama rules restricted tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide from light-duty vehicles but gave companies several ways to comply. Meeting that target just by increasing fuel economy would have required car companies to average 54.5 miles per gallon across sales of cars, trucks, SUVs, and crossovers by 2025.

Some car companies thought this target was too aggressive, so when Trump came to office, these manufacturers petitioned to have the standard revised. But carmakers got way more than they bargained for: The Trump administration decided to freeze mileage standards after 2020, which would hold average fuel economy at just 37 miles per gallon.

The state of California, which has a waiver from federal rules to set its own emissions standards, said it wanted to uphold the Obama benchmark. In response, the EPA threatened to revoke California’s waiver.

That put California and the federal government on a collision course, with car manufacturers in the middle. California is the largest market for new cars in the United States, so it’s impossible for carmakers to ignore. Another 13 states and the District of Columbia have also adopted California’s vehicle emissions standards.

So auto companies were faced with the prospect of having two very different standards to meet across the country, or having to wait for the dust to settle from what was sure to be a long, messy legal fight.

To justify the rollback, the Trump administration has cited safety as its main concern. The reasoning is that new cars are safer than old cars, but forcing carmakers to meet tougher efficiency rules makes new cars more expensive. That means people end up driving their older, less safe cars for longer, according to the EPA’s published analysis.

The EPA publicly said the Trump rule change would save 1,000 lives per year, but an internal email from staffers obtained by the Associated Press showed that they expected the revision to actually increase highway deaths by 17 per year, undermining the EPA’s bizarre rationale.

Increasing fuel economy is an important tool for limiting air pollution and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The transportation sector is now the largest source of carbon dioxide in the United States. Cars and trucks account for about 20 percent of all US carbon emissions.

So why is the Trump administration so insistent on relaxing a regulation beyond what the auto industry wants? Because oil producers want cars and trucks to use more fuel. As the New York Times reported in December, oil companies see higher fuel efficiency standards as a threat:

The industry had reason to urge the rollback of higher fuel efficiency standards proposed by former President Barack Obama. A quarter of the world’s oil is used to power cars, and less-thirsty vehicles mean lower gasoline sales. In recent months, Marathon Petroleum also teamed up with the American Legislative Exchange Council, a secretive policy group financed by corporations as well as the Koch network, to draft legislation for states supporting the industry’s position. Its proposed resolution, dated Sept. 18, describes current fuel-efficiency rules as “a relic of a disproven narrative of resource scarcity” and says “unelected bureaucrats” shouldn’t dictate the cars Americans drive.

But as the recent California deal shows, car companies would prefer to have stable regulations, even if it means a tougher standard for themselves.

Correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the scope of California’s waiver from federal air quality rules."
Trump's Flores replacement will prevent the sexual assault of migrant children,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/trumps-flores-replacement-will-prevent-the-sexual-assault-of-migrant-children,"In an overdue but welcome move from the Trump administration, the Department of Homeland Security announced Wednesday their new regulation replacing the Flores Settlement Agreement, which forces the separation of migrant children from their parents while they await asylum proceedings. For all that immigration activists and even members of the media have lambasted the DHS' elimination of the potentially illegal Flores settlement, it may right one of the worst humanitarian evils on the border: the sexual assault epidemic of migrant children.

The new Flores Final Rule will immediately ameliorate the minor-on-minor sexual assault crisis by keeping children under the supervision of their parents rather than in understaffed cages. Of 1,303 sexual abuse cases of migrant minors, the Justice Department found that in 1,125 of them, the perpetrators were other minors. Keeping parents in charge of their children will drastically increase the supervision of children, all but eliminating not just fellow minors abusing them but also adult predators.

In the long term, the new regulation will disincentivize human traffickers from stealing children as an effective entry ticket to the country. Given the rightful blowback of family separation, border security has been forced to relegate to catch-and-release in migrant cases involving children, thus inviting false asylum seekers and illegal immigrants to traffic children in the hopes of being released into the country. Contrary to the claims of immigration doves, the child trafficking problem has catapulted into a crisis. In a pilot program of rapid DNA tests, border security officials found that 30% of children weren't related to the ""parents"" who brought them to the country.

The legality of the Flores Final Rule remains unclear, and there's no question that the change, as well as increased funding for border facilities and expediting immigration courts, ought to be coming from Congress. But as a matter of protecting human rights while preventing catch-and-release from inviting mass influxes of illegal immigrants and human traffickers, the replacement of the Flores Agreement should be celebrated by Americans across the political spectrum."
Veteran's widow speaks out after former VA doctor charged in 3 deaths,https://www.cbsnews.com,['Omar Villafranca'],08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/veterans-affairs-pathologist-charged-robert-levy-involuntary-manslaughter-widow-speaks-out-today-2019-08-21/,"Fayetteville, Arkansas — The indictment of a former doctor at a VA hospital in Arkansas is sending shock waves through the nation's largest health care system. Dr. Robert Morris Levy, 53, is accused of involuntary manslaughter in the deaths of three patients — and he could be responsible for the deaths of at least a dozen others.

Kathy McCoy's husband, Michael, died late last year. He was a proud grandfather of 10 and a retired Army sergeant. In 2014, he went to an Arkansas VA complaining of pain in his leg.

""He was in constant pain. It got to where at the end he couldn't walk … he would crawl a lot,"" McCoy told CBS News. ""They kept saying it was arthritis.""

She said it ended up being a blood clot in the leg.

McCoy's case is one of thousands under review after VA pathologist Robert Levy was accused of manslaughter in the deaths of at least three veterans by misdiagnosis or falsifying their diagnoses.

Kathy McCoy CBS News

""We looked at the most serious cases and the cases that were the most prosecutable and those are the three cases that we feel confident that we can take into court and get a conviction,"" Duane Kees, the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Arkansas, said.

Levy was chief pathologist at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center of the Ozarks for more than a decade, but he was fired last year after he was accused of working while drunk.

The federal indictment accuses him of practicing while intoxicated by drinking a potent form of alcohol called 2-methyl-2-butanol — or 2M2B — a form of alcohol that can't be detected in a common drug and alcohol test.

Levy can be seen in police bodycam footage said to be from a 2018 DUI stop. It was released by a law firm representing some of his alleged victims.

Robert Levy Washington County Sheriff's Dept.

An 18-month VA investigation into more than 30,000 cases under Levy's supervision found 3,029 showed errors or misdiagnoses, and concluded they may have led to at least 15 deaths, some from cancer.

McCoy explained that her husband felt like he trusted a system that ultimately failed him.



""I think there, at the end, he knew they had failed him,"" she said.

McCoy is buried here at the Fort Smith National Cemetery. But his family wonders if a proper diagnosis could have saved his life. In a statement, Levy said he's innocent and will defend himself vigorously.

If convicted of all counts, Levy faces a sentence of up to 524 years in prison and $7.75 million in fines, Kees said."
Trump Finds Unlikely Ally in Greenland Aspirations: Iran,https://www.usnews.com,[],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.usnews.com/news/world-report/articles/2019-08-22/trump-finds-unlikely-ally-in-greenland-aspirations-iran,"President Donald Trump faced almost universal opposition this week to his idea of purchasing Greenland from Denmark, though an unlikely ally emerged Thursday acknowledging the move would align with the commander in chief's perceived doctrine.

Iranian state news service Fars published an analysis Thursday afternoon detailing news this week that the president wishes to purchase the island governed by Denmark that straddles the Arctic Circle and where the U.S. maintains a key military base. It described Trump as ""unconventional and seemingly obsessed with reasserting U.S. hegemony"" but acknowledged the Arctic as a geopolitically critical region, currently contested by other powers like Russia and China.

""This scenario makes the island of Greenland, freezing and home to only 50,000 inhabitants, an extremely strategic location,"" Fars noted. ""Thus the idea that Trump aspires to acquire the island for the United States and militarize it accordingly is by no means unreasonable in his strategic calculus, even if the idea is a non-starter.""

Trump announced by Twitter earlier this week he was canceling a planned trip to Denmark in early September, later explaining he took issue with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen's dismissal of his apparent bid. Trump on Wednesday called Fredericksen "" nasty "" for her comments. He also lamented via Twitter that Denmark does not spend 2 percent of its gross domestic product on defense – a goal NATO countries in 2014 agreed they would each achieve by 2024.

In its analysis, Fars noted of Greenland, ""Denmark on its own does not have the resources or capabilities to make it useful on behalf of NATO, which is why Trump likely hit out at them over military spending.""

Remaining on message with the regime's central talking points, it concluded that Iran should take seriously the White House's pursuit of Greenland as a part of what it considers U.S. efforts to ""to maintain worldwide military supremacy.""

""American history is defined almost solely by territorial expansion for strategic ends. It may have fallen dormant, but Trump has very much rekindled an old flame for strategic ends. This illustrates as a whole just how far this administration is willing to go to reassert unilateral hegemony over the world – even if that means disappointing old allies.""

Many have expressed grave concern in recent days about Trump's intentions regarding a potential sale. Reactions from senior officials and lawmakers in Copenhagen have varied from calling the situation a "" laughing stock "" to a "" diplomatic crisis ."" Multiple officials from the Obama administration have spoken out about the importance of U.S. relations with Denmark – a founding member of NATO – calling it one of America's most important allies ."
Federal judge approves DHS request to force feed immigrant detainee on hunger strike,https://thehill.com,[],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/homenews/news/458493-federal-judge-approves-dhs-request-to-force-feed-immigrant-detainee-on-hunger,"A Federal judge in San Diego approved Thursday a request from the Department of Homeland Security to force feed and hydrate an immigrant detainee on hunger strike.

The San Diego Union-Tribune reported the 41-year-old man, a Russian citizen, has not eaten since Aug. 4 and has consumed only water, though he has refused to tell officials at the ICE facility how much.

The man is also refusing any medical examination, clinical director at Otay Mesa Detention Center said in a declaration.

The physician indicated in federal filings that they are concerned the detainee could suffer serious health problems because of the ongoing hunger strike.

U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw approved ICE’s request to restrain the man if necessary to perform a medical examination and forcefully feed and hydrate him.

“The Court finds that Plaintiff is likely to succeed in showing that its interests in preserving life and discharging its duties to care for those in its custody outweigh any interest Defendant might have in expressing himself through a hunger strike,” U.S. District Judge wrote in the order.

The Hill has reached out to ICE for comment.

The Daily Beast identified the man as Evgenii Ivanov. He has reportedly lost 27 pounds and has refused 51 meals since his stay began.

Ivanov has been in immigration proceedings since November. His next court appearance is scheduled for the end of next month."
Defense Department Official Stresses CBD Ban For Military Members,https://www.marijuanamoment.net,['Kyle Jaeger'],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.marijuanamoment.net/defense-department-official-stresses-cbd-ban-for-military-members/,"A Department of Defense (DOD) official is reiterating that military service members are barred from using CBD products despite the legalization of hemp and its derivatives under the 2018 Farm Bill.

Patricia Deuster, director of the Human Performance Laboratory at the federal government-run Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, said in a call with reporters this week that the non-intoxicating compound is “completely forbidden for use by any service member in any of the services at this point of time.”

While CBD products are widely available—in grocery stores, gas stations and online—the lack of regulations for these items from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) creates uncertainty about levels of THC in the preparations. And military members who test positive for THC can be punished with an other-than-honorable discharge and the potential loss of other benefits.

“It’s a real conundrum, and it’s going to be a major issue for the military because it is available [nearly everywhere],” Deuster said, according to Military.com, which first reported her remarks. “You go into any store, and you can find gummy bears with a supplement fact panel on it.”

Though the Tuesday press call simply provided clarity on existing military CBD policy, it represents the latest example of DOD interest in preventing the use of cannabis among service members.

The Navy released a notice earlier this month stipulating that “all hemp and CBD products are strictly prohibited for use by Sailors” no matter the legal status. And the Coast Guard said its members aren’t even allowed to visit marijuana shops or use online or delivery cannabis services, according to an order released last month.

That order didn’t specify policy around hemp-derived CBD, but a Coast Guard official told Mililtary.com that if members “have a desire to use a product that may or may not fall into the definition of what’s prohibited, they should seek guidance or use caution.”

Last year, the Air Force wrote in a post that “consumption [of marijuana] is not permitted in any fashion, period.” It emphasized the need to take caution as more states legalize, with one risk factor being your “friend’s grandma’s miracle sticky buns” that “might look mighty tasty and get rave reviews at the big shindig,” but could contain THC.

In a memo released in April, the Air Force said that “Airmen are advised against using CBD products” and could face disciplinary action if they use CBD that isn’t the FDA-approved drug Epidiolex.

The Army issued a similar notice in November 2016 that stated service members may not use marijuana, hemp or hemp oil.

Though not a military branch, NASA also sent a warning to its workforce this month that the unregulated nature of CBD products means employees could inadvertently consume THC that could get them fired.

“The problem is there is no regulatory framework to ensure that the CBD products being sold meet the Farm Act,” Deuster said on the call this week. “[CBD] is everywhere. We are waiting for the FDA to do something,”

She added that service members shouldn’t “believe what [the companies] are telling you” about the benefits of CBD.

VA charges: Doctor's ruse risked his life,https://www.arkansasonline.com,['Doug Thompson'],08-21-2019,2019,8,https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2019/aug/21/va-charges-doctor-s-ruse-risked-his-lif/,"“Our veterans go to get help and not be harmed,” U.S. Attorney Duane “Dak” Kees said Tuesday in announcing the charges against Robert Morris Levy. - Photo by David Gottschalk

FAYETTEVILLE -- A former pathologist charged in the deaths of three patients also committed fraud to hide his alcohol abuse, falsified medical records and gave false statements to investigators, according to a federal indictment.

Dr. Robert Morris Levy, 53, of Fayetteville risked his own life to stay intoxicated on the job at the Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks, according to the indictment. Levy was paid $225,000 a year plus bonuses to review laboratory test results on tissue samples and make diagnoses based on those findings, according to the indictment.

U.S. Attorney Duane ""Dak"" Kees and Inspector General Michael Missal of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs held a news conference on the case Tuesday and released copies of the indictment at the Washington County sheriff's office. Directors of the Ozark system had no comment Tuesday.

The federal grand jury indicted Levy on 12 counts each of wire fraud and mail fraud, four counts of giving false statements and three counts of involuntary manslaughter. Trial is set for Oct. 7 in federal court in Fayetteville. If convicted on all counts, Levy would face a theoretical maximum of 524 years in prison and fines totaling $7.75 million, Kees said.

""Our veterans go to get help and not be harmed,"" Kees said of the Ozarks system. ""Our thoughts are with the veterans and their families."" Missal added later that charges such as manslaughter are ""exceedingly rare"" in the veterans health care system nationwide, and that observers would have to ""go back a number of years"" to find any similar case.

Brian Smith of Memphis is an attorney representing several veterans who suffered from missed diagnoses by Levy and their family members or survivors, he said Tuesday. ""We are continuing to look at what happened,"" Smith said. ""They are trying to hang all this on Dr. Levy, but we believe people at the medical center and above have responsibility.""

""It's been a tough day for the veterans and their families who are involved in this,"" Smith said.

Levy was being held without bail in the Washington County jail after his arrest late Friday and, as of yet, has no attorney to speak for him, Kees said. Levy pleaded innocent in a federal court appearance Tuesday morning, federal court records show. The investigation into how the situation developed at the Ozarks system isn't over, Kees said.

Pathology errors at the veterans system came to light publicly June 18, 2018, when the Ozarks system and three members of the state's congressional delegation held a news conference at the center in Fayetteville. The other three members of the Arkansas delegation were unable to attend but sent staff members. That news conference announced the beginning of a yearlong review of every case the pathologist had worked on from his hiring in 2005 through 2018. The name of the pathologist wasn't released at the time.

Third District U.S. Rep. Steve Womack, 4th District U.S. Rep. Bruce Westerman and U.S. Sen. John Boozman, all Republicans, attended the 2018 announcement and also issued statements after Tuesday's news conference. All three, along with U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton pledged Tuesday to continue monitoring the situation.

""For the sake of the integrity of the VA medical system and the quality of care of our heroes, we have a duty to ensure that bad actors are held accountable,"" Womack's statement says. ""This situation can never be allowed to happen again.""

Patients' families and veteran groups asked at the first news conference and during each of the seven public meetings held after on the progress of the review: Why was the pathologist involved not watched closely after he was reported to be working while impaired in 2016 and allowed to return after passing through a substance-abuse treatment program? Administrators at the Ozarks system said they could not answer those questions because that aspect of the review was a personnel matter.

The indictment released Tuesday says Levy was closely monitored, giving 42 random blood and urine tests after completing the substance-abuse program. He intoxicated himself while evading the tests by using a highly toxic form of alcohol, 2-methyl-2-butanol, according to the indictment. That substance doesn't show up on normal alcohol and drug screening.

""Being a pathologist, he was skilled in toxicology and had the knowledge and the medical equipment to give himself exactly the right amount,"" Kees said Tuesday about Levy. More than a tiny amount of the substance, carefully measured for the individual taking it, is fatal, Kees said. Kees declined to say how much Levy is believed to have taken in each dose, ""but it's a matter of drops.""

The 2-methyl-2-butanol compound isn't produced for human consumption, Kees said. According to product listings on a chemical company website, the substance is legal onlyfor research and development.

Levy had to submit blood and urine samples to both the Ozarks system and to the Mississippi State Board of Medical Licensure, which issued his medical license. In all, he submitted his 42 blood or urine samples from Nov. 11, 2016, to July 3, 2018. That averages out to two a month. None tested positive for drugs or alcohol.

Investigators found 12 purchases of ""2m-2b"" in Levy's financial records, all between June 30, 2017, and June 13, 2018, the indictment shows. Ordering the substance with the intent to defraud the Ozarks system by cheating on the alcohol tests and taking delivery of it resulted in the wire- and mail-fraud charges, according to the indictment.

The indictment says Levy's ruse was discovered by a March 1, 2018, breath analysis. The indictment doesn't say who administered the test or why, but Fayetteville Police Department records show Levy was arrested that day for driving while intoxicated after going to the post office on Dickson Street. In a July 9, 2018, interview, Levy blamed the arrest for his firing the following April and the subsequent review of his work.

Reviewing all of Levy's cases since he started work at the Ozark system in 2005 took more than a year. The review by pathologists from other hospitals found 30 missed diagnoses that posed serious health risks to patients, according to results released May 31 by the health care system. Overall, pathologists found 3,029 errors out of 33,902 cases, but most patients didn't suffer long-term ill effects, according to the review.

The review found an error rate of 8.9% compared with a pathology practice average of 0.7%, according to Ozarks system director Kelvin Parks. That works out to an error rate more than 12 times the average, figures show.

Investigators from the Veterans Affairs Department and the U.S. attorney's office questioned Levy about any substance abuse after March 1, 2018.

Levy testified under oath, the indictment says, that he had no idea what substance had been detected in his March 1, 2018, breath test even though he had ordered 2m-2b before and after investigators first questioned him. Levy denied any knowledge of using any intoxicant after 2016, he told investigators subsequently.

Investigators also found Levy changed the medical records of all three of the patients who died as a result of diagnoses he missed, Kees said. The names of those patients weren't released Tuesday.

Levy caused the death of a patient identified as JRG by entering ""an incorrect and misleading diagnosis"" on Feb. 4, 2014, in the patient's medical record and falsely putting into the record that a second pathologist verified his results.

Levy then, according to the indictment, entered another equally incorrect diagnosis in the same case by altering the medical record again. The patient was treated for a type of cancer he didn't have and died of small cell carcinoma on July 26, 2014.

Levy made another fatal misdiagnosis on or about Sept. 22, 2014, according to the indictment in the case of a patient identified only as JDQ. According to the indictment, Levy said a second pathologist who reviewed the case concurred in Levy's diagnosis even though ""Levy well knew that a second pathologist did not concur."" The patient died Sept. 13, 2015.

The third patient died April 28, 2016, after getting a cancer-free diagnosis from Levy in 2009. The tissue samples from that case, of patient identified as DRM, ""was obviously cancerous,"" according to the indictment.

The Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks serves veterans in 23 counties in Northwest Arkansas, southwest Missouri and eastern Oklahoma.

USDA Begs Americans to Finally Stop Washing Their Chicken,https://www.inverse.com,[],,,,https://www.inverse.com/article/58691-do-not-wash-chicken-poultry,"Raw chicken, with its slightly slimy sheen, doesn’t look clean enough to eat. That doesn’t mean that you should wash it with water, though. While it’s common practice for some — and even the legendary chef Julia Child washed her poultry — scientists consistently agree that rinsing chicken is dangerous.

A report from the US Department of Agriculture released on Tuesday is the latest in a long line of research to link poultry washing to an increased risk of becoming ill. That’s because raw chicken is often contaminated with Campylobacter bacteria, as well as Salmonella and Clostridium perfringens bacteria. Cooking chicken at 165 degrees Fahrenheit is all you need to destroy these bacteria and make the meal safe to consume.

Meanwhile, washing chicken easily spreads the bacteria to other surfaces and foods, increasing the likelihood of an unsuspecting encounter that causes people to become sick.

Want to know why you shouldn’t wash chicken? Watch where the germs go in this new CDC video. #FoodSafety https://t.co/TsOrI1FpGj pic.twitter.com/qkJOptArGT — CDC (@CDCgov) August 20, 2019

This investigation was a partnership between the USDA and North Carolina State University. Overall, 300 people were asked to prepare a chicken and a salad in a test kitchen located in either the Raleigh-Durham area of North Carolina or in Lillington, North Carolina. All participants self-reported that they had some experience washing or rinsing raw chicken at home. Their reasons for washing included the intention to “remove blood/slime” or “because that is how a family member does it.”

These participants were broken up into two groups — one that was told before the cooking experience that washing their poultry was dangerous, and one that was not. When they started cooking, 93 percent of the first group did not end up washing their chicken, while 61 percent of the second group did.

Overall, preparing raw chicken close to a salad created a potentially dangerous scenario. Twenty-six participants who washed their chicken accidentally transferred the chicken’s bacteria to their salad lettuce. But even when people didn’t wash their chicken, 31 percent still ended up with salad that was contaminated with chicken bacteria. This cross-contamination is chalked up to “a lack of effective handwashing and contamination of the sink utensils.”

“Please keep in mind that children, older adults, and those with compromised immune systems are especially at risk,” explains Administrator Carmen Rottenberg of USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service. “Washing or rinsing raw meat and poultry can increase your risk as bacteria spreads around your kitchen, but not washing your hands for 20 seconds immediately after handling those raw foods is just as dangerous.”

The investigators also found that 60 percent of the sinks and counters in the test kitchens used by the chicken-washers were contaminated with bacteria as well. Furthermore, 14 percent of these surfaces remained contaminated even after they were cleaned.

Luckily, no one ate any of the food prepared in the test kitchen.

The report additionally notes that, while it’s popular to brine poultry in salt water, vinegar, or lemon juice, that practice only flavors the chicken. It does not destroy bacteria, and that bacteria, in turn, contributes to millions of cases of foodborne illnesses that strike Americans each year.

If you really want to get the slime off your chicken, the best thing to do is to pat the area down with a paper towel and wash your hands as soon as possible."
Why does Kevin Moley still have a job at the State Department?,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Daniel W. Drezner', 'Daniel W. Drezner Is A Professor Of International Politics At The Fletcher School Of Law', 'Diplomacy At Tufts University', 'A Regular Contributor To', 'August At Am']",08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/08/22/why-does-kevin-moley-still-have-job-state-department/,"Daniel W. Drezner is a professor of international politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University and a regular contributor to PostEverything

The hard-working staff here at Spoiler Alerts has been highly critical of how the Trump administration has treated the State Department. Morale was awful under Rex Tillerson and has barely improved under successor Mike Pompeo. The situation was so bad in 2017 that even Trump appointees publicly acknowledged the morale problem. In 2019, Foreign Service officers keep leaving the administration, writing Washington Post op-eds to explain: “More and more I found myself in a defensive stance, struggling to explain to foreign peoples the blatant contradictions at home. … I can no longer justify to him, or to myself, my complicity in the actions of this administration.”

Still, perhaps Pompeo means what he says about returning the swagger to the State Department. Susan Glasser’s recent New Yorker profile of him was not terribly flattering but acknowledged that morale had improved somewhat. In a recent interview with the Washington Examiner, Pompeo pledged: “I want to make the State Department a place where people want to come serve. I always think when you’re responsible for a team that one of the things you can do that outlasts your time and service is that you can create a culture and an environment where the best and brightest from all across America want to come be [a] part of that team.”

Furthermore, Pompeo has taken action when his subordinates behave badly. Earlier this month, Pompeo fired policy planning director Kiron Skinner for her “abusive” management style. According to Politico’s Eliana Johnson and Nahal Toosi, “State Department officials said Skinner acted unprofessionally in multiple ways, including yelling in public spaces and using homophobic language.” This secretary of state is unafraid to take tough actions to eliminate bad eggs, even when such actions threaten his pet projects.

That leads me to the question animating today’s column and directed at Pompeo: Why does Assistant Secretary of State Kevin Moley still have a job?

Some background: Fourteen months ago, Foreign Policy’s Colum Lynch and Robbie Gramer broke a story alleging that Mari Stull, a political appointee in the Bureau of International Organization Affairs (IO), was vetting the political affiliation and views of career employees. This would violate the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, as well as the guidelines laid out in the Foreign Affairs Manual. Stull worked for and was appointed by Moley, the assistant secretary of state for IO. In response to the article, the State Department’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) opened an investigation into the matter.

OIG published its findings last week in a 30-page report that incriminates both Stull and Moley. Some of the highlights:

“Throughout its review of the IO Bureau, OIG found that the leadership of IO failed to meet the Department’s Leadership and Management Principles. Nearly every employee interviewed by OIG raised concerns about the leadership of IO and the treatment of staff. Then-Under Secretary Shannon told OIG that IO employees had described to him a negative and ‘vindictive’ environment in IO cultivated by Assistant Secretary Moley and Ms. Stull.”

“Several current and former IO employees reported that Assistant Secretary Moley and Ms. Stull frequently berated employees, raised their voices, and generally engaged in unprofessional behavior toward staff. Senior Department officials outside of IO were particularly concerned about such treatment directed at more junior employees.”

“Other employees reported that they were reprimanded by Assistant Secretary Moley and Ms. Stull for following established Department policies and procedures.”

“Assistant Secretary Moley criticized employees when they told him that official travel that he planned in May 2018 did not qualify for first class accommodations under the Department’s travel policies and accused them of ‘not fighting hard enough’ to meet his demands.”

There’s plenty more, but those excerpts provide the general idea.

There are two other points worth noting. The first is that the problems were severe enough for acting director general for the Foreign Service William Todd, undersecretary for political affairs Thomas Shannon, Shannon’s successor Stephen Mull and deputy secretary John Sullivan to meet with Moley at various points to discuss Stull’s bad behavior, as well as sagging morale at IO.

The second is that Moley’s mismanagement of the situation led to an exodus of IO staff. As the OIG report says, “Approximately 50 of 300 domestic IO employees have departed IO since Assistant Secretary Moley took over its leadership, and nearly all of the former employees who OIG interviewed stated that poor leadership of the bureau contributed to their decision to depart.”

OIG recommended disciplinary action for Moley. (Stull left the State Department in January.) The State Department responded by saying that Moley “has been counseled by Department leaders on appropriate leadership and management of the bureau. Further discipline will be considered following OIG’s assessment of [Moley’s] response to the draft OIG report.” Moley’s response is included in the final OIG report, and it’s pretty laughable. Moley tries to pin most of the blame on Stull. But his denials contradict what Sullivan and Shannon told OIG and other facts OIG discovered.

Given Moley’s fact-challenged response, those who care about U.S. diplomacy — which presumably includes Pompeo — should hope he is gone soon. The day after the OIG report was released, Politico’s Toosi reported widespread frustration that Moley still had a job, especially given that Pompeo fired Skinner for similar transgressions: “If Moley isn’t fired, it sets a bad precedent for holding anyone else accountable, current and former staffers argued. ‘It’s offensive that [Moley] is collecting a taxpayer-funded paycheck today,’ one staffer said.”

The Los Angeles Times’s Tracy Wilkinson reported that “morale is sinking” at the State Department and that further resignations from Foreign Service officers are pending. Keeping Moley around despite documented examples of horrible management seems like a surefire way for Pompeo to contradict his pledge to “make the State Department a place where people want to come serve.”

Pompeo’s principal calling card as secretary of state has been his willingness to make the Faustian bargain of staying in President Trump’s good graces. It would be nice if he showed that he cared as much about the workplace culture of his employees as he does about the whims of the president. What happens to Moley will be an interesting test of whether Pompeo means what he says."
GOP Oversight report says Interior head met with group tied to former clients,https://thehill.com,[],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/458474-republican-oversight-report-shows-interior-head-met-with-groups,"Republicans on the House Oversight and Reform Committee released a report Thursday examining Interior Secretary David Bernhardt’s calendar and alleged conflicts of interest in an effort to counter an ongoing investigation by Democrats.

But the report appears to confirm Bernhardt met with a group he recused himself from dealing with as part of his ethics pledge.

Democrats on the Oversight Committee have yet to release a report, but Republicans launched their own probe after they said Democrats launched an investigation without consulting them and issued an “unprecedented and overbroad initial document request.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Bernhardt, a former lobbyist for a number of oil and gas companies, has been under fire from Democrats and environmental groups since joining the Trump administration as deputy secretary at the Department of the Interior (DOI). Democrats argue his background leaves him with a wealth of conflicts of interest, and have accused him of violating public records laws with how he

manages his calendar

.

The GOP report lists a number of findings, the majority of which state that, “contrary to allegations,” Bernhardt is not mismanaging his calendar, obfuscating meetings or violating ethics laws. Republicans instead accused Oversight Chairman Elijah Cummings Elijah Eugene CummingsNikki Haley voices 'complete support' for Pence House committee heads demand Coast Guard Academy explain handling of harassment allegations Can the Democrats unseat Trump? MORE (D-Md.) and House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) of using “cherry-picked information to create a false impression"" about transparency at Interior.

“This interim staff report sets the record straight about the allegations levied against Bernhardt and DOI. The record is clear that contrary to public allegations of wrongdoing, DOI and Bernhardt have acted appropriately and ethically in maintaining and preserving the Secretary’s calendar records, as well as making them publicly available,” the GOP report said.

But Bernhardt's critics say the report shows he took meetings with former clients.

One part of the report aims to dissect a meeting of interest to Democrats involving Bernhardt and nine oil and gas companies.

That included the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association (LMOGA), a division of the U.S. Oil and Gas Association (USOGA).

“LMOGA appears to have an association to an entity on Bernhardt’s recusal list, U.S. Oil and Gas Association, but it does not appear that this association would require a recusal in all circumstances,” the report said.

Aaron Weiss with the Center for Western Priorities, which has criticized Bernhardt’s ethics record, said the secretary should not meet with a division of a group on his recusal list.

“They don’t ‘appear to have an affiliation’ — they are part of USOGA,” Weiss said. “They are on Bernhardt's recusal list.”

A spokesperson for Interior said another oil company, Statoil, did not attend the meeting because of advice from Interior ethics officials.

""Secretary Bernhardt is and always has been committed to upholding his ethical responsibilities, and he takes his ethics pledge very seriously. He seeks advice from career ethics officials before taking any meeting involving external parties and strictly follows their advice and guidance,"" a spokesman for the agency told The Hill.

The Hill has reached out to Oversight Republicans for further comment on the LMOGA meeting.

Democrats on the House Natural Resources Committee did not respond to request for comment, but Oversight Democrats say the report from their Republican colleagues left many questions unanswered.

“The Republican Staff Report provides cover for the Trump Administration’s secrecy. The Committee still has unanswered questions about who Secretary David Bernhardt met with, when, and why. The Committee is also concerned about how the Department maintains records of Secretary Bernhardt’s meetings, as well as its compliance with FOIA, which remains a serious problem,” Cummings said in a statement to The Hill.

Interior has been under fire for a number of actions critics say make the department less transparent, from a public records policy that would give political hires more influence over what documents are released to leaving controversial meetings off of Bernhardt’s public calendar.

Interior previously outlined how meeting requests would be vetted by ethics officials before being added to the schedule on a Google document. Some meetings were added to the public calendar, but others were placed on “daily cards” used to outline Bernhardt’s schedule.

“Bernhardt’s calendars are not created to be public documents, but instead used as an internal method of allocating his time,” the report said.

House Democrats have questioned whether the method violates public record-keeping laws, but Interior said an outside review found the process did not result is destruction of federal records.

""We are pleased the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) found the Department of the Interior to be in full compliance with records management laws. We appreciate their thorough and professional review in response to Congressional inquiries,” Interior told The Hill in July.

The GOP report includes high praise for Bernhardt, saying he “is improving the ‘anemic’ ethics environment of the Obama administration” and repeatedly lists witness testimony saying Bernhardt has not violated ethics or public record keeping laws.

Weiss said the report cherry-picks interviews and hopes that all of them will be released publicly.

“This is truly a ridiculous document that reads like it was written by Bernhardt himself,” he said.

"President Trump decision to end DACA was lawful, Justice Department says",https://www.foxnews.com,['Danielle Wallace'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/president-trump-decision-to-end-daca-was-lawful-justice-department-supreme-court,"The Justice Department submitted a legal brief to the Supreme Court Monday that stated President Trump acted lawfully when he decided to end the Obama-era immigration program known as DACA in September of 2017, according to a new report.

The Department of Homeland Security, “correctly, and at a minimum reasonably, concluded that DACA is unlawful,” Justice Department lawyers wrote in a brief submitted to the Supreme Court late Monday.

SUPREME COURT TO DECIDE WHETHER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CAN END DACA PROGRAM

The Supreme Court will begin to hear arguments in November. A ruling is expected in the presidential election year, putting the high court at the center of one of the most politically charged issues of debates. A decision in favor of Trump would allow for the president to deport more than one million young adults residing in the U.S. under DACA protection, the New York Times reported.

Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, was created under an executive order in 2012. The program gives some illegal immigrants -- known as ""Dreamers"" -- who were brought to the United States as children-- the opportunity to receive a renewable two-year reprieve from deportation and become eligible for a work permit.

In 2017, the Trump administration announced its plan to phase out the program, but federal courts have ruled that the phase-out could not apply retroactively and that the program should be restarted.

The White House fought back on those decisions, saying the president has broad authority over immigration enforcement policy. Federal appeals courts around the country have rejected efforts by the federal government to move ahead with phasing out the Obama-era program.

DACA proponents have also argued that Trump’s planned termination of the program violates federal law requiring adequate notice-and-comment periods before certain federal rules are changed, as well as other constitutional equal protection and due process guarantees.

A decision from the Supreme Court to end DACA could galvanize young Americans to ensure Trump does not see another four years in the White House, the Times report stated. On the other hand, if the Court chooses to continue the Obama-era program, conservatives could argue Trump needs another four years to fulfill his campaign promises on immigration.

(Photo by Liz Ruskin/Alaska Public Media)

Protesters stood outside the Dena’ina Center Tuesday. Inside, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency addressed a luncheon sponsored by the Resource Development Council. EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler spoke of easing regulations on industry. He talked about hot-button issues, like narrowing the definition of wetlands and chemical pollutants in drinking water.

He didn’t say a word about the hottest Alaska conflict facing the EPA: the proposed Pebble Mine, the project that draws protesters to nearly every relevant forum.

For over a decade, Bristol Bay fishing communities have been campaigning against the proposed gold and copper mine, though some Alaskans, including villagers closer to site, say they’d welcome the jobs.

In the latest turn on Pebble, the publication E&E News reported last week that political staffers at EPA headquarters watered down the concerns raised by scientists in the regional EPA office about the adequacy of the environmental review of the proposal.

The EPA is in a powerful position. It has the right to veto Pebble’s application, even if the Corps of Engineers wants to greenlight the mine.

But the head of the EPA says the decision won’t be his. Wheeler used to work at a law firm hired by Pebble, so he needs to avoid the appearance of a conflict.

“So far, you all are the first people to have raised Pebble to me,” he told reporters at the Dena’ina Center. “But if people do raise it, I just explain that under my ethics recusal with the agency, which I abide by, I can’t discuss Pebble mine.”

How the EPA decides whether to exercise its veto power is something mine developers and opponents are watching closely.

Wheeler left the decision to the EPA’s top lawyer, who Wheeler says is working with the agency’s Region 10 administrator, Chris Hladick. Hladick is an Alaskan who has worked in commercial fishing towns. Mine opponents worry he, and the scientists at Region 10, will be steamrolled.

Hladick says a team of 40 staffers worked on the document reviewing the Pebble environmental impact statement, and he says nothing out of the ordinary occurred.

“Anything that you do at the EPA comes with consensus of headquarters,” he said.

Region 10 was still able to produce a long document finding fault with the environmental statement on the mine.

“Yeah, 170 pages of comments,” Hladick said. “They’re pretty substantial.”

EPA’s critique hit home with at least one key player: Sen. Lisa Murkowski says the document Region 10 issued has her doubting that the environmental review of Pebble’s plan has been sufficiently rigorous.

“This is substantive,” she said of the criticism. “This is considerable. And it needs to be addressed. And if it can’t be addressed, there shouldn’t be a permit that issues.”

“Over three tours abroad, I worked to spread what I believed were American values: freedom, fairness and tolerance,” Park wrote in an essay. “But more and more I found myself in a defensive stance, struggling to explain to foreign peoples the blatant contradictions at home.”

The ranks of the United States’ foreign policy establishment are being roiled once again by resignations, reports of partisan intimidation and looming massive cuts in foreign aid that critics in Congress and elsewhere contend weaken American diplomacy worldwide.

When Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo took over the State Department 16 months ago, there was a surge in optimism that a dispirited corps would be reinvigorated after a tumultuous year of budget cuts and bungled management under former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson.

But morale is sinking amid signs that American foreign policy is now being dictated unchecked by a shoot-from-the-hip president and executed by a secretary of State with the political savvy to actually implement those controversial policies.

That includes efforts to essentially revamp the United States’ asylum programs, proceed with arms sales to Saudi Arabia despite bipartisan congressional opposition following the gruesome murder of a U.S.-based journalist in a Saudi consulate, and overturning of decades of U.S. policy in the Middle East by moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to the disputed city of Jerusalem and recognizing Israeli sovereignty over Golan Heights.

In parts of the world and international venues where American influence was once king, the United States has lost influence or is not present, critics say. Pompeo has declined to get involved in a delicate dispute between Japan and South Korea, two key Asian allies whose cooperation is central to regional stability and negotiations with nuclear-armed North Korea.

Pompeo will not attend this week’s Group of 7 meeting of the world’s top advanced democracies, leaving it to Trump –- who last year stormed away from the summit and refused to sign a final document, the first time that has happened. A communique this week from Western democracies offering support to the Hong Kong protesters facing off with China was signed by major world powers, but not the United States.

And in the coming days, the White House is expected to maneuver around legal hurdles to attempt to slash as much as $4 billion in U.S. foreign aid that supports critical programs around the world, including peace-keeping missions, and development, educational and human rights projects.

“We are not in a good place for dealing with the next super-crisis overseas, nor ongoing great power competition,” said Barbara Leaf, a retired 34-year veteran of the foreign service whose last post was as ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, on Twitter. In an interview, she added, “We have lost decades of expertise vital to our national interests ... and we are stepping back a degree from the international engagement of the last 75 years that shaped” the world order.

For many diplomats like Park, the unconventional Trump approach has triggered an intense debate about whether to stay and promote good diplomacy, or leave an administration that violates their values. In social chat rooms and private conversations, they discuss what one diplomat called the “morality” of their work.

One of State’s most senior officials, the assistant secretary in charge of the Western Hemisphere, Kimberly Breier, abruptly resigned this month after reportedly clashing with White House advisor Stephen Miller over his aggressive immigration policies. Several people said they expected additional departures in the coming weeks.

Another diplomat told The Times this week he was quitting in part because Pompeo’s State Department seemed to have little use for input from its experienced foreign service officers. “We are serving a secretary of State who largely agrees with the president” instead of offering alternative viewpoints, said the diplomat, who is based in Latin America and requested anonymity because his resignation is pending. State’s “is a largely empowering voice,” he added.

Trump and Pompeo defend their policies, arguing the United States can no longer be the world’s police force or its benefactor. They say they are promoting a doctrine of “America first” that puts top priority on the prosperity and security of U.S. citizens.

But critics warn that could lead to U.S. isolation. “What we’re seeing, I think, is the institutionalization of America alone,” said Heather Conley, who heads the Europe program at the nonpartisan Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Other countries are trying to figure out who takes up the new mantle and [whether] can they hold on … until the U.S. returns to that leadership role, if it will.”

Speaking this week to the United Nations Security Council in New York, Pompeo defended the administration’s conduct of foreign policy, saying it was “reviving” America’s leadership role by joining multilateral efforts that are “meaningful,” “effective” and “reflect the values of freedom-loving societies,” such as the battle against Islamic State terrorism.

But in State Department ranks, there are frustrations on other fronts as well. A new report by the Inspector General’s office documents cases of Trump loyalists appointed to senior positions inside the department who went on to demand fealty to the administration and often berated and abused those they believed fell short.

The report recounted cases of “harassment” of career employees “premised on claims that they were ‘disloyal’ based on their perceived political views.”

Focusing on the State Department’s internal divisions over the United Nations and other multilateral organizations, investigators described a “negative and vindictive” environment in which one political appointee, senior advisor Mari Stull, punished and dressed down those she believed undermined Trump. She removed one senior official from the office and drove away dozens more, according to the report. She reportedly scrubbed officers’ social media, blacklisted those she deemed insufficiently loyal to Trump and labeled them “traitors,” it concluded.

Stull, who left the administration earlier this year, was formerly a food-industry lobbyist who came to the State Department from a wine blog she produced under the name Vino Vixen. She told those who complained that their objections were “pointless,” the report said, because “the Trump administration ‘has my back.’”

The inspector’s report also cited her boss, assistant secretary Kevin Moley, for failing to respond to complaints and granting her an “unprecedented level of independence,” according to an internal memo. He denied to investigators “the behavior attributed to me,” and remains in office.

A second inspector general report is underway on other alleged abuses, including the firing of a diplomat of Iranian descent, according to people familiar with the probe.

In cutting foreign aid, it remains unclear which programs will be targeted and how much money will be lost. To slash the money, the White House is attempting a workaround by submitting the proposed cuts late in the fiscal year so that Congress will not have time to act. The “rescission” package, as it is known, freezes foreign-aid money that Congress already approved for a 45-day review period. The fiscal year ends in Sept. 30, meaning the money will almost certainly go unspent and be returned to the U.S. Treasury.

The administration argues the action will help reduce the budget deficit. Agencies likely to be affected denied this, noting the money is a tiny fraction of the overall government budget.

Gayle Smith, former administrator of U.S. AID and president of the One Campaign, a global group that fights poverty and preventable disease, said the rescission move was “as ineffective as it is shameful.” It will “undermine U.S. leadership around the world,” she said, “subvert Congress’ spending authority ... and chip away at really powerful relationships” with private sectors, universities, civil societies and other non-governmental entities in scores of countries.

Trump this week said he was willing to listen to members of Congress but that he planned to go ahead with cuts. He argued that taking money away from countries or groups, citing Pakistan and the Palestinians, makes them more pliable in negotiations, though history has showed otherwise.

Opposition in Congress has come from both sides of the aisle. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) said the maneuver is illegal. Even Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said taking money from critical State Department programs “only undermines our national security interests and emboldens our adversaries.”

Justice charges 80 in massive online fraud case linked to Nigerian defendants,https://thehill.com,[],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/458446-justice-charges-80-in-massive-online-fraud-case-linked-to-nigerian,"The Department of Justice on Thursday unsealed a 252-count federal indictment charging 80 defendants, many of whom are Nigerian nationals, with conspiring to steal millions of dollars through online scams.

The indictment was unsealed by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California and was made public shortly after authorities arrested 14 of the defendants across the United States, with 11 of these defendants apprehended in the Los Angeles region. The majority of the defendants are outside the country, with many likely in Nigeria.

The defendants involved in the case were charged with attempting to defraud individuals of millions of dollars through the use of business email compromise (BEC) and online romance scams, in addition to other schemes meant to target the elderly.

The investigation is being led by the FBI, with each of the defendants charged with “conspiracy to commit fraud, conspiracy to launder money, and aggravated identity theft,” according to Justice Department. Some defendants also face fraud and money laundering charges.

U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna described the scams used by the defendants during a press conference on Thursday, saying that “fraud networks now target individuals and businesses alike.”

“In the BEC scams, the fraudsters will often hack a company’s email system, impersonate company personnel, and direct payments to bank accounts that funnel money back to the fraudsters in Nigeria,” Hanna said. “In the romance scams, victims think they are developing a dating relationship, when in fact they are just being tricked into sending money to the fraudsters.”

Hanna added that “we believe this is one of the largest cases of its kind in U.S. history.”

Paul Delacourt, the assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Los Angeles field office, said during the same press conference that losses involved in this case for victims total around $10 million. He said defendants attempted to obtain $40 million from victims.

There were at least 32 victims in the case, from the United States and other countries including Japan, the United Kingdom, Lebanon, Ukraine, China, Mexico, Germany, Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates, and Trinidad and Tobago.

Delacourt said the case began in 2016 after one individual was victimized by the defendants. The two main defendants in the case are Nigerian citizens Valentine Iro and Chukwudi Christogunus Igbokwe.

“In the days ahead, we will be working with our foreign counterparts in nine countries to apprehend 57 additional defendants,” Delacourt said, noting that six defendants are still at large in the United States.

Delacourt emphasized the seriousness of these types of fraud, noting that in the first seven months of 2019, the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center received more than 14,000 complaints related to BEC scams, with a total loss of nearly $1.1 billion for victims.

“This crime is growing exponentially in terms of losses and victims,” Delacourt said. “While we are happy to announce these charges today, we are not going to arrest our way out of this problem, and we so we continue to educate potential victims.”"
USDA cuts buyout packages for employees who won't relocate,https://www.cnn.com,['Sam Fossum'],08-20-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/20/politics/usda-buyouts-kansas-city/index.html,"(CNN) The US Department of Agriculture is shrinking payments offered to employees who applied for buyouts rather than relocate to the greater Kansas City area, according to a document obtained by CNN.

The one-time payouts are being reduced from $25,000 to $10,000 because so many workers applied, according to the document.

The American Federation of Government Employees, which represents workers at the affected agencies, says employees of the two research-related agencies that are being moved out of the the Washington area are ""extremely upset.""

A USDA spokesperson told CNN that the department said the change was made in order to offer payments to all eligible employees, rather than offer only the higher amount on a first-come, first-served basis. Workers still have the option to refuse the reduced payment if they decide to relocate, the spokesperson added.

The change comes after a union-compiled survey released last month showed an overwhelming number of the reassigned employees will likely choose to leave rather than relocate -- losses that could drain institutional knowledge and talent at two units that fund agricultural research across the nation and produce crucial reports, including data on agricultural markets and estimates of US and international agricultural productivity.

New York sues EPA over GE's Hudson River PCB cleanup,https://www.reuters.com,"['Jonathan Stempel', 'Min Read']",08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-new-york-epa/new-york-sues-epa-over-ges-hudson-river-pcb-cleanup-idUSKCN1VB1YM,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday, accusing the agency of prematurely allowing General Electric Co to stop clearing the Hudson River of PCB contamination before the cleanup was finished.

Citing the state’s compelling interest in protecting the public and the environment from contaminants, New York officials are seeking to void GE’s “certificate of completion” from the EPA on April 11, which excused the company from further dredging unless further studies showed more was needed.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Attorney General Letitia James, both Democrats, accused Republican President Donald Trump’s administration of siding with “big polluters” by accepting PCB levels that constitute a known health risk and leave Hudson River fish “too toxic” to eat.

“Since the EPA has failed to hold GE accountable for restoring the river, New York is taking action to demand a full and complete remediation,” Cuomo said in a statement.

The EPA did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but has said its decisionmaking was not politically driven.

GE had spent an estimated $1.7 billion to clean up the river over eight years, including six years of dredging, under a 2006 consent decree.

Mark Behan, a GE spokesman, said the EPA found that the Boston-based company had met its cleanup obligations, and that New York’s own data showed that 99% of sampled locations in the upper Hudson met state cleanup standards.

“Environmental conditions in the Hudson will continue to improve and GE will continue to cooperate,” he added.

New York filed its lawsuit in the federal court in Albany, the state’s capital, seeking to void GE’s completion certificate and block its reissuance until the cleanup is done right.

PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, were used in electrical equipment, carbonless copy paper and other products before a 1979 U.S. manufacturing ban, and are considered possible human carcinogens.

Two since-closed GE capacitor manufacturing plants north of Albany dumped roughly 650 tons of PCBs into the river between 1947 and 1977.

About 200 miles of the river were polluted, stretching as far south as Battery Park in Manhattan, though most pollution occurred in a 40-mile (64-km) zone near the plants.

State officials said about 54 tons of PCBs remain in the upper Hudson, roughly 13 tons more than the EPA expected when it found dredging necessary, and that PCB levels in fish remain three times higher than the agency’s goal."
A 100-Year Treasury?,https://www.wsj.com,['The Editorial Board'],,,,https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-100-year-treasury-11566515504,"Some $16 trillion in securities around the world are trading at negative yields. Austria earlier this summer issued a 100-year ultra-low-yield bond. Germany this week sold 30-year bonds that pay no interest; investors lent the country money for three decades for nothing. Maybe it’s time the U.S. Treasury capitalized on the unusual monetary times to lower its financing costs.

Treasury posted a note on its website last Friday saying that it will conduct “broad outreach to refresh its understanding of market appetite” for 50- or 100-year bonds. The Obama Administration noodled over the idea but worried about the reputational risk for U.S. credit if longer-dated securities met weak demand. That wasn’t long after the debt-limit fight caused a downgrade in the U.S. credit rating, but now investors are piling into Treasurys in a flight to quality.

The Obama Treasury Department also feared that a 50- or 100-year bond would compete with and drive down prices (and raise yields) for 10- and 30-year Treasurys, causing U.S. government borrowing costs to rise and the yield curve to steepen. At the time the Federal Reserve was trying to flatten the yield curve to push investors into riskier assets and stimulate consumption via a “wealth effect.”

Secretary Steve Mnuchin floated the idea again two years ago. But the Treasury’s Borrowing Advisory Committee, which is comprised of large financial institutions and broker dealers, said it “does not see evidence of strong or sustainable demand for maturities beyond 30 years.” Note the word sustainable.

Over the years many countries and even some companies have launched small batches of long-dated securities. In 2010 Mexico raised $1 billion in what at the time was the world’s largest 100-year bond offering. Belgium and Ireland in 2016 raised €100 million with 100-year bonds. Canada floated a 50-year bond in 2014.

Countries have discontinued long-term bonds when market conditions turn less favorable, and the U.S. could test demand with an issue or two. In 2017 Austria floated a €3.5 billion 100-year bond at a yield of 2.1%. Demand was so hot that Austria offered another 100-year issue this summer to raise €1.25 billion at a 1.17% interest rate—a mere 50 basis points above the yield on its 30-year bond. Germany’s 30-year bond sale wasn’t fully subscribed but still raised more than $900 million with an effectively negative interest rate.

Investors, especially insurers in Europe and Japan, are ravenous for high-quality government securities with positive yields as negative interest rates spread around the world. The worry that a 50- or 100-year Treasury bond might crowd out the 30-year is less salient now than it was a couple of years ago.

The term premium that investors demand for holding longer-dated securities has been shrinking since 2014, and the yield on the 30-year Treasury last week dipped below 2% for the first time. Even if Treasury issued a 50- or 100-year bond with a 3% coupon, the yield would only be 50 basis points above the average interest rate on U.S. public debt last year.

In the 2000s before the recession, the average interest rate on federal debt hovered between 5% and 6.5%. Monetary policy has significantly eased since then around the world, but interest rates won’t stay low forever.

The U.S. has debt of $15.7 trillion held by the public—the kind it has to repay on pain of default—and won’t be able to continue ringing up trillion-dollar deficits without investors demanding a heftier premium for the risk. The Congressional Budget Office forecasts that federal government debt as a share of GDP will grow to 144% by 2049 from 78% today and interest costs will go to 5.7% of GDP from 1.8%.

Budget prognosticators aren’t clairvoyant, but 50- or 100-year bonds would almost certainly reduce the government’s financing costs over the long term. The Trump Treasury can do taxpayers a favor by gradually stretching out the average duration of federal debt and reducing the chances of steep future tax increases."
"Former VA doctor, who reportedly was impaired on duty charged with involuntary manslaughter, prosecutors say",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Paulina Dedaj', 'Paulina Dedaj Is A Writer', 'Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/former-va-doctor-who-was-impaired-while-on-duty-charged-with-involuntary-manslaughter-prosecuters-say,"A former Veteran’s Affairs doctor in Arkansas, who was reportedly caught under the influence of an intoxicating substance, was charged Tuesday with three counts of involuntary manslaughter after prosecutors say he misdiagnosed three patients -- eventually leading to their deaths.

Robert Morris Levy was charged in the deaths of three patients after a year-long investigation found he played a pivotal role in the deaths by “entering incorrect and misleading diagnoses” and, in two of the deaths, faking medical records to cover his tracks, the Western District Attorney’s Office of Arkansas said in a press release.

VETERANS ADVOCATE SPEAKS OUT AFTER SOLDIERS WERE DENIED MORE THAN $50 MILLION IN MEDICAL CLAIMS

In one case, a patient died of prostate cancer after Levy determined his biopsy showed he didn't have cancer, prosecutors say.

Levy first received his medical license in 1997 and several years later, in 2005, he began work as the Chief of Pathology and Laboratory Medical Services at the Veterans Health Care System of the Ozarks.

In 2015 he was placed under review after several reports surfaced he was “under the influence of alcohol while on duty,” prosecutors said. A year later, Levy was found “intoxicated” while working and a drug and alcohol test revealed a blood alcohol content of .396.

His privileges were revoked and he was voluntarily admitted to a three-month in-patient treatment program.

Levy was allowed to return to the VA after signing an agreement in which he vowed to “maintain sobriety to ensure his ability to practice medicine with reasonable skill and safety to patients.” He was subject to 12 random tests during the period from November 2016 to June 2018, which he passed.

It was only later discovered that Levy was actually taking a substance, 2-methyl-2-butanol, which officials said “enables a person to achieve a state of intoxication but is not detectable in routine drug and alcohol testing methodology.”

He was fired that same year.

VA officials said in January that outside pathologists reviewed nearly 34,000 cases handled by Levy and found more than 3,000 errors or missed diagnoses dating back to 2005. Levy has acknowledged that he once showed up to work at the VA drunk in 2016, but he denied that he had worked while impaired

In addition to the involuntary manslaughter charges, Levy also faces 12 counts of wire fraud, 12 counts of mail fraud and four counts of making false statements.

“These charges send a clear signal that anyone entrusted with the care of veterans will be held accountable for placing them at risk by working while impaired or through other misconduct,” Michael Missal, Inspector General of the Department of Veterans Affairs, said.

“Our thoughts are with the veterans and their families affected by Dr. Levy’s actions.”

If convicted of all counts, Levy faces a sentence of up to 524 years in prison and $7.75 million in fines.

He then met with a conservative group, the Committee to Unleash Prosperity, which routinely hosts events with prospective candidates. That meeting included Steve Forbes, the chairman of Forbes Media; the economist Arthur B. Laffer; and John A. Catsimatidis, a former New York City mayoral candidate.

Mr. Pompeo’s itinerary gave only more credence to the regular talk in Washington that Mr. Pompeo was seriously weighing a run for Senate from Kansas, a step favored by Republicans worried about holding the seat next year but one that would leave a hole in the top ranks of President Trump’s national security team.

Justice Dept. again sides with Trump over House in personal financial records fight,https://www.cnn.com,['Katelyn Polantz'],08-19-2019,2019,8,https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/19/politics/justice-trump-financial-records/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Trump administration's Justice Department has again taken President Donald Trump's side in a fight between him -- as a private citizen -- and the US House of Representatives over subpoenas for his personal financial records.

The Justice Department argues the two banks shouldn't have to hand over the subpoenaed information and accuses lawmakers of not taking the correct steps to seek the documents.

This is the first time the Justice Department has spoken up in this subpoena fight. Its foray into the case comes as House Democrats' attempts heat up to get Trump's financial records and to consider formal impeachment proceedings of the President.

On Friday, the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals is scheduled to consider whether two banks, Deutsche Bank and Capital One, will have to turn over Trump's information to House committees. Judge Jon Newman, a Jimmy Carter appointee, and Judges Debra Ann Livingston and Peter Hall, both appointed by President George W. Bush, will hear the arguments.

In its legal brief Monday, the Justice Department broadly criticizes how the House authorized the subpoenas before taking a full House vote. They also allege that House Democrats are unfairly targeting the President.

"DHS cyber agency to prioritize election security, Chinese threats",https://thehill.com,[],08-22-2019,2019,8,https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/458487-dhs-cyber-agency-to-prioritize-election-security-chinese-threats,"The Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) plans to prioritize election security, cybersecurity at federal agencies, and the “persistent threat” posed by China, among its many goals.

The agency laid out its key priorities in a new “strategic intent” document released on Thursday, which CISA Director Christopher Krebs described in the introduction as the “keystone” for the agency.

Among Krebs’s operational priorities is addressing Chinese threats to U.S. supply chains and to the rollout of 5G networks, bolstering election security efforts at the state and local level, and protecting the cybersecurity of industrial control systems.

Other priorities are protecting federal networks against cyber attacks, such as ransomware incidents that have increasingly spread across the country, and defending “soft targets” and crowded venues from physical threats.

CISA is the primary agency responsible for assisting state and local governments with securing elections, replacing the former National Protection and Programs Directorate in a law that took effect last year.

“We know that our Nation’s banks, hospitals, power plants, election systems, and state and local governments are under constant attack, and CISA must stand ready to help these owners and operators shore up their defenses,” Thompson said. “This Strategic Intent document sets forth an ambitious agenda, and I hope to hear more from Director Krebs about how he plans to execute the priorities outlined today, and what resources CISA will need in order to do so.”

Krebs, who is the agency’s first director, laid out the strategic plan during a speech on Thursday at Auburn University’s Center for Cyber and Homeland Security in Auburn, Ala. He emphasized CISA’s core mission of “defend today, secure tomorrow.”

Krebs noted that he spends “probably 40 to 50 percent” on election security issues, adding that the 2018 midterm elections were secure in large part due to strides forward in securing elections against outside interference in the wake of the 2016 elections.

“I know what the Russians did in 2016, I know what they tried to do in 2018, I need to know what they’re going to try to do in 2020,” Krebs said.

Mueller testified last month on Capitol Hill that he expects the Russians to return and try to interfere during the 2020 elections.

Another key issue touched on in the strategy is addressing threats from China. Krebs said he has “significant concerns” in regards to Chinese tech companies being involved in the 5G rollout in the U.S., pointing to the Chinese intelligence law that requires companies to assist in the national intelligence work of the Chinese government.

“Why on earth would we put them in a position to control whether our communications systems are up or down?” Krebs said. “That is the threshold issue here.”"
"Facing farmer anger, Trump scrambles Cabinet to brainstorm on biofuel policy: sources",https://www.reuters.com,"['Humeyra Pamuk', 'Min Read']",08-22-2019,2019,8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biofuels-trump/trump-set-to-discuss-biofuels-thursday-with-usda-epa-sources-idUSKCN1VC1RN,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, faced with mounting anger in the farm belt over policies that allow oil refineries to use less corn-based ethanol, summoned Cabinet members on Thursday to discuss ways to boost biofuel demand, four sources familiar with the matter said.

Throughout his 2016 campaign that brought him to power, Trump championed ethanol but also courted the oil industry. However, his latest decision to grant dozens of waivers to oil refineries infuriated farmers, a key constituency he is counting on for re-election in 2020.

Trump met with Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Andrew Wheeler at the White House, the sources said. They presented options to boost ethanol demand, which farmers say has slumped since the EPA exempted dozens of refineries from ethanol requirements.

The White House declined to comment on the meeting.

One proposal that was discussed and was advocated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture was rescinding seven or eight of the 31 waivers the administration has granted to refineries, according to a memo of five proposals obtained by Reuters. Sources said government agencies have agreed on four of the proposals, but Trump was yet to make a final decision.

The sticking point is a technical proposal to redistribute projected volumes that could be exempted in the future through the annual biofuel mandate from 2020 onwards. The USDA and EPA remain divided on the issue.

David Fialkov, a lobbyist for NATSO, the national association representing the travel plaza and truckstop industry, said an agreement on that proposal was key for biofuels.

“As long as EPA continues issuing small refinery exemptions without accounting for waived volumes in establishing the underlying renewable fuel mandate every year, fuel marketers won’t be motivated to buy biofuels. End of story,” Fialkov said.

The remaining proposals agreed upon are for the EPA taking steps to make infrastructure for E15, a higher ethanol blend of gasoline, more accessible; and the USDA and EPA working together to amend the Reset rule, which will be dictating new blending mandates for a slew of biofuels for the next several years and beyond. The final one is for the EPA to take action to encourage flex-fuel vehicles that can use E85, a higher ethanol blend.

U.S. regulations require refiners to blend biofuels into their gasoline or buy credits to fund those refiners who can. Small refiners can seek exemptions, but Trump’s EPA has granted waivers to refineries owned by the likes of Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and billionaire Carl Icahn.

U.S. farmers have already been suffering due to a slump in crop prices and exports shrinking following Trump’s trade war with China. On Wednesday, biofuel industry groups and farm-state lawmakers complained to the White House about the refinery waivers.

‘ENOUGH IS ENOUGH’

The backlash from agricultural and biofuel trade groups has been particularly strong in Iowa, the largest producer of corn and ethanol, and a swing state won twice by former Democrat President Barack Obama but which voted for Trump in 2016.

Democratic presidential hopefuls have spent a lot of time in Iowa because it holds an early nominating contest, and they have used the refinery issue as a cudgel. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said that if elected, she would block pending refinery waiver applications and look to reverse any approved. She said, at a maximum, only a few should be approved.

Farmers and biofuel producers have complained that Trump is favoring the oil industry at their expense. Over the past month, several biofuel plants announced shutdowns or production cutbacks, including the largest U.S. ethanol producer POET.

On Thursday, American GreenFuels, owned by Kolmar Americas, said it was slashing output by 50% in the fourth quarter, citing pain from waivers and a biodiesel tax credit that expired and has not been renewed.

“Enough is enough,” Raf Aviner, president of Kolmar Americas said in a statement. “We cannot justify buying more feedstock under these market conditions.”

Refiners and some academics dispute the contention that waivers have decimated ethanol demand, and the industry and its allies have fought to keep the waivers intact.

On Thursday, North America’s Building Trades Unions (NABTU) sent a letter to Trump supporting waivers, saying they significantly reduced costs for refineries and alleviated a threat to thousands of jobs.

Renewable fuel credits for 2019 traded at 16.5 cents apiece throughout the session on Thursday, up from 14.75 cents each on Wednesday, traders said. The credits have steadily climbed from trading at 11 cents apiece two weeks ago as refiners sought to actively buy in the market."

U.S. Park Police Chief Robert D. MacLean, who has led the uniformed force since 2013, is being promoted to head the Interior Department’s Office of Law Enforcement and Security, overseeing law enforcement programs including the Park Police and officers in the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Interior Department said Thursday.

MacLean, 53, has been a Park Police officer for 28 years. He did not return a request for comment. The move was first reported by Paul Wagner of Fox 5 News.

During MacLean’s tenure, unarmed motorist Bijan Ghaisar was fatally shot by two Park Police officers on Nov. 17, 2017. After Ghaisar was shot in a residential neighborhood of Fairfax County, Va., MacLean had his detectives begin a homicide investigation and told Fairfax police they were not needed, exercising the federal jurisdiction of the Park Police. Three days later, MacLean handed the case over to the FBI, though the bureau had not responded to the scene the night of the slaying. Ghaisar’s parents said Park Police officers treated them insensitively while Ghaisar, 25, lay in a coma, refusing to allow them to see their son for more than 10 minutes each hour or to touch him.

No decision has been made about whether to charge the officers involved in the shooting, Lucas Vinyard and Alejandro Amaya. U.S. Attorney Jessie K. Liu and a spokeswoman for the Justice Department’s civil rights division declined to comment earlier this week on when a charging decision might be made. Twenty-two months have passed since Ghaisar was killed.

Ghaisar’s mother, Kelly Ghaisar, was outraged by MacLean’s promotion. “Every time I even start to allow myself to think there might be some hope for justice, I get hit with news like this,” she said Thursday. “Chief MacLean allowed, and possibly ordered, his officers to guard my son’s body and treat my family in the most racist way possible. The U.S. Park Police have sat on this case after killing our son. It is a disgrace that it has taken this long to investigate this murder. This is another example of a law enforcement supervisor getting promoted despite obvious evidence of conduct that would likely end any other career.”

MacLean has remained silent about the shooting, refusing to disclose the names of the officers involved or details about why they shot. After MacLean refused to release videos of the shooting recorded by two Fairfax County police officers, Fairfax Police Chief Edwin C. Roessler Jr. in January 2018 released one of the videos that appeared to document the entire episode. MacLean declined to comment on the video.

When The Washington Post obtained the names of Vinyard and Amaya in the summer of 2018, MacLean refused a Freedom of Information Act request seeking to confirm the two men were Park Police officers, saying it was “personal information” and “would not shed light on an agency’s performance of its statutory duties.”

Vinyard and Amaya’s names were released to the Ghaisar family by Fairfax County police, who publicly disclosed them in a lawsuit against the officers and the Park Police in March. They remain on paid administrative duty. The lawsuit is pending.

The Park Police are not equipped with body cameras or in-car cameras. No federal agents wear cameras. In response to the Ghaisar shooting, Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D. C.) and Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) introduced legislation requiring federal uniformed officers to use such cameras, and they said MacLean told them he supported the legislation. MacLean has not publicly commented on the idea, which has not had a hearing in Congress.

The Park Police have about 700 officers in Washington, New York and San Francisco. MacLean previously worked on the department’s SWAT team and in internal affairs, headed its homeland security division, was the department spokesman, and served on a crime and violence task force with D.C. police and other agencies. MacLean helped oversee security and planning for major events on the Mall such as inaugurations and Independence Day festivities.

His department was criticized in 2017 when Park Police officers twice handcuffed youths selling water on the Mall. “We have to come up with better alternatives to handcuffing or having juveniles handcuffed and exposed out in the public for that long,” MacLean said.

The Park Police were also criticized by an inspector general’s audit in 2014 for “dysfunction” in communication after not finding a traveler who wandered from Reagan National Airport and died.

MacLean’s new job with the Interior Department involves overseeing law enforcement, security and intelligence activities for seven agencies: the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the National Park Service rangers, the Park Police, the Fish and Wildlife Service Office of Law Enforcement, Fish and Wildlife refuge law enforcement officers, the Bureau of Land Management and the Bureau of Reclamation. The law enforcement office is described as the Interior Department’s “focal point to provide program guidance and oversight of the Department’s law enforcement, security, intelligence, counterintelligence/insider threat, and information sharing programs,” according to the office website.

In announcing the job, Susan Combs, the assistant interior secretary for policy, management and budget, said, “Chief MacLean has a stellar record protecting visitors and resources and is proud of the partnerships he has forged that have focused on the mutual law enforcement mission that transcends organizational jurisdiction and structure.” He is expected to begin in his new post on Sept. 16, Combs said in an email to Interior Department employees.

Chicago Housing Authority’s CEO Eugene Jones abruptly resigns,https://chicago.curbed.com,['Aug'],08-21-2019,2019,8,https://chicago.curbed.com/2019/8/21/20827053/chicago-housing-authority-resign-ceo-eugene-jones,"On Tuesday, the Chicago Housing Authority’s CEO Eugene Jones announced his resignation. Jones was the longest-serving boss in more than a decade of the second largest public housing agency in the country. Many people view his departure as a surprise and the city will face a challenge in searching for replacement.

Jones joined CHA in 2015 as Chief Property Officer and two months later was named acting CEO. In January 2016 then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel made him the permanent CEO. Lightfoot had full confidence in Jones too. Before Chicago, he had 35 years in housing operations and a reputation for bringing mediocre programs in Toronto, Detroit, Indianapolis, and Kansas City up to high standards.

In a WBEZ interview Wednesday morning about the news, an activist and former Cabrini-Green resident said: “We just lost the Michael Jordan of housing.”

Jones put out a statement about his resignation which goes into effect September 27 and thanks the public and his supporters. It reads:

“Since my arrival at CHA four and a half years ago, I have been committed to meeting CHA’s goals of producing more housing and to supporting the city in its efforts to expand housing opportunities in every Chicago community.”

Highlights from Jones career include the development of three co-located housing and libraries, the establishment of a field office that connected with residents, millions set aside for Section 3 (a federal program that supplies jobs and contracts to public housing residents), and a landmark settlement this year in the Gautreaux case.

It’s unclear where Jones will go next, and he doesn’t explain his departure in the annoucement, but the housing expert was shortlisted for a top position in New York City’s Housing Authority back in March. That position has since been filled, but its clear that Jones is in high demand."
