He continued: ""We will not allow the President to block congressional subpoenas, putting himself and his allies above the law.

Ocasio-Cortez says it's time to 'move forward' with Trump impeachment,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Liam Quinn', 'Liam Quinn Is A Senior Editor At Fox News. He Can Be Found On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ocasio-cortez-says-its-time-trump-impeachment,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., has called on House Democrats to “move forward” with impeaching President Trump, adding that if they fail to do so it could be viewed as a “politically motivated” decision.

The freshman New Yorker issued the call to arms to members of her party shortly after White House Counsel Don McGahn defied a subpoena and skipped a committee hearing at Trump's direction.

The move infuriated Democrats and touched off what could be another high-profile battle over holding a Trump official in contempt of Congress.

“Let me be clear, this committee will hear Mr. McGahn's testimony, even if we have to go to court to secure it,” House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y, said at the beginning of the hearing which McGahn did not attend.

DEMOCRATS FUME AS McGAHN SKIPS HOUSE HEARING: 'OUR SUBPOENAS ARE NOT OPTIONAL'

Speaking to reporters from a hallway inside the Capitol, Ocasio-Cortez said members of her party must understand how the decision whether or not to impeach the president will be viewed.

“Just as impeaching without cause could be construed, and is, politically motivated choosing to not impeach when there is an abundance of cause could also be construed similarly,” she said.

Ocasio-Cortez was also asked by CNN’s Manu Raju if Democrats should impeach Trump in the wake of McGahn’s no-show.

“You know, I trust the speaker is taking a measured approach to ensure that we’re moving everyone forward and, you know, being a speaker is hard, holding this party together is a difficult task,” the freshman congresswoman said.

“But I personally think so. I think we have to move forward.”

The development comes one day after a senior House Democrat -- speaking on the condition of anonymity -- told Fox News that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi could soon be left with no choice but to embrace calls from some within her party to impeach Trump.

The official said, despite Pelosi’s repeated attempt to quell talk of impeaching the president, she “isn’t going to be able to hold off on impeachment much longer.”

“It is coming to a head,” the Democrat told Fox News, before predicting the mounting pressure from inside her own ranks could force Pelosi to change her position “within the next two weeks.”

Trump Expected to Pick Ken Cuccinelli for Immigration Policy Role,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Maggie Haberman', 'Zolan Kanno-Youngs']",05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/us/politics/trump-ken-cuccinelli-immigration.html,"President Trump is expected to name Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, a former attorney general of Virginia and an immigration hard-liner, as his choice to coordinate the administration’s immigration policies, a White House official confirmed on Tuesday.

The specifics of the role — including the title and the scope of duties — are still being hashed out, according to the official. But Mr. Cuccinelli is expected to be based in the Department of Homeland Security, not in the White House.

Mr. Cuccinelli met with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office on Monday, along with nearly a dozen other administration officials, including Kevin K. McAleenan, the acting secretary of homeland security. By Monday evening, Mr. Cuccinelli had begun placing calls to people to alert them that he was expected to get the job, according to people familiar with the discussions.

The formal appointment could come as soon as this week, officials said.

Mr. Cuccinelli served as attorney general from 2010 to 2014, running unsuccessfully for governor of Virginia in 2013. He is a frequent presence on cable news, which Mr. Trump consumes with gusto. He is aligned with Mr. Trump on issues related to border security, though he caught the president’s attention during the 2016 presidential primaries, when he led the effort to strip Mr. Trump of delegates on behalf of an opponent, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a person close to the president said."
Trump’s troubling response to “lock them up!” chants during his Pennsylvania rally,https://www.vox.com,['May'],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.vox.com/2019/5/21/18633879/trump-montoursville-pennsylvania-rally-lock-them-up-bill-barr,"President Donald Trump’s reelection rallies might have found version 2.0 of their familiar “lock her up!” chants: “Lock them up!”

With special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation mostly in the rearview mirror and William Barr installed as the protective attorney general Trump hoped Jeff Sessions would be, the president went on the attack during his speech Monday evening in Montoursville, Pennsylvania, reviving his baseless treason accusations against the FBI and Democrats.

“We caught ’em — they were spying,” Trump said, referring to the counterintelligence investigation of his campaign that began in 2016 and followed normal procedures. “They were spying on our campaign. I’ll tell you what — if that ever happened to the other side, this thing would’ve been over two years ago, and you know, it would have been treason. They would’ve called it treason. And that’s what it is — it was treason. And it should never be allowed to happen to another president again. Ever, ever, ever.”

Trump’s accusation is transparently meritless, but that’s beside the point. Heading into his 2020 reelection campaign, Trump — with help from Barr — is trying to establish a narrative that the entire investigation into his campaign’s contacts with Russia stemmed from anti-Trump bias in the law enforcement and intelligence communities, not his campaign’s secretive contacts with people in the Kremlin’s orbit. Trump wants to portray himself as a victim and Obama-era officials as bad actors who had it out for him from the beginning.

Trump’s audience seemed ready to get on board, cheering his accusations of treason and then breaking out in “lock them up!” chants. Trump basked in the chants for a moment before threatening to sic Barr on law enforcement officials who investigated him.

“Well, we have a great new attorney general who is going to give it a very fair look,” Trump said.

Barr, for his part, doesn’t seem troubled by Trump’s threat to use trumped-up charges against his perceived political enemies. During an interview on Fox News last week, Barr hit back at Democratic leaders who accused him of lying under oath during his congressional testimony and seemed to threaten to investigate them, saying, “they may be concerned about the outcome of a review of what happened during the election.”

During an interview with the Wall Street Journal that was published on Monday, Barr insisted he’s protecting the presidency, not just Trump. Barr has already announced he’s launched an investigation into the origins of the FBI’s counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign.

The “lock them up!” chants weren’t the only time Trump’s fans called for summary imprisonment of his enemies on Monday night. When Trump brought up Hillary Clinton earlier during the rally, his audience responded with resounding boos and the classic “lock her up!” chants.

Trump’s latest rally came hours after he suffered a defeat in federal court

Trump’s rally came hours after Judge Amit Mehta of the DC District Court decisively ruled against Trump in his effort to prevent House Democrats from subpoenaing 10 years of his financial records from the accounting firm Mazars USA. While the White House is sure to appeal Mehta’s ruling, it indicates that Trump’s strategy of stonewalling all congressional subpoenas may be a losing one.

Asked about the ruling just before taking off to Pennsylvania for his rally, Trump suggested he doesn’t think he needs to listen to judges who were appointed by Democratic presidents.

“Well, we disagree with that ruling — it’s crazy,” Trump said. “This never happened to any other president ... it’s totally the wrong decision by obviously an Obama-appointed judge. He was a recent Obama-appointed judge.”

Trump 100 percent thinks he can just choose to ignore rulings from ""Obama-appointed"" judges.



""We disagree with that ruling ... it's totally the wrong decision by obviously an Obama-appointed judge. He was a recent Obama-appointed judge."" pic.twitter.com/ksyJcWWe1h — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) May 20, 2019

But Mehta’s ruling opens by discussing how another president, James Buchanan, raised similar concerns about congressional oversight but ended up having to submit to it anyway — a history that contradicts Trump’s claim he’s being treated unfairly.

“Courts have grappled for more than a century with the question of the scope of Congress’s investigative power,” Mehta wrote. “The binding principle that emerges from these judicial decisions is that courts must presume Congress is acting in furtherance of its constitutional responsibility to legislate and must defer to congressional judgments about what Congress needs to carry out that purpose.”

Attorney General Barr is powerless to stop the DC District Court from ruling against Trump. But if the fight over subpoenas makes its way to the US Supreme Court — whose balance has shifted to the right due to Trump’s nominations of Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh — the extent to which Congress will be empowered to conduct oversight on a president who is clearly interested in using the powers of the state against his enemies is unclear.

But the headwinds for Trump are severe.

One of the largest: His polarizing approach looks to be more hindrance than help.

In four separate polls over the past month, more than 50 percent of respondents said they would not vote for him again or were unlikely to do so. The percentage who said they would vote for him never rose higher than 38.

The most recent of those polls, from Fox News, found 54 percent of respondents saying they would probably not or definitely not vote for Trump.

In a Quinnipiac University Poll, 52 percent of respondents said they would definitely not vote for the president, while 33 percent said they definitely would. Only 13 percent were in the middle ground, saying they would “consider” backing Trump.

It will be hard to overcome negative perceptions of the president that look to have become fixed. Some of the voters who backed Trump as an anti-establishment disruptor in 2016 appear to have peeled away.

Trump’s overall approval ratings remain mediocre at best. In the RealClearPolitics polling average Monday afternoon, Trump’s job performance gained the approval of 43 percent of voters and the disapproval of 53.6 percent.

But Trump’s salvation could lie in the idiosyncrasies of the Electoral College.

Trump’s 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale Bradley (Brad) James ParscaleMORE, has insisted that the president could win states that eluded him last time around.

During an appearance on CBS News’s “Face the Nation” last month, Parscale asserted that Colorado, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Mexico and Nevada — all of which backed Clinton — could go for Trump in 2020.

“In every single metric, we’re looking at being bigger, better and badder than we were in 2016,” Parscale insisted.

Even if that turns out to be the case, the most likely pathway to victory for Trump has familiar contours.

He emerged victorious in 2016 largely because he won Florida — the biggest of the traditional swing states — and demolished the so-called blue wall.

The term refers to three large states — Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin — that had not backed a Republican for president since the 1980s.

Pennsylvania is the largest of the three, bestowing 20 electoral votes on the victor.

Trump was in Montoursville, Pa., for a campaign-style rally on Monday evening.

Terry Madonna, a professor of public affairs at Pennsylvania’s Franklin & Marshall College, said he would not rule out Trump winning the state again — but there were significant barriers.

“Trump’s job performance [rating] here is lower than in the national polls. But he also has a constituency that remains firm — the working-class voters in the northeast and southwest parts of my state, in the old mining and mill towns,” Madonna said.

“The real problem Republicans have is that the suburbs outside Philadelphia have gone from solidly Republican 30 years ago to trending Democratic,” Madonna added.

There is plenty of evidence of trouble for Trump.

A Quinnipiac University Poll released last week indicated Biden would beat Trump by 11 points in Pennsylvania.

The same poll also showed other Democratic candidates vanquishing the president, though by smaller margins: Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersThe Memo: Trump faces steep climb to reelection California Democrats face crisis of credibility after lawsuits Fox's Brit Hume fires back at Trump's criticism of the channel MORE (I-Vt.) ran ahead of Trump by 7 points, and Sen.

MORE (D) held a statistically insignificant 1-point advantage.

Those kinds of findings add to Biden’s appeal as the candidate purportedly best able to rebuild the blue wall.

Some argue his appeal could be broader.

Steve Schale, a Democratic strategist in Florida who was the 2008 state director for former President Obama’s campaign, is backing Biden in the primary but has no formal role with his campaign.

Schale said that Florida was always going to be a “jump ball” given the state’s competitive makeup.

But he added that the swing voters in the Sunshine State “tend to look like the swing voters in the Upper Midwest and Pennsylvania. Maybe they have moved here from that part of the country. So generally, the same types of candidates are going to do well in Florida.”

Trump and his campaign pretty clearly see Biden as the biggest threat. The president took another swipe at Biden on Twitter on Monday.

Trump called Biden “Sleepy Joe” three times in one tweet.

But it’s Trump himself who needs to be fully awake to the difficulties he faces in 2020.

E.P.A. Plans to Get Thousands of Pollution Deaths Off the Books by Changing Its Math,https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/20/climate/epa-air-pollution-deaths.html,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.

WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency plans to change the way it calculates the health risks of air pollution, a shift that would make it easier to roll back a key climate change rule because it would result in far fewer predicted deaths from pollution, according to five people with knowledge of the agency’s plans.

The E.P.A. had originally forecast that eliminating the Obama-era rule, the Clean Power Plan, and replacing it with a new measure would have resulted in an additional 1,400 premature deaths per year. The new analytical model would significantly reduce that number and would most likely be used by the Trump administration to defend further rollbacks of air pollution rules if it is formally adopted.

The proposed shift is the latest example of the Trump administration downgrading the estimates of environmental harm from pollution in regulations. In this case, the proposed methodology would assume there is little or no health benefit to making the air any cleaner than what the law requires. Many experts said that approach was not scientifically sound and that, in the real world, there are no safe levels of the fine particulate pollution associated with the burning of fossil fuels.

Fine particulate matter — the tiny, deadly particles that can penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream — is linked to heart attacks, strokes and respiratory disease."
"McGahn confirms he will skip House hearing, as DOJ asserts 'immunity' and Nadler fumes",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-mcgahn-house-hearing,"President Trump has directed former White House Counsel Don McGahn to skip a House Judiciary Committee hearing scheduled for Tuesday, citing a Justice Department opinion that he cannot be compelled to testify about his official duties -- and, through his legal team, McGahn confirmed Monday evening that he won't appear.

The development prompted an obstinate response late Monday from House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y.: “We are having the hearing tomorrow and we’re expecting Mr. McGahn to show pursuant to the subpoena.""

Earlier this month, House Democrats opted to question an empty chair -- and a bucket of fried chicken -- when Attorney General Bill Barr failed to appear, citing Democrats' unusual demands.

In a letter to Nadler, McGahn attorney William Burck said his client won't show up. Burck said current White House Counsel Pat Cipollone had communicated that Trump had instructed McGahn not to testify, and that Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel Steven Engel had said McGahn was immune from testifying.

""Mr. McGahn understands from your prior correspondence that the Committee would vote to hold him in contempt should he not appear tomorrow and the House of Representatives may follow suit,"" Burck wrote to Nadler. ""While we disagree with the Committee’s position and hope it will instead seek an accommodation with the White House, Mr. McGahn also must honor his ethical and legal obligations as a former senior lawyer and senior advisor to the President. In short, it is our view that the Committee’s dispute is not with Mr. McGahn but with the White House.""

Burck added: ""Mr. McGahn remains obligated to maintain the status quo and respect the President’s instruction. In the event an accommodation is agreed between the Committee and the White House, Mr. McGahn will of course comply with that accommodation.""

In a statement released Monday afternoon, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders blasted Democrats for continuing to pursue Trump investigations, saying they want a ""wasteful and unnecessary do-over"" in the wake of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe -- and describing the subpoena for McGahn as part of that.

""The House Judiciary Committee has issued a subpoena to try and force Mr. McGahn to testify again. The Department of Justice has provided a legal opinion stating that, based on long-standing, bipartisan, and Constitutional precedent, the former Counsel to the President cannot be forced to give such testimony, and Mr. McGahn has been directed to act accordingly,"" Sanders said. ""This action has been taken in order to ensure that future Presidents can effectively execute the responsibilities of the Office of the Presidency.""

The related DOJ memo said McGahn, like other senior advisers to a president, has ""immunity"" from being compelled to testify about his official duties.

""This immunity applies to the former White House Counsel. Accordingly, Mr. McGahn is not legally required to appear and testify about matters related to his official duties as Counsel to the President,"" the memo said.

The New York Times first reported that the president would likely direct McGahn to skip the hearing.

HOUSE JUDICIARY CHAIRMAN SUBPOENAS EX-WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL DON MCGAHN

The committee announced the hearing last week, but it was unclear whether McGahn would appear due to the ongoing battle between congressional Democrats and the White House over his testimony.

Earlier this month, Sanders said she did not “anticipate” that a hearing would take place. “We consider this to be a case closed and we’re moving forward to do the work of the American people,” Sanders said on ABC News’ “The Investigation” podcast.

The committee, led by Nadler, subpoenaed McGahn on April 22, days after the release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report, which featured McGahn prominently in its section related to the obstruction of justice inquiry. This included a claim that McGahn disobeyed Trump’s call to have him seek Mueller’s removal.

“On June 17, 2017, the president called [White House Counsel Don] McGahn at home and directed him to call the Acting Attorney General and say that the Special Counsel had conflicts of interest and must be removed. McGahn did not carry out the direction, however, deciding that he would resign rather than trigger what he regarded as a potential Saturday Night Massacre,” the report stated, referencing the Watergate scandal.

The report also revealed that when the media reported on the president’s request, the president directed White House officials “to tell McGahn to dispute the story and create a record stating he had not been ordered to have the special counsel removed.” He did not.

The House committee's subpoena, coming amid a fight over access to the unredacted Mueller report, called for McGahn to appear before the panel to testify and provide documents related to the Mueller investigation.

But earlier this month, Cipollone first notified the committee that McGahn would not be allowed to comply with the subpoena, saying requests for documents and materials must go to the White House.

“The White House provided these records to Mr. McGahn in connection with its cooperation with the Special Counsel’s investigation and with the clear understanding that the records remain subject to the control of the White House for all purposes,” Cipollone wrote. “The White House records remain legally protected from disclosure under longstanding constitutional principles, because they implicate significant Executive Branch confidentiality interests and executive privilege.”

HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SCHEDULES HEARING FOR DON MCGAHN, DESPITE WHITE HOUSE MOVE TO BLOCK SUBPOENA

He added: “Because Mr. McGahn does not have the legal right to disclose these documents to third parties, I would ask the Committee to direct any request for such records to the White House, the appropriate legal custodian.”

Cipollone wrote that acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney “has directed Mr. McGahn not to produce these White House records,” adding that the Justice Department concurs with their legal position.

But Nadler has stressed the importance of McGahn’s testimony, saying it would “help shed further light on the president’s attacks on the rule of law, and his attempts to cover up those actions by lying to the American people and requesting others to do the same.”

Trump, though, said he never told McGahn to fire Mueller, and tweeted last month that if he “wanted to fire Mueller, I didn’t need McGahn to do it, I could have done it myself.""

The battle over McGahn's testimony is just one front in the clash between the White House and congressional Democrats.

Earlier this month, the committee voted to hold Barr in contempt for defying a subpoena for Mueller's full and unredacted report, as well as underlying evidence and documents used in the investigation.

Trump, prior to the vote, asserted executive privilege over the materials in a bid to protect them from being turned over to the committee. The full House has yet to take a final vote on whether to hold Barr in contempt of Congress.

I have nothing against old people — I'm one of them. But maybe it's time to add a maximum age limit to our minimum age requirement for our presidents.

Next month, presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren and I will both turn 70. Warren will be the fourth septuagenarian officially in the race, joining Joe Biden (76), Bernie Sanders (77) and Donald Trump, who turns 73 on June 14. Personally, I am amazed to have chronologically made it this far. Those candidates and I were all born during the 1940s, which means we went though the 1980s as young adults.

That fact alone should disqualify all of us from running for president.

The '80s were exhilarating and then exhausting. As my crowd was coming of age and into positions of leadership, we had nearly limitless possibilities to define and achieve success. The war in Vietnam was over. We were allowed to take risks. We were unsupervised and unchecked, our privacy protected by analog obscurity. Boomers and our Warholian older brothers and sisters, were posing, positioning and philandering. We had loads of time to land on our feet and reinvent ourselves. Love was free. Cocaine was ubiquitous. Decadence had no consequences. We had only begun to hear about a blood disease that was affecting gay men.

I cast no aspersions on the emerging elderly for their youthful transgressions. My generation of geezers, through no fault of our own, lived our lives during the great social experiment that was the second half of the 20th century.

Growing up in the analogue era

In my 20s, I made countless poor choices that regularly led to spectacular failures (for example, in 1970, I moved to a beach in Sinaloa, Mexico, instead of going to college). As buffer to my habit of making impulsive decisions, I was absurdly lucky. I survived to my 30s and, by 1978, landed in post-Watergate Washington, D.C., with a grown-up career.

President Richard Nixon had resigned, and both the American government and I were getting a new start.

It turned out the times were an imperfect proving ground for noble intentions. The Reagan years were culturally flat, but politically stable and economically opportune. To quote Tom Petty, for the ambitious and energetic, ""the sky was the limit.""

Fast-forward to 2019. The past didn’t go anywhere. Archival time capsules are everywhere, and they highlight our midcentury midlife decision-making — when we were developing character.

While not everyone’s history is as colorful as these senior citizen contenders for 2020, for today’s spry 70-somethings, it can be terribly uncomfortable that our hard copy records have been transcribed, digitized, cataloged and made keyword-searchable. Seemingly anyone can unearth acts and interpret motivations of our younger selves and upload them to the internet.

Back while I was learning about politics in Washington, D.C., in Burlington, Vermont Sanders was fulfilling his civic duty as mayor. Coincidentally, both of us wrote down our interior thoughts on yellow legal pads. Mine are safely in my office closet stacked in a box full of self-recriminating scolds and personal pep talks in my handwriting about my work (challenging), friendships (mostly transactional) or parenting skills (lacking).

Awkwardly, Mayor Sanders’ similarly toned, excruciatingly personal midlife existential doubts ended up among his official mayoral records sent to storage at the University of Vermont after he left office, along with, Mother Jones reports, “bank statements, an overdue gas bill, and a letter from an acquaintance asking Sanders to pay back $250 he had borrowed seven years earlier.”

This month, more than three decades later, the now three-term senator and eight-term congressman’s humanizing but hardly helpful notes-to-self ended up published. Mother Jones reported that the frustrated municipal chief, approaching middle age, complained to himself that he was losing his radical touch and maintaining a socialist “vision is extremely difficult when one is confronted on every corner with the … suffocating force of the status quo.”

Business values of the 1980s

While Sanders was stewing over the meaning of his life in the mid-1980s, 300 miles south, Trump, a self-styled mogul and beneficiary of the equivalent of $4.5 million a year from his father’s clever generosity, was on a debt-fueled spending spree to build his own real estate and gambling empire in New York and Atlantic City.

Any interior thoughts during the mid-80s that media darling Donald Trump might have had have so far been shielded from snoopy reporters (and congresspersons) by nondisclosure agreements, sealed lawsuits and, perhaps, his early passion for “getting even.”

Some light has recently been shed, however, on his business acumen. The New York Times obtained printouts from his official IRS tax transcripts, from 1985 through 1994. The Times calculated that Trump claimed $1.17 billion in losses for the period. Claiming these losses allowed Trump to avoid paying income tax for eight of the 10 years.

In response to this public peek into his early approach to playing the system, the 72-year-old first-term president said real estate developers were “entitled to massive write-offs,"" and ""you always wanted to show losses for tax purposes."" Apparently, loading up on loopholes was a common “sport” among real estate developers.

Thanks to my generation’s harrowing histories, our compromised conditions and our diminished drive, the field of members competent to sit in the Oval Office has narrowed. That’s as it should be. We are admittedly not as fresh as we once were.

The future might rest on electing a sufficiently “woke” candidate who can connect with a gender-fluid generation, plus set a deadline to save the planet and also develop policies to protect Americans from violence.

Boomers and the truly elderly added much to the culture of our era, but in these troubled times it seems right to me that we elect a candidate who will make appropriate choices for his or her contemporaries, and the ones who will follow. As I blow out my many birthday candles, I’ll wish for an election that features fresh ideas.

For the long term, maybe we should consider an age limit to bookend the constitutional provision making 35 years old the minimum threshold for presidential authority. A reasonable maximum might be 70 (or possibly 75 to accommodate the many geezers who would want to be grandfathered in).

Commerce Dept. grants Huawei a 90-day license to help existing users,https://www.engadget.com,[],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.engadget.com/2019/05/20/huawei-temp-license/,"Last week the US Commerce Department added Huawei and 68 subsidiaries to its ""Entity List"" that bans it from doing business with US companies without a special license. Today, as anticipated, the Commerce Department loosened that restriction a bit with a temporary 90-day license. According to Wilbur Ross, the Secretary of Commerce, it ""will allow operations to continue for existing Huawei mobile phone users and rural broadband networks.""

Because many operators, or owners of various handsets might not have any other way to get software updates or look into backups for necessary equipment, Huawei can continue to service those existing customers -- for now at least. For the long term, however, it's still looking at the loss of access to technology like Google's Android OS, not to mention any business deals in the US.

Update: Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei made a rare public statement, telling media in China that his company had already made preparations for a ban, and said that its 5G would not be affected by the restrictions. He also said the temporary license ""bears little meaning."""

Senate Democrats on Tuesday hammered a top Treasury Department official over a bombshell report that Deutsche Bank resisted reporting suspicious financial activity tied to President Donald Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, whose companies were clients of the German lender.

One after another, Democrats at a Senate Banking Committee hearing that focused on anonymous shell company abuse urged the director of Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, Kenneth Blanco, to take action on the New York Times story.

Story Continued Below

Blanco's agency, known as FinCEN, is responsible for policing illegal money laundering and would have received any so-called suspicious activity reports filed by Deutsche Bank. According to the Times, bank employees prepared the reports but were blocked by executives.

""The alleged facts are in plain sight,"" Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said. ""It's essential it seems to me to the public trust and the integrity of FinCEN that these be actively pursued.""

Despite the pummeling by Democrats — not a single Republican at the hearing brought up Deutsche Bank — Blanco said he was unable to comment on allegations made in the story, which he said he had been briefed on but had not read.

""You're a very smart man,"" Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), responded. ""It wouldn't take very long to read it, but it might be very informative to you.""

""Just because it's in the newspaper doesn't mean it’s true,"" Blanco said. ""I'm not saying it's false, either.""

Blanco suggested that the bank might have been comfortable with the risks it was taking with Trump.

""Everything is fact-specific,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, it could be quite appropriate.""

Before Tuesday's hearing, Van Hollen and Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) wrote to Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing asking him to confirm the accuracy of the Times story and to divulge how many suspicious activity reports were quashed.

Deutsche Bank has said there were ""numerous inaccuracies and misleading statements"" in the Times story but that legal restrictions prevented it from refuting them in detail."
U.S. Justice Department : ex-White House counsel McGahn has 'immunity from testifying',https://www.reuters.com,"['Sarah N.

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department offered President Donald Trump legal cover on Monday to block former White House counsel Don McGahn from testifying before the House Judiciary Committee, saying McGahn has “immunity from testifying” before Congress about matters related to his official duties.

The legal opinion by the Justice Department was released one day before McGahn had been due to appear before the Democratically controlled House panel by order of a subpoena to discuss matters outlined in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigative report.

“Congress may not constitutionally compel the president’s senior advisers to testify about their official duties,” the opinion said, citing the Constitution’s separation of powers provisions."
The Trump Administration Is Burying Evidence Its Coal Plan Will Kill Thousands,https://www.vanityfair.com,"['Bess Levin', 'Vanity Fair']",,,,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/05/trump-epa-coal-plan-deaths,"Last August, the soot fetishists in the Trump administration released a proposal to prop up dying coal plants by giving states free rein to come up with their own rules, or let them petition to opt out of profit-killing regulations altogether. Among the many problems with Donald Trump’s “Affordable Clean Energy rule”? Technical analysis from his own Environmental Protection Agency showed that whereas Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan was expected to prevent between 1,500 and 3,600 premature deaths annually by 2030, Trump’s replacement would cause as many as 1,400 premature deaths (just in America) each year. To many people, that seemed like a lot! So the administration has come up with a new tactic to get the nation on board. No, it’s not to keep Obama’s plan in place or to actually make sources of human-killing dirty energy comply with any sort of legitimate oversight. Instead, it’s to ignore science to get those pesky predicted deaths out of future disclosures.

The New York Times reports that the E.P.A. plans to “get thousands of deaths off the books,” not by doing anything to actually prevent those deaths, but by altering “the way it calculates the health risks of air pollution,” which would “make it easier to roll back a key climate-change rule.” (According to reporter Lisa Friedman, “The E.P.A. . . . is normally expected to demonstrate that society will see more benefits than costs” from a rule change, and apparently some people don’t get that killing off four figures’ worth of Americans per annum is a worthy trade-off for increased corporate profits.) Naturally, experts say the new modeling method is “not scientifically sound,” a situation that obviously poses no concern for this White House:

The proposed shift is the latest example of the Trump administration downgrading the estimates of environmental harm from pollution in regulations. In this case, the proposed methodology would assume there is little or no health benefit to making the air any cleaner than what the law requires. . . . in the real world, there are no safe levels of the fine particulate pollution associated with the burning of fossil fuels.

Fine particulate matter—the tiny, deadly particles that can penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream—is linked to heart attacks, strokes, and respiratory disease.

The five people familiar with the plan, all current or former E.P.A. officials, said the new modeling method would appear in the agency’s analysis of the final version of the replacement regulation . . . which is expected to be made public in June.

Jonathan M. Samet, the dean of the Colorado School of Public Health, said that the most recent studies show negative health effects far below the 12-microgram safety threshold set by the E.P.A. “It’s not a hard stop where we can say ‘below that, air is safe.’ That would not be supported by the scientific evidence,” Samet told the Times. Richard L. Revesz, an expert in environmental law at New York University, added, “Particulate matter is extremely harmful and it leads to a large number of premature deaths,” calling the expected change a “monumental departure” with “significant impact” that would likely lay the groundwork for gutting more environmental regulations in the future. William L. Wehrum—who, it will surely surprise you to hear, worked as a lobbyist and lawyer for chemical manufacturers and fossil-fuel businesses before joining the E.P.A.—would just as soon take his industry cronies’ word for it:

. . . fossil-fuel advocates ask, why should the E.P.A. search for health dangers, and, ultimately, impose costs on industry, in situations where air is officially considered safe? Wehrum, who worked as a lawyer and lobbyist for chemical manufacturers and fossil-fuel businesses before moving to the E.P.A., echoed that position in two interviews. He noted that, in some regulations, the benefits of reduced particulate matter have been estimated to total in the range of $40 billion.

“How in the world can you get $30 or $40 billion of benefit to public health when most of that is attributable to reductions in areas that already meet a health-based standard,” he said. “That doesn’t make any sense.”

Actual scientists say it makes total sense, noting that standards for particulate matter are a lot like speed limits; while 65 miles per hour is typically “considered reasonable” to prevent deaths, it doesn’t mean that an accident couldn’t happen at lower speeds. There are reasons not to force people to drive at 20 or 25 miles per hour on the highway, and most people accept the risk of driving at 65. In this case, however, the administration is in the uncomfortable position of arguing that the risk here—1,400 people dying every year—is worth it, purely to allow the fossil-fuel industry to make some extra cash. Even someone as dumb as Trump knows that’s a hard sell.

Cheating on your taxes?

If you’re among the ultra-rich, you’re probably in the clear!

The Internal Revenue Service audited just 0.59 percent of individual tax returns last year, marking the seventh consecutive annual decline as the tax agency copes with smaller budgets and fewer workers. . . . Audits of the highest-income households dropped sharply, to their lowest levels since the I.R.S. began reporting that data in 2008. In fiscal 2018, the I.R.S. audited 6.66 percent of returns of filers with more than $10 million in adjusted gross income, down from 14.52 percent in 2017. Among households with income between $1 million and $5 million, the audit rate dropped from 3.52 percent to 2.21 percent.

Last year, an investigation by ProPublica revealed that a person making $20,000 a year and claiming the earned-income tax credit was much more likely to be audited than someone making 20 times that amount. So if you’re dodging taxes and are a cartoon villain who hates the poor, this is doubly good news.

How’s Trump’s trade war going?

Well, on Monday, more than 170 retailers, including Adidas and Nike, signed a letter begging him not to impose a threatened 25 percent tariff on footwear that could cost consumers an estimated $7 billion a year. Also on Monday, Morgan Stanley predicted that no trade deal plus further tariffs, which Trump is considering, could cause a global recession. Meanwhile, China has indicated that it has no intention of backing down anytime soon:

China’s government looks to be settling in for a long trade war with the United States, with President Xi Jinping invoking one of the Communist Party’s most epic—and ultimately successful—battles. The Chinese leader, accompanied by his top trade negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He, on Monday placed a floral basket at a monument in Jiangxi province commemorating the start of the Long March in 1934. In the 4,000-mile, year-long trek, the Communists broke through Nationalist lines, eventually ousting them and installing Mao Zedong as leader of China.

Meanwhile, China’s main movie channel, CCTV-6, has scrapped its regular programming in favor of films about the Korean War, which ended in a draw after China intervened to push back the Americans. . . . The planned coverage of the Asian Film Awards was ditched Friday for the classic war movie Heroic Sons and Daughters, the story of Chinese “volunteer troops” who helped North Korea fight the Americans in the 1950s. Then, over the weekend, came three more movies about resisting the United States: Battle on Shangganling Mountain and Surprise Attack. Another classic, the 1960 film Guards on the Railway Line, about Chinese scouts rooting out spies who work for the Americans, was due to screen Monday night.

Oh, and a song about the trade war—an extremely niche genre—has reportedly gone viral and includes the lyrics: “If the perpetrator wants to fight, we will beat him out of his wits.” So you might say Trump’s trade war isn’t going great!

The White House would really prefer that a witness to Trump’s attempts to obstruct justice not speak with House Democrats

It’s almost as though the administration has something to hide:

Trump on Monday directed former White House counsel Donald F. McGahn II to defy a congressional subpoena and skip a hearing scheduled for Tuesday, “denying House Democrats testimony one of the most important eyewitnesses to Trump’s attempts to obstruct the Russia investigation.”

Since last month’s release of the 448-page redacted report by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, Democrats have sought for Mr. McGahn to publicly give his account of Mr. Trump’s attempts to thwart investigators. . . . Democrats hoped that hearing directly from Mr. McGahn in a televised hearing would help galvanize public opposition to Mr. Trump.

Mueller cited McGahn more than any other witness in his report on whether the president obstructed justice. In interviews with the special counsel’s investigators, McGahn detailed several episodes including an effort to oust Mueller—that showed the president intent on using his position atop the executive branch to protect himself from the Russia inquiry.

During his own testimony, Attorney General William Barr claimed it was “not a crime” for the president to instruct McGahn to lie to investigators about Trump’s attempt to fire Mueller, a legal opinion many have taken issue with.

Trump administration will hire Cuccinelli for senior DHS border role,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Josh Dawsey', 'Reporter Covering The White House', 'Nick Miroff', 'Reporter Covering Immigration Enforcement', 'Drug Trafficking', 'National Security', 'May At Pm']",05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-administration-hired-cuccinelli-for-senior-dhs-border-role/2019/05/21/f9272ddc-7be1-11e9-a66c-d36e482aa873_story.html,"The Trump administration will hire conservative firebrand and former Virginia attorney general Ken Cuccinelli II to buttress its immigration efforts, according to three administration officials.

Cuccinelli will work at the Department of Homeland Security in a senior role, a senior White House official said, declining to specify what Cuccinelli’s duties will entail, what his job title will be or if he will report to Acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan.

The hiring appears to come in response to Trump’s desire for an immigration “czar” to help coordinate border policies across agencies, officials said, although the job will be more limited in nature.

Cuccinelli was at the White House on Monday, officials said. He could not be immediately reached for comment. News of Cuccinelli’s expected hiring was first reported by the New York Times.

The former Virginia attorney general is deeply disliked by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has vowed to block Cuccinelli from any Senate-confirmed post after Cuccinelli helped lead efforts in 2014 backing insurgent candidates that hurt the Senate GOP majority, McConnell advisers said.

For months, DHS officials have discussed the need for a border crisis manager who would coordinate among the multiple federal agencies struggling to cope with an unprecedented surge of Central American migrant families.

The job would smooth out communication and planning among the departments of Defense, Justice and Health and Human Services, as well as DHS. But that role was never contemplated as one outranking the DHS Secretary; rather the person would work in a complimentary role.

In April, more than 100,000 migrants were taken into custody for the second consecutive month, and the numbers in May are on pace to go even higher.

But some in the administration fear there will be too many power players fighting to wrest control over an immigration agenda — with White House adviser Stephen Miller already chafing officials at DHS.

One White House adviser said Cuccinelli would probably advocate for the White House’s aggressive position at the agency. Miller has argued to Trump that others within DHS are trying to stall him.

At the Republican Party convention in 2016, Cuccinelli protested the “petty, tyrannical rules” and threw his convention badge on the floor in protest of Trump’s nomination. He was a strong supporter of the presidential bid by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who has since become one of Trump’s most ardent defenders.

Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington think tank whose immigration-reduction agenda has had significant influence in The White House, called Cuccinelli “an unusual choice.”

“He doesn’t have any immigration experience, but he does have law enforcement experience,” said Krikorian, who said he was “cautiously optimistic” that the appointment would make a difference. “If he does not answer directly to the president, he’s not likely to be able to get much done,” he said.

One senior administration official expects Cuccinelli to function more like a crisis manager and policy adviser with a direct line to Trump, who is frustrated with the border surge.

“He won’t be able to order McAleenan to do a thing,” the official said. “The president’s frustration is not directed at DHS alone. It’s DOJ, DOD, State. So this job will ensure closer coordination at a senior level, and it’s an effort to acknowledge you need someone who can have conversations with department heads about policies and drive them to the same place.”

The official said Cuccinelli’s appointment risked undercutting McAleenan at a time when the acting secretary has been making inroads with lawmakers, including Democrats who see him as a neutral law enforcement official, rather than a White House political operative.

“I don’t see how this appointment makes things better on the Hill,” the official said."
U.S. eases curbs on Huawei; founder says clampdown underestimates Chinese firm,https://www.reuters.com,"['Brenda Goh', 'Min Read']",05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-huawei-tech-usa-license/u-s-commerce-department-scales-back-restrictions-on-huawei-idUSKCN1SQ27T,"SHANGHAI/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States has temporarily eased trade restrictions on China’s Huawei to minimize disruption for its customers, a move the founder of the world’s largest telecoms equipment maker said meant little because it was already prepared for U.S. action.

The U.S. Commerce Department blocked Huawei Technologies from buying U.S. goods last week, a major escalation in the trade war between the world’s two top economies, saying the firm was involved in activities contrary to national security.

The two countries increased import tariffs on each other’s goods over the past two weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump said China had reneged on earlier commitments made during months of negotiations.

On Monday, the Commerce Department granted Huawei a license to buy U.S. goods until Aug. 19 to maintain existing telecoms networks and provide software updates to Huawei smartphones, a move intended to give telecom operators that rely on Huawei time to make other arrangements.

Shares of U.S. suppliers to Huawei including Qualcomm, Intel Corp and Lumentum Holdings Inc rose on Tuesday morning, with the Philadelphia Chip Index up more than 1%.

Radio frequency chipmaker Qorvo was the latest U.S. supplier after mobile parts maker Lumentum to halt shipments to Huawei.

It is unclear what the U.S. government extension permits, but if it allows Huawei to keep purchasing components, the company will likely order more to build inventory, said Mark Kelleher, an analyst at D.A. Davidson.

Huawei is still prohibited from buying American-made hardware and software to make new products without further, hard-to-obtain licenses.

Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei on Tuesday told Chinese state media that the reprieve bore little meaning for the company as it had been making preparations for such a scenario.

“The U.S. government’s actions at the moment underestimate our capabilities,” Ren said in an interview with CCTV, according to a transcript published by the Chinese state broadcaster.

The temporary license suggests changes to Huawei’s supply chain may have immediate, far-reaching and unintended consequences for its customers.

The Commerce Department said it will evaluate whether to extend the license period beyond 90 days.

CURRENCY FIRMS

China’s yuan firmed versus the dollar on Tuesday as news of the reprieve eased some worries that trade tensions would be further inflamed and inflict deeper losses on the currency.

Beijing has struck an increasingly defiant tone as the trade war has escalated, saying it will take measures to safeguard the interests of its companies, but has not said whether or how it may retaliate over the U.S. action against Huawei.

President Xi Jinping’s Monday visit to a rare-earth company in southern China sparked speculation that the sector could be the next front in the trade war, driving up shares in Chinese rare-earth related firms on Tuesday.

China produced 80% of rare-earths, a group of 17 chemical elements used in electronics, imported by the United States in 2017.

“Given the Huawei decision, I feel they (China) have no choice but to retaliate, for face sake,” Cliff Tan, head of East Asian research at MUFG Bank in Hong Kong, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum on Tuesday.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang, at a media briefing, rebuffed Trump’s claim that his tariffs were causing companies to move production away from China, saying foreign investors remain enthusiastic about the country.

GOOGLE SUSPENSION

Huawei is currently on the receiving end of a U.S. government accusation that it engaged in bank fraud to obtain embargoed U.S. goods and services in Iran and move money via the international banking system. Huawei has pleaded not guilty.

The trade blacklist has added to its woes, following which Alphabet Inc’s Google suspended some business with Huawei, Reuters reported on Sunday citing a person familiar with the matter, raising worries about the Chinese firm’s smartphones that run on Google’s Android operating system.

Monday’s temporary license is likely to allow companies such as Google to continue providing service and support, including software updates or patches, to Huawei smartphones that were available to the public on or before May 16.

“Keeping phones up to date and secure is in everyone’s best interests and this temporary license allows us to continue to provide software updates and security patches to existing models for the next 90 days,” a Google spokesperson told CNBC in an email on Tuesday.

The license also allows Huawei to engage in the development of standards for fifth-generation (5G) telecom networks.

APPLE PRAISE

Ren put up a brave front on Tuesday, reiterating claims that the restrictions will not hurt Huawei’s prospects and that no other company will be able to catch up with Huawei in 5G technology in the next two to three years.

China was nevertheless still “far behind” the United States in technology, he said.

Chip experts have called out Huawei on its claims that it could ensure a steady supply chain without U.S. help, saying the technology it buys from American companies would be “hard to replace”.

Nearly 16 percent of Huawei’s spending on components in 2018 went to U.S. firms including Qualcomm, Intel and Micron Technology, analysts said.

Ren said Huawei was at odds with the U.S. government, not U.S. firms, and in a comment that trended on Chinese social media, he praised Apple Inc’s iPhones, saying he gifted the American firm’s devices to family members.

“Apple has a good business ecosystem ... We cannot think narrow-mindedly that loving Huawei equals loving its phones.”

U.S. firms could lose up to $56.3 billion in export sales over five years from stringent export controls on technologies involving Huawei or otherwise, the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation said in a report. Missed opportunities threatened as many as 74,000 jobs, the foundation said."
DHS warns of 'strong concerns' that Chinese-made drones are stealing data,https://www.cnn.com,['David Shortell'],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/20/politics/dhs-chinese-drone-warning/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Chinese-made drones may be sending sensitive flight data to their manufacturers in China, where it can be accessed by the government there, the US Department of Homeland Security warned in an alert issued Monday obtained by CNN.

The drones are a ""potential risk to an organization's information,"" the alert from DHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency states. The products ""contain components that can compromise your data and share your information on a server accessed beyond the company itself.""

The report does not name any specific manufacturers, but nearly 80% of the drones used in the US and Canada come from DJI, which is headquartered in Shenzhen, China, according to one industry analysis. US local law enforcement organizations and infrastructure operators have grown to rely on drones in recent years.

""The United States government has strong concerns about any technology product that takes American data into the territory of an authoritarian state that permits its intelligence services to have unfettered access to that data or otherwise abuses that access,"" the alert says.

""Those concerns apply with equal force to certain Chinese-made (unmanned aircraft systems)-connected devices capable of collecting and transferring potentially revealing data about their operations and the individuals and entities operating them, as China imposes unusually stringent obligations on its citizens to support national intelligence activities,"" the alert adds.

DOJ reveals name of ex-US attorney accused of sexual misconduct after BuzzFeed lawsuit,https://thehill.com,[],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/444620-doj-reveals-name-of-ex-us-attorney-accused-of-sexual-misconduct-after,"The Justice Department has revealed the name of a former U.S. attorney accused of misconduct after BuzzFeed News successfully sued for disclosure of his identity.

The Justice Department announced in May 2017 that the since-retired attorney had an affair with a subordinate, created a hostile work environment and possibly violated department policy on sexual harassment. A federal judge ruled in March that public interest superseded government officials’ right to privacy, forcing the Justice Department to disclose last week the attorney in question was Stephen Wigginton, who served as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Illinois from 2010 to 2015. Wigginton was also charged with driving under the influence and causing a car crash in 2017.

In the March ruling, U.S. District Judge Vernon Broderick ruled the Justice Department omitted key details in arguing Wigginton’s case only involved an “improper consensual relationship.”

“Instead, the improper relationship was so open and obvious that it caused employees within the Office to feel powerless, embarrassed, and distracted, and resulted in a work environment that some described as unbearable and hostile,” Broderick wrote. “In addition to work environment issues, the conduct had an impact on the operations of the Office since it resulted in disparate treatment regarding bonuses and disciplinary actions, and led some to avoid the U.S. Attorney and Supervisory AUSA at all costs.”

“Following the OIG’s investigation into this matter, the Department took appropriate steps to assess and address the issues outlined in the OIG’s report,” a Justice Department spokesperson told BuzzFeed. “The department has complete confidence in the new leadership and overall professionalism of the [US attorney’s office] in the Southern District of Illinois.”

The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Hill."

Even The New York Times, the so-called Gray Lady with all the news that’s fit to print, found it fit to print the B.S. word just 14 times in the many years before Mr. Trump’s inauguration, according to a Nexis search, but has used it 26 times since — not all in stories covering the president.

Other presidents, of course, have engaged in common language and found a connection to everyday people. Harry S. Truman was told to “give ’em hell, Harry,” to which he famously replied: “I don’t give them hell. I just tell the truth about them and they think it’s hell.” But in general, it used to be something of a mini-scandal when a president was caught cursing in public.

During a campaign event in 2000, George W. Bush was heard over a live microphone talking with his running mate, Dick Cheney, calling a Times reporter he did not particularly like a “major-league asshole.” In 2004, as vice president, Mr. Cheney told a senator on the Senate floor to “go fuck yourself.” His successor, Joseph R. Biden Jr., was overheard in 2010 using a variation of that profanity to tell Barack Obama what a big deal passage of health care legislation was.

Never has any president pushed the boundaries of language as far as Mr. Trump. He had a foul mouth long before politics, of course, but he seemed to try, however fitfully, to clean it up for a while when he set his sights on the White House. Still, he could not resist at times. At one rally during his 2016 campaign, he quoted a supporter calling a Republican rival, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a “pussy.”

Once taking office, he tried, at least, to keep it private, but he was uninhibited when the cameras were not on. After the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, was appointed, he told aides, “I’m fucked.” Speaking with lawmakers, he called African nations “shithole countries.”

Yet Mr. Trump feigned shock in January when the newly elected Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan said she and her fellow House Democrats were “going to impeach the motherfucker.” The president told reporters that “she dishonored herself” by “using language like that in front of her son and whoever else was there.”

Mick Mulvaney, the White House chief of staff, acknowledged a certain raw quality in Mr. Trump’s discourse but dismissed its significance. “The president does use coarse language in private a lot with us,” he told Jake Tapper on CNN after Ms. Tlaib’s comment. “Many people do.” But, he added, “I think there’s more important things as to who’s coarsening the language.”"
EPA to ‘Massage Death Projections’ to Make Trump’s Coal Plan Look Less Deadly: Report,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Jamie Ross'],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/epa-plans-to-massage-death-projections-to-make-trumps-coal-rule-look-less-deadly-report,"If your projections make a policy look dangerous, there’s two options—change the policy, or change the projections. The Environmental Protection Agency is reportedly planning to do the latter by adopting a new method for projecting the future health risks of air pollution. The new method has not been been peer-reviewed and is not scientifically sound, The New York Times reports, citing five people said to have knowledge of the plan. The change would drastically lower an estimate made last year by the Trump administration that as many as 1,400 more people could die prematurely each year under a proposed new rule on emissions from coal plants. Lowering the projections would make it much easier to defend the new regulation, known as the Affordable Clean Energy rule. “Particulate matter is extremely harmful and it leads to a large number of premature deaths,” said Richard L. Revesz, an expert in environmental law at New York University. He called the expected change a “monumental departure” from the approach used over the past several decades."

DES MOINES, Iowa — U.S. corn farmers have the most corn acres left to plant, on this date, than they have ever had and remain behind the trade’s expectations, as well.

In its Crop Progress Report Monday, the USDA pegged U.S. corn planting at 49% complete, behind the 80% five-year average.

The trade expected a completion rating of 53%. On this week of the planting season, the most that U.S. farmers have ever had left was 47% of the crop. In 2019, that amount is 51%, with plenty of rain in the Midwest’s forecast.

As of Sunday, Iowa farmers had 70% of that state’s corn crop planted vs. a 89% five-year average. Illinois farmers have 24% of their corn seeded, behind a 89% five-year average. Indiana has 14% planted vs. a 73% five-year average. In the eastern Corn Belt, Nebraska farmers have 70% of their corn planted vs. a 86% five-year average.

Also, 19% of the U.S. corn has emerged vs. a 49% five-year average.

So perhaps a more instructive way to assess Biden’s prospects at this point might be to take a look back at the history of vice presidents who became president — and those who didn’t.

ADVERTISEMENT

In all of U.S. history, only 14 vice presidents have acceded to the role of commander in chief. But eight of those got there because of the death of the president under which they served, and one — Gerald Ford — due to the resignation of his boss. So that leaves only five who were elected in their own right, the last being George H.W. Bush, 31 years ago.

Alas, this has not been for lack of trying. Sitting Vice Pres. Richard Nixon ran for president and lost in 1960. Incumbent Vice Pres. Hubert Humphrey ran and lost in 1968, as did Al Gore Albert (Al) Arnold GoreSeveral factors have hindered 'next up' presidential candidates in recent years Montana Gov. Bullock enters presidential race Bullock hires senior staffers ahead of likely presidential run MORE in 2000. So three of the last four sitting vice presidents who ran for president failed.

Only Bush 41 broke that pattern, but let’s not forget that his 1988 win to replace Ronald Reagan was an historical anomaly: The last time an incumbent vice president had been elected to succeed the president under which he served was 152 years before, when Martin Van Buren replaced Andrew Jackson.

But to fully paint the picture, we need to add two other vice presidents to the mix. Former Vice Pres. Walter Mondale won the Democratic nomination in 1984, but was demolished by Pres. Ronald Reagan, losing every state but his own Minnesota.

And let’s not forget ex-Vice Pres. Dan Quayle, beaten badly along with Bush in 1992 by Bill Clinton William (Bill) Jefferson ClintonBarr says he's working to protect presidency, not Trump Lightfoot takes office as Chicago's first black woman mayor De Blasio pitches himself as tough New Yorker who can take on 'Don the con' MORE. Quayle laid low for a while, but reappeared in 1999 and announced he would seek the 2000 GOP nomination. His attempted comeback didn’t end well. After finishing eighth — yes, eighth — in the Iowa straw poll, he withdrew from the race a month later, before a single vote had been cast, claiming he couldn’t raise the money to compete.

Speaking of Mondale, Quayle and Biden, it is also interesting to note that Richard Nixon in 1968 became still the only former vice president ever to be elected president after an interregnum between his service as vice president and his election as president. In Biden’s favor, unlike Mondale and Quayle, he wasn’t part of a ticket unceremoniously ejected from office after one term.

None of this history is determinative or even predictive, of course. In 2008, America elected its first African American, then eight years later elected the first-ever president who had never served either in elective office or the military.

I could enthusiastically support Biden as the Democratic nominee for president next year. He is a good guy, a regular joe who has overcome unspeakable personal tragedies to stay involved in public life. But as a student of American history, a healthy pinch of skepticism is to be excused when assessing his capacity as a former No. 2 to pull off a presidential win.

"GM's over-the-air updates, EPA's new math, hydrogen from seawater: Today's Car News",https://www.greencarreports.com,[],,,,https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1123198_gms-over-the-air-updates-epas-new-math-hydrogen-from-seawater-todays-car-news,"



EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler

The EPA plans to stop counting potential lives saved from new pollution rules. GM reveals a platform that's connected to the future. Stanford scientists devise a way to use seawater to make hydrogen. And our latest Twitter poll asks what types of incentives work best to sell EVs. All this and more on Green Car Reports.

In its latest effort to unwind the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan, the EPA is considering a new analytical model that will quit counting thousands of lives potentially saved by cleaning up the air, according to a new report in The New York Times.

GM introduced a new electrical architecture expected to go into most of its cars by 2023, which can provide faster communications for electric drive systems, self-driving, and infotainment, with future expandability and Tesla-style over-the-air updates.

How to make enough hydrogen is one of the main challenges with fuel-cell cars. Getting it from water, in addition to requiring a lot of energy, could stress water supplies. Now scientists at Stanford have figured out how to make lots of it from seawater. That leaves several other challenges unsolved, however.

After checking out how Norway managed to find success with electric cars, our latest Twitter poll asks, ""What kinds of EV incentives are most effective?""

Spy photographers from our partners at Motor Authority have caught images of the new Chevy Bolt–based electric SUV from GM out testing on public roads. The new model, which could be called the Bolt EUV, is expected to be built alongside the Bolt EV in 2021.

Finally, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles recalled almost 200,000 Chrysler Pacifica minivans—but not the Pacifica Hybrid this time—for an electrical problem that could lead to a stall or a lack of power-steering assistance.

Contributing columnist

The Office of Legal Counsel offered more cause for concern last week that politics is playing an undue role at the Justice Department. The office, which is charged with providing the executive branch neutral legal advice, issued an opinion that the Food and Drug Administration has no authority to regulate drugs used in lethal injection.

The OLC opinion was clearly designed to break through the legal logjam that has prevented states from using lethal injection drugs in executions — and it uses Evel Kneivel-style logical leaps to get there.

Lethal injections, such as the three-drug cocktail sodium thiopental, have become the primary method of execution in the United States. Of the 292 executions in the last 10 years, 289 have employed such chemicals.

U.S. drug manufacturers, not wanting their products to be associated with executions, stopped making thiopental 10 years ago, forcing states to acquire the killing drugs overseas. This move has generated legal trouble, however, as the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) prohibits misbranded drugs from entering interstate commerce, including any drug not manufactured in an establishment registered with the FDA. The statute also prohibits the use of an unapproved new drug that the FDA has not blessed as safe and effective for its proposed use.

Based on these legal provisions, a group of convicts on death row sued the FDA in 2011 and gained an injunction requiring the administration to prevent the entry of foreign-manufactured thiopental on the grounds that it was unapproved and misbranded. It also had to tell state correctional departments that the use of the drug was prohibited by law under threat of civil and criminal penalties.

That injunction remains in effect today. Among other things, it has put the FDA and death-penalty states such as Texas at loggerheads.

The Office of Legal Counsel’s opinion, authored by its well-respected head lawyer, Assistant Attorney General Steven A. Engel, attempts to take the FDA’s foot off the throat of death-penalty states. Engel points to FDA v. Brown & Williamson, a 2000 case in which the Supreme Court found that the FDA lacks regulatory authority over tobacco products as “drugs” or “devices” (Congress later granted the agency power to regulate them directly), to argue that the FDA similarly cannot regulate sodium thiopental’s use in executions. The supposition is that when used for executions, the substance is intended to kill the prisoner, so by definition the drug is not “safe” or “effective.”

But this reasoning is tendentious. Nowhere in Brown & Williamson did the court suggest that the law inherently did not cover tobacco products; rather, the court held that, lacking any safer effective use, the FDA could only regulate the products by banning them, which Congress expressly forbade. Congress has not, however, forbidden the FDA from banning the use of sodium thiopental in executions.

The OLC opinion tries to get around this problem by lumping sodium thiopental in with other means of executions — electric chairs, gallows or firing squads — that “are intended to affect the function or structure of the body,” which is one of the definitions of a “drug.” Thus, Engel argues, the FDA would have to ban all means of execution, whereas “the Constitution and laws of the United States presuppose the continued availability of capital punishment.”

This is a massive logical leap. Among other problems, it assumes that there cannot be a “safe and effective” drug in executions, but the whole point of lethal injection is to provide a safe and effective form of execution — not, of course, to extend life but to promote a humane and predictable death rather than the ghoulish lottery of untested, potentially painful drugs.

Moreover, all the opinions in the litigation that resulted in the 2011 injunction, as well as previous opinions in the Supreme Court, concluded that the FDA’s jurisdiction over drugs extends to sodium thiopental. Even Texas expressly conceded it in the injunction litigation. The OLC opinion also sidesteps the immense implications of its reasoning for the FDA’s regulation of drugs for physician-assisted suicide, animal euthanasia or recreation.

So why would OLC issue such a strained opinion? First clue: The heading of the opinion makes clear that it was ordered up by the attorney general, which is relatively rare. And a footnote states that OLC “considered” the views of the FDA. Reading between the lines, it’s a decent bet that OLC rejected the FDA’s arguments.

Apart from disarming the FDA, the opinion removes the threat of civil and even criminal liability under the FDCA for state officials who buy and use the foreign-manufactured drugs.

Finally, the OLC opinion could potentially serve as the basis for a motion to dissolve or amend the 2011 injunction. Death penalty states could argue to the court that the FDA’s jurisdiction is a threshold issue not previously considered, and the opinion here, being an official statement of the executive branch, would carry more weight than a simple argument in a brief.

None of this would be so worrisome if the opinion represented the sort of nonpartisan legal interpretation that the OLC is charged with providing. But the opinion, not least because of its dubious legal analysis, bears the distinct scent of a preferred political solution. Given the concern that the Justice Department has become a political tool for the administration, it’s yet another worrisome indication that the norms of our institutions are eroding.

"Venezuela opposition's envoy to U.S. meets Pentagon, State Department officials",https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-usa/venezuela-oppositions-envoy-to-us-meets-pentagon-state-department-officials-idUSKCN1SQ26G,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Venezuelan opposition’s envoy to the United States said he met Pentagon and State Department officials in Washington on Monday to discuss “all aspects of the Venezuelan crisis.”

Carlos Vecchio, opposition leader Juan Guaido’s ambassador to Washington, said in a message on Twitter that the talks held at the State Department had been “very positive” but offered no further details. “We continue to advance,” he said.

The talks were arranged at the request of Guaido, leader of the opposition-controlled National Assembly who invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency in January, arguing that socialist President Nicolas Maduro’s 2018 re-election was illegitimate.

The United States and many European and Latin American countries have recognized Guaido as Venezuela’s rightful leader. But Maduro retains control of state functions and the support of the military’s top brass, as well as allies such as Russia, Cuba and China.

The purpose of Monday’s meeting was to discuss the U.S. Defense Department’s “past and future role related to humanitarian assistance and regional support,” a State Department official said ahead of the talks.

President Donald Trump and senior aides have not ruled out military action in the crisis-stricken South American country, repeatedly saying that “all options are on the table.”

But Washington has made clear it prefers to exert continued economic and diplomatic pressure to push Maduro out, and many experts have said the U.S. use of military force is unlikely."
Homeland Security warns of scam that uses real law enforcement numbers,https://kstp.com,[],,,,https://kstp.com/news/homeland-security-warns-scam-uses-real-law-enforcement-phone-numbers-dhs/5361377/,"According to the release, the perpetrator starts by befriending victims on a mobile app for chatting, such as Facebook Messenger or Words with Friends, and feigns romantic interest in the victim through dating services or chat rooms. After gaining the victim's trust, the perpetrator describes a minor hardship and persuades the victim to sent them a small amount of money.

The release says a fraudster then calls the victim the following day, claiming to be an employee of DHS or another law enforcement agency. DHS says the fraudsters spoof the caller ID of legitimate law enforcement phone numbers, and tells the victim the funds they sent the day before went to a criminal organization or terrorist group, such as ISIS or Al-Qaeda, and threatens them with arrest and imprisonment.

The fraudsters then direct the victim to contact a ""lawyer"" who can help them, and the ""lawyer"" then instructs the victim to pay $1,000 or more as a ""retainer.""

DHS says the Office of Inspector General is investigating the situation, but reminds the public that law enforcement and other government agency phone numbers may be used by the fraudsters in the scam. The release warns people to not provide any personal information when receiving calls from these numbers.

The release says people should remember that legitimate law enforcement callers will never ask you to pay fines over the phone or request money from you. If you question the validity of the call, you're urged to call the relevant field office number of the agency that called and ask to be put in touch with the individual who called you.

If you believe you may have been a victim of this scam, DHS urges you to call its hotline at 1-800-323-8603 or file a complaint online at oig.dhs.gov."
"Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, Utah Gov. Herbert to meet over roadless rule",https://www.deseretnews.com,"[""Amy Joi O'Donoghue"", 'Amy Joi Is The Environmental Reporter For The Deseret News.']",05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900071458/agriculture-secretary-sonny-perdue-utah-gov-herbert-to-meet-over-roadless-rule.html,"SALT LAKE CITY — U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue is coming to Utah this week and will meet with Gov. Gary Herbert to discuss multiple issues, including the state's desire for a roadless rule specific to Utah and the formalization of a stewardship agreement with the U.S. Forest Service.

Herbert and Perdue will spend most of the day together Wednesday, kicking things off with a meeting, talks over breakfast, a Tooele County tour of a watershed restoration project, lunch and a tour of Welfare Square operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

As head of the agriculture department, Perdue oversees the management of the nation's forests. In Utah, there are 8.1 million forested acres, of which more than 4 million are designated and managed as roadless.

The 2001 Roadless Rule, according to the U.S. Forest Service, establishes prohibitions on road construction, road reconstruction and timber harvesting on 58.5 million acres of inventoried forest lands across the country.

Utah is following the lead of Alaska, which in 2018 successfully received approval of its petition to the U.S. Forest Service for the agency to begin developing a specific roadless rule plan for the Tongass National Forest.

Any new rule or update requires an environmental review process, and the state's petition to change what is on the books has prompted outcry and objection from multiple organizations.

In a briefing to lawmakers last week, the head of the Utah Public Lands Policy Coordinating Office, Kathleen Clarke, said Utah's petition was submitted at the end of February and is awaiting action by the U.S. Forest Service.

Perdue's visit is a good sign, she added, in her presentation to the Natural Resources, Agriculture and Environment Interim Committee.

“I think it is a very solid petition,"" Clarke said. ""There is a lot of rumor out there. There are a lot of accusations of it taking over management, which it does not do,"" she said.

Utah's desire for the roadless rule alteration comes in the aftermath of a record-breaking wildfire season in 2018 that cost the state more than $42 million in funding to quell.

Jeffrey D. Allred, Deseret News The Dollar Ridge Fire continues to burn at Strawberry Reservoir on Friday, July 6, 2018.

In a video presented to the legislative committee, Clarke's office detailed the specific motivation for seeking a Utah specific rule, citing the need to update the 18-year-old management structure that fails to keep pace with modern challenges of drought, climate change and rampant insect infestation killing millions of trees.

""Utah is not scheming to put more roads in forests,"" the narrator said, adding it is only asking for an updated rule that encompasses Utah's conditions that may differ from the rest of the nation.

But there are plenty of critics who say Utah's move for a modification of the rule is unnecessary and suspect, prompting some to threaten lawsuits or lobby personally in Washington, D.C.

Trout Unlimited sent Andy Rasmussen, the organization's Utah coordinator of the Sportsmen's Conservation Project, and Heidi Lewis, chairwoman of the Women's Initiative Council, and others to the nation's capital on Friday to press its case on keeping the current roadless rule intact.

""Trout Unlimited feels like it should not change and that we can work things out with programs already in place,"" Lewis said. ""Ultimately if you put roads in, you can't remove them.""

Kristin Murphy, Deseret News Linda Adams looks at the damage after the Dollar Ridge Fire in Fruitland on Wednesday, July 11, 2018. The fire destroyed her home, shed and camper.

Lewis added that Utah's prized Blue Ribbon fisheries would be threatened via changes to the roadless rule management.

The group met personally with Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, and staffers with other members of Utah's delegation.

""It was surprisingly positive,"" he said. ""They are definitely open to a path forward that does not include"" a revision of the rule, Rasmussen said, stressing that Utah's petition is especially concerning because it is so vague.

Rasmussen added the organization believes a better solution, and less costly one, would be an administrative agreement between Utah and the Forest Service, rather than wholesale makeover of the rule.

""I am with the governor on the goals as far as forest health and resiliency,"" he said, but added there should be an agreement that ""maintains the integrity of the roadless rule and still addresses (Utah) concerns.""

USDA: Don’t add foodborne illness to summer menu,https://www.masslive.com,"['Anne-Gerard Flynn', 'Special To The Republican']",05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.masslive.com/news/2019/05/usda-dont-add-foodborne-illness-to-summer-menu.html,"Rates of foodborne illnesses increase during the summer.

According to the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the season’s hot and humid weather causes environmental bacteria to grow faster and, of course, food is more exposed to possible contamination with summer’s many outdoor activities.

“We receive thousands of different questions from consumers regarding food safety during the summer,"" said Adam Ghering of FSIS’ Office of Public Affairs and Consumer Education.

“Many of those questions are linked to the weather. Severe storms and power outages routinely impact food safety during the summer.”

He added, “In general, perishable foods will stay safe in a refrigerator for four hours when the door remains closed.”

“If the power is out for longer, you can transfer foods to a cooler with ice or frozen gel packs. Foods in the freezer will be safe for approximately 48 hours, 24 hours if the fridge is half full,” said Ghering, adding further information on what food is still considered save to consume after a power outage is available online or by calling the USDA’s Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-674-6854.

Ghering said that the “other topic that we receive many questions about is cooking outdoors.”

“Cooking away from the kitchen can be fun but it also requires a good deal of preparation to ensure everything goes smoothly,” he said.

“Bringing water for washing hands, utensils and other equipment is something that can be easily overlooked. Moist towelettes can be a good ‘touch-up’ when your hands get dirty but the most effective method is soap and water.”

He also recommended a cooler will “to keep your food cold, just remember to keep replenishing ice as it melts” and “any type of food thermometer will provide you with the internal temperature of your meat and thereby help you prevent foodborne illness.”

“Any type of improper handling of your food can cause illness but not properly cooking and cooling meat and poultry is vital during summer months,” Ghering said.

“Meat and poultry can quickly brown when grilled but that doesn’t mean they are safe to eat.”

He called probe food thermometers “which you can keep in meat and poultry while cooking” a “great addition to your grilling equipment” in particular.

USDA tips to avoid food poisoning that is estimated to cause some 128,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 deaths in the United States annually include:

Perishable food should not sit out for more than two hours at room temperature and no more than an hour when the temperature is above 90 degrees.

Pack beverages in one cooler and perishable food in another cooler and place cooler in shade when possible, even in car.

If grilling away from home, bring your own water for preparation and cleaning if unsure of availability of clean water supply.

Use a meat thermometer to ensure harmful bacteria are destroyed. Cook beef, pork, lamb and veal to internal minimum safe temperatures of 145 degrees; ground meats, 160 degrees; whole poultry, poultry breasts and ground poultry, 165 degrees.

Keep cooked meats at 140 degrees or warmer by setting them to the side of the grill rack, not directly over the coals where they could overcook. They may also be kept hot in an oven set at approximately 200 degrees in a chafing dish, slow cooker or warming tray.

Leftovers should be stored within two hours of cooking. Divide them into smaller portions and refrigerate or freeze in covered shallow containers for quicker cooling."
New DOJ Investigation Has Haunted FBI for Months,https://www.realclearpolitics.com,[],05-18-2019,2019,5,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/05/18/new_doj_investigation_has_haunted_fbi_for_months.html,"John Durham, the prosecutor tapped by Attorney General William Barr to investigate how Trump-Russia allegations emerged and spread within federal law enforcement, has already been looking into whether the FBI’s former top lawyer, James Baker, illegally leaked to reporters.

In fact, the U.S. attorney from Connecticut appears to have begun that work more than seven months ago, to judge from an underreported transcript of an October congressional interview with Baker. The Baker interview, at which Durham was not present, suggests that the prosecutor nevertheless has some people very worried.

Baker testified about the Trump-Russia affair on Oct. 3 before the House Judiciary Committee and the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.

In that session, the former FBI general counsel admitted that versions and variations of Christopher Steele’s dossier were being turned in to the bureau from the strangest of places. Baker said he had even heard about it from David Corn, Washington bureau chief of left-leaning Mother Jones, who wrote one of the first pieces on the dossier, in October 2016. But in one of those company-town connections that happen frequently in Washington, Baker said he was not just a contact or source for Corn; they were also old pals.

“Tell me about your relationship with David Corn,” said Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan.

“David is a friend of mine,” Baker said.

“Tell me about that. A close friend? Long-time friend?”

“Long-time friend.”

Jordan asked, “When did you first meet Mr. Corn?”

“I don't specifically remember,” Baker testified. “A long time ago, though.”

“Years ago? “

“Years and years and years ago, yeah,” Baker allowed. “Our kids carpooled together. We carpooled with them when our kids were little.”

So one of the most divisive scandals in Washington history was facilitated by an unexpected friendship, an odd couple brought together by a shared interest in getting their kids dropped off at school.

The congressman from Ohio wanted to know more about the Baker-Corn relationship: “Prior to the election of – Presidential election of 2016,” Jordan asked, “how many times did you talk with David Corn in the weeks and months prior to election day?”

“I don't remember,” Baker said, providing an answer that suggests it was more than a few.

“Is it fair to say you did” talk with Corn, Jordan asked?

“Yes, I did, but I just don't remember how many [times].”

“So did you talk to Mr. Corn about anything that the FBI was working on,” Jordan asked, “specifically the now infamous Steele dossier?”

Suddenly, Baker’s lawyer, Dan Levin, jumped in: “One second,” he said before he and his client had a conversation off the record.

When the microphones were back on, Levin declared he would “not let [Baker] answer these questions right now. You may or may not know, he's been the subject of a leak investigation which is still – a criminal leak investigation that's still active at the Justice Department.” And so Levin concluded, “I’m sorry. I'm cutting off any discussion about conversations with reporters.”

North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows wanted to make clear what Baker’s lawyer was claiming: “You're saying he's under criminal investigation? That's why you're not letting him answer?”

“Yes.”

Levin and the lawmakers sparred a bit over whether Baker was invoking his Fifth Amendment rights, and the congressmen finally got around to asking who was leading this criminal probe:

“There is an ongoing investigation by whom?” Jordan said.

“The Justice Department,” Levin responded.

“I mean, is the inspector general looking at this or is this—”

“No,” said Levin, “it's Mr. John Durham, a prosecutor.”

The specter of Durham haunts the rest of the interview. Baker can’t talk about what he told his old friend David Corn in their conversations about the dossier because it would put Baker in legal jeopardy.

Time and again, when Baker was asked questions about reporters – even hypothetical questions about FBI policy regarding contacts with the press, Levin said, “I'm not going to allow him to answer that question” or “I am not going let him answer any questions about leaks.”

“I don't want him talking about conversations he's had with reporters because I don't know what the questions are and I don't know what the answers are right now,” Levin said. “Given that there is an ongoing investigation of him for leaks which the Department has not closed, I'm not comfortable letting him answer questions.” Durham’s inquiry was serious enough to limit significantly what Baker was willing to talk about with lawmakers.

That Baker’s lawyer advised him not to talk about leaks is, of course, not proof that Baker leaked. ""Baker's lawyer was obviously being prudent and saying his client could not talk about anything related to any leaks of any kind,"" David Corn tells RealClearInvestigations. Corn emphasizes that the ""Durham inquiry did not involve Russia or the Steele memos; it had nothing to do with me or my limited interaction with Baker.""

And one former federal official who said he has been interviewed by Durham in connection with the Baker probe, Robert Litt, has written that the inquiry has nothing to do with the Steele dossier.

Contacted by RealClearInvestigations, Levin said, “Mr. Baker did not make an unauthorized disclosure of classified information and we are confident the investigation will conclude that.”

"Acting DHS chief says U.S. won't send migrants to Florida, insists he didn't threaten to quit",https://www.cbsnews.com,['Kathryn Watson'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kevin-mcaleenan-acting-dhs-chief-tells-face-the-nation-the-trump-administration-wont-send-migrants-to-florida/,"The Trump administration will not send immigrants who cross the southern border to Florida, a reversal that was decided over the weekend, acting Department of Homeland Security chief Kevin McAleenan told ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday.

McAleenan's comments come after Florida officials said they were told earlier last week that federal officials were sending immigrants to South Florida jurisdictions. McAleenan told ""Face the Nation"" that ""U.S. Customs and Border Protection did notify officials locally in those areas that they were looking at the possibility of doing that,"" but the CBP acting commissioner decided against doing so Saturday.

News of the plans drew criticism from elected officials in Florida, including Ron DeSantis, the state's Republican governor, who said Friday the state ""cannot accommodate in Florida this dumping of unlawful migrants."" DeSantis confirmed in a Tweet Sunday that he has spoken with Mr. Trump, and migrants won't be heading to his state.

""President @realDonaldTrump and I spoke yesterday and confirmed that he did not approve, nor would approve, sending immigrants who illegally cross the border, to Florida. It is not going to happen,"" DeSantis tweeted.

McAleenan insisted the administration is focused on using southwest border areas to handle the influx of immigrants. He also claimed the administration isn't moving immigrants to sanctuary jurisdictions, as President Trump has said he wants to do. McAleenan claimed sanctuary cities are already housing many immigrants because those cities serve as a ""magnet.""

McAleenan also insisted he never threatened to quit, denying a Washington Post report that he threatened to leave amid a dispute with top Trump adviser and immigration hardliner Stephen Miller, who was reportedly pushing for another shakeup at the agency.

McAleenan, who is also the head of CBP, took over as acting DHS secretary after former DHS secretary Kirstjen Nielsen resigned in April.

Last week, Mr. Trump announced a proposal to reform legal immigration by restricting some family-based migration and instituting higher skill and education requirements. The proposal would overhaul the family-based migration system Mr. Trump calls ""chain migration."" But the proposal was light on specifics, and the administration has given no timeline for when the proposal might be released in the form of a bill.

""Our proposal is pro-American, pro-immigrant, and pro-worker. It's just common sense,"" the president told supporters and reporters in the White House Rose Garden on Thursday."

Mr. Mnuchin was widely expected to ignore the subpoena, as Mr. Trump has vowed to fight all subpoenas from House Democrats. The Treasury secretary has warned that allowing House Democrats to retrieve the president’s tax returns would open the door to lawmakers from both parties politicizing the Internal Revenue Service in the future.

At a Senate hearing this week, Mr. Mnuchin said that House Democrats were trying to “weaponize” the I.R.S. He said that he had not yet decided how he would respond to the subpoena, but that “you can guess which way we are leaning.” He said that the judiciary, as the third branch of government, would most likely need to settle the dispute between Congress and the executive branch, signaling the potential for a protracted court fight.

House Democrats have been weighing how to respond to the Trump administration’s defiance of congressional subpoenas. On Friday, Mr. Neal made clear his preference for avoiding retaliatory threats, to the disappointment of several of his more liberal colleagues.

Mr. Neal told reporters that he saw little value in trying to hold Mr. Mnuchin or Charles P. Rettig, the I.R.S. commissioner, in contempt of Congress. Instead, he said, he would go straight to the courts to try to enforce his subpoena, potentially as soon as next week. The case could take months or years to resolve."

Two organizations representing farmers and fishermen announced their support for legislation that would require the U.S. Department of Agriculture purchase agricultural commodities and seafood from domestically owned enterprises whenever possible.

Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., introduced this past week a bill in the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday called the “Buy American Agriculture Act.”

In addition to requiring the secretary of the USDA to purchase from domestically owned enterprises, the legislation would require the secretary to publish why the purchasing contracts were awarded to enterprises and whether they are domestically owned.

DeLauro announced she would file the bill in January, when the USDA published reports it would purchase nearly 9.8 million pounds of pork for $22.3 million from Greeley-based JBS USA through a program meant to help U.S. farmers impacted by the trade war. However, JBS USA is a subsidiary of JBS SA, an international meatpacker based out of Brazil.

According to reports from the Department of Agriculture, JBS USA has since secured nine additional contracts for nearly 18.5 million pounds of pork for $40.1 million.

“This legislation comes at a time when USDA, in the name of bailing out farmers harmed by the U.S.-China trade war, has already awarded over $60 million of U.S. taxpayer funds to one of the largest and most corrupt meatpacking corporations in the world,” the Organization for Competitive Markets stated in a news release.

In its release, the organization provided the following reasons for supporting the legislation:

In November 2018, Chinese-owned Smithfield Foods rescinded its bid for $240,000 through the trade mitigation program after backlash on Capitol Hill,

JBS SA was involved in a corruption scandal involving more than 1,800 Brazilian politicians,

In 2017, the company exported rotten meat worldwide, using cancerous acid products to cover up the stench,

This past year, the company recalled about 12 million pounds of ground beef

The USDA settled claims in 2018 that JBS shorted three separate slaughter facilities on payments for their cattle. The company paid a $50,000 penalty.

“At a time when our farmers and fishermen are barely surviving and multinational companies dominate our food system, this is a particularly important measure,” the Northwest Atlantic Marine Alliance stated in the release.

JBS USA defended the USDA purchases in a January statement to The Tribune:

“As an approved vendor in USDA food purchasing programs, all eligible JBS USA pork products come from American livestock raised on American farms by U.S. family farmers, and are processed in American facilities in rural American towns.”"

A person familiar with the process told Fox News Tuesday that Durham has been working on his review “for weeks,” to probe ""all intelligence collection activities"" related to the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election.

The Russia investigation and Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report continue to be debated by Republicans and Democrats since its release last month.

In an interview that aired on Fox News Thursday, Barr explained that he is trying to get to the bottom of whether or not “government officials abused their power and put their thumb on the scale” during the early stages of the Russia probe.

McDowell also said Americans deserve to know the truth.

""[According to a Fox News poll released Thursday] a majority, 58 percent think it's at least somewhat likely the FBI broke the law when it started investigating the Trump campaign,"" McDowell said.

Five missteps that led to the removal of St. Petersburg Housing Authority board members,https://www.tampabay.com,[],05-21-2019,2019,5,https://www.tampabay.com/florida/2019/05/21/five-missteps-that-led-to-the-removal-of-st-petersburg-housing-authority-board-members/,"City Hall veterans can’t remember officials ever removing a St. Petersburg Housing Authority board member from office. Now Mayor Rick Kriseman has replaced five of the seven-member voluntary board in just the past three months including three who were removed from office Thursday. Here’s a look at the missteps that have dogged the agency over the past year:

1. Relocation of residents from Jordan Park

The bungalows of Jordan Park sit empty behind a gate put up to enclose the properties.

The Housing Authority’s plan to demolish rather than renovate the last original structures of the historic African-American community was controversial enough. Then it relocated about 31 families from the complex even though there was no financing in place to redevelop it. Displaced residents complained they had been moved into deplorable housing, leading prominent community leaders including School Board Chairwoman Renee Flowers and City Council member Lisa Wheeler-Bowman to call for new board members that would challenge agency CEO Tony Love.





2. Charging its own board member for public records

St. Petersburg Housing Authority board member Terri Lipsey Scott received an email from the agency she oversees stating she must pay up to $400 for records she wants to review. The agency said her list of 14 different requests would take considerable staff time to produce. Other Tampa Bay housing authorities say they provide board members any records free of charge. CHRIS URSO | Times

Housing Authority board members, who are charged with overseeing the agency, serve on a voluntary basis. So Terri Lipsey Scott was outraged when she was told in January she would have to pay as much as $400 for agency records including minutes of meetings, staff evaluations of Love, and travel and legal invoices. By the time St. Petersburg City Council Chairman Charlie Gerdes decided he would intervene and pay for the records, the cost had risen to $900. The agency eventually returned Gerdes’ check and provided Scott the records for free.





3. Allowing CEO Tony Love to live for nine months in low-income housing

St. Petersburg Housing Authority CEO Tony Love lived in a second-floor unit at Saratoga Apartments for nine months in 2016. The agency was originally required to pay his rent for six months as part of his relocation package. It also paid for $3,000 in furniture and his monthly electric bills.

When it hired Love in 2016, the Housing Authority agreed to pay his rent for six months as part of a relocation package. Love, instead, decided it made more sense for him to live in a vacant agency apartment than for the Housing Authority to pay for a privately owned one. He moved into a complex restricted to low-income families. Love, who at the time was earning $140,000, also billed the agency $3,000 to furnish the apartment and $625 for his electric bills, items that were not listed in his relocation benefits. The perk didn’t end after six months. Board members retroactively agreed to extend his stay for an extra three months. A Tampa Bay Times report exposing the misuse of agency resources led to the agency being cited by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in March.





4. Failing to disclose complaints about the CEO to board members voting on his $10,000 pay raise

St. Petersburg Housing Authority CEO Tony Love was awarded a $10,000 raise in 2017. Some board members said they were never shown his evaluation but voted for the raise nonetheless.

Love’s first evaluation as agency CEO was conducted in 2017 by the agency’s personnel committee, which included board members Harry Harvey and Delphinia Davis. It included questionnaires filled in by about eight senior agency staffers about their boss. At least two of employees described a leader who bullied and belittled his workers and ordered some to work on preparations for his fraternity’s golf event. The complaints were serious enough for the agency to pay $3,600 for a consultant to work with Love on his people skills. But none of those reports nor the consultant’s report were forwarded to other board members who were asked later that year to approve raising Love’s yearly salary to $150,000. Board members approved the hike even though some questioned how they could vote on an evaluation they hadn’t seen.





5. Board members held emergency meeting in violation of Florida’s “Government in the Sunshine” act

With Kriseman’s pledge to remove three board members hanging over them, Board Chairman Harvey scheduled an emergency meeting April 10 for the board to authorize taking legal action against the city. Ironically, the meeting ended up making its way into the “charges” the city used to justify removing Harvey and Ann Sherman White from office.

The only public notice of the meeting was made to board members via an email sent by Love at 7:14 p.m. the night before it took place. State law says “reasonable notice” must be made to the public before such meetings are held, and that they must be open to the public. The meeting was attended by only three board members, too few to establish a quorum required by state law for board action. Nonetheless, the board voted to authorize suing the city. Concern about the legality of the action led agency attorney Charley Harris to recommend the board redo the vote at its next regular board meeting."

McAleenan was asked Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation” if he had threatened to leave. “No,” he responded, saying he planned to lead the department for as long as he had the opportunity.

But he refused to discuss whether he had fought with Miller, who is known as an immigration hardliner.

“Look, I'm not going to talk about rumors or any alleged internal conversations,” McAleenan said.

President Trump appointed McAleenan to lead Homeland Security temporarily after Kirstjen Nielsen was ousted as secretary last month at Miller’s urging. Other top officials, including acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Ron Vitiello, have been removed at Miller’s insistence.

Nielsen and Vitiello had challenged Miller’s proposal to conduct mass arrests in 10 cities of migrant parents and children eligible for deportation."
Critics Say USDA Plan To Move Federal Agencies Could Hurt Research Vital For Farmers,https://www.npr.org,['Frank Morris'],05-18-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/18/724433714/critics-say-usda-plan-to-move-federal-agencies-could-hurt-research-vital-for-far,"Critics Say USDA Plan To Move Federal Agencies Could Hurt Research Vital For Farmers

A couple of federal agencies you probably haven't heard of keep track of what farmers grow, what Americans eat and how the country's entire food system operates. And the Trump administration wants them out of Washington, D.C.

Last summer, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) would relocate somewhere that's closer to farmers and public universities doing agricultural research. But critics, including many scientists, balked, saying the agencies won't be as effective.

ERS collects and crunches numbers on everything from how much corn syrup Americans consume to how tariffs affect farmers, while NIFA funds research that does things like closely track climate change.

USDA has yet to announce a new home for the agencies, but recently narrowed the list to three: the greater Kansas City metro area, the Research Triangle Park area near Raleigh, N.C., and various sites in Indiana — Vice President Mike Pence's home state.

Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran recalled when he heard of Perdue's proposal.

""My first thought was Kansas City would be the perfect place,"" said the Republican, who, along with other Missouri and Kansas members of Congress, supports the move.

""Not every job in government needs to be in Washington D.C."" Moran said, noting that about 9 out of 10 USDA employees already work outside of Washington.

He added that ERS and NIFA would boost budding research clusters like the Kansas City area's animal health corridor and give bright kids from the region a chance to stay put and still pursue a research career. The move would also fall in line with the Trump administration's cost-cutting measures. Moran said office rent and the cost of living is cheaper away from the coasts.

Skepticism about what is driving the move

But many in the research community said efficiency isn't driving the move. It's hostility toward science.

""I think that moving the agencies out of D.C. is going to significantly dilute their effectiveness as well as their relevance,"" says Ricardo Salvador, who is the Director of the Food and Environment Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

The agency's effectiveness already is under attack, according to a former ERS employee who was granted anonymity due to fear of losing his current position.

""Efforts by the secretary ... have just destroyed morale,"" the ex-ERS employee said.

He said he enjoyed working at the agency until about a year and a half ago, when researchers began to fear tackling politically sensitive topics. Then, Purdue pushed to take the agency out from under nonpartisan oversight and place it under his control.

Finally, the ex-employee said, the surprise announcement to move most of ERS and NIFA out of Washington triggered a cascade of resignations, including his own.

""I think it's had its intended effect. People have left, morale is low. The agency will take a long time to recover from the damage that's been inflicted,"" the former employee said.

Employees remaining at ERS and NIFA are fighting back. ERS researchers recently voted to join the American Federation of Government Employees, and NIFA employees plan to take a vote, too. The union will negotiate to give ERS and NIFA employees longer to decide if they want to move, and is backing legislation that would withhold funds USDA would need to make the move.

The Trump administration wanted staff reductions years ago. And all three Trump budgets, none of which have been accepted by Congress, have proposed deep cuts to the agencies.

Salvador argued that's because objective research often clashes with political ideology. ERS studies, for instance, concluded that the 2017 tax cuts championed by the administration would most benefit the richest farmers, and that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which Trump wants to cut, is good for the economy.

""So the secretary is clearly dealing with inconvenient facts by going to the source and eliminating them,"" Salvador said.

Sen. Jerry Moran said he believes the research agencies can be relocated and well supported, and he's played a key role in fighting off earlier efforts to cut funding for agricultural research.

Moran said farmers, ranchers and policymakers can't make sound decisions without reliable USDA data.

But that's exactly the problem critics have with the proposal to move ERS and NIFA: They say the USDA hasn't produced data that support the move."
James Comey accuses AG Barr of ‘sliming’ DOJ,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Andrew Blake']",05-18-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/may/18/james-comey-accuses-ag-barr-of-sliming-doj/,"Former FBI director James Comey on Friday accused Attorney General William P. Barr of “sliming” the Department of Justice and effectively serving as President Trump’s spokesman.

Mr. Comey criticized the attorney general on Twitter after Mr. Barr raised concerns this week about the origins of the government’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election — a probe led by the former FBI director prior to his firing by Mr. Trump in May 2017.

“The AG should stop sliming his own Department. If there are bad facts, show us, or search for them professionally and then tell us what you found. An AG must act like the leader of the Department of Justice, an organization based on truth. Donald Trump has enough spokespeople,” Mr. Comey tweeted.

Mr. Comey had led the FBI for nearly four years when he was fired by Mr. Trump weeks after revealing that the bureau was investigating possible coordination between the president’s election campaign and Russia. Robert Mueller, the head of the FBI prior to Mr. Comey, was subsequently appointed special counsel and tasked with assuming control of the probe, which culminated last month in the release of a lengthy, heavily redacted report summarizing its results.

Mr. Trump has been highly critical of the government’s probe since prior to Mr. Mueller’s appointment, and Mr. Barr announced this week that a federal prosecutor in Connecticut has been assigned to investigate its origins.

“I think people have to find out what the government was doing during that period. If we’re worried about foreign influence for the very same reason we shouldn’t be worried about whether government officials abused their power and put their thumb on the scale. And so I’m not saying that happened, but I’m saying that we have to look at that,” Mr. Barr said in an interview aired Friday on Fox News.

A total of 34 people and three entities were criminally charged during the duration of the special counsel’s 22-month probe, including several Russians and former members of Mr. Trump’s campaign.

Mr. Barr, 68, was confirmed as attorney general in February. The House Judiciary Committee voted along party lines last week to hold him in contempt of Congress for failing to comply with a subpoena compelling him to provide lawmakers with an unredacted version of Mr. Mueller’s report.

This legislation could help more small tech companies land defense contracts,https://www.fedscoop.com,['Dave Nyczepir'],05-20-2019,2019,5,https://www.fedscoop.com/sbir-dod-legislation-mac-thornberry/,"Written by Dave Nyczepir

Newly proposed legislation could increase the amount of work the Department of Defense does with small businesses — particularly those that get a majority of their funding from venture capital.

The Accelerating Defense Innovation Act would create a pilot project within the DOD’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program to direct grant money to companies the department has otherwise avoided because of legal hurdles that stretch back more than a decade.

Created in 1983, SBIR provides small businesses with research grants to expedite their products’ development, as well as potential follow-on funding and assistance in meeting competitive requirements during the acquisition process. In 2003, courts ruled companies with more than 50 percent venture capital ownership are ineligible for SBIR grants. Congress created a waiver in 2011 for small businesses that are majority owned by multiple domestic venture investors, which requires congressional notification and Small Business Administration approval.

DOD has never used the waiver. Instead, the department “is turning away innovative small businesses with the most promising military and commercial technologies,” reads a fact sheet from the office of Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, the new bill’s sponsor. For example, Thornberry’s office cites satellite technology from startup Capella Space that can see through clouds. The 50-person team came out of DOD’s Hacking 4 Defense program but failed to receive an SBIR grant because of venture capital investment.

The Domestic Investment Pilot Program would allow the secretary of Defense and service acquisition executives for each military department to make an SBIR award to a small business that is majority-owned by multiple domestic venture investors. The bill allows no more than 15 percent of DOD SBIR program funds to be awarded to small businesses owned in majority part by multiple domestic venture investors, and the program will end on Sept. 30, 2022.

Despite the limitations of SBIR, there are other ways for young tech companies to work with the DOD, regardless of their funding. The Defense Innovation Unit, for example, currently handles pilot projects for commercial innovations that any of the department’s branches may procure after testing is complete. The goal is to speed up time to agreement, which the unit generally reaches within 90 days of first contact with the company.

Thornberry, the ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, wants to include his legislation in the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the release said."
Nellie Ohr deleted emails sent from husband's DOJ account,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/nellie-ohr-deleted-emails-sent-from-husbands-doj-account,"Nellie Ohr, the wife of Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, told her husband she was deleting emails sent from his government account.

The revelation comes as both Ohrs remain under intense scrutiny for their ties to Fusion GPS and British ex-spy Christopher Steele, the author of the anti-Trump dossier that was used to obtain warrants to wiretap a member of President Trump's 2016 campaign.

Conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch obtained a series of April 2016 emails from a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the Justice Department that show a correspondence between the Ohrs, an aide to Bruce Ohr named Lisa Holtyn, and Stefan Bress, a first secretary at the German Embassy.

They discussed setting up a dinner for the German delegation as well as a meeting to discuss Russian organized crime. Included in a proposed agenda is the “Impact of Russian influence operations in Europe (‘PsyOps/InfoWar’).”

On April 20, responding to the email thread with the subject line, “Analyst Russian Organized Crime – April 2016,"" came the email from Nellie Ohr about deleting the emails. ""Thanks! I’m deleting these emails now,"" she said.

Bruce Ohr was an associate deputy attorney general and director of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force while his wife Nellie was an independent contractor and Russia specialist.

Emails previously released by Judicial Watch show Bruce Ohr acting as an unofficial back channel between the FBI and Steele. He was demoted when it was revealed he met with Steele and Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which commissioned Steele's work. Ohr also told lawmakers his wife shared a thumb drive with him to hand over to the FBI.

The dossier, which contained unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia, has been a subject of concern for GOP lawmakers, particularly for how it was used by the FBI in Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant applications to gain the authority to spy on onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

Nellie Ohr conducted research on connections between Russia and Trump, having been contracted by Fusion GPS.

Both Ohrs testified last year to a joint task force of the House Oversight and Judiciary committees that were investigating decisions made by the Justice Department and FBI surrounding the 2016 election. This month, Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., sent a criminal referral addressed to Attorney General William Barr, citing concerns that Nellie Ohr ""knowingly provided false testimony"" to lawmakers.

Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton said that Nellie Ohr informing her husband about deleting the emails indicates a pattern of covering up a plot against Trump. “This email is disturbing and suggests documents relevant to the improper targeting of President Trump were destroyed,” Fitton said in a statement."
CFPB Chief Says Education Department Is Blocking Student Loan Oversight,https://www.npr.org,['Chris Arnold'],05-16-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/16/723568597/cfpb-chief-says-education-department-is-blocking-student-loan-oversight,"CFPB Chief Says Education Department Is Blocking Student Loan Oversight

The director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau says the Trump administration's Education Department is getting in the way of efforts to police the student loan industry. The revelation, in a letter obtained by NPR, comes at the same time that lawsuits allege that widespread wrongdoing by student loan companies is costing some borrowers thousands of dollars.

CFPB Director Kathy Kraninger explained the problem in an April letter responding to questions from Sen. Elizabeth Warren and other lawmakers about whether the federal regulator had ""abandoned its supervision and enforcement activities"" related to more than $1 trillion in student loans.

A central issue is that companies that manage student loans, known as student loan servicers, are refusing to share information that the CFPB says it needs to perform proper oversight.

""Since December 2017,"" Kraninger wrote in the letter, ""student loan servicers have declined to produce information requested by the Bureau for supervisory examinations"" related to federal student loans.

She said servicers are not sharing the information because the Department of Education has issued guidance telling them not to do so, citing ""privacy"" concerns. Kraninger also said that information from student loan servicers is ""necessary for supervisory examinations.""

The letter is a carefully worded response to senators' questions. But Kraninger, a Trump administration appointee, is in essence saying that the CFPB is trying to do its job protecting student borrowers and supervising loan servicing companies, but the Education Department is getting in the way.

""It's actually quite remarkable,"" says Seth Frotman, executive director of the nonprofit Student Borrower Protection Center. ""The head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is telling the world that the secretary of education has put in place a series of policies that are obstructing federal law enforcement officials from standing up for the millions of Americans with student debt.""

Frotman used to be the CFPB's student loan ombudsman but quit last summer over frustrations with the Trump administration. In a scathing resignation letter last August, he said the Trump administration was ""turning its back on student borrowers"" and preventing him from doing his job.

Now Kraninger, the administration's hand-picked director for the bureau, is pointing the finger, albeit in a less dramatic way, at the Education Department for hindering efforts to protect student borrowers.

In response to Kraninger's letter, Elizabeth Warren, Sherrod Brown, and three other Democratic senators called the revelations ""disturbing"" in a round of letters they fired off this week to loan servicing companies.

The lawmakers say in their letters that since Kraninger says the CFPB has attempted to get documents it needs for supervision and been rebuffed by the servicers, that ""reveals that the Department under Secretary DeVos, has removed the most potent weapon from the CFPB's arsenal to fight illegal behavior and mistreatment of borrowers by student loan servicers, and that federal student loan servicers, who are paid by the federal government, are ignoring federal regulators' requests for information.""

The senators' letters add that no ""guidance"" from the Department of Education ""can absolve servicers of their legal responsibility to comply with state and federal consumer protection law.""

Student borrowers getting hurt

When Jessica Saint-Paul heard about a program called Public Service Loan Forgiveness, she was ecstatic. For borrowers who work in qualifying public service jobs — such as police officers, government workers, people who work at nonprofit organizations — the program promises that if they make loan payments for 10 years, the remainder of their student debt will be forgiven. Saint-Paul had about $80,000 in student loans and she wasn't making much money working for a nonprofit that provides services to foster children.

""I was just like, 'Oh, this is perfect,' "" Saint-Paul says. So she called the company that was servicing her student loans and says she was told she was all set — after 10 years, she should be eligible to get her loans forgiven. That was nine years ago.

Saint-Paul said she called back over the years, including once when she changed nonprofit jobs in 2014, to say, ""just making sure I'm on track."" She says she was told, "" 'OK, no problem.' The conversation was quick; they were so kind.""

The call center workers might have been friendly, but Saint-Paul says she was getting bad information. She says she found that out just last year at a conference she attended. There was an information session on loan forgiveness, and she was told she was in the wrong kind of loan and wrong payment plan so she couldn't qualify. She says many other people were finding out the same thing alongside her at the conference.

""It was like a support group almost it turned into because people were like, 'No, that can't be true,' "" Saint-Paul says. ""I went on my phone, people were on their laptops checking what kind of loan they were in. We were all sitting there just frantic.""

Saint-Paul says that if nine years ago her loan servicer had just told her to convert to the right loan and payment plan, everything would have been OK. Instead, she says she feels as though someone stole tens of thousands of dollars from her.

""I just cannot believe this happened to me,"" she says. ""That's like criminal, it's not right.""

Many people agree that it's not right — regulators and advocacy groups are filing a growing number of lawsuits against loan servicing companies alleging mishandling of the loan forgiveness program. Saint-Paul is a plaintiff in one of them.

Many of the consumer complaints and lawsuits involve allegations that servicing companies gave borrowers bad information or advice that resulted in them thinking they were getting credit toward loan forgiveness, when in fact they were in the wrong loan or payment plan.

The Education Department revealed late last year that about 99% of borrowers who thought they had reached that 10-year milestone and applied for forgiveness were rejected. More than 1 million people are actively pursuing loan forgiveness under the program and hoping to qualify.

That's why Democratic lawmakers say they want to make sure that perhaps the most powerful watchdog — the CFPB — is on top of all this.

Fears that the watchdog has been asleep

Since 2011, the CFPB has monitored loan servicers, lenders and complaints from student borrowers and brought enforcement actions when it discovered wrongdoing. For example, the CFPB in 2015 returned $480 million to allegedly defrauded students of Corinthian Colleges.

In 2017, the CFPB brought a lawsuit against one of the nation's largest student loan servicers, Navient. The bureau said Navient ""created obstacles to repayment by providing bad information, processing payments incorrectly, and failing to act when borrowers complained. Through shortcuts and deception, the company also illegally cheated many struggling borrowers out of their rights to lower repayments, which caused them to pay much more than they had to for their loans."" That lawsuit is ongoing.

Navient disputes the allegations in the CFPB lawsuit and other suits brought by state regulators. ""The allegations made in the claims are unfounded, and we are vigorously defending our record in court,"" a Navient spokesman says.

But since Richard Cordray, the bureau's Obama-era director, stepped down in November 2017, consumer advocates have been worried that the Trump-appointed interim director, Mick Mulvaney, and now the permanent director, Kraninger, have backed away from protecting student borrowers.

But in her letter, Kraninger said the consumer protection bureau takes that job seriously.

""As with all industries subject to the Bureau's supervisory or enforcement authority, the Bureau will continue to monitor those subject to its authority — in this case, student lenders and student loan servicers — to ensure they are complying with the law,"" she wrote.

At the same time, Kraninger also explained that the Education Department has created obstacles that are getting in the way of the CFPB doing its job. In addition to the guidance to student loan servicers that is impeding oversight efforts, back in 2017, the Trump administration's Education Department ended information sharing agreements that it had with the CFPB. In her letter, Kraninger said an information-sharing agreement (called a Memorandum of Understanding) is required under law and it is ""a priority"" for the bureau to get a new one in place.

Some advocates say the CFPB should do more than acknowledge such problems in a letter to lawmakers. Frotman, of the Student Borrower Protection Center, says the bureau has broad powers to compel student loan servicing companies to turn over the information it needs about student loans and student borrowers.

""I think just identifying this fact is of little solace to student loan borrowers who desperately need the help of a consumer financial watchdog that is supposed to be independent,"" Frotman says. He says he'd like to see Kraninger more directly demand that the Education Department change its guidance to loan servicers and tell them to cooperate with regulators. The CFPB could also take loan servicers to court to get the information it needs., Frotman says.

In a statement to NPR, the CFPB said: ""The Bureau continues to supervise the student loan market, as well as taking action against those who fail to comply with the law."" And the bureau says it is confident it can resolve the issues to achieve its mission of protecting borrowers.

But for its part the Education Department appears to be defending its stance — that loan servicers not hand over information to the CFPB. The department says in a statement that it takes privacy seriously along with the need to ""protect customers' personal data."" It says requests for information about student loan borrowers should be made to the department.

State regulators also say Education Department impeding oversight

Last month, 21 state attorneys general sent Education Secretary Betsy DeVos a letter calling on her to ""reverse the limitations"" the department has placed on student loan servicing companies sharing information with state law enforcement agencies.

The attorneys general said ""student loan information is vital to our efforts to protect consumers from illegal, unfair, abusive, or deceptive practices by actors in the higher education industry, in which the Department historically has been an important partner. However, the Department's policy reversal impedes states' ability to enforce the law and shields unprincipled industry actors from regulatory enforcement, harming student loan borrowers nationwide.""

The industry group the Student Loan Servicing Alliance told NPR in a statement, ""As contractors of the Department of Education which owns its federal student loan data, federal servicers must follow federal law and ED guidance on disclosure and data sharing.""

Why not just share the information?

It's not clear why the department is blocking state and federal regulators from getting information from servicers to do oversight presumably aimed at protecting the rights of student borrowers.

Jason Delisle, a fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, says there may be a turf war going on here. Even if a particular student loan program has problems, Delisle says the department may feel, ""this is our program and we're designing it the way we want to design it and we're running it the way we want to run it."" And Delisle says if there are problems the department may feel it can sort them out by itself.

Frotman says that's not the issue. He says the Education Department may not like having regulators looking into alleged wrongdoing within the companies managing its loan programs, but ""this isn't about reasonable disagreements, it is about following the law versus obstructing law enforcement."""
"Dispute erupts over whether Brennan, Comey pushed Steele dossier, as DOJ probe into misconduct begins",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is A Lawyer', 'Editor Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dispute-erupts-over-whether-brennan-comey-pushed-steele-dossier-as-doj-probe-into-misconduct-begins,"A high-level dispute over which senior government officials pushed the unverified Steele dossier amid efforts to surveil the Trump campaign has broken out into the open again, after it emerged that Attorney General William Barr appointed a U.S. attorney to examine the origins of the Russia investigation and determine if the FBI and DOJ's actions were ""lawful and appropriate.""

Sources familiar with the records told Fox News that a late-2016 email chain indicated then-FBI Director James Comey told bureau subordinates that then-CIA Director John Brennan insisted the dossier be included in the intelligence community assessment on Russian interference, known as the ICA.

Fox News was told that the email chain – not yet public -- referred to the dossier as ""crown material,"" but it was not clear why this apparent code was used. On Tuesday night, former GOP Rep. Trey Gowdy said on Fox News' ""The Story with Martha MacCallum"" that ""Comey has a better argument than Brennan, based on what I've seen.""

A day earlier, Gowdy told Fox News, ""Whoever is looking into this, tell them to look into emails"" from December 2016 involving Brennan and Comey. Gowdy, who is now a Fox News contributor, said his assessment was based on sensitive Russia records he reviewed as then-chairman of the Republican-led House Oversight Committee.

But in a statement to Fox News, a former CIA official put the blame squarely on Comey.

""Former Director Brennan, along with former [Director of National Intelligence] James Clapper, are the ones who opposed James Comey’s recommendation that the Steele Dossier be included in the intelligence report,"" the official said.

""They opposed this because the dossier was in no way used to develop the ICA,"" the official continued. ""The intelligence analysts didn't include it when they were doing their work because it wasn't corroborated intelligence, therefore it wasn't used and it wasn't included. Brennan and Clapper prevented it from being added into the official assessment. James Comey then decided on his own to brief Trump about the document.""

Fox News has reached out to Comey's legal team twice, and provided the statement from the former CIA official, but did not receive a reply on the record.

In March, Republican Sen. Rand Paul leveled similar allegations on Twitter, citing a ""high-level source"" who said Brennan had ""insisted that the unverified and fake Steele dossier"" be included in the January 2017 ICA.

FOX NEWS EXCLUSIVE: INTERNAL FBI TEXTS SHOW DOJ WARNED FBI OF 'BIAS' IN KEY FISA SOURCE -- BUT FBI PRESSED ON

Clapper previously testified that the dossier was not ultimately used in the ICA. News that Comey had briefed Trump personally on the dossier before the inauguration -- purportedly to warn him of potential blackmail threats -- leaked within days and opened the door for media outlets to publicize the dossier's lurid claims.

Whether the FBI acted appropriately in obtaining the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant to Trump campaign aide Carter Page is now the subject not only of U.S. Attorney John Durham's new probe, but also the ongoing review by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz. U.S. Attorney for Utah John Huber has been conducting his own investigation separately, although details of his progress were unclear.

As one example, in its FISA application, the bureau repeatedly and incorrectly assured the court in a footnote that it ""does not believe"" British ex-spy Christopher Steele was the direct source for a Yahoo News article implicating Page in Russian collusion, and instead asserted that the Yahoo article provided an independent basis to believe Steele.

Steele has told a British court that he briefed multiple news organizations during the fall of 2016 -- including Yahoo News.

Gowdy's remarks echoed Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who told Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" this past weekend that he was pushing to declassify documents that would expose the FBI's poor efforts to corroborate the dossier.



""There's a document that's classified that I'm gonna try to get unclassified that takes the dossier -- all the pages of it -- and it has verification to one side,"" Graham said. ""There really is no verification, other than media reports that were generated by reporters that received the dossier.""

Graham cited a report from The Hill's John Solomon that the FBI was told expressly that Steele, the bureau's confidential informant, had admitted to a State Department contact he was ""keen"" to leak his discredited dossier for purposes of influencing the 2016 election.

Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec’s written account of her meeting with Steele on Oct. 11, 2016, was sent to the FBI prior to the bureau's FISA warrant application to monitor Page, according to records unearthed in a transparency lawsuit by Citizens United.
