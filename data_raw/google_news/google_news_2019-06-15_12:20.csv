Trump thanks Marsha Blackburn for blocking 'blatant political stunt' bill,https://www.foxnews.com,['Brie Stimson'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-thanks-marsha-blackburn-for-blocking-blatant-political-stunt-bill,"President Trump on Friday thanked U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., for blocking a bill that she called a “blatant political stunt.”

The bill, known as the Foreign Influence Reporting in Elections Act, was proposed by U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., and required unanimous consent, the Tennessean of Nashville reported.

TRUMP SAYS HE WOULD 'WANT TO HEAR' DIRT ON 2020 RIVALS FROM FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, SUGGESTS HE WOULDN'T CONTACT FBI

“Thank you Senator @MarshaBlackburn for fighting obstructionist Democrats led by Cryin' Chuck Schumer,” the president tweeted. “Democrats continue to look for a do-over on the Mueller Report and will stop at nothing to distract the American people from the great accomplishments of this Administration!”

The bill was prompted by remarks Trump made during an interview with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos in the Oval Office this week where the president said he would be willing to listen if a foreign government came to his campaign with “dirt” on an opponent.

“I think I'd take it,"" Trump said. ""If I thought there was something wrong, I'd go maybe to the FBI.""

In a ""Fox & Friends"""" interview on Friday, Trump clarified himself, saying he would “of course, report dirt to the FBI.”

""My colleagues on the left tried to rush this legislation through the Senate without giving it a chance for the careful consideration and debate needed to address such an important issue,” Blackburn said in a statement Thursday, according to the Tennessean. “Of course action needs to be taken to protect the integrity of our elections, but let’s do this the right way.""

Russians attempted to offer dirt on Hillary Clinton to the Trump campaign in 2016, the Mueller report found, but nothing came of it."
The internal poll that Donald Trump said didn’t exist was just leaked,https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/the-internal-poll-that-donald-trump-said-didnt-exist-was-just-leaked-1bedd00413f1/,"ABC News on Friday published the results of an internal poll conducted by President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign in March, a survey that Trump himself denied even existed.

The poll found Trump trailing Joe Biden by huge margins in states he carried in 2016, including Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. In Texas, which has voted for Republican presidents by wide margins for the last 43 years, Trump holds just a two point edge against the former vice president.

The existence of the poll and its damning findings were first reported by the New York Times earlier this week. It aligns closely with several independent surveys which have consistently found Trump trailing virtually every Democratic presidential contender in head-to-head matchups, findings which Trump himself has repeatedly denied. He also suggested the very existence of internal polling was a fabrication, and when that was proven to be a lie, instructed his staff to deny the results.

“They were fake polls that were released by somebody that is — it’s ridiculous,” he told the media during a typically meandering press conference on Wednesday. “No, we are winning in every single state that we’ve polled.”

In Florida, the Trump campaign’s internal poll shows him losing to Biden by seven points. In Wisconsin, the margin is 10 points. In Pennsylvania, it’s 16. Trump won all three states in 2016, and desperately needs all of them in order to win reelection in 2020.

“They’re giving out phony polls,” Trump insisted on Wednesday. “These are polls that we have, that nobody saw. We do very little polling because I’m not a huge believer in polling…But we have some internal polling — very little — and it’s unbelievably strong. The strongest I’ve ever been is exactly today.”

Brad Parscale, Trump’s campaign manager, confirmed the authenticity of the internal poll obtained by ABC News while simultaneously arguing that the numbers in that poll are outdated.

“These leaked numbers are ancient, in campaign terms, from months-old polling that began in March before two major events had occurred: the release of the summary of the Mueller report exonerating the President, and the beginning of the Democrat candidates defining themselves with their far-left policy message,” said Parscale in a statement to ABC News.

As the network noted, the poll was still being conducted several days after Mueller’s report first became public. The report also explicitly did not exonerate Trump, but rather outlined as many as 10 instances of criminal obstruction of justice.

Just as his boss instructed, Parscale claimed there is other, more recent internal polling showing Trump doing significantly better in the same 17 states the campaign polled. He declined to share those figures with ABC News.

The leaked internal poll only focused on a hypothetical matchup against Joe Biden, who is currently leading the field of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. But recent independent polling suggests that Trump would fair only marginally better against a number of other Democratic contenders.

He trailed Bernie Sanders (by 9%), Kamala Harris (by 8%), Elizabeth Warren (by 7%), Pete Buttigieg (by 5%), and Cory Booker (by 5%) in the recent survey by Quinnipiac University."
Trump’s plan to repaint Air Force One has some Democrats fuming,https://www.foxnews.com,['Dom Calicchio'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-plan-to-repaint-air-force-one-has-some-democrats-fuming,"President Trump’s plan to give Air Force One a bolder, more updated, “more American” look has some Democrats angrier than a traveler who just missed a flight.

On Thursday, the president revealed mockups of a proposed new design for the presidential jet, showing a new red-white-and-blue color scheme that features a darker blue base color instead of the lighter “sky blue” that has been used on the plane since the Kennedy administration.

In approving the plan, Trump reportedly said he wanted the plane to look “more American,” rather than be painted in a “Jackie Kennedy color.”

TRUMP UNVEILS NEW RED, WHITE AND BLUE AIR FORCE ONE PAINT JOB

“I think it’s going to look much better, actually,” Trump said Friday morning on Fox & Friends. “I like the concept of red, white and blue.

“The baby blue doesn’t fit with us,” Trump added.

The proposed redesign comes as part of a contract with Boeing to build two new Air Force One jets to replace the current models, which are more than 30 years old. Trump reached a deal with Boeing to buy the jets for $3.9 billion – after negotiating a $1.4 billion reduction from the original estimate.

But one day earlier, a Connecticut Democrat introduced an amendment to a Pentagon spending plan that calls for congressional approval for spending on “interior, paint and fixtures.”

The Democrat-controlled House Armed Services Committee adopted Rep. Joe Courtney’s amendment on a 31-26 vote that went along party lines, the Hartford Courant reported.

Courtney told the newspaper why he introduced the amendment.

“Additional paint can add weight to the plane, additional fixtures inside the plane can also add cost and delays to the delivery of the plane,” Courtney said.

But the Democrat insisted he had no intention of blocking the president’s plan.

“We are not handcuffing the Air Force and Boeing,” he said. There is some flexibility.”

Another Democrat, Rep. John Garamendi of California, told the newspaper that the U.S. should be careful before changing the appearance of a plane that he said is symbolic of American leadership around the globe.

“The Air Force One plane is iconic,” Garamendi told the Courant. “It is known throughout the world. It has been the representation of the United States, the power of the president.”

Committee Chairman Adam Smith, D-Wash., noted that because the new planes aren’t scheduled to be delivered until 2024, the amendment shouldn’t be interpreted as a slight directed toward the president.

“This president is not going to fly on these planes,” Smith said, according to Military Times.

But to some Republicans on the committee, the Democrats’ explanations sounded more like an effort to simply obstruct the president.

“They want to impede the president at every turn,” Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Va., told the Courant.

The broader spending bill still requires passage from both the House and Senate, as well as the president’s signature, before any new planes will be ordered, the Times reported.

"As Trump Accuses Iran, He Has One Problem: His Own Credibility",https://www.nytimes.com,['Peter Baker'],06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/14/us/politics/trump-iran-credibility.html,"“The problem is twofold for them,” said John E. McLaughlin, a deputy C.I.A. director during the Iraq war. “One is people will always rightly question intelligence because it’s not an exact science. But the most important problem for them is their own credibility and contradictions.”

The task is all the more formidable for Mr. Trump, who himself has assailed the reliability of America’s intelligence agencies and even the intelligence chiefs he appointed, suggesting they could not be believed when their conclusions have not fit his worldview.

At one point shortly before taking the oath of office, he compared intelligence agencies to Nazi Germany and ever since has cast doubt on their findings about Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. This year, he repudiated his intelligence chiefs for their assessments of issues like Iran, declaring that “they are wrong” and “should go back to school.” And just this week, he rebuked the C.I.A. for using a brother of North Korea’s Kim Jong-un as an informant, saying, “I wouldn’t let that happen under my auspices.”

All of that can raise questions when international tension flares up, like the explosion of the two oil tankers on Thursday, a provocation that fueled anxiety about the world’s most important oil shipping route and the prospect of escalation into military conflict. When Mr. Trump told Fox News on Friday that “Iran did do it,” he was asking his country to accept his word.

“Trump’s credibility is about as solid as a snake oil salesman,” said Jen Psaki, who was the White House communications director and top State Department spokeswoman under Mr. Obama. “That may work for selling his particular brand to his political base, but during serious times, it leaves him without a wealth of good will and trust from the public that what he is saying is true even on an issue as serious as Iran’s complicity in the tanker explosions.”"
Sean Hannity: Sources say DOJ inspector general resolved 'hang up' on first Carter Page FISA application,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-15-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/sean-hannity-sources-say-doj-inspector-general-resolved-hang-up-on-first-carter-page-fisa-application,"Fox News host Sean Hannity said the Justice Department inspector general's investigation into alleged surveillance abuses may have hit a snag examining the first Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant against one-time Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

During his evening show on Thursday, Hannity explained how Inspector General Michael Horowitz worked around the issue, which was related to British ex-spy Christopher Steele and his dossier, and may have already submitted his report to the attorney general.

""From my understanding, my sources, is inspector general Horowitz is probably likely done,"" Hannity said, adding, ""I’ve had some people saying, suggesting strongly they believe that the attorney general already has the inspector general's report.""

He was interviewing the Hill's John Solomon and credited memos obtained by conservative group Citizens United through open-records litigation and first reported by Solomon with aiding the watchdog investigation reach a breakthrough.

The memos showed Steele met with Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec on Oct. 11, 2016 and admitted he was encouraged by his client to get his research out before the 2016 election, signaling a possible political motivation. The timing of the meeting is notable, as it was 10 days before the FBI used Steele's unverified dossier to obtain the original warrant to wiretap Page.

""Now there was apparently, originally a hang up on only one of the FISA applications. Surprisingly that being the first,"" Hannity said. ""But according to my sources, your reporting about Kathleen Kavalec's confirmation and warning and admonition to the FBI prior to the first FISA application put that to bed in light of also the closed-door testimony of Bruce Ohr that everybody was warned,"" he added, referring to Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, who acted as an unofficial back channel between the Steele and the FBI.

Steele's dossier, which was funded by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign, contained salacious and unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia. It was used by the FBI to obtain the authority to wiretap Page, an American who had just left the Trump campaign and had suspicious connections to the Russians. The first warrant application was submitted in October 2016, after which there were three renewals at three-month intervals, including in January, April, and June 2017.

Hannity's reporting follows Joe diGenova, a former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, saying last month that Horowitz's team determined the three FISA warrant extensions against Page were illegally obtained.

Although Attorney General William Barr said he anticipated Horowitz’s investigation to be complete by early June, Solomon said his own sources and Rep. Mark Meadows, have made it clear that the FISA investigation will take longer than expected to wrap up, particularly after Steele offered himself up for an interview with the inspector general.

""Not a long time, a short while,"" Solomon said, adding that he thinks the American people will see the report sometime in the summer."
Justice Dept. Backs Mnuchin’s Refusal to Release Trump’s Tax Returns,https://www.nytimes.com,['Alan Rappeport'],06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/14/us/politics/trump-tax-returns-justice-department.html,"WASHINGTON — The Justice Department on Friday backed a decision by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to defy a request from Congress for President Trump’s tax returns on the basis that it lacked “legitimate legislative purpose.”

The department issued a 33-page memo, dated Thursday, that came as House Democrats were preparing a lawsuit as the next step in their effort to gain access to Mr. Trump’s returns. Mr. Mnuchin defied requests made in April and May by the House Ways and Means Committee and refused to comply with a subpoena, setting up a legal battle between the two branches of government.

House Democrats are trying to obtain six years of Mr. Trump’s personal and business tax returns using an obscure provision of the tax code that allows congressional tax-writing committees to get the returns of any taxpayer.

The memo, written by Steven A. Engel, the head of the Office of Legal Counsel, argued that House Democrats, led by Representative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, made the request for political purposes with the intention of releasing Mr. Trump’s tax returns. It cast doubt about the formal rationale that the committee used for the request, which Democrats said was for the purpose of examining how the Internal Revenue Service audits presidential tax returns."
DOJ edges closer to T-Mobile-Sprint approval,https://www.cnet.com,['Marguerite Reardon'],06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.cnet.com/news/doj-edges-closer-to-t-mobile-sprint-approval/,"Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

The US Justice Department is getting close to approving T-Mobile's $26 billion merger with Sprint if the companies agree to sell multiple assets to help create a new wireless carrier, according to The New York Times. The paper reports that three unnamed sources close to the DOJ have said the agency could approve the deal as soon as next week, so long as a new nationwide phone carrier can be created to ensure sufficient competition in the wireless market.

T-Mobile and Sprint have already struck a deal with the Federal Communications Commission to sell off Sprint's prepaid brand Boost Mobile in exchange for the agency's blessing. The FCC and the DOJ must each sign off on the deal. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has already said he'd support the merger if the companies agreed to sell Boost and if they make other commitments, such as meeting build-out requirements for 5G wireless service. In addition to the Boost sale, the DOJ is also asking T-Mobile and Sprint to divest wireless spectrum, according to the Times.

Reports that the DOJ wanted the companies to sell off assets to create a new carrier first circulated last month. But the Times report suggests a deal is imminent.

Such an agreement could weaken the case for the states suing to stop the merger. A group of 10 state attorneys general, led by New York Attorney General Letitia James and California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, filed their suit earlier this week, saying that the merged company would ""deprive consumers of the benefits of competition and drive up prices for cellphone services.""

The lawsuit to block the merger is set for a pretrial hearing next week in federal court in New York City, according to Reuters.

T-Mobile declined to comment on the report. Sprint, the DOJ and the New York Attorney General's office weren't immediately available for comment."
"A President With a Taste for Planes Has a Plan for Air Force One: Paint It Red, White and Blue",https://www.nytimes.com,['Katie Rogers'],06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/14/us/politics/trump-air-force-one-paint-job.html,"WASHINGTON — As someone who fancies himself an aviation expert — he did once have his own airline, after all — President Trump indulged his interest this week in a number of ways.

He ordered an F-35, a (very loud) $80 million fighter jet, to fly over the White House during the visit of the president of Poland. He stood on the South Lawn watching the landing of a pricey new VH-92 helicopter, which is referred to as Marine One when he is aboard. And in maybe his most satisfying moments of the week, he detailed his plans to give Air Force One — perhaps the most famous plane in the world — a new paint job.

“I like the concept of red, white and blue,” Mr. Trump said in an interview with “Fox & Friends” on Friday, describing the makeover he envisions for the plane, a specially fitted Boeing 747 with iconic cyan and white coloring. “The baby blue doesn’t fit with us.”

For other presidents, all of this would have amounted to a few too many aeronautical activities to stuff into a week packed with mounting aggression toward Iran, tariff threats and a head-of-state visit. Not for this one. In fact, it’s hard not to think that this sort of sky-toy-packed schedule is closer to what Mr. Trump, with his peculiar fixation with all things aviation, originally envisioned for his presidency."

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced an Obama-era plan to put Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill in 2020 would now be delayed until at least 2027, calling it a security issue. But a new report is saying that a preliminary design of the bill was almost finished before Obama left office. Mnuchin responded by calling those accusations “completely erroneous.”

DOJ establishes transnational elder fraud strike force,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-establishes-transnational-elder-fraud-strike-force/story?id=63714167,"The Justice Department has formed a transnational elder fraud strike force to combat the growing international problem of elder fraud.

Elder fraud is when fraudsters prey on older victims who can be more susceptible to when approached to give money to sympathetic causes and in some cases threatened and harassed by criminals.

Recently, three Peruvian men pleaded guilty to extorting older Americans through a Spanish-speaking call center.

""For example, one such script directed the callers to falsely and fraudulently claim to be government attorneys and to state that the victims faced lawsuits and fines for not paying for or receiving packages. Other scripts included similar stories where the callers falsely claimed to be attorneys with courts or credit bureaus in the United States,"" the indictment in the case reads.

The effort, announced Thursday, combines six U.S. Attorney's offices from California to Georgia, FBI Special Agents and the Postal Inspection Agency -- all in an effort to combat elder fraud in the United States.

“Fraud against the elderly is on the rise,"" Attorney General William Barr said in a release. “One of the most significant and pernicious causes for this increase is foreign-based fraud schemes. The new Transnational Elder Fraud Strike Force will bring together the expertise and resources of our prosecutors, federal and international law enforcement partners, and other government agencies to better target, investigate, and prosecute criminals abroad who prey on our elderly at home. The Department of Justice is committed to ending the victimization of elders across the country.”

Earlier this year, the attorney general announced the largest ever crackdown on elder fraud in country by highlighting the case of William Webster, the former FBI director who was targeted for months by scammers abroad.

“It doesn’t matter where these criminals live. We’re committed to keeping our elderly citizens safe, whether they’re being targeted door-to-door, over the phone, or online, from thousands of miles away,” FBI Director Christopher Wray said.

Jose Luis Magana/AP, FILE

Barr has said that he had been a victim of one of the scams in 2017. While he was not attorney general at the time, fraudsters asked for money using his old official portrait.

He highlighted his story at a roundtable event in March.

""People took my official Justice Department portrait from 1992, so I was looking pretty good in 1992 and they put it up on Facebook and other online sites and I was telling people as the former attorney general I had access to special federal grant money and if they just sent some money I could tell them how to get some major grants,"" he explained.

Barr said he had the pages taken down, but from time to time even leading up to when he was nominated to be attorney general he would get calls from people around the country which he called ""heartbreaking."""

Dems' Selective Outrage Over Foreign-Sourced Oppo Research on Full Display,https://www.realclearpolitics.com,[],06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/06/14/dems_selective_outrage_over_foreign-sourced_oppo_research_on_full_display_140562.html,"The selective outrage from the left surrounding foreign interference in U.S. elections is beyond hypocritical -- it's absurd.

Take President Trump's interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos on Wednesday. When asked by the TV anchor if his campaign would accept information from foreign nations, including China or Russia, that could damage his opponent, Trump said, ""I think you might want to listen. There's nothing wrong with listening."" He continued. ""If somebody called from a country, Norway -- 'We have information on your opponent' -- oh, I think I'd want to hear it.""

The president downplayed the notion that such a gesture amounts to foreign election interference.

The response, however, from scores of Democratic presidential hopefuls was piercing. They excoriated Trump's comments, with several candidates amplifying calls for impeachment. Frontrunner Joe Biden tweeted: ""President Trump is once again welcoming foreign interference in our elections. This isn't about politics. It is a threat to our national security. An American President should not seek their aid and abet those who seek to undermine democracy.""

Sen. Bernie Sanders said, ""We have a president who thinks he is above the law. The House should immediately begin impeachment inquiries.""

California Sen. Kamala Harris said on MSNBC, ""what we hear tonight is that he is yet again open to the idea of working with foreign governments to undermine the integrity of our election system. It's outrageous.""

Sen. Elizabeth Warren also reiterated calls for impeachment while other 2020 Democratic candidates including Beto O'Rourke tweeted, ""When the President of the United States openly welcomes foreign help to win an election, he threatens the very core of our democracy. If we are to secure justice and ensure this never happens again, we must impeach him.""

Many other prominent Democrats, lawmakers and biased media made similar utterances.

Of course, there was no such outrage from the left or the #FakeNewsMedia when the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign paid millions for Russian disinformation against Donald Trump. Former British spy Christopher Steele procured the propaganda from foreign ""informants"" for what's known as the ""dirty dossier."" That foreign-sourced opposition research wasn't just obtained and listened to by Team Hillary. It was used by former FBI Director James Comey, Democratic lawmakers and the highest echelons of the justice system to derail the Trump campaign and current administration via counterintelligence investigations and other underhanded tactics.

Two sets of rules? Clearly.

Then there's former President Barack Obama's Department of Justice, which used the foreign-sourced dossier -- despite it being unverified and salacious, per James Comey -- to obtain FISA warrants to spy on the Trump campaign and launch several ongoing investigations into the administration.

Democrats aren't bothered by any of that, as they only care about foreign meddling in our democracy and elections when it hurts them politically. When it benefits them, however, they look the other way.

Then there's the high-paid DNC contractor Alexandra Chalupa who, as Politico reported in 2017, sought dirt on Paul Manafort from the Ukrainian government to harm Trump's 2016 campaign -- and help Hillary Clinton. Politico said: ""Ukrainian government officials tried to help Hillary Clinton and undermine Trump by publicly questioning his fitness for office. They also disseminated documents implicating a top Trump aide ... And they helped Clinton's allies research damaging information on Trump and his advisors.""

Any outrage from the left? Not even a smidgen.

Then there's Trump nemesis Rep. Adam Schiff, a ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee who is laser-focused on investigating the president and removing him from office -- at any cost. Democrats' feathers weren't ruffled in 2017 when Schiff solicited dirt on Trump from Russians, who offered nude photos of Trump.

But when Trump says he'd listen to information from a foreign government -- not necessarily act on it -- or inform the FBI, the left goes ballistic, illustrating how morally bankrupt and ethically challenged Democrats have become in their unbridled quest for power.

Trump administration to move USDA researchers to Kansas City area,https://www.politico.com,"['Liz Crampton', 'Ryan Mccrimmon', 'Burgess Everett', 'Nancy Cook', 'John Bresnahan']",06-13-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/13/usda-kansas-city-area-1529072,"Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue argued in a statement that the Kansas City region will better position the department to attract people “with training and interest in agriculture” because the area is a proven “hub for all things agriculture."" | Alex Wroblewski/Getty Images Agriculture Trump administration to move USDA researchers to Kansas City area

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue has chosen to relocate two of USDA's research agencies to the Kansas City area, the final step in a process to reshape the department's research wing that has drawn objections from several congressional Democrats.

Perdue said in announcing the new home of the Economic Research Service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture on Thursday that the move would bring the research agencies closer to major farming regions, improve customer service and save taxpayer dollars — about $20 million per year over 15 years.

Story Continued Below

But many employees at ERS, who conduct research into areas such as climate change, nutrition and the farm economy, and at NIFA, who arrange federal grants for agricultural research institutions, have told POLITICO they believe the move is rooted in politics.

Several current and former staffers at the agencies have warned that relocation could disrupt operations and drive out experienced researchers. The proposal has already sparked a brain-drain of veteran economists from ERS, and some lawmakers and ERS staff allege relocation is a back-door attempt to shrink the agency and clamp down on research that doesn't align with the Trump administration's priorities.

Democrats have questioned the relocation plan and blamed USDA for not providing detailed justification since the concept was first unveiled in August 2018. The House USDA-FDA appropriations bill for fiscal 2020 would prohibit USDA from moving forward with the relocation, but the measure is unlikely to become law before the move is carried out.

Perdue argued in a statement that the Kansas City region will better position the department to attract people “with training and interest in agriculture” because the area is a proven “hub for all things agriculture” and already boasts a “significant presence” of USDA and federal government employees, in addition to the Kansas City Federal Reserve.

“The Kansas City Region will allow ERS and NIFA to increase efficiencies and effectiveness and bring important resources and manpower closer to all of our customers,” he said.

“This agriculture talent pool, in addition to multiple land-grant and research universities within driving distance, provides access to a stable labor force for the future,” he added.

The department has not settled on a location in the Kansas City area. The General Services Administration will release a proposal early next month, allowing interested parties to submit bids, Perdue said Thursday afternoon. In the meantime, employees will be relocated as soon as mid-July and will be placed in temporary office space that fits up to 200 workers.

USDA has argued since the relocation proposal was first announced that the high cost of living in the Washington, D.C., area hinders recruitment and retention at the agencies.

The anticipated savings of $20 million per year will allow more funding to be directed to research initiatives to address “critical needs like rural prosperity and agricultural competitiveness,” Perdue said, adding that the savings will also enable the agencies to maintain service and staffing “even in the face of tightening budgets.”

State and local governments sweetened the deal by offering a package of $26 million in incentives, the secretary said. Perdue refused to reveal what the Kansas City region offered to attract USDA.

""These are proprietary discussions from our perspective,"" he told reporters. ""If the local community chooses to disclose those, they can do so at their will.""

The total savings of the projected move — about $300 million over 15 years — is based on a cost-benefit analysis of relocation to the Kansas City area that the department released on Thursday. Several congressional Democrats have called on the department for months to release such a study.

In announcing the pick, USDA backed down on another element of its plan that had drawn pushback from lawmakers — moving ERS within the department's organizational structure so that it would fall under the Office of the Chief Economist. The agency will remain under the department's Research, Education, and Economics mission area.

""While we believe there is considerable synergies and benefits to a realignment, after hearing feedback from stakeholders and members of Congress, USDA will not move forward with the realignment plans,"" the release said.

Critics of that part of the plan, including several current and former ERS employees interviewed by POLITICO, argued the realignment could subject the agency's research to political influence by positioning it closer to the Office of the Secretary. The House fiscal 2020 spending bill for USDA had sought to block the realignment.

The Kansas City region was selected from a pool of more than 130 locations that had expressed interest in hosting the agencies. Now, the move is on a fast-track timeline.

Agency employees are expected to receive relocation letters on Thursday. Employees anticipate being given 30 days to decide whether to move, according to union leaders.

Employees of both agencies have voted to unionize in the face of the relocation, and leaders at the American Federation of Government Employees, which is representing the workers, have vowed to press for a delay.

Union representatives said employees were not given advance notice of the announcement — something Perdue said on Wednesday he would do. They learned of the site selection through media reports, according to union leaders.

During a town hall briefing following the announcement, nearly 20 employees silently protested Perdue by turning their backs to him while he addressed staff.

""Secretary Perdue continually speaks of transparency and communicating to employees but has failed on both fronts,"" said Kevin Hunt, acting vice president of the ERS union. ""The announcement today highlights his disregard for the rights and wellbeing of employees.""

In a letter to employees shared with POLITICO, Perdue said he knows ""that this time, especially for the employees directly affected, has been personally and professionally challenging. I am grateful for your patience and your continued hard work.""

The secretary said he wrote the letter because he wanted employees to hear the news from him first. But a notice containing the letter was not distributed among staff until 10:37 a.m. Thursday — well after media reports were published and Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.) had hailed the decision in a press release.

The four U.S. senators from Missouri and Kansas — all Republicans — issued a joint statement praising Perdue for selecting the Kansas City area. One of them, Senate Agriculture Chairman Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), said that ""agricultural research is a critical function of USDA, and I am committed to ensuring we continue to support and strengthen the research mission that our U.S. producers rely on.""

But some Democrats from other parts of the country were critical of the decision.

Reps. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio) and Del. Stacey Plaskett (D-V.I.), who lead House Agriculture subcommittees that have jurisdiction over the USDA research agencies, criticized Thursday's announcement and said the entire process has lacked transparency.

Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-Maine), a House Appropriations Committee member who co-sponsored a bill to stop the move, said she was ""appalled"" with USDA's decision to force ""staffers to uproot their lives to Kansas City in order to keep their livelihoods.""

She also noted that a USDA Inspector General investigation ""examining the viability of this relocation is not complete.""

USDA paid the consulting firm Ernst & Young $340,000 to run the site selection process.

DOJ lost track of foreign nationals with criminal histories after bringing them to US: audit,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Alex Pappas', 'Alex Pappas Is A Politics Reporter At Foxnews.Com.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-lost-track-of-foreign-nationals-with-criminal-histories-brought-into-us-for-court-cases-audit,"The Justice Department has lost track of numerous foreign nationals who were brought into the United States to help with law enforcement cases and may have criminal histories of their own – something that could be putting the public ""at risk,"" the DOJ’s inspector general warned in a newly released audit.

The report released by the Office of the Inspector General identified 62 foreign nationals brought into the U.S. who have since ""absconded"" from Justice Department oversight. The audit called this “especially problematic” because “these individuals often have criminal histories or are involved with criminal organizations.”

“Therefore, there are risks associated with these individuals remaining in the United States unsupervised and the public can be at risk,” the report said.

HOUSE DEMS VOTE TO HOLD BARR, ROSS IN CONTEMPT, AS TRUMP ASSERTS EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE OVER CENSUS

The report warned that others could be missing too: As of August 2018, the Department of Homeland Security was still seeking current information for 665 people identified as DOJ-sponsored foreign nationals as part of its own tracking.

A Justice Department spokesman, Alexei Woltornist, told Fox News: “The Department of Justice is aware of the findings of the IG report and is working on remedying the problem.”

​

In total, the department has sponsored thousands of foreign nationals under this program -- 5,496 between 2015 and 2017, spanning the Obama and Trump administrations, the audit said. Agencies involved include the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, United States Attorney’s Offices and the United States Marshals Service.

According to the audit, these foreign nationals – who may otherwise be considered inadmissible to the United States because of their criminal history – are brought to the U.S. to help support investigations and prosecutions.

“Significant risks accompany the sponsoring of foreign nationals to support law enforcement investigations because these individuals may be associated with criminal activity and motivated only by the ability to reside in the United States,” the report said.

But the report said the inspector general’s office does not “have assurance” that the DOJ and its law enforcement agencies have “adequately executed their monitoring responsibilities to mitigate the risks involved with sponsoring foreign nationals and to fulfill their obligation to protect the public.”

While the Justice Department and the other agencies have performed monitoring activities, problems have been identified in the process.

The report said some of the sponsored foreign nationals are not actually subject to “any routine monitoring requirements” because of “weaknesses in the monitoring policies at some DOJ components.”

And the report noted 18 instances where the Justice Department did not renew the sponsorship or termination of a foreign national in a timely matter, leading to those individuals falling into “an illegal status while residing in the United States.”

“We are concerned that the monitoring policies and practices currently executed by the DOJ components that sponsor foreign nationals do not adequately mitigate the risks associated with bringing individuals into the United States who may have criminal backgrounds or involvement in disreputable activities, or who may be associated with such individuals,” the report said.

In a response included in the audit, the Justice Department defended the use of the so-called S visa program, which allows long-term stays for foreign nationals in the United States when their presence could assist in combatting criminal and terrorism activities.

“The S visa program has played a crucial role in the successful prosecution or investigation of significant criminal or terrorist organization enterprises, and has enabled federal investigators and prosecutors to bring to justice dangerous criminals,” Jennifer A.H. Hodge, the acting deputy assistant attorney general, wrote in an April letter.

There have been risk concerns involving other federal government programs designed to expedite the admittance of foreign nationals into the United States. Then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in 2017 revamped a program that puts foreign-born recruits on a fast-track to U.S. citizenship in exchange for military service as doctors, nurses and language experts after Defense Department investigators discovered “potential security risks” with the Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest program."
Justice Dept. Seeks to Question C.I.A. in Its Own Russia Investigation,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Julian E. Barnes', 'Katie Benner', 'Adam Goldman', 'Michael S. Schmidt']",06-12-2019,2019,6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/us/politics/russia-investigation-cia.html,"WASHINGTON — Justice Department officials intend to interview senior C.I.A. officers as they review the Russia investigation, according to people briefed on the matter, indicating they are focused partly on the intelligence agencies’ most explosive conclusion about the 2016 election: that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia intervened to benefit Donald J. Trump.

The interview plans are the latest sign the Justice Department will take a critical look at the C.I.A.’s work on Russia’s election interference. Investigators want to talk with at least one senior counterintelligence official and a senior C.I.A. analyst, the people said. Both officials were involved in the agency’s work on understanding the Russian campaign to sabotage the election in 2016.

While the Justice Department review is not a criminal inquiry, it has provoked anxiety in the ranks of the C.I.A., according to former officials. Senior agency officials have questioned why the C.I.A.’s analytical work should be subjected to a federal prosecutor’s scrutiny. Attorney General William P. Barr, who is overseeing the review, assigned the United States attorney in Connecticut, John H. Durham, to conduct it.

[The attorney general is reviewing the Russia inquiry. Here’s what we know about its origins.]

The Justice Department has not submitted formal written requests to talk to the C.I.A. officers, but law enforcement officials have told intelligence officials that Mr. Durham will seek the interviews, two of the people said. Communications officers for both the C.I.A. and the Justice Department declined to comment."
Federal watchdog opens inquiry into EPA handling of Minnesota PolyMet pollution permit,http://www.startribune.com,"['Jennifer Bjorhus', 'Jennifer.Bjorhus Startribune.Com']",,,,http://www.startribune.com/federal-watchdog-opens-inquiry-into-how-the-epa-handled-minnesota-pollution-permit/511333592/,"The Environmental Protection Agency Office of Inspector General has opened an investigation into the agency’s handling of a crucial pollution permit for Minnesota’s first copper mine after a retired agency attorney raised questions about the episode.

The investigation was announced June 12, the same day the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released documents related to the water quality permit requested by several parties, including the Minnesota-based advocacy group WaterLegacy and U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn.

Release of the documents shows that written comments by EPA regulators, challenging key parts of the permit, were never formally submitted for the public record and were never sent to officials at the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA). Instead, the comments were read to MPCA staff over the telephone last spring, a practice that the retired EPA attorney described as “bizarre.”

The Star Tribune has also requested the documents, but the EPA hasn’t yet provided them.

The documents relate to a crucial state water quality permit issued to PolyMet Mining, a Toronto-based minerals firm that wants to build a $1 billion copper-nickel mine in northeast Minnesota. After years of review, PolyMet cleared most of Minnesota’s regulatory hurdles in late 2018. The newly released documents include seven pages of detailed criticism by EPA Region 5 staff in Chicago, which oversees Minnesota’s enforcement of federal pollution laws, outlining deficiencies in the permit that the MPCA issued to PolyMet last December. It is the first time the EPA’s official comments on the permit, which will regulate dangerous pollutants in effluent from the mine, have been made public.

The written comments note that the permit would “authorize discharges that would exceed Minnesota’s federally-approved human health and/or aquatic life water quality standards for mercury, copper, arsenic, cadmium, and zinc.” In one core passage, they said the permit lacked specific effluent limits, known as WQBELs, which are numeric limits on how much of a pollutant can be in the effluent pumped out a discharge pipe.

A retired EPA attorney from Boston, Jeffry Fowley, learned of the phoned-in comments from confidential sources in January and filed a complaint with the EPA’s Office of Inspector General.

The sources told him EPA leadership in Region 5 were suppressing staff comments. Fowley has called it “serious improper conduct” and “unethical.”

“In all my years of experience, I have never heard of a situation where EPA personnel have read written comments on a permit to state personnel over the phone,” Fowley said in a sworn declaration filed with the Minnesota Court of Appeals.

MPCA officials told the Star Tribune there was nothing unusual about their exchange with the EPA, and that they did incorporate many of the agency’s concerns into the final permit for PolyMet.

In an interview Friday, Fowley said he and Minnesota’s Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, which also filed a complaint, were pleased with the Inspector General’s decision.

“I think the fact that they’re taking up this one indicates they think there is something seriously wrong,” Fowley said.

McCollum, who waged a monthslong public battle to obtain the EPA documents, had only brief comments. In a statement to the Star Tribune she said her role was to “ensure transparency.”

“Now the courts and the public have the information needed to determine whether the final permit adequately addresses the many concerns raised by the EPA,” said McCollum, who leads a House subcommittee that oversees the EPA.

Differing documents

In a letter to McCollum with the documents, EPA Acting Associate Administrator Joseph Brazauskas said it’s common practice for complex permitting decisions to be handled verbally rather than in writing.

“EPA Region 5 Administrator Cathy Stepp has specifically encouraged EPA staff to work more collaboratively and speak ‘face-to-face’ with state officials,” Brazauskas wrote.

Brazauskas also said the EPA hadn’t planned to release the written comments because it considers them private under the “deliberative process privilege” exemption to the federal Freedom of Information Act.

However, he said, the agency had given the comments voluntarily to the Fond du Lac tribe, so it could no longer withhold them.

The EPA’s written comments were also sent to WaterLegacy, an advocacy group in St. Paul, and the Fond du Lac Band, whose land is downstream from PolyMet’s proposed mine near Babbitt.

The parties together have challenged the water permit over its lack of stringent, federally enforceable limits on nearly two dozen pollutants regulated by the Clean Water Act.

The documents received by WaterLegacy, however, differ slightly from those sent to McCollum; they include a separate letter from Kevin Pierard, a senior official in the EPA’s Chicago office, to Jeff Udd, the MPCA’s director of metallic mining, which underscores the fact that the EPA’s concerns were conveyed by phone, not in writing.

Many sections in this copy of the written comments were underlined and numbered; across the top Pierard wrote by hand that the underlined sections were “conveyed verbally” to the MPCA on April 5, 2018, and lists the MPCA staff on the phone call.

The phone conversation occurred several weeks after the public comment period on PolyMet’s draft permit closed in March 2018, meaning that the EPA-written criticisms were never entered in the public record.

The EPA’s criticisms should have been public from the start, said WaterLegacy lawyer Paula Maccabee.

“They are some of the strongest comments I’ve ever seen,” she said. “It’s like one of the most important documents in this entire case, and it’s not in the administrative record.”

‘Rigorous’ review

MPCA officials and former MPCA Commissioner John Linc Stine said nothing improper occurred in the episode and that the final PolyMet permit did reflect some of the EPA comments.

In an interview, Stine said nothing requires the EPA to submit written comments during the public comment period. He also said that the concerns the EPA read over the telephone were similar to comments other stakeholders had filed previously.

“It didn’t strike me that there was anything that was plowing new ground,” he said.

In a statement, MPCA spokesman Darin Broton described the PolyMet permit process as “rigorous” and said the agency discussed technical issues with the EPA frequently.

“Based on those conversations, as well as other comments received … during the official comment period, the MPCA made substantive changes to the draft permit, including additional limits for arsenic, cobalt, lead, nickel and mercury; and new language was added that clearly states that the discharge must not violate water quality standards,” Broton said. “That’s why the EPA did not object to the MPCA’s final permit.”

Several MPCA staff members have filed sworn statements as part of an appeal filed by WaterLegacy, making similar arguments.

Former MPCA staff attorney Michael Schmidt said in his declaration that no one tried to conceal anything. They noted how quickly the EPA staff read the comments on the phone that day, making note-taking difficult.

In an interview Friday, Fowley, the former EPA attorney, accused both the EPA and the MPCA of a “coverup.” He said confidential sources told him that the EPA’s Region 5 staff were so frustrated about their unheeded concerns that they filed a memo Dec. 18 — just before the permit was issued — documenting the issues that had not been resolved. Fowley said the memo contained sufficient information to justify an EPA objection to the permit.

Fowley characterized PolyMet’s permit as weak, and “an end run around the … requirements of the Clean Water Act.”

“It’s kind of like if instead of speed limits they told people not to drive too fast,” Fowley said. “I’ve never seen this situation before.”"
Trump says he will install former ICE chief Tom Homan as ‘border czar’,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Nick Miroff', 'Reporter Covering Immigration Enforcement', 'The Department Of Homeland Security', 'June At Pm', 'Nick Miroff Covers Immigration Enforcement', 'The Department Of Homeland Security For The Washington Post.

(John Bazemore/AP)

President Trump said Friday that he is planning to install former immigration enforcement chief and Fox News analyst Tom Homan as a “border czar” at the White House, making him the latest hard-liner to land a senior Homeland Security role after praising the president on cable television.

“He’ll be a border czar,” Trump told the hosts of “Fox & Friends” via telephone Friday morning. “He’ll be reporting directly to me. He’ll probably be working out of the White House but spending a lot of time at the border. . . . He’s going to be very much involved with the border.”

[How Mexico talked Trump out of tariff threat with immigration crackdown pact]

The plan to appoint Homan had not been finalized and remained under discussion, but Trump announced it anyway, according to a White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the president’s behavior.

Homan ran U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement as acting director during the first 18 months of the Trump administration, but he retired in frustration when the White House failed to move his nomination toward Senate confirmation.

President Trump had a 50-minute phone interview with “Fox & Friends” on June 14, covering a wide range of topics including Iran, Sarah Sanders’s replacement and foreign election intelligence. (REF:guildb/The Washington Post)

Homan then became a Fox News analyst on immigration and border issues, where he was known for his blunt speaking style and enthusiasm for the president’s attempts to impose harsher border measures.

The former police officer and Border Patrol agent was known at ICE for intense devotion and an emotional style, especially when pushing back at allegations that ICE agents acted too aggressively and against calls for the agency to be eliminated. Homan frequently applauded Trump for “taking the shackles” off ICE by giving agents latitude to make a broader range of immigration arrests in the U.S. interior.

Homan did not respond to requests for comment Friday.

Left unclear in the president’s surprise announcement was an explanation of what duties Homan will assume, and how he will work with Kevin McAleenan, the acting director of the Department of Homeland Security, the agency tasked with securing the border. The DHS did not respond to requests for comment.

[Kevin McAleenan is taking over DHS. Will be he ‘tough’ enough for Trump?]

Making Homan a “czar” could diminish McAleenan’s role. ­McAleenan played a central part in securing a deal last week that requires the Mexican government to dramatically increase its efforts to stop U.S.-bound migrants as they travel northward.

Vice President Pence and other U.S. officials told the Mexican government during those talks that immigration is the most important issue of Trump’s presidency. Trump has been repeatedly frustrated by his inability to secure funding for a barrier along the border with Mexico and by the unchecked rise in the number of migrants being taken into custody by U.S. agents.

U.S. authorities detained more than 144,000 border-crossers last month, as arrests reached the highest level in 13 years. Several of the Trump administration’s policies aimed at slowing migration have been blocked in federal court or have not succeeded.

Trump and his close aides also have been pushing for tougher approaches to immigration, and top officials have called for an overarching post in the White House to help coordinate efforts across agencies.

Before she was ousted in April from her position as DHS secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen had advocated for a senior White House figure who could spearhead the administration’s response to the crisis at the southern border. Such a job was envisioned as helping to increase communication and collaboration between the Departments of Defense, Justice, Homeland Security, and Health and Human Services.

Those who worked with Homan, who is known more as a hard-charging beat cop than an interagency traffic manager, said he does not seem to be a natural fit for such an organizational role. He has told former colleagues that he did not wish to rejoin government and preferred to stay retired.

But since the shake-up at the DHS, the president has been filling the department’s senior ranks with former officials who appear frequently on television praising his border policies.

Mark Morgan, a former FBI and Border Patrol official, was named acting director of ICE after a number of tough-talking television appearances. And on Monday, Ken Cuccinelli II, the conservative activist and former attorney general of Virginia who also became a border pundit, took over as the interim head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

Asked by the Fox hosts whether he will nominate McAleenan to be permanent DHS secretary, Trump said McAleenan was “doing a nice job” but “we’re going to see.”

“I’ve got to get used to him,” Trump said. “Because it’s very important to me, the border. We need strong people at the border, and if people aren’t strong, they’re not going to do a good job.”

Under Trump, the focus of the DHS secretary role has shifted from counterterrorism to immigration enforcement, but the job still includes oversight of the U.S. Coast Guard, the Transportation Security Administration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Secret Service and other non-immigration-related agencies.

Just before she was ousted from the DHS, Nielsen irritated Trump by traveling to Europe for counterterrorism meetings; he insisted that the migrant crisis required her at the U.S.-Mexico border.

During meetings at the White House with Polish President ­Andrzej Duda on Wednesday, Trump chided McAleenan on the same basis.

“Why aren’t you on the Mexican border today?” Trump asked him during a portion of the bilateral meeting open to the media. “What are you doing here with Poland?”

“Well, we need to partner with our friends in Europe as well, Mr. President,” McAleenan said.

McAleenan has repeatedly warned that the migrant crisis has pushed U.S. agents and infrastructure beyond “the breaking point,” leading to dangerous overcrowding of Border Patrol holding cells with families and children, many of them ill.

He has called for a “whole of government” response, and this week he urged lawmakers to approve the White House’s $4.5 billion request for supplemental funding. At least $3 billion of that would pay for the care of the growing number of underage migrants who arrive without parents and often spend months in U.S. shelters while the government identifies and screens relatives who can assume custody.

Some of those children will be housed at military bases on an emergency basis, and U.S. soldiers are also providing support to free up more Border Patrol agents for front-line duty.

Trump on whether Shanahan will become permanent defense secretary: 'We are going to see',https://www.politico.com,['Politico Staff'],06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/14/trump-shanahan-defense-secretary-nomination-1364993,"“We are going to see, Pat Shanahan has been recommended for the job,"" President Donald Trump said of his proposed nominee for defense secretary. | Alex Wong/Getty Images White House Trump on whether Shanahan will become permanent defense secretary: 'We are going to see'

President Donald Trump on Friday offered a tepid assessment about Pat Shanahan's chances of becoming the permanent defense secretary, saying, “We are going to see.”

Trump on Tuesday indicated Shanahan’s nomination was a done deal, even though it’s been more than a month since the White House announced on May 9 that Trump intended to nominate Shanahan for the job, and he has yet to make it official.

""Well, I have, defense secretary. I have. It's done. I put it out,"" Trump said on Tuesday when asked why he hasn't made the nomination official. ""Yeah, it's done from the standpoint of the nomination. Wait, wait, wait, Pat Shanahan was nominated two weeks ago. Yeah, no, I put it out, I put it out officially. Now he has to go through the process. He's now going through.""

On Friday, Trump offered a less-than-full-throated endorsement when asked during an interview with “Fox & Friends"" if Shanahan will get the formal nomination.

“He's been recommended, now he has to be approved by Congress. We are going to see,” Trump said, adding again, “We are going to see, Pat Shanahan has been recommended for the job.”

NBC News reported on Tuesday that Trump appeared to be having second thoughts about Shanahan and that the president had asked several people about alternative candidates, citing four people familiar with the conversations.

Shanahan, a former Boeing executive, took over as acting defense secretary on Jan. 1, after former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned over Trump's decision to pull all U.S. troops from Syria.

""Based upon his outstanding service to the Country and his demonstrated ability to lead, President Trump intends to nominate Patrick M. Shanahan to be the Secretary of Defense,"" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders tweeted on May 9. ""Acting Secretary Shanahan has proven over the last several months that he is beyond qualified to lead the Department of Defense, and he will continue to do an excellent job.""

"Kamala Harris: If elected, my DOJ would have 'no choice' but to prosecute Trump",https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-if-president-doj-would-have-no-choice-but-to-charge-trump,"2020 candidate Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., has issued a stunning warning to President Trump that seems to echo controversial recent comments from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, saying her Justice Department would likely charge him with obstruction of justice if she wins the White House.

Harris, in a newly released interview, said she believes the only reason former Special Counsel Robert Mueller did not recommend prosecuting Trump was because of the Justice Department’s policy against indicting a sitting president. Once out of office, Trump would be subject to charges -- and Harris was emphatic in saying the DOJ should pursue them.

DEMS' LONG GAME? PELOSI RAISES PROSPECT OF PROSECUTING TRUMP ONCE HE LEAVES OFFICE

“I believe that they would have no choice and that they should, yes,” Harris said on this week’s NPR Politics Podcast.

The former California attorney general and San Francisco district attorney cited the importance of holding everyone accountable for their actions.

“I mean look, people might, you know, question why I became a prosecutor,” Harris said. “Well, I’ll tell you one of the reasons – I believe there should be accountability. Everyone should be held accountable, and the president is not above the law.”

Harris is not the first high-profile Democrat to suggest that not only should Congress pursue impeachment against Trump -- but he should face criminal charges once out of office.

Pelosi, D-Calif., reportedly told colleagues last week: “I don’t want to see him impeached, I want to see him in prison.”

REP. WARREN DAVIDSON: PELOSI MENTIONED TRUMP IMPRISONMENT TO ‘KEEP IMPEACHMENT ZEALOTS IN LINE’

Trump reacted to this by calling Pelosi ""a nasty, vindictive, horrible person.""

Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., however, had no problem with Pelosi's remarks.

""I don’t have any difficulty with those words,"" Cicilline told ""Fox News Sunday,"" comparing them to when then-candidate Trump inspired ""lock her up"" chants when he ran against Hillary Clinton. A 2018 New York Times report also said that Trump looked into prosecuting Clinton, as well as former FBI Director James Comey.

Joining the chorus of Democrats hinting that prosecuting Trump might be appropriate was another 2020 candidate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. The progressive Democrat said recently that Trump would be ""carried out in handcuffs"" if he were anyone else, though she did not openly advocate charges against him.

Asked Wednesday if he would advocate Trump's prosecution, fellow candidate Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., said “no one is above the law” while leaving the question open.

“To be very blunt, if my attorney general at the Department of Justice finds that there is probable cause that a law has been broken by anyone, I expect him to hold the alleged offender accountable no matter who they are or what title they’ve held in the past,” he said. “I’m not going to be a president that undermines the independence of the DOJ or the judiciary in a way that I’ve seen this administration do.”

U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith dismissed Friday the lawsuit following a resolution reached in mediation sessions that included Quicken Chairman Dan Gilbert before he had a stroke on May 25. The deal resolves the matter without findings against Quicken Loans, the largest Federal Housing Administration lender in the United States.

""Dan Gilbert has been involved in this all the way, in the entire seven-year process,"" Quicken Vice Chairman Bill Emerson told The Detroit News, adding: ""He was 100 percent fully involved"" in mediation sessions on May 8 and May 9 that culminated in an agreement on May 9 — more than two weeks before his stroke.

Quicken's agreement differs from settlements made between major FHA lenders and the Justice Department following the bursting of the housing bubble and the financial meltdown that followed. Typically, those have totaled billions of dollars and often required the lenders to acknowledge they failed to comply with quality and reporting requirements.

""The small dollar amount and the fact that the government did not insist on an admission of wrongdoing gives the impression that the investigators did not feel they had a strong case of systematic wrongdoing of the sort they found at Wells Fargo,"" Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross Business School, said in an email.

Gilbert and his lawyers previously said the company would fight the accusations and not settle. Emerson denied the agreement resolving the suit is a settlement, instead calling it a ""resolution.""

Quicken, now the country's No. 1 mortgage lender, made loans in error totaling $25.5 million, he said, which is 0.02% of the company's $108 billion in FHA loans it has originated since 2007. To encourage homeownership, when a debtor defaults on an FHA loan, the government pays, not the lender. Quicken previously had said it would correct any wrongs.

""We didn't settle; we did exactly what we said we would do,"" Emerson said. ""We looked at some of the loans, and there were a few we made a mistake on. We made them whole. That's all we did.

""We did exactly what we said we would do, that we would fight this case. There was no case. There is no case. There are no findings of wrongdoing of us at all. There were a handful of loans that we made a mistake on. That’s exactly what happened.""

Emerson did not detail what or how many mistakes had been made. When the Justice Department filed the lawsuit, Quicken CEO Jay Farner said in 2015 that the online lender had found issues with only ""eight or nine"" loans.

Progress on the case, for the most part, had been behind closed doors and in documents under seal. The agreement comes two months after Goldsmith ordered that the parties undergo mediation with Gerald Rosen, the retired chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.

Rosen proposed the ""fair path"" agreement following several meetings and two full days of mediation that the parties ultimately accepted, he said in a statement. The parties differed as to how the settlement amount should be attributed and calculated.

Ultimately, the proposed $25.5 million would go to making the government whole for any losses it may have incurred, together with $7 million in interest on that amount.

""The parties worked diligently, and in good faith, to mediate for a solution to resolve their differences and to put the dispute behind them,"" Rosen wrote. ""This resolution is in the interests not only of the parties, but of the home-buying public. All parties fully understand the important role the FHA program plays in helping middle-class Americans access home financing, and this resolution allows the parties to move ahead together with that mission and to ensure their future relationship.""

The deal also sends a message to all lenders that they will be held to the same regulatory requirements as traditional banks, said Lysa Davis. She has worked on settlement agreements for financial institutions in the past and is the founder of Community-Up, an anti-poverty nonprofit in Detroit.

""The fact that Quicken settled for millions and not billions is not that unusual,"" Davis said in an email. ""This is their first settlement agreement of this type. Quicken, like any other company, has learned from its mistakes over the years; I think it's a great organization — they make solid investments in urban cities across the country creating economic development opportunities and strengthening neighborhoods.""

The case was dismissed with prejudice — meaning it cannot be reinstated, according to an order filed Friday. The resolution comes under the leadership of the Housing and Urban Development Department, which oversees the FHA, within the administration of President Donald Trump. The government originally filed the lawsuit in 2015, the seventh year of the Obama administration.

The agreement will allow for the continuation of ""safe and sustainable mortgage financing to qualified, creditworthy borrowers,"" Amy Thompson, the Housing and Urban Development Department's secretary for public affairs, said in a statement.

“FHA relies on its partnerships with lenders, such as Quicken Loans, to advance home buying opportunities for Americans, and we look forward to continuing our relationship with Quicken Loans,"" she wrote.

The government alleged that Quicken had a culture of bending the rules and gave “speed bonuses” to underwriters. Federal lawyers contended the mortgage company failed to disclose the problems with the FHA-insured loans that cost the federal government millions of dollars when they went bad.

Quicken said it has represented the FHA’s “gold standard” for underwriters. Court documents filed by Quicken attorneys say the company could prove it had proper underwriting practices, complied with program and contractual requirements, and did not make false claims. It denied the existence of speed bonuses.

The lawsuit has not soured Quicken Loans from offering FHA loans or led it to make any significant operations changes, Emerson said.

""We have continued exactly to do the same thing as always,"" he said. ""It's always been our job to do the right thing to underwrite loans correctly. That's what we've done and continue to do.""

The Justice Department and the Department of Housing and Urban Development Office of Inspector General began investigating Quicken under the False Claims Act. The investigation originally encompassed about 246,000 FHA loans Quicken had originated from mid-2007 through Dec. 31, 2011. The number of loans in question, however, had been reduced to 109 as of April.

The federal government’s lawsuit alleged Quicken employees regularly spoke of “fudging” a borrower’s income to get approval for FHA insurance. It included emails from company officials discussing the “bastard income” of borrowers. One email described how a customer was approved for a loan after he stopped paying other bills and his credit score dropped 100 points.

Rosen has presided at previous mediation sessions with the parties. He was the court's chief justice from 2009 to 2015, after President George H. W. Bush nominated him to the federal court bench in 1989. Rosen oversaw a number of high-profile cases during his tenure, and he led the mediation team that helped Detroit exit its record-setting municipal bankruptcy in just 18 months. After retiring from the bench, he opened a Detroit branch of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services.

Since the financial crisis, the Justice Department has reached settlements totaling billions of dollars with several major lenders, including the Bank of America Corp., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co., over poorly underwritten FHA loans. Pontiac-based United Shore Financial Services LLC in 2016 paid $48 million to resolve allegations of knowingly originating and underwriting loans that did not meet FHA requirements.

Quicken also had sued the government preemptively in 2015 after Justice Department officials requested ""nine-figure"" settlements, Gilbert has said. The company claimed the Justice Department unfairly targeted major lenders after the 2008 mortgage crisis. Goldsmith dismissed the suit. The Justice Department originally filed its case in Washington, D.C., but Quicken won its motion to move it to Detroit.

The chemicals are often referred to as “forever chemicals” because of the time it takes them to break down.

The EPA has said it will decide by the end of the year whether it will set drinking water standards for PFAS.

The amendment, filed as part of the annual defense policy bill, would put pressure on the agency to speed up that timeline, adopting a drinking water standard within two years for two specific types of PFAS.

The EPA said it would not comment on pending legislation.

The compromise measure from a bipartisan group of senators on the Environment and Public Works Committee provides an early glimpse at how Congress plans to address the issue this year.

The EPA currently recommends no more than 70 parts per trillion of PFAS in drinking water. But many states, tired of waiting for standards from the federal government, have passed their own drinking water standards that are tougher than what the EPA currently recommends.

Attempting to force the EPA to set a standard would likely meet resistance from some Republicans.

At a recent House hearing on PFAS, several GOP lawmakers said they were wary of getting ahead of agency scientists and recommending a specific response.

But other Republicans argue the agency has been delaying action while the problem spreads.

Thursday’s Senate amendment would also force the EPA to consider barring new uses of PFAS and require PFAS manufacturers to share data on their production.

The amendment does not, however, make Superfund cleanup money available for places where PFAS has contaminated drinking water.

Carper has been pushing to designate PFAS a hazardous substance under the Superfund law as a way to force responsible parties to clean up the chemical.

In some cases, that party would be the military itself, which has identified more than 400 military sites with suspected PFAS contamination."
The treasury secretary’s wife finally explained what was going on in this bizarre photo,https://www.businessinsider.com,['Nicole Einbinder'],06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.businessinsider.com/louise-linton-finally-explains-bizarre-instagram-photo-2019-6,"Louise Linton, the wife of Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, spoke out in a recent interview about the secret behind one of her most controversial photos: the 2017 viral image featuring her husband and her posing with newly-printed dollar bills at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. Many took to social media to compare the couple to James Bond villains, and Linton was questioned over her black leather gloves.

Linton told Maer Roshan from Los Angeles Magazine that she simply wore the gloves because she was cold inside the building.

""You've heard of 'cold cash' right? They call it that because it's kept freezing cold there. I was warned ahead of time so I came prepared,"" Linton said. ""But I certainly didn't expect to be in any photographs. My mistake was when Steven said, 'Hey, honey, this is cool; step in this picture.' I didn't say, 'Wait a minute, let me take my gloves off, Steven. I look like a crazy person. I look like Darth Vader!'""

The glove pic isn't the only time Linton's gotten in trouble for an image. She was widely condemned for a 2017 Instagram post in which she can be seen disembarking from an Air Force jet in Kentucky in what looks like a fashion magazine cover, complete with hashtags for the expensive brands she wore — like Tom Ford, Hermés, and Valentino.

Many weren't happy with Linton's photo, with one commenter writing ""glad we could pay for your little getaway. #deplorable."" In response, Linton blasted the woman's lifestyle and boasted of her own wealth. She later apologized for her post and, in the interview with Roshan, said she tried to direct message the woman to apologize, but she was already blocked on the platform.

""Look, that was bad. I've really absorbed the criticism and learned a lot of humility and have grown from all of it. Shit happens; mistakes happen. People grow and move on,"" Linton told journalist Maer Roshan. ""That whole Instagram thing happened because I got some bad advice. My advisers at the time were telling me to be glamorous and fashionable. I was looking at actresses I admired, and they all tagged their clothes. I should have realized that what's good for movie stars doesn't work for a Cabinet secretary's wife.""

""It sucks being perceived as a person that you're not; it sucks being hated,"" she told Roshan. ""I made some rookie mistakes.""

Roshan used the opportunity to probe Linton on more serious subject matter, such as her thoughts on the Trump administration's anti-LGBTQ policies and a recent proposal that would expand hunting and fishing at wildlife refuges.

Linton acknowledged that while ""all of my besties are gay,"" she is ""caught between a rock and a hard place with these questions. Either I can express my beliefs and be at odds with my husband and his boss and get in trouble that way, or I can decline to comment and be in hot water with everyone else. Sucks either way.""

When pushed about the relaxed hunting ban, Linton, a vocal animal lover, said ""I was very upset. Not furious, just very upset, just upset, sad. Sad."" She also said she feels uncomfortable around Donald Trump Jr., who supports big-game hunting.

""Look, when I went to D.C. I thought I would have an incredible platform to help animals,"" Linton told Roshan. ""But I realized very quickly that there were huge limits to what I could do. Cabinet spouses are not allowed to lobby other Cabinet members. It's against the rules."""
Feds gone wild: DOJ's stunning inability to prosecute its own bad actors,https://thehill.com,[],06-13-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/opinion/criminal-justice/448383-feds-gone-wild-dojs-stunning-inability-to-prosecute-its-own-bad,"One was caught red-handed engaged in nepotism. Another, a lawyer no less, admitted to shoplifting at a Marine barracks store. A third leaked sealed court information to the news media. And a fourth engaged in fraud by turning a government garage into a personal repair shop.

Four cases, all solved in the past month, with suspects who cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars and significant breaches of public trust.

But these weren’t your everyday perps.

All were U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) employees who are supposed to catch other criminals while working for the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and U.S. attorneys’ offices. Instead, they broke the law or violated the rules. And all managed to escape prosecution, despite their proven transgressions.

ADVERTISEMENT

Recent Justice Department disciplinary files tell an undeniable story.

Under the leadership of Inspector General (IG) Michael Horowitz, DOJ’s internal watchdog is doing an outstanding job of policing bad conduct inside America’s premier law enforcement agency.

And DOJ is doing a poor job of punishing its own.

In cases closed in the past month, more than a half-dozen FBI, DEA, U.S. attorney and U.S. marshal officials were allowed to retire, do volunteer work, or keep their jobs as they escaped criminal charges that everyday Americans probably would not.

In most instances, the decisions were made by federal prosecutors who work with the very figures impacted by or committing the bad conduct. In local law enforcement, that go-easy phenomenon is known as the “thin blue line.”

Spokespersons for the Justice Department and FBI did not respond to a request for comment.

The troubling pattern of weak punishment emerges as DOJ heads into one of its most ambitious internal affairs probes in recent history. Attorney General William Barr, Horowitz and special U.S. Attorney John Durham are investigating whether the FBI and other intelligence agencies violated the law with the Trump-Russia investigation.

Even before the recent spate of closed inspector general investigations, questions surfaced about DOJ’s willingness to punish its own. That’s because fired FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe Andrew George McCabeMcCabe says it's 'absolutely' time to launch impeachment inquiry into Trump McCabe says it's 'absolutely' time to launch impeachment inquiry into Trump Feds gone wild: DOJ's stunning inability to prosecute its own bad actors MORE was recommended for prosecution more than 15 months ago for lying about news leaks, and so far has faced no criminal charges.

To put that into perspective, it took special counsel Robert Mueller just a few months to bring charges against multiple figures associated with President Trump’s campaign accused of lying or other process crimes.

It’s still possible that McCabe could face prosecution. But the recent spate of fresh wrongdoing inside DOJ doesn’t portray a compelling pattern of enforcement or punishment.

Take, for example, the DEA executive who just this week was found to have engaged in nepotism by routing hundreds of thousands of dollars to contractor jobs for his son and retired colleagues or friends.

Horowitz spared few words for the egregious scheme. “The senior DEA official wasted and misused hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxpayer funds and engaged in misconduct when he took actions to get his son and former colleagues contractor positions and that his actions constituted misconduct in violation of federal ethics regulations, the DEA Standards of Conduct, and the Federal Acquisition Regulation,” he reported this week.

The official also engaged in a “lack of candor,” the investigative file showed.

Despite the established wrongdoing, criminal prosecution “was declined” and “the senior DEA official retired from his position.” In short, he kept his retirement benefits.

Likewise, the inspector general had harsh words for the FBI special agent in charge (SAC) who used the bureau’s official garage to perform repairs on his and other employees’ personal vehicles, calling it, among other things, a “dereliction of supervisory responsibility,” and a misuse of tax dollars for “private gain.”

“The SAC took advantage of the SAC’s official position for personal benefit by arranging to have the SAC’s personal vehicle repaired by an FBI employee in exchange for compensation, in violation of federal regulations regarding standards of conduct for federal employees and FBI policy,” the investigative file concluded. “The OIG also found that the SAC was derelict in the SAC’s supervisory responsibilities by allowing use of the FBI repair facility to conduct repairs and maintenance on personal vehicles belonging to FBI employees.”

And then there was the FBI lawyer who got caught in an embarrassing criminal act at the Marine Corps barracks (MCB) commissary in Quantico, Va.

“The FBI attorney admitted to placing numerous cosmetic items, valued at $257.99 and belonging to the MCB Quantico Exchange, into her purse without the intention to pay for them and did not pay for them before leaving the store. The FBI attorney further admitted that between February 2016 and her arrest in February 2018 she had shoplifted at the MCB Quantico Exchange one to two additional times, and at other private retailers in the area on two to three occasions,” the inspector general reported on May 14.

The investigation concluded her conduct violated federal criminal law and FBI policy regarding unprofessional conduct. But here was the outcome: “Criminal prosecution was deferred pending the FBI attorney’s completion of 125 hours of community service, after which all charges were dismissed.”

A few weeks of community service, and she was still in her job at the time the IG issued its report.

Two weeks ago, another DOJ official, an assistant U.S. attorney, escaped charges even after it was documented that he violated federal laws by possessing, transporting and consuming marijuana-laced edibles that he claimed he needed to treat back pain. He also was caught lying about his wrongdoing and 'fessed up only when his estranged wife threatened him during their divorce proceedings. Nonetheless, “criminal prosecution by federal and state authorities was declined,” the IG reported May 30.

One of the internal affairs cases that stunned members of Congress this month directly grew out of the interwoven Hillary Clinton email and Russia collusion investigations in 2016, during then-FBI Director James Comey James Brien ComeyUnder Trump, our democracy is for sale Sarah Sanders to leave White House Sarah Sanders to leave White House MORE’s tenure.

The IG concluded that an FBI deputy assistant director engaged in multiple improper news media leaks while those investigations were ongoing, including one that violated a sealed court order, and accepted an improper gratuity from the news media. But prosecution was declined, yet again. FBI officials say they are considering discipline against the supervisor.

Records I reviewed indicate that more misconduct eerily similar to that already uncovered is being investigated. For example, the IG fraud unit opened a case in March and began interviewing whistleblowers about a new contract fraud matter inside the DEA, emails show.

It used to be that those who were entrusted to enforce the law were held to the highest standards.

Today, however, there is a troubling pattern of officers being held to a lower standard inside a department where critics fear there is a dual system of justice.

USDA Corn Yield Estimate Still Too High,https://www.agweb.com,[],,,,https://www.agweb.com/article/usda-corn-yield-estimate-still-too-high/,"It’s been a long, arduous planting season for farmers across the U.S. Many farmers are wondering what this will mean for yields, ending stocks and, consequentially, corn prices.

“I think the drop-dead week will be this week for planting,” Michael Cordonnier of Soybean and Corn Advisor, Inc., told AgriTalk Host Chip Flory. “If you plant your corn at this time in June you’ve probably got at least a 20% yield drag. If you go at the end of this week that could go up to 30% or 40%. This is very serious, and we won’t know the yields until later in summer.”

So far, the market isn’t reflecting the tough season.

“USDA’s World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimate (WASDE) showed us down 3 million corn acres with a harvest estimate of 91.7%,” Cordonnier says. “I think a 90% harvest for grain is optimistic—it might be in the 88% to 89% and then lower yield. When you combine all these things, you’re going to get a much lower production number.”

Cordonnier estimates farmers will finish with 86 million corn acres planted, with 90% harvested for grain and a 165 bu./acre yield—putting total production at 12.8 million bu. His yield estimate is just slightly lower than USDA’s 166 bu./acre estimate.

With lower production and unchanged demand, the market could provide positive pricing opportunities.

“The burdensome corn carryout could be gone by the end of the summer,” Cordonnier says. “We’re going to need price rationing to ration the demand.”

South American farmers will be closely watching U.S. corn production, he notes.

“This is a corn story, primarily, in the U.S.,” says Cordonnier. “So, I do think corn acres will go up in South America, especially Argentina. They’re going to take out some soybeans to put in more corn.”"
Newly released documents detail EPA's concerns over PolyMet,https://www.mprnews.org,"['Dan Kraker', 'Jim Mone', 'Ap Photo']",06-13-2019,2019,6,https://www.mprnews.org/story/2019/06/13/newly-released-documents-detail-epas-concerns-over-polymet,"A former iron ore processing plant near Hoyt Lakes, Minn., that would become part of a proposed PolyMet copper-nickel mine is seen in February 2016.

Updated 7:57 p.m. | Posted 5:23 p.m.

Staff scientists at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had serious concerns last year that the PolyMet copper-nickel mine might not be able to meet state and federal water quality standards under the Clean Water Act, according to documents released Thursday.

The scientists' comments were written more than a year ago in response to a key permit the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency issued to PolyMet Mining. But they were never submitted. Instead, they were released this week as part of a Freedom of Information Act case an environmental group filed against the EPA in an attempt to make them public.

In court filings, the St. Paul-based advocacy group WaterLegacy questioned whether the EPA comments had been suppressed as the MPCA developed the final water quality permit it eventually granted to PolyMet last December.

WaterLegacy and Minnesota U.S. Rep. Betty McCollum applauded the documents' release.

""All Minnesotans have a stake in ensuring that the quality of our water is protected, and the public has a right to access essential information about whether a project of this magnitude meets the spirit and letter of the law,"" said McCollum, who, as chair of a House subcommittee with jurisdiction over the EPA, had also pushed for the release of the documents.

The water quality permit and an air quality permit were the last two state approvals PolyMet needed to move ahead with its NorthMet copper-nickel mining project, which would be located near Babbitt and Hoyt Lakes in northeastern Minnesota. It capped a review and permitting process for the controversial development — which is set to become Minnesota's first copper-nickel mine — that's stretched well beyond a decade.

Copper-nickel mining poses potentially more severe environmental risks than the state's long-established iron ore mining industry because the process used to extract the minerals from the sulfide rock can result in acid mine drainage, which can leach heavy metals and other pollutants into nearby surface and groundwater.

That's why the project's water quality permit, which sets limits on the pollutants that can be released into groundwater, lakes and streams, was so heavily scrutinized when the MPCA announced it had been issued in December.

Four environmental groups — the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy, the Center for Biological Diversity, Friends of the Boundary Waters Wilderness and WaterLegacy — along with the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, quickly challenged the water quality permit at the Minnesota Court of Appeals. They argued the permit failed to comply with federal and state standards.

Soon after, in January, retired EPA attorney Jeffry Fowley filed a complaint with the agency's inspector general, alleging that administrators in the EPA's Chicago office had ""suppressed"" staff comments that were critical of the PolyMet water quality permit.

But in a brief filed Wednesday in the appeals court case, the MPCA acknowledged it had come to an agreement with the EPA ""that EPA would provide oral [rather than written] comments to MPCA."" The documents EPA released Thursday show that EPA staff had significant concerns about the permit. EPA scientists were especially concerned that it failed to include specific limits on the amount of pollutants the mine can discharge, — known as ""water quality-based effluent limits"" — which are put in place to ensure that projects can meet federal environmental standards.

EPA staff had prepared detailed written comments, but the agency never filed an objection to the MPCA's permit plan. And instead of publicly submitting those comments in writing during the public comment period part of the permitting process, staffers at both agencies agreed that the EPA would read them to MPCA staffers over the phone.

As a result, the EPA scientists' concerns did not become a part of the administrative record, which appeals courts rule on — and which the Minnesota Court of Appeals will rely on in its review of the MPCA's decision to issue the permit.

Fowley, the former EPA attorney who filed the inspector general complaint, said in a filing included in WaterLegacy's appeals court case that it was ""highly unusual"" that written comments on such a complex permit would not be part of the public record. ""In all of my years of experience,"" he wrote, ""I have never heard of a situation where EPA personnel have read written comments on a permit to state personnel over the phone.""

Fowley worked for 37 years at the EPA office in Boston and specialized in Clean Water Act compliance. ""The apparent purpose for only receiving such comments over the phone would be to obtain them off the record — to avoid the MPCA receiving written comments which it would then need to be put into the administrative record for the permit and to which it would then need to respond,"" he wrote.

Fowley told the court last week that the EPA's inspector general had begun a preliminary inquiry into his complaint. The office announced Wednesday it was beginning an audit of the water quality permit issued by the MPCA ""to determine whether the EPA followed appropriate Clean Water Act ... regulations to review the PolyMet permit approved by Minnesota and issued in 2018.""

But in interviews and court filings, the MPCA argues it engaged in a robust back-and-forth with EPA staffers for several years in developing PolyMet's water quality permit. Officials insist it was neither out of the ordinary — nor unethical — for the agency to receive comments from federal regulators over the phone.

""I think it was the most effective way for [EPA] to make the comments and for us to react to them,"" said John Linc Stine, who was MPCA commissioner while the PolyMet water quality permit was being developed.

""There had been years and years of document exchange and comment back and forth,"" he continued. ""So, it seemed right to me to handle it by phone calls, so that we could get the permit finally resolved and drafted.""

Linc Stine said it wasn't unusual for the EPA not to submit written comments. MPCA officials said the agency's staffers engaged in regular conference calls with their EPA counterparts, and continually incorporated their feedback into the draft water quality permit.

But Paula Maccabee, WaterLegacy's attorney and advocacy director, said it's commonplace for the EPA to provide written comments on major industrial permits in Minnesota — and for the MPCA to provide detailed responses.

MPCA spokesperson Darin Broton emphasized that staffers from the state and federal agencies had frequent conversations during the permitting process. Those conversations, he said, resulted in substantive changes to the permit along the way, including additional limits on the discharge of several pollutants — including arsenic, lead and mercury — and ""language prohibiting violation of water quality standards.""

Broton said that's why the EPA did not object to the MPCA's final permit when the state agency sent it to them for final review.

But the Fond du Lac Band and environmental groups that brought the appeals court case argue that the limits included in the permit are weak and unenforceable, and aren't the same kind of restrictions that EPA scientists asked for in the comment letter released Thursday.

They also argue the permit, as written, could actually act as a shield to protect the company from potential liability.

""Without those effluent limits, Minnesota water quality won't be protected from the state's first proposed toxic sulfide mine,"" Water Legacy's Maccabee said.

WaterLegacy's appeals court case is one of several lawsuits making its way through state and federal courts seeking to overturn various approvals PolyMet received to build its mine.

Barring a successful legal challenge, PolyMet is clear to begin construction of the state's first-ever copper-nickel mine, once it raises the estimated $1 billion it will cost to build it. Later this month, PolyMet is expected to conclude a stock offering to clear debt from its balance sheet, which could result in the Swiss mining and commodities giant Glencore winning majority ownership of the company."
House Democrats question DHS over using facial recognition tech on US citizens,https://thehill.com,[],06-14-2019,2019,6,https://thehill.com/policy/technology/448577-over-20-house-dems-press-dhs-over-using-facial-recognition-tech-on-us,"Over 20 House Democrats in a letter on Friday pressed the Department of Homeland Security over Border Patrol's use of facial recognition technology on U.S. citizens in airports, arguing the rapidly expanding program has not been enabled by any congressional mandate.

Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which has been rolling out the face-scanning program in a growing number of airports across the U.S., has argued that it is operating under a congressional mandate and executive order from the president. But those orders ask CBP to roll out a biometrics program for ""foreign nationals,"" not U.S. citizens, the lawmakers say.

ADVERTISEMENT

""We write to express concerns about reports that the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is using facial recognition technology to scan American citizens under the Biometric Exit Program,"" the group of progressive lawmakers, who sit on multiple committees, wrote, referring to CBP's facial recognition tech program.

""This is an unprecedented and unauthorized expansion of the agency’s authority,"" they wrote. ""As such, we urge the agency to allow for public input and establish privacy safeguards.""

Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle in recent weeks have dramatically intensified their scrutiny of facial recognition technology, particularly by CBP and the FBI, saying the technology poses privacy and civil rights issues that have not been resolved. At a pair of House Oversight and Reform Committee hearings over the past month, Republicans and Democrats raised concerns that the government has implemented programs around facial recognition tech without any congressional regulation or oversight.

House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings Elijah Eugene CummingsHouse Democrats question DHS over using facial recognition tech on US citizens House Democrats question DHS over using facial recognition tech on US citizens Democrats lash out at Trump's bombshell remarks MORE (D-Md.) said there will be a third hearing on the issue, after which the lawmakers will be compiling potential legislative solutions.

The Democrats in the letter asked acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan to respond to four questions about CBP's facial scanning program. They questioned which laws give CBP the authority to use the technology on American citizens, what efforts CBP has made to provide passengers with the ability to opt out ahead of time, and for more information on the nature of the contracts between CBP, airports and airlines.

CBP's program hit the headlines again after the agency last week confirmed that photos of U.S travelers and license plate images were recently stolen from a database maintained by CBP.

Lawmakers have been demanding answers about the breach, including how the agency is protecting photos of U.S. citizens in its expansive photo database.

DHS this year said it plans to use facial recognition technology on nearly all departing air passengers within the next four years as part of its ""Biometric Entry/Exit"" program, which scans the faces of people coming into and out of the U.S. CBP has said the program is aimed at identifying people flouting laws about who can come into the country, including those overstaying their visas, and airlines have argued that it makes traveling more efficient.

CBP has been implementing its “biometric exit” program for years, expanding to 15 major airports with plans to reach five more.

A CBP spokesperson in a statement to The Hill argued that CBP's program is ""solving a security challenge while adding a convenience for travelers.""

The spokesperson said CBP has processed 19 million travelers using facial recognition technology with a match rate of 97 percent since the program began. Of those millions, CBP said, it has intercepted six ""imposters"" who were denied admission to the United States at airports.

""CBP is committed to protecting the privacy of all travelers and has issued several Privacy Impact Assessments related to Entry/Exit, employed strong technical security safeguards, and has limited the amount of personally identifiable information used in the transaction,"" the spokesperson said.

Currently, CBP says passengers are welcome to decline to participate in the program. But according to the airlines partnering with the agency, very few passengers do so.

DOD unveils plans for contractor cybersecurity standards,https://www.fedscoop.com,['Jackson Barnett'],06-14-2019,2019,6,https://www.fedscoop.com/dod-cmmc-new-supply-chain-and-cybersecurity-rules/,"Written by Jackson Barnett

A Department of Defense official unveiled plans Thursday for contractor cybersecurity standards that are scheduled to be implemented by January 2020.

Katie Arrington, special assistant to the assistant secretary of Defense acquisition for cyber, made the announcement along with a plea for the private sector to work with the government to secure its supply chain at a Professional Services Council conference Thursday. The new standards will have a five-level system, and they will combine guidance currently in place from the National Institute of Standards and Technology with new input from the private sector and academia.

The standards, known as Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification, will be researched and developed in partnership with the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab and Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering Institute. Once in place, third-party private sector companies will audit contractors to ensure compliance. The program also will include an education and training center for cybersecurity.

The level of cybersecurity required by the standards will be indicated on all contract solicitations once implemented.

Defense officials have spoken of the need to develop new contractor cybersecurity standards for more than a year now. Earlier this year, DOD CIO Dana Deasy described how tier-one prime contractors aren’t the big concern.“It’s down when you get to the tier-three and the tier-four” subcontractors.”

“Where the issue breaks down is that as you go down to those various subcontractors, do they understand, [are they] equipped, have the knowledge and the capabilities to defend themselves, and what is it we should be doing more to help them learn how to defend themselves at those tiers?” Deasy said.

Arrington’s announcement was the first look into what to expect when the new standards are implemented. Similarly, in 2017, DOD introduced a regulation that requires all vendors who do business with the department to more safely guard “covered defense information” that is transmitted to or stored in their systems or networks for contracted work.

In addition to speaking about the new rules, Arrington stressed the need for collaboration between public and private sectors to ensure information security.

“It is not a ‘me’ thing, it is a ‘we’ thing,” Arrington said.

The “vast majority” of DOD contractors have ad hoc and inconsistent cybersecurity practices, Arrington said. Cybersecurity breaches and intellectual property theft of DOD data has led to the theft of high-grade weapon systems, such as the F-35.

“We should be infuriated about what has happened to our data,” she said.

Arrington will be embarking on a listening tour across the country to seek input from contractors for the cybersecurity rules. Arrington is a former South Carolina lawmaker and small business owner who contracted with the government — experiences she said will inform her work to help secure military data.

The greatest counterintelligence risk to the U.S. is not theft of government data, but private sector IP, said Joyce Corell, assistant director for supply chain and cyber at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence’s National Counterintelligence and Security Center. Governments, like China’s, and their efforts to steal U.S. IP have taken up the majority of the U.S. counterintelligence apparatus’s work, Corell said in a talk following Arrington’s.

New steps to secure the supply chain are critical to plugging the leaks of data. To do so, Corell pushed for cybersecurity to be baked-in across all parts of the supply chain for government contractors. In the past, Corell has pushed small businesses to increase their cybersecurity to work with the government.

Corell and Arrington both drove the message that cybersecurity is needed at all levels of the supply chain, at all levels of contracting and from the military to civilian agencies.

Supply chain security is “a team sport,” Corell said."
Panel Votes to Hold Barr in Contempt of Congress: What Happens Next,http://fortune.com,"['Chris Strohm', 'Billy House']",06-13-2019,2019,6,http://fortune.com/2019/06/13/contempt-of-congress-what-happens/,"A House panel voted to hold Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt of Congress for withholding documents on plans to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. Earlier Wednesday, President Donald Trump asserted executive privilege over the material.

The Oversight and Reform Committee’s 24-15 vote Wednesday for the civil contempt resolution gives Democratic Chairman Elijah Cummings the option to file a lawsuit to enforce the panel’s subpoenas for the documents.

Republican Mark Meadows of North Carolina warned colleagues their vote was “a significant moment in history” in holding two cabinet-level officials in contempt. Cummings said he didn’t disagree.“Nobody is trying to be harmful to our attorney general. It’s not about him” or the Commerce secretary, said Cummings of Maryland. “It’s about our country.”“The Constitution gives Congress the responsibility and the authority to ensure that the census is working as it was intended,” Cummings said. “We must protect the integrity of the census, and we must stand up for Congress’ authority under the Constitution to conduct meaningful oversight.”The chairman didn’t disclose when he may file a legal action, saying he’ll consult with Democratic leaders on the next steps.Ross, in a statement, called the committee’s action “shameless” and said Democrats “aren’t going to let the facts get in the way of their own concocted stories.”Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said in a statement: “The committee’s attempt to define the Department of Justice’s good-faith cooperation as ‘contempt’ defies logic.”

Response rate

Congressional Democrats are pursuing what they say is evidence that the Trump administration’s bid to include the citizenship question was designed to suppress the response rate to the census of immigrants and non-citizens. That could reduce some states’ number of congressional seats, Electoral College clout and federal funding.

Before the Oversight panel vote, Trump asserted executive privilege over documents concerning plans to add a citizenship question to the census, including the material sought by the Oversight Committee.

“These documents are protected from disclosure by the deliberative process, attorney-client communications, or attorney work product components of executive privilege,” Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd wrote in a letter Wednesday to Cummings. “In addition, the president has made a protective assertion of executive privilege over the remainder of the subpoenaed documents.”

The move was just the latest effort to stymie and frustrate efforts by House Democrats to investigate actions by the Trump administration.

But the Democratic-controlled House is firing back. The chamber voted Tuesday to authorize a lawsuit against Barr in a separate matter, for refusing to give the Judiciary Committee redacted parts of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

The House also approved a speedier process for committee chairmen such as Cummings to file a lawsuit to enforce subpoenas. Under the plan, they would only need to be green-lighted by a panel led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

Ross has denied assertions that the citizenship question was inspired by efforts to suppress census participation by immigrants, including those in the country legally, who may tend to vote for Democrats. The underlying issue is now before the Supreme Court.

Trump told reporters at the White House that he feels strongly the census should ask Americans whether they’re citizens.

“That doesn’t sound so good to me” if the question can’t be included, he said Wednesday during a meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda. “It’s ridiculous, I think it’s totally ridiculous that we would have a census without asking.”

Ross’s role in the 2020 census has come under Democratic scrutiny because he and other Commerce Department officials asserted multiple times that the decision to include the citizenship question stemmed solely from a Justice Department request in December 2017 to aid enforcement of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.

Barr additionally is accused of ordering Justice Department official John Gore to defy a subpoena for his testimony.

The Justice Department said the Oversight Committee abandoned efforts to reach an accommodation by going forward “with an unnecessary and premature contempt vote.”

Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the committee, asked why Democrats don’t want to ask about citizenship even though many people think the question already is included in the census.

“Every person you ask will say, ‘yes we should do that,’” Jordan said. Referring to Democrats, he said, “Why don’t they want to know?”

Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York responded that she wants to know why people like former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach — “with a resume of voter suppression techniques in Kansas” — and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon “have their fingerprints all over the census.”

“I want to know about corruption. That’s what I want to know about — the racism and the very disturbing history that we are seeing here,” she said.

Representative Justin Amash of Ohio was the only Republican who voted to hold Barr and Ross in contempt. Amash, who last month enraged much of his party — and Trump — when he said that the president had engaged in “impeachable conduct” wrote on Twitter: “Fact: Both Democratic and Republican attorneys general are capable of being in contempt of Congress.”

"DHS chief reveals startling stat on asylum seekers who skip hearings, disappear",https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dhs-secretary-reveals-startling-stat-on-asylum-seekers-who-skip-hearings-disappear,"The acting Homeland Security secretary gave lawmakers a glimpse Tuesday into just how many asylum seekers skip their hearings after being released into the United States -- telling a Senate panel that a recent program found 90 percent miss their court dates.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., asked Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan how many asylum seekers coming across the southern border show up for their hearings.

BORDER ARRESTS SKYROCKET IN MAY, AS OFFICIALS DECLARE 'FULL-BLOWN EMERGENCY'

“It depends on demographic, the court, but we see too many cases where people are not showing up,” he said, telling Graham that DHS recently conducted a pilot program with family units.

“Out of those 7,000 cases, 90 received final orders of removal in absentia, 90 percent,” he said.

“90 percent did not show up?” Graham asked.

“Correct, that is a recent sample from families crossing the border,” McAleenan clarified.

McAleenan’s testimony also painted a grim portrait of a border crisis that shows no signs of easing, with Border Patrol overwhelmed and underfunded. The secretary described authorities as hamstrung by laws that limit how long they can keep migrants in custody.

“Currently due to a single district court order, we cannot obtain effective immigration enforcement results for the families arriving at our border -- they cannot be held for longer than 21 days and do not receive rulings from immigration courts for years,” he said.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported that it encountered 144,000 migrants at the border in May, a level not seen in decades, describing the situation as a “full-blown emergency.” McAleenan said that 60,000 children have entered into DHS custody in just the last 40 days.

McAleenan told lawmakers they also suffer due to “misaligned” asylum standards, meaning many of those who demonstrate “credible fear” of returning home -- the initial bar for claiming asylum -- are later judged not to have a valid asylum claim.

PELOSI HITS TRUMP'S DEAL WITH MEXICO, ACCUSES HIM OF 'THREATS AND TEMPER TANTRUMS'

He also said the restrictions on how long family units can be held mean that a child is now seen as a passport to the U.S. -- a perception he said is based in reality. He testified that only 30 percent of those coming to the border are actually trying to avoid being captured.

“Unless you’re a single adult, it is very unlikely you’ll be repatriated,” he said.

McAleenan urged Congress to act to end those loopholes and to grant requested DHS funding, and suggested that moves to make asylum seekers claim asylum in their home countries or designated third-countries could help solve the crisis.

Graham’s “Secure and Protect Act of 2019,” being discussed at the hearing, would include a provision to establish refugee processing centers in Mexico and Central America, and the senator asked the DHS chief if such an approach would work.

“First of all, it would break the back of the smuggling organizations, they’re profiting from this cycle.” McAleenan said. ""It would provide access to asylum in country in a much safer manner than taking this dangerous journey and it would stop this flow immediately.”

“I believe the vast majority [of the migrant flow] would stop,” he said.

Democrats, meanwhile, suggested that the administration bears some of the blame for the situation at the border, with Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., pointing to McAleenan's recent appointment as an example of dysfunction at the department.

“In less than two and a half years, there have already been four heads of this department, we have before us an acting secretary who has been on the job for more than two months,"" he said. ""We cannot face this crisis effectively with a revolving door policy in the leadership at the Department of Homeland Security.”

McAleenan’s testimony comes amid continued negotiations between the Trump administration and Mexico on immigration. The U.S. announced on Friday that it had reached a deal with Mexico to drop threatened tariffs on Mexican imports in exchange for Mexico increasing efforts to limit U.S.-bound migration flows from Central America.

An administration source told Fox News Tuesday that a new deal for Mexico becoming a safe third country for asylum seekers was completed, but not yet announced.

EPA Reforms Pit Oil and Green Lobby Against Corn Producers,https://finance.yahoo.com,['Nilanjan Choudhury'],06-14-2019,2019,6,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/epa-reforms-pit-oil-green-125012621.html,"Oil spikes on fear of supply disruption, following attacks on two tankers in the Gulf of Oman. Will the rally continue?

Recently, the Andrew Wheeler-led Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) formally approved changes to its biofuels policy that included modifications to the RIN market and the year-round availability of E15 ethanol.

RIN Reforms

What Are RINs: It all started in 2005 when the Congress passed the 'Energy Policy Act' to reduce America's dependence on imports, lower greenhouse gas emissions and enhance the country's energy security. The legislation, among other provisions, created a Renewable Fuel Standard (or RFS) requiring the mixing of renewable fuels (like corn ethanol or other biofuels) into gasoline and diesel.

The U.S. EPA calls for a blending target known as the Renewable Volume Obligation (or RVO). For example, in 2010, EPA proposed that 12.9 billion gallons of ethanol and other biofuels be blended into gasoline and diesel. By 2018, the amount had jumped to 19.3 billion gallons and the RVO requirement for 2019 is 19.9 billion gallons.

Apart from its efforts to force the use of ethanol in the domestic gasoline mix – the percentage of which has gone up from around 3% in 2005 to roughly 10% now – Congress instructed the EPA to develop a system of electronically tracking numbers that could allow the agency to check whether the assigned blending requirements were being met by the concerned parties.

These 38-character tracking numbers or tradable certificates (sometimes referred to as ‘credits’) are known as RINs (Renewable Identification Numbers). Each physical gallon of renewable fuel produced/imported is assigned a RIN that follows the fuel’s journey to a blender. Post blending, RINs are separated from the blended gallons of petroleum-based fuels, and they are used as proof by obligated parties that they have complied with the federal program.

Lack of Transparency Leads to Widespread Abuse: Interestingly, the so-called RFS point-of-obligation are not the actual parties engaged in blending gasoline with ethanol or other biofuels, but refineries and gasoline-diesel importers. That means, all oil refiners – big and small – are required to shoulder the burden for mixing ethanol into gasoline, even if they do not possess the blending terminals to do so.

EPA's New Rules: The agency has come up with several structural changes to increase RIN market transparency and prevent price manipulation. The proposals include preventing certain parties from gaining access to RINs, public declaration for RIN holdings when they reach a threshold, stipulating a holding period for non-obligated parties and increasing the frequency of disclosure requirements from annual to quarterly.

The E15 Rule

The Current Ruling on E15: The vast majority of ethanol consumed in the United States comes in the form of E10, or a 10 vol% blend with gasoline. In 2011, the EPA permitted a partial waiver for blends of up to 15% with gasoline for passenger vehicles manufactured after 2001. While the ruling was bitterly contested by refiners, there was a rider associated with this approval that prohibited the sales of E15 ethanol between Jun 1 and Sep 15 every year. The restriction during the summer driving season was attributed to concerns over the potential for smog formation resulting from the volatile organic compounds in the hotter days.

EPA’s New Rules: EPA’s action translates into the removal of restrictions on E15 sales and allow year-round blending of the fuel rather than for just eight months of the year.

Gainers and Losers from the Proposed Rule Changes

The RIN credit reform is strongly opposed by large integrated energy conglomerates like ExxonMobil XOM and Chevron CVX. These biggies, with operations equipped to process ethanol, are placed at an advantage to standalone downstream operators.

The facilities of independent refiners can process just petroleum products and not ethanol. This means that the refiners have to either buy or build special ethanol blending terminals or purchase RINs to comply with the RFS. For most of the smaller players, investing in a new ethanol blending and distribution infrastructure is not financially viable. So, the only option for them is to buy RIN credits that they require to meet the RFS standard. Most independent refiners have to purchase them from integrated majors like Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) Chevronand biofuel producers who sell their excess credits."
VA’s new mission: expand services,https://www.wane.com,['Wane Staff Reports'],06-15-2019,2019,6,https://www.wane.com/news/local-news/vas-new-mission-expand-services/,"President Donald Trump signed the MISSION Act into law a year ago. Now, the Department of Veteran’s Affairs (VA) is using that law to expand healthcare options for veterans.

The VA says the new law allows VA care providers to recommend veterans go to local hospitals to get the care they need sooner. If a VA care provider determines a veteran cannot be seen in less than 20 days for primary care or less than 28 days for specialty care, that provider can recommend veterans go to a local hospital.

“What the VA MISSION Act does is it allows veterans to have the care they need when they need it and where they need it,” said heather Tarr, a supervisory health systems specialist for the VA. “It gives veterans greater access to care and greater options in where they go to receive that care.”

Some veterans are excited about their future healthcare with this law.

“I really like it because I’ve literally gotten in a skydiving accident before and instead of going somewhere local, I had to drive an hour and 40 minutes here to Fort Wayne for them to look at me and determine ‘yeah, it’s broken. We need to do this with it,'” said Justin Baker, a veteran who comes to Fort Wayne for healthcare but lives in South Bend. “So, I think it’s awesome.”

Local hospital groups in Fort Wayne told WANE 15 News they are excited about the expanding opportunities to give health care to veterans.

IU Health said in a statement to WANE 15 News, “We want to improve access to care for our veterans, so when we heard about the MISSION ACT, we wanted to be part of the initiative.”

Parkview Hospital has not responded to our request for comment.

Lutheran Health network said in a statement they “look forward to learning more about how the MISSION Act may provide even more access to those who have served our country so bravely.”

The VA is hosting a benefits fair on June 20th at the Parkview Mirro Center. The event runs from 10 in the morning to 7 at night. You can find more information about the benefits you’d be eligible for there and here."

"T-Mobile, Sprint vow to fight state AGs if they get DOJ approval",https://www.foxbusiness.com,"['Lydia Moynihan', 'Charles Gasparino']",,,,https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/t-mobile-sprint-vow-to-fight-state-ags-if-they-get-doj-approval,"T-Mobile US. Inc., and Sprint Corp., are prepared to fight the 10 state attorneys general suing to block their $26 billion merger if the U.S. Department of Justice approves the deal, FOX Business Network has learned.

Continue Reading Below

The coalition of state AGs led by New York Attorney General Letitia James and California’s Xavier Beccera filed a lawsuit in Manhattan federal court on Tuesday to stop the deal on antitrust grounds, arguing the merger would reduce the number of major wireless carriers to three from four, and possibly lead to higher prices for consumers. The move briefly upended the negotiations between the companies and the DOJ’s Antitrust Division, which had been making progress toward a possible solution.

But on Wednesday, officials from T-Mobile and Sprint both resumed their consultation with the DOJ’s Antitrust Division, and importantly, developed a legal strategy to fight the state AG lawsuit, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

That strategy is to proceed with attempting to convince the DOJ to approve the deal, and if that happens, fight what the companies believe is a long-shot attempt to block the merger by the states, these people said. The companies believe that even if a court issues an injunction to block the deal, the state case is weakened by the fact it was filed before the DOJ finished its discussions with the companies about their agreement to make further concessions to address antitrust concerns, they added.

Press officials from T-Mobile and Sprint had no comment. A DOJ spokesman also declined comment. A spokesman for the New York Attorney General had no immediate comment.

Even with the latest twist to hit the merger, officials at T-Mobile and Sprint believe a final decision from the DOJ’s Antitrust Division could come by next week.

In their negotiations with the DOJ, T-Mobile and Sprint have discussed concessions including selling wireless spectrum and additional businesses outside the Sprint’s Boost Mobile prepaid service. The companies agreed to sell Boost, build out their rural network, and not raise wireless prices for three years in order to receive approval from the Federal Communications Commission for the merger to proceed.

The state attorneys general ""saw what the DOJ was likely to propose as a remedy and didn’t like it, so jumped the gun and sued."" Peter Adderton, founder of Boost

The Trump administration has made the development of fifth-generation wireless networks, also known as 5G, both a national security and an economic objective. The development of such super-fast wireless networks are expected to be an economic boom, adding potentially hundreds of billions of dollars to the U.S. gross domestic product. The companies have also argued that a combined T-Mobile and Sprint will be better able to compete on price with wireless heavyweights AT&T and Verizon and gain ground in the area of 5G.

But DOJ staffers are eager to nix the merger on the grounds that fewer major carriers will lead to higher prices—the same argument made by the state AGs. They can be overruled by antitrust chief Makan Delrahim, who is said to be officially undecided but may be warming to the companies’ argument that the merger would not lead to high prices, particularly, after additional concessions are agreed upon.

Progress toward forming a set of concessions may be behind the state lawsuit, according to Boost founder Peter Adderton. The state AGs “saw what the DOJ was likely to propose as a remedy and didn’t like it, so jumped the gun and sued,” Adderton said Tuesday in an interview with FOX Business.

Another theory for the lawsuit is that the “states just got frustrated with the slowness of the process at DOJ,” said Craig Moffett of MoffetNathanson Research. “There’s a fair amount of pressure on DOJ to end this process,” he added.

An antitrust lawyer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the state AGs' announcement may signal the DOJ is looking to approve the deal. “The state AGs want to get ahead of the DOJ decision… and undermine whatever action [the Department of] Justice is going to take."" However, a ruling with concessions could “take the wind out of the state AG’s sails,” this person told FOX Business.

Another possibility is the DOJ is looking to file its own suit and the state AGs want to deny the Trump administration a pro-consumer victory by launching their lawsuit first.

In filing their lawsuit, the attorneys general blindsided Delharim and his staff, which wasn’t notified of the filing, this person added. Officials at the DOJ’s Antitrust Division were recently in negotiations to appease the state attorneys general and prevent state legal action from taking place.

FOX Business has also learned that the AGs are attempting to recruit other states to create the strongest possible case that might find a sympathetic judge to block the deal, or delay it indefinitely through an injunction. “If the states win their injunction, it’s not a slam dunk but it could make the merger messy,” Moffett notes, adding that an injunction could prevent the deal from closing, forcing one or both of the parties to walk away.

Still, legal experts say the states face an uphill battle in looking to kill the merger if the DOJ approves it.

Not only do states have fewer resources than the feds, they also have a higher bar to meet to prove their case: They must show the merger would cause “irreparable harm” whereas the FCC’s “general interest” paradigm and the DOJ’s mandate to keep markets competitive are much broader and less restricting, experts say.

As the telecom deal continues to face opposition, some on Wall Street are looking at what may happen if the companies call it quits. In an unusual provision, T-Mobile is not required to pay Sprint the agreed upon $600 million break-up fee if Sprint’s debt doesn’t meet minimum credit ratings from the three major bond-rating services.

Sprint’s debt must have at least a “B-2” bond rating from Moody’s Investors Service, a “B” rating from S&P Global and “B-plus” from Fitch Ratings.

Sprint is the smallest of the major wireless carriers, and its finances are considered the most suspect contributing to a stock price that is just above penny-stock levels. Ironically, its shaky finances could help the deal gain approval; Delrahim told FOX Business in an April interview that he was considering the so-called “failing firm defense,” meaning he was weighing the argument made by company officials that if Sprint wasn’t purchased by T-Mobile it might fall into bankruptcy and the number of wireless carriers would be reduced."
DOJ settles with First Merchants Bank after ‘redlining’ allegations,https://fox59.com,[],06-13-2019,2019,6,https://fox59.com/2019/06/13/doj-settles-with-first-merchants-bank-after-redlining-allegations/,"× DOJ settles with First Merchants Bank after ‘redlining’ allegations

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. — The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Indiana filed a complaint and a settlement agreement resolving allegations against First Merchants Bank on Thursday.

In the complaint, DOJ claimed that First Merchants Bank practiced lending discrimination by “redlining” predominantly African-American neighborhoods in Indianapolis from 2011 to at least 2017.

“Discriminatory race-based lending practices have no place in our District,” said Josh Minkler, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Indiana. “This case involving First Merchants Bank shows our commitment to ensure this reality.”

The term “redlining” describes illegal practices in which lenders intentionally avoid providing services to individuals living in predominantly minority neighborhoods because of the race of the residents in those neighborhoods.

The complaint alleged that First Merchants adopted a residential mortgage lending policy that effectively denied residents of predominantly African-American neighborhoods equal access to credit in violation of the Fair Housing Act and Equal Credit Opportunity Act.

According to the settlement agreement, pending court approval, First Merchants will expand its marketing, lending and banking services to specifically include predominantly African-American neighborhoods in Indianapolis:

Invest $1.12 million in a loan subsidy fund to increase credit opportunities to residents of predominantly African-American neighborhoods

Devote $500,000 toward advertising, community outreach, and credit repair and education

Open a branch and loan production office to serve the banking and credit needs of residents in predominantly African-American neighborhoods

Employ a director of community lending and development who will oversee these efforts with bank leadership

“We commend First Merchants for cooperatively resolving this case by taking steps to ensure that its residential lending products and services are made available to everyone in Indianapolis, regardless of race,” said Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband of the Civil Rights Division."

LEADING THE DAY

Centrist Democrats raise concerns over $15 minimum wage push: House Democrats are moving forward with legislation that would raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour, despite concerns from centrist lawmakers about the impact on lower-cost areas.

Democratic leaders say they're close to clinching the 218 votes needed to pass the bill, which they expect to bring to the floor in July.

Raising the minimum wage has been a staple of Democratic policy for years. But Congress has only voted twice in the past two decades to increase the minimum wage, and it has been stagnant at its current rate since 2009.

That might change soon.

All but 29 of the 235 House Democrats have cosponsored the measure, arguing it is key to helping workers and reducing poverty, while also lowering dependence on government welfare programs.

Other Democrats aren't sold. Many of the holdouts are moderates who are concerned that a significant wage boost in a short period of time could have an unintended effect in more rural settings. They argue that in a country as economically diverse as the United States, an across-the-board base wage doesn't make sense.

Reactions:

Trump bashes Powell, says he's 'waited long enough' for rate cut: President Trump escalated his criticism of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell in an interview that aired Friday, saying he's ""waited long enough"" for the Fed to cut interest rates.

""He's my pick,"" Trump said. ""And I disagree with him entirely.""

Trump argued that the U.S. economy and stock market would have grown faster ""if we had a different person in the Federal Reserve that wouldn't have raised interest rates so much.""

""It's OK to raise interest rates a little bit,"" Trump said. ""But so much ... it would have been even better.""

Crucial moment: Powell has brushed off Trump's criticism, insisting that politics play no role in the Fed's decisionmaking. But the president's latest attack intensifies the spotlight on the Fed as it weighs whether to cut interest rates.

Fed officials have expressed concern over the persistence of inflation below the central bank's 2 percent target and the rising costs of Trump's trade battles with China, the European Union, Mexico, Canada and Japan.

Powell said last week that the Fed ""will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion"" as inflation remains low and the economy faces headwinds abroad. Analysts and investors saw Powell's comments as a nod to an impending rate cut following months of the chairman stressing the bank's ""patient"" approach to moving rates.

What comes next: The Fed's policymaking arm, the Federal Open Markets Committee, will meet Tuesday and Wednesday for its monthly huddle. While the Fed is not expected to cut rates next week, Powell's press conference and the committee's statement may shed light on the central bank's next moves.

Design leaks for Harriet Tubman $20 bill after Mnuchin announces delay: The preliminary design for an updated $20 bill featuring Harriet Tubman was revealed by The New York Times on Friday, after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced last month that a redesign will be delayed until 2028.

The design was reportedly completed in late 2016. The Obama administration had set a 2020 deadline for finishing the design before Mnuchin pushed that deadline back.

A spokeswoman for the bureau, Lydia Washington, confirmed to the Times that preliminary designs of the new note were created as part of research that was done on orders from former Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew.

President Trump Invoked Executive Privilege. Here's the History of That Presidential Power,https://time.com,['Olivia B. Waxman'],,,,https://time.com/5605930/executive-privilege-history/,"When Congress issues a subpoena for documents, usually they get what they want. But that’s not the case for certain documents related to the 2020 Census question about citizenship, the Department of Justice said on Wednesday in a letter to Elijah E. Cummings, chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee. The reason: President Trump is invoking executive privilege.



The committee voted to recommend holding Attorney General William P. Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt of Congress for failing to comply with the subpoenas — though the committee’s Republicans say that the administration has already provided thousands of pages of relevant documents — but Trump is unlikely to face consequences for failing to comply. That’s because the doctrine of executive privilege, which Trump invoked for the first time in his presidency just a month ago, to block House Judiciary Committee Democrats from seeing Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s un-redacted report, gives presidents wide leeway to keep secrets.

So what is executive privilege? TIME once summed up the evolution of the concept as: “George Washington invoked it, Dwight Eisenhower named it and Richard Nixon abused it.” Here’s what else to know about the term and how its use has evolved over time.



What is executive privilege?

One oft-cited definition comes from Mark Rozell, author of two books on executive privilege and the Founding Dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University. He defined executive privilege in a 1998 Minnesota law review article as “the right of the president and high-level executive branch officers to withhold information from Congress, the courts and ultimately the public” when it comes to “(1) certain national security needs and (2) protecting the privacy of White House deliberations when it is in the public interest to do so.”

The term “executive privilege” is not in the U.S. Constitution, but it’s considered an implied power based on the separation of powers laid out in Article II, which is meant to make sure one branch of government doesn’t become all-powerful; executive privilege is one way the legislative branch’s power over the executive is limited. For example, when Congress investigated George W. Bush’s firing of eight U.S. Attorneys in 2006, the White House Counsel at the time, Fred Fielding, alluded to executive privilege in a letter referencing the “the constitutional prerogatives of the presidency.” But prominent constitutional law expert Raoul Berger famously called it a “constitutional myth” in his 1974 book, literally entitled Executive Privilege: A Constitutional Myth.

Why do presidents need executive privilege?

The basic idea behind executive privilege is that an entity like the U.S. government requires a lot of transparency, but also can’t function if there’s no possible way to speak about things confidentially.

“All reasonably complicated organizations need some space in which people can discuss what they’re going to do, with some degree of confidentiality. Why? If you know everything you consider is going to made public, or shared in some way, then that’s going to chill your ability to have frank and open discussion,” says Michael Dorf, a constitutional law expert at Cornell Law School. “The early understanding is simply that this is just a logical consequence of separation of powers, that each branch has to be able to assert its powers relative to the other branches.”

Generally, presidents will invoke executive privilege in matters relating to national security, the military and foreign affairs, for example to protect the names of spies and informants.

Who was the first President to invoke executive privilege?

The idea can be traced all the way back to President George Washington, who claimed it in 1792 when Congress asked him to turn over documents related to an unsuccessful military operation against Native Americans, according to Rozell’s report on the history of executive privilege for the Miller Center at the University of Virginia. Thomas Jefferson once wrote that, after conferring with his cabinet members, Washington believed “that the Executive ought to communicate such papers as the public good would permit & ought to refuse those the disclosure of which would injure the public.” Washington also claimed it when Congress requested documents related to the negotiation of the Jay Treaty with England, arguing that “the nature of foreign negotiations requires caution, and their success must often depend on secrecy.”

And Jefferson is considered the first president to establish the precedent of only releasing parts of subpoenaed material; when he was subpoenaed by his political rival Chief Justice John Marshall to present documents for the treason trial of his former Vice President Aaron Burr, who was accused of plotting to carve out the Western territories to form an independent republic, Jefferson initially refused to turn over the requested materials. The president must be able, he wrote, to “decide, independently, what papers coming to him as President, the public interest permit to be communicated, & to whom.” Jefferson eventually turned over the papers but maintained that he couldn’t be forced to do so; Burr was acquitted.

“Jefferson says that the court doesn’t have any power to issue this but I’m going to hand it over anyway because I’m a cooperative kind of guy,” says Dorf. “That set a pattern that I think we’ve seen ever since — that the President or members of an administration will cooperate to some degree, but say they’re doing so voluntarily.”

The specific phrase “executive privilege,” however, is more often said to have emerged in the 20th century. President Dwight Eisenhower invoked executive privilege more than 40 times. “Eisenhower took a very strong stand, especially during the McCarthy hearings,” Rozell told TIME in 2007. When Senator Joseph McCarthy demanded that White House officials testify in 1954 about suspected communists, “Eisenhower responded that any man who testifies to Congress about what advice he gave me will not be working for me by nightfall.”

How has executive privilege evolved?

One president who significantly changed the usage of executive privilege was Grover Cleveland, who “almost single-handedly” increased the power of the presidency in “his use of executive privilege in refusing to hand over department files to Congress in the fight over presidential appointments,” wrote Henry F. Graff, Professor Emeritus of History at Columbia University.

But Cleveland isn’t the president most people think of when they think of executive privilege. Graff goes on to say as much: “No President prior to Richard M. Nixon had ever made such an extreme assertion of executive privilege in peacetime.”

Though plenty of others have invoked the idea, Nixon remains to this day the president most closely associated with the concept. In fact, the only Supreme Court case on executive privilege is United States v. Nixon (1974), which came about when he claimed executive privilege during the Watergate investigation to get out of a grand jury subpoena and avoid handing over recordings of his conversations in the White House.

In a unanimous decision — meaning that even the conservative justices whom Nixon appointed agreed — the court ordered Nixon to hand over the tapes, arguing that presidents can’t just say that material is confidential in order to withhold criminal evidence. Here’s how TIME summarized the key points of the case in the Aug. 5, 1974, issue:

> The court firmly rejected Nixon’s argument that as head of the co-equal Executive Branch of the Government, he was entitled under the Constitution to determine finally the scope of his own privilege. On the contrary, the main theoretical plank of the court‘s opinion was the assertion of its supremacy in all matters of the law. The Judiciary’s power to interpret the law, the decision said, “can no more be shared with the Executive Branch than the Chief Executive, for example, can share with the Judiciary the veto power, or the Congress share with the Judiciary the power to override a presidential veto.” Quoting directly from Chief Justice John Marshall’s decision in Marbury v. Madison, the court said, “It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is” with respect to the claim of privilege presented in this case. > The President’s claims of Executive privilege must give way to the needs of the courts to settle a criminal case. Neither the separation of the Executive and Judicial branches nor the need for confidentiality “can sustain an absolute, unqualified presidential privilege of immunity from judicial process under all circumstances.” The court found that President Nixon’s claim of Executive privilege was too “broad” and “undifferentiated.” It showed no danger to the nation if the tapes were turned over to Sirica for in camera inspection. “We conclude that when the ground for asserting privilege as to subpoenaed materials sought for use in a criminal trial is based only on the generalized interest in confidentiality, it cannot prevail over the fundamental demands of due process of law in the fair administration of criminal justice.” …[T]he ruling was a narrow one. For one thing, as the President pointed out the day the decision was announced, the court “reaffirmed both the validity and the importance of the principle of Executive privilege.” The court, agreeing that “deference” should be accorded the “President’s need for candor and objectivity from advisers,” stated that the Chief Executive must be assured of confidentiality when discussing policy alternatives. Thus “the privilege is fundamental to the operation of government and inextricably rooted in the separation of powers under the Constitution.”

Sixteen days after this decision was handed down, Nixon resigned.

Why is executive privilege still controversial?

While the court clearly upheld the idea of executive privilege, scholars say it’s still unclear how the decision applies beyond that particular case, leaving the potential for the idea to be exploited. What is the limit to its use and how will it be enforced are questions that continue to be debated.

Many scholars worried about that problem as soon as U.S. v. Nixon was decided; because Chief Justice Burger had taken care to lay out examples of moments when executive privilege was merited (concerning “military, diplomatic, or sensitive national security secrets”) it seemed possible that future presidents merely had to invoke those ideas to hide whatever information they wanted.

Scholars say there hasn’t been enough case law to clarify whether a congressional investigation can override executive privilege. “Lower courts have tried to avoid the issue but have come down on the side of saying, ‘it’s a balancing test,’ Dorf says. “In the past, whenever possible, courts have tried to avoid making those judgments. So presidents have been very reluctant to assert executive privilege, and then the courts have tried to duck the issue, and they can. But the way things are going now, it looks not likely to be duckable — although you never know.”

"Rand Paul echoes Pelosi: Saudis getting away with murder, Trump complicit",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],06-13-2019,2019,6,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/rand-paul-echoes-pelosi-saudis-getting-away-with-murder-trump-complicit,"Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., called on President Trump and other world leaders to stop sending money and weapons to Saudi Arabia, a regime he characterized as menacing and murderous.

“Proliferating arms in the midst of chaos is a recipe for disaster,” Paul said in an op-ed for Fox News. “One cannot overstate the calamity that awaits the Middle East, and perhaps the world, if Saudi Arabia should misuse 'peaceful' nuclear technology in pursuit of nuclear weapons.”

Paul’s words were similar to statements House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., made earlier Thursday saying the Saudis were “getting away with murder” and Trump was complicit in their misbehavior.

“He chooses to ignore it,” Pelosi said of Trump. “He's engaged in a deadly war in Yemen which the Congress opposes. So we have important policy matters to deal with.”





Paul noted that “even” Hillary Clinton warned an aide in 2016 that Americans need “to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to Isis and other radical groups in the region.”

“What sane person would sell arms to a regime that kills, tortures, and imprisons dissidents,” Paul asked.

The United States’ relationship with Saudi Arabia came under intense scrutiny earlier this year after the murder of Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi — a killing widely viewed as carried out by the Saudi Arabain government.

In the weeks following Khashoggi’s death, Trump drew criticism for continuing to call Saudi Arabia “a good ally.”

The Senate will vote on a pair of resolutions that would put a halt on future weapons sales to Bahrain and Qatar, Paul said.

“Dumping more weapons into the Middle East won’t get us any closer to peace,” Paul said. “Our Founding Fathers were wary of granting presidents too much power.”

Accusing the country of waging a war on Christianity by persecuting Asia Bibi and others, Paul likewise urged the U.S. to cut off all foreign aid to Pakistan in a November op-ed for Breitbart."
"Editorial: EPA, emissions changes have to make sense",https://triblive.com,[],06-14-2019,2019,6,https://triblive.com/opinion/editorial-epa-emissions-changes-have-to-make-sense/,"TribLIVE's Daily and Weekly email newsletters deliver the news you want and information you need, right to your inbox.

Pennsylvania doesn’t have the same earthquake building code requirements as California.

The state doesn’t demand you inspect your home for dinosaurs before you sell it.

It makes sense that things that aren’t a problem aren’t regulated. Even if there was an earthquake in Central Pennsylvania this week, it’s not the kind of thing that swallowed homes and broke bridges. No special building standards required.

So it makes perfect sense that the Legislature has proposed eliminating vehicle emissions testing in more counties.

There was a reason to monitor and lower the filth belched out by cars and trucks when the rules were passed, but now all it does is take money away from vehicle owners. The money doesn’t even go to the state, but just covers the cost of the test itself. The garages that perform it, however, have to invest money in expensive, specialized equipment.

For all of that, only 4% of vehicles fail a test that is only administered to those least likely to fail. Older vehicles and those that use diesel are exempt. It’s already not required in 42 of Pennsylvania’s 67 counties.

On Wednesday, the Senate Transportation Committee passed a bill that would remove counties — including Westmoreland — that meet or exceed air quality and allow testing only every two years for other counties.

That makes sense. If the air quality is good, why keep making people pay to test newer cars that pose less problem?

What is more concerning that there are several things happening at the state and national level at the same time for the same reason that might individually make sense but together could be a problem.

Like the summer gas requirement. The more expensive, lower-polluting blend has been waived until July 1 because of a damaged pipeline, but Allegheny County is no longer required by the state and the Environmental Protection Agency to use the pricier fuel. A final decision on removing it is pending.

The reason for the change? Newer cars cause less pollution. The regulation isn’t necessary.

But last year, the federal government was talking about rolling back emissions standards for new cars, saying they were too high. This month, the EPA’s Science Advisory Board voted to review the science on the agency’s recommendations.

It doesn’t take a genius to see that the math there doesn’t add up to something good. We can’t say the cars don’t need inspection because they are better and the gas doesn’t need to be as good because the cars are more efficient and then take away the rules that make the better, efficient cars.

That just doesn’t make sense."
USDA issues reminder about how to safely meal prep,https://www.today.com,"['Chungah Rhee', 'Erica Chayes Wida']",06-13-2019,2019,6,https://www.today.com/food/usda-issues-reminder-about-how-safely-meal-prep-t156194,"Instagrammers make meal prep look like an art. They also make sky-high stacks of lunches stowed effortlessly in the fridge look like they'll last forever.

Unfortunately for the folks who have been pinning a recipe for grilled chicken lettuce wraps to eat Monday through Saturday, the whole seven-day thing is a bit of a ruse.

Whether aiming to gain muscle or lose weight, meal prep may be a large part of your healthy lifestyle. Don’t let food poisoning delay reaching your goals! Cooked meals are only safe for up to 4 days in the fridge. #MensHealthMonth pic.twitter.com/6jjh1VmhMv — USDA Food Safety (@USDAFoodSafety) June 9, 2019

According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), no one should be planning to keep pre-prepped meals around for longer than a handful of days. That is, unless they enjoy a forkful of spoilage bacteria along with that colorful, healthy fare.

All bacteria is not created equal

Meredith Carothers, a technical information specialist for the U.S. Food Safety and Inspection Service (a organization under the USDA), told TODAY Food bacteria that appears on leftovers isn't the same as the bacteria that causes foodborne illnesses. Unlike potentially life-threatening pathogens like E. coli, which can land someone a trip to the hospital, spoilage bacteria is the bacteria that causes food to go bad, which is indicated by a change in smell or appearance.

""It's not great to eat spoiled food. [The bacteria] will cause food to have an odor. Mold might start to grow. It could get a slimy texture. It’s unpleasant,"" Carothers said.

Spoilage organisms include yeast, fungi, mold or other bacteria that, while they can look totally unsightly, are unlikely to make you violently ill. However, Carothers said that many people will likely be nauseated by unsightly, moldy milk or sulphuric-smelling meats, so it's certainly not worth chancing it on something that might make you or your family gag.

Carothers added that prepped meals, despite their perfectly portioned, not-yet-eaten appearance, should still be considered as leftovers. As such, home cooks needs to abide by the food safety recommendations for leftover foods.

""After about four days is when that spoilage bacteria starts kicking in. Exactly how long it takes depends on other components — a citrus acidic sauce, for example, could preserve something longer,"" she said.

A colder fridge also slows the spoilage bacteria from growing. Unlike many bacterias that cause foodborne illnesses, the kind that causes food to rot still function in temperatures below 40 degrees.

However, a chilly 30-degree environment might give you an extra day or two to before the meal needs to be consumed.

Depending on what you're prepping, you may have a slighter longer storage window. Carothers advised consumers to remember the following guidelines, just in case a meal still looks and smells fresh at the four day mark.

Here's what to look out for

1. Meats, fish and poultry: When it comes to most animal proteins, pay attention to surface color changes, a dull hue or a funky smell. There may also be a texture change, especially a slimy coating on deli meats, chicken and fish.

2. Cooked and raw veggies: Make sure to feel their texture. The tips of vegetables like green beans or asparagus will sometimes take on a wilted look and feel mushy to the touch. Their odor, while less noticeable than bad meat, will also change slightly.

3. Grains and pasta: The starch category may have a little more ""leniency"" than something like cooked fish when it comes fridge shelf life, said Carothers. Because a lot of grains are cooked in water, there's a moisture component to watch out for that will result in the noodles or starch becoming soggy during the first stages of spoiling. Cooked pasta, however can last up to five days, while rice and quinoa may be good for up to six days.

4. Vegan proteins: Like animal protein, vegan proteins can also stink up the kitchen with unsavory odors. If a rotten, sulfur smell pours out of the Tupperware container of tofu tacos and beans, toss it.

The best meal-prepping advice?

While it might be tempting to try to cook for seven days at a time, you'll have a lower risk of your food spoiling if you plan two prep days a week. Because nobody wants to waste a pretty lunch — or eat a stinky one."
