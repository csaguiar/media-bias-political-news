Two and a half years into President Trump’s tenure, the Republican national security heavyweights blacklisted from his administration for signing a pair of “never Trump” letters in 2016 face a crossroads — remain opposed or support him in 2020.

While some have become prominent figures of the anti-Trump resistance — denouncing him in op-eds and on cable news — others have offered policy advice from outside perches, and a select few have quietly, though mostly unsuccessfully, angled for administration jobs, hopeful that a mea culpa could end their days in purgatory.

This weekend, a few dozen once-prominent GOP foreign policy figures, including some original “never Trumpers,” will gather at a private Reagan Institute retreat in Beaver Creek, Colo., to promote and preserve the 40th president’s “conservative internationalist” approach to foreign affairs. Yet the White House has shown little willingness to tap into this wellspring of expertise, even as Trump cycles through national security aides and faces a dwindling pool of experienced staffers in a potential second term.

The ostracism of the group has led some to reconsider their roles in a prominent public movement to stop Trump three years ago.

“I’m not comfortable with letters anymore,” said Patrick Cronin, head of the Asia-Pacific security program at the Hudson Institute, who signed the first letter, which called Trump “fundamentally dishonest” and “utterly unfitted to the office.” In March 2017, Cronin was forced to withdraw from a new position overseeing a Pentagon think tank after Trump allies blasted his appointment by then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.

“I don’t regret the letter in 2016; I thought it was the right thing to do,” said Cronin, who has been publicly supportive of some elements of Trump’s policies on China and North Korea. “But I’m not writing or signing any letters in 2020. I’m not predicting the outcome of the election. I will be supporting the U.S. government.”

Of the 149 experts who signed at least one of the two letters warning that Trump was unfit for office — the first published on the War on the Rocks website during the 2016 GOP primaries and the second on the New York Times’s site during the general election campaign — just one has been hired by the Trump administration. James Jeffrey, a Middle East expert who served under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, was named the State Department’s special representative for Syria last summer, before adding the role of special envoy to counter the Islamic State in January.

Neither of Jeffrey’s roles required Senate confirmation, which would have risked Democratic lawmakers reading from the never Trump letters at a public hearing.

The retreat in Beaver Creek was organized by Roger Zakheim, the Reagan Institute’s Washington director, who worked at the Pentagon in the Bush administration. He and his father, Dov, a senior Pentagon official in the Reagan and George W. Bush administrations, signed both never Trump letters.

But organizers emphasized that the event includes participants who have supported the president, among them former Trump administration officials. The dialogue is not aimed at countering Trump, said one person familiar with the planning, but rather is intended to build consensus around Reagan’s approach to U.S. global leadership in a time of uncertainty.

This person pointed to a new think tank founded by mega-philanthropists George Soros, a liberal, and Charles Koch, a conservative, that offers, in his words, a more “isolationist and protectionist” view of foreign policy.

Trump’s “America First” agenda has rattled traditional conservatives, as he has looked skeptically at multilateral alliances, free trade and democracy promotion. He has withdrawn the United States from some international treaties, criticized the United Nations and shown little interest in global human rights issues.

The question of how far Trump has strayed from Reagan’s principles has divided the never Trump group. Some praised Trump’s choice of conservative Cabinet members, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton, who helped dissuade him from acting on threats to pull the United States out of NATO and close military bases in East Asia.

Some of the letter organizers, including Eliot A. Cohen, a former State Department counselor in the Bush administration, and Max Boot, a Washington Post columnist who advised the 2008 presidential campaign of the late senator John McCain (R-Ariz.), have remained prominent critics of Trump’s policies and personal conduct.

But others have expressed admiration for his willingness to take a harder line on China’s trade practices, even if they remain uneasy about the tariff war between Washington and Beijing. And they asserted that Trump’s un­or­tho­dox personal diplomacy with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un has opened an unexpected avenue to try at least contain to Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons program.

Trump’s foreign policy “might not be as bad as feared and not as good as hoped,” said Peter Feaver, a Duke University political science professor who served on the National Security Council under George W. Bush and signed both letters.

Feaver, who stands by the letters and said Trump has validated much of what the experts warned of, said he is not seeking an administration position and thinks those who are will remain disappointed.

“Certainly, with the president, I don’t sense he’s anywhere closer to that kumbaya moment,” Feaver said. “It would probably take movement on both sides, but I don’t see much evidence the White House wants to move.”

Among those at the Reagan Institute retreat is Daniel Blumenthal, an American Enterprise Institute scholar who served at the Pentagon in the Bush administration. Last summer, Blumenthal was among the candidates whom Pompeo was considering to oversee East Asia affairs at the State Department. But his candidacy was derailed, at least in part, by the White House’s learning of his signature on the War on the Rocks letter, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the subject.

Another foreign policy analyst who signed that letter said in an interview this week that he regrets his participation. This person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly to discuss the issue, accused the letter organizers of turning their opposition to Trump into a “never-ending anti-Trump crusade” that continued after he took office and has vaulted some of them to media stardom while leaving others with limited professional options.

“I didn’t sign up for that,” this analyst said. “I learned my lesson. I’ve sworn off ever signing another letter I didn’t write.”

Some of the never Trumpers expressed hope that the blacklist will erode around the edges; even if the White House refuses to hire them, they said, perhaps a determined Cabinet secretary can bring them on. Along with Jeffrey, they pointed to Elliott Abrams, a veteran of the Reagan and Bush administrations who did not sign the letters but wrote an op-ed in 2016 saying Trump should not be president and would lose the election.

Trump foiled then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s attempt to name Abrams as his deputy in spring 2017. But Pompeo succeeded in January of this year in appointing Abrams as special envoy for Venezuela.

Mary Kissel and Brian Hook, two other senior State Department officials, also were vocal critics of Trump during the campaign, though neither signed the letters. Like Jeffrey, Abrams, Kissel and Hook were named to positions that do not require Senate confirmation.

Of those who have accepted their purgatory, some said they have had some modest policy conversations with moderate Democratic presidential candidates even though they recognize it is unlikely they will play a prominent role in any of their campaigns.

Someone like former vice president Joe Biden “is going to be surrounded by all the establishment Democrats,” said Michael Green, a former Bush administration official who signed the New York Times letter and works at a Washington think tank. “What’s the value added of an old Bush hand?”

Jeffrey Epstein is Donald Trump's idea of the perfect man,https://www.salon.com,[],07-13-2019,2019,7,https://www.salon.com/2019/07/13/jeffrey-epstein-is-donald-trumps-idea-of-the-perfect-man/,"He owned a palatial home in Palm Beach and a luxurious residence in Manhattan.

He owned a commercial airliner converted into a luxurious private plane.

He gave parties attended by young women seeking careers in the modeling business.

He was connected to numerous wealthy, powerful men who shared his taste in women and money.

Advertisement:

He bragged to others about his sexual conquests with women.

He paid women for sex.

He was charged in lawsuits with numerous sexual assaults on women.

Jeffrey Epstein? No, Donald Trump.

I really wonder what everyone is doing getting their dander up about this disgusting sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein, when we’ve got one in the White House. We’ve known about Trump not for years, but for decades. We’ve known about his sexcapades around New York with women who were not his wife. Hell, he used to call the New York Post’s “Page Six” and brag about himself!

And by what magic of moral vacuity has the infamous Access Hollywood tape disappeared down the memory hole? Its words ought to be carved in granite and mounted on a pedestal on the Mall in Washington in full view of the current occupant of the White House. Just listen to this low-life disgusting piece of shit. He was bragging to Access Hollywood’s Billy Bush about a ham-handed pass he had made at his co-host on the program, Nancy O’Dell:

“I moved on her, and I failed. I'll admit it. I did try and fuck her. She was married. And I moved on her very heavily. In fact, I took her out furniture shopping. She wanted to get some furniture. I said, ‘I'll show you where they have some nice furniture.’ I took her out furniture — I moved on her like a bitch. But I couldn't get there. And she was married. Then all of a sudden I see her, she's now got the big phony tits and everything. She's totally changed her look.”

There’s more, but let’s stop right there. “I moved on her very heavily.” “I moved on her like a bitch. But I couldn’t get there.” Who the hell talks like that?

Advertisement:

“I did try and fuck her.” What the hell is wrong with this man that he would talk like that to anyone, much less to a television host just before an interview? They were on a bus, getting ready for the interview, and there were seven other people present: a two person camera crew, a production assistant, the show’s producer, Trump’s security guard and his publicist, and the bus driver. Who talks that way about anyone, much less a woman who was the interviewer’s co-host on his television program? Who even talks in that manner about himself?

Trump. He did. And he wasn’t finished. He was on the bus, getting ready to meet a television actress, Arianne Zucker, with whom he would be filming a segment for Access Hollywood. This is what Trump said, referring to Ms. Zucker:

“I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know I'm automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab 'em by the pussy. You can do anything.”

There it is, the infamous “grab ‘em by the pussy” comment that would give newspaper editors fits. Are we really going to print “pussy” in our newspaper?

Looking back, you can hardly believe there was the kerfluffle about printing “pussy,” that the whole thing happened. But it did. It happened on October 7, 2016, in the closing days of what has turned out to be the most consequential presidential election in the history of this country. That was the day the Access Hollywood tape was released.

What happened next should shame all of us, the print press, the television shows that bleeped out “pussy,” even those that didn’t, but most of all the voters, the citizens of this country who beginning on that day, October 7, started sending this incident down the memory hole.

The Access Hollywood tape was released by the Washington Post around 4 p.m. on that day, a Friday. Thirty minutes later, WikiLeaks started tweeting links to emails stolen by the Russians from the personal email account of John Podesta, Clinton’s campaign chairman. Some of the emails on Podesta’s account were embarrassing. They had the transcripts of speeches Clinton had given to Wall Street banks, for which she was paid hundreds of thousands of dollars. They had private comments made by Clinton campaign staffers about ethnic voters.

And all of this was happening exactly one hour after the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson, jointly released a statement blaming Russia for the hacks into the Democratic Party’s emails.

You know what happened next. Trump’s confessions of his own sexual assaults and his disgusting behavior with a woman who was not his wife got lost in the frenzy around the WikiLeaks release of Podesta emails. Trump’s campaign should have been stopped in its tracks. He had already been accused of sexual assault and harassment by two dozen women (Their names, and descriptions of Trump’s sexual misconduct are here). Instead, Trump used the Democratic Party emails stolen by the Russians to stomp all over Hillary Clinton in the closing weeks of the campaign. With the help of the Russians and the cynicism and indifference of the American voter, he squeezed out a narrow victory, and we’ve been paying for it ever since.

But here’s the thing that’s jaw-dropping about Donald Trump. We’ve known who this bastard is for decades. We’ve known that he had affairs with porn stars and nude models and paid them money to buy their silence. We’ve known that he grabbed the private parts of a woman sitting next to him on an airplane, that he grabbed another woman sitting next to him in a restaurant. Hell, he as much as admitted it on the Access Hollywood tape! We’ve known that Trump was accused of raping a 13 year old girl in 1994 – in Jeffrey Epstein’s apartment! A lawsuit was filed on behalf of the victim, “Joan Doe,” making the allegation in 2016 and subsequently dropped.

Only three weeks ago, yet another woman came forward and accused Trump of rape: Columnist E. Jean Carroll accused Trump of raping her in a dressing room in Bergdorf’s in 1995 or 1996, a charge that was subsequently backed up, on the record, by two women who Carroll told about the rape at the time. We’ll hear from more victims of Trump’s sexual perversion before this is over.

So forget about this sexual predator, Jeffrey Epstein. He’s in jail in downtown Manhattan awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, and already, new witnesses are showing up, accusing him of new crimes.

We’ve got a sexual predator in the White House. The American people put Donald Trump there with their votes. It’s up to us to get him out and put him where he belongs, behind bars alongside his pal Epstein."
A White House Correspondent Departs the Jaw-Dropping Trump Beat,https://www.nytimes.com,['Mark Landler'],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/us/politics/trump-white-house-.html,"WASHINGTON — Choosing a single day that epitomizes Donald J. Trump’s presidency — amid the endless tangle of jaw-dropping, reality-bending, norm-shattering days — is a fool’s errand. But for a White House correspondent departing the beat after eight years, Thursday came awfully close.

From Mr. Trump’s morning Twitter rant (asking how anyone could vote for a Democrat over “what you have now, so great looking and smart, a true Stable Genius!”) to his social media summit (in which he praised a room of right-wing agitators for “the crap you think of”), to a news conference that ended with his merry band of provocateurs almost coming to blows with reporters, the White House finally surrendered itself to being a stage set for Mr. Trump’s greatest reality show.

It is not that real business wasn’t transacted there on Thursday. Mr. Trump went to the Rose Garden to announce his retreat, in the face of a Supreme Court ruling, from asking a question about citizenship on the 2020 census. But he upstaged his own effort to spin the defeat — by promoting actions that were underway already — with a theatrical outburst.

“Are you a citizen of the United States of America?” Mr. Trump said to reporters, sarcastically mimicking a data collector for the Census Bureau. “Oh, gee, I’m sorry, I just can’t answer that question.”"
Trump DOJ scores rare win on sanctuary city crackdown in appeals court,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Joseph Wulfsohn', 'Joseph A. Wulfsohn Is A Media Reporter For Fox News. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-doj-scores-rare-win-on-sanctuary-city-crackdown-in-appeals-court,"President Trump notched a win on Friday in a federal appeals court, which upheld a Department of Justice method for cracking down on sanctuary cities.

In a 2-1 decision that overturns a nationwide injunction, the DOJ is now allowed to give preferential treatment for community policing grants to cities that don't defy federal immigration enforcement.

""The department is pleased that the court recognized the lawful authority of the administration to provide favorable treatment when awarding discretionary law enforcement grants to jurisdictions that assist in enforcing federal immigration laws,"" the DOJ said in a statement.

DHS LEADING INTERNAL INVESTIGATION INTO RAID LEAKS

While the Trump administration has faced numerous obstacles in cutting funding to sanctuary cities, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals appears to make an exception for the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) grant program, which is meant to help cities hire more police officers.

Other factors in the program's ""points"" system include the hiring of veterans, and the occurrence of school shootings within a jurisdiction. In 2017, the DOJ under then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions implemented points that benefit non-sanctuary cities.

Judges Sandra Ikuta and Jay Bybee, who ruled in the DOJ's favor, were appointees of President George W. Bush.

""Cooperation relating to enforcement of federal immigration law is in pursuit of the general welfare, and meets the low bar of being germane to the federal interest in providing the funding to 'address crime and disorder problems, and otherwise ... enhance public safety,'"" Ikuta stated."
"Devin Nunes: Without jail time for Russia probe 'dirty cops', no Republican will trust DOJ for ‘generations'",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Sam Dorman', 'Sam Dorman Is A Reporter With Fox News. You Can Follow Him On Facebook']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/devin-nunes-jail-dirty-cops-republicans-doj,"House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said there will be massive political consequences if Justice Department officials don't face jail time for their conduct during the Russia investigation.

According to Nunes, the Russia investigation was an ""obstruction of justice trap,"" that started without evidence of collusion and ended in an ""awful situation"" that could only be fixed by jailing the people who ""perpetuated this hoax.""

""These are all a bunch of dirty cops and I'll tell you,"" he told Fox News' Bill Hemmer on the latest ""Hemmer Time"" podcast. ""We're going to go down in a spiral in this country because you will not have a Republican that will trust the FBI or the Department of Justice for generations to come.""

Nunes specifically mentioned Andrew Weissman, one of the Mueller team's top prosecutors who briefed AP reporters in 2017, before Mueller's team was assembled, on ""something to do with the Trump-Russia investigation.""

Authorities, Nunes said, hid that fact from his committee -- something he said was inappropriate given that Weissman was briefed on the Steele dossier in the summer of 2016.

At Mueller's hearing, Nunes plans to ask him whether he knew that Weissmann had been briefed on the dossier. Weissmann's early involvement with the chain of custody, according to legal advice Nunes received, effectively disqualified him from serving on Mueller's team.

Nunes' comments came before former Special Counsel Robert Mueller was scheduled to testify on July 17 before the House Judiciary Committee -- a hearing Nunes suspected Democrats hoped would include ""nasty"" comments making President Trump ""look bad.""

That date, according to sources, could have been pushed back to July 24, although committee Democrats have maintained the hearing would take place on July 17.

While the committee's chair, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., joined other Democrats in continuing to pursue the Mueller report's findings, Republicans have attempted to refocus the debate on accountability for what Nunes described as ""dirty cops.""

REP. NUNES ON CHRISTOPHER STEELE'S GRILLING BY DOJ INVESTIGATORS: A LOT OF THE DOSSIER 'WAS JUST MADE UP'

Barr already started the investigation and Nunes, in April, sent a criminal referral notification telling the Justice Department in April that he had identified ""potential violations"" of the law. Those criminal referrals stemmed from the Intelligence Committee's investigation when Nunes was chair and Republicans held the House.

Nunes told Fox News host Bill Hemmer that he thought it was possible that the Russia investigation was a way for the House to develop an impeachment strategy. He accused DOJ officials of trying to drag out the investigation in order to find legal violations.

""They were trying to hold out this investigation as long as possible, bust people here and there for nickel and dime stuff -- like obstructing an investigation, lying to Congress -- and eventually they would get Trump,"" he said.

""What they were probably trying to get Trump to do was say something publicly, tweet something ... probably their best dream was for him to fire Mueller ... and then you'd have public sympathy and public support"" for action against Trump.

Trump Administration Gets Court Victory in Sanctuary Cities Case,https://www.nytimes.com,['The Associated Press'],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/us/sanctuary-cities-ruling.html,"SEATTLE — A federal appeals court on Friday gave President Trump a rare legal victory in his efforts to crack down on so-called sanctuary cities, upholding the Justice Department’s decision to give preferential treatment in awarding community policing grants to cities that cooperate with immigration authorities.

The 2-to-1 opinion overturned a nationwide injunction issued last year by a federal judge in Los Angeles. The appeals court said awarding extra points in the application process to cities that cooperate was consistent with the goals of the grant program created by Congress.

“The Department is pleased that the Court recognized the lawful authority of the Administration to provide favorable treatment when awarding discretionary law-enforcement grants to jurisdictions that assist in enforcing federal immigration laws,” the Justice Department said in an emailed statement.

Federal courts have blocked some efforts by the administration to withhold money from sanctuary cities, including an executive order issued by the president in 2017 that would have barred them from receiving federal grants “except as deemed necessary for law enforcement purposes.”"
Acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan under federal investigation for alleged leaks,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,['Ap Photo Pablo Martinez Monsivais'],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/acting-dhs-secretary-mcaleenan-under-federal-investigation-for-alleged-leaks-officials,"Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan is at the center of a federal investigation into the leak of confidential government information in late June that forced Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to call off a nationwide operation, three senior administration officials told the Washington Examiner.

Following the publishing of sensitive leaked law enforcement information on June 21, then-acting ICE Director Mark Morgan’s team followed department protocol and reported the incident to the ICE Joint Intake Center so they could investigate. JIC is an agency office that handles internal investigations of personnel misconduct, sexual abuse, staff neglect, or violations of responsibilities that may have contributed to such incidents.

“There is an ongoing investigation. An internal investigation has been launched,” one official said in a phone call Friday.

The investigation, which is not a criminal probe, is centered around the leader of the department’s 240,000 employees, as well as at least one aide, for possible involvement in the leak. ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It's not clear if JIC has referred the matter to the DHS Office of the Inspector General.

“Any investigation into the malicious, unauthorized disclosure of the operations is completely justified. Any causal observer would logically deduce that McAleenan’s dodgy response and coy behavior warrant additional scrutiny,” a second senior official said late Thursday.

A third official said the department’s decision to pursue the investigation of the acting secretary in itself was “very troubling.”

“It’s worrisome that it took days for the acting secretary to acknowledge and then deny the allegations, and it’s telling that he didn’t call for the investigation in the first place. More than anything, it’s unfortunate that people are even having this discussion at all,” the official wrote in a text.

McAleenan was named by three senior administration officials and two former officials as the orchestrator of the leak, charging he wanted to sabotage ICE’s monthslong plan to find and arrest around 2,000 people who had been denied asylum and not left the country. McAleenan opposed the plan because of its potential to remove a parent from a household with children in it.

Three officials have claimed McAleenan ordered Morgan on two occasions in the two weeks leading up to the planned June 23 operation to not carry it out, orders that would have contradicted the White House’s support and approval. Morgan contacted the White House following McAleenan’s warning to try to carry it out, according to three current and two former senior administration officials.

“That’s our belief,” one official told the Washington Examiner in late June, when asked if McAleenan was behind the leak. “The secretary was not supportive from day one.”

The acting secretary, who was in El Paso Thursday to show mayors from southern border cities conditions of Border Patrol facilities, has not mentioned the investigation in the weeks since the leak.

He directly denied being the leaker during an interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham last week, but on Sunday dodged the same question when it was asked by ABC News host Martha Raddatz.

“I find it interesting that he demanded an investigation into the Border Patrol Facebook, but he didn’t demand an investigation into the leak. If he was innocent of this, why didn’t he?” said a senior former official.

The official was referring to a Facebook page on which border patrol agents made vulgar and derisive posts.

The planned raids in cities such as Los Angeles, Miami, and Houston, were first reported by the Washington Post the day after its reporter traveled on a government plane with the acting secretary and aides to the border.

ICE is now planning to carry out raids nationwide this weekend, though it is not clear if the same people targeted in the canceled ones from June will be the focus of these new ones. The raids were reported Friday as having started earlier than expected."
E.P.A. Plans to Curtail the Ability of Communities to Oppose Pollution Permits,https://www.nytimes.com,['Coral Davenport'],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/climate/epa-community-pollution-appeal.html,"Want climate news in your inbox?

WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency is preparing to weaken rules that for the past quarter-century have given communities a voice in deciding how much pollution may legally be released by nearby power plants and factories.

The changes would eliminate the ability of individuals or community advocates to appeal against E.P.A.-issued pollution permits before a panel of agency judges. However, the industrial permit-holders could still appeal to the panel, known as the Environmental Appeals Board, to allow them to increase their pollution.

The draft plan was described by three people familiar with the document, who requested anonymity because the proposal is not yet public. The document has been largely completed, they said, and the next step would be to announce the proposed rule change and seek public comment.

“This is outrageous,” said Richard Lazarus, an environmental law professor at Harvard. “Individuals in communities will lose a way to seek relief from pollution that has historically been very effective. But industry will still be able to seek relief to pollute more.”"

SAN FRANCISCO - The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday ruled in favor of the Trump administration, saying the Department of Justice could give preference in awarding grants to cities that would use the money to focus on illegal immigration, as the federal government prepares to seek out undocumented immigrants in raids this weekend.

The City of Los Angeles sued the Department of Justice because it did not receive any funding from the Community Oriented Policing Services grant program, which is aimed at initiatives to build trust between communities and law enforcement agencies. Los Angeles chose ""building trust and respect"" as its focus area and did not mention illegal immigration in its application because of its policy as a sanctuary city.

The panel of judges ruled that ""because DOJ's scoring factors encouraged, but did not coerce, an applicant to cooperate on immigration matters, the panel also rejected Los Angeles's claims that DOJ's use of the factors infringed on state autonomy in a manner that raised Tenth Amendment concerns.""

""DOJ did not exceed its statutory authority in awarding bonus points to applicants that selected the illegal immigration focus area,"" the judges wrote, arguing that ""DOJ's determination that the techniques of community policing may be used to address this public safety issue (illegal immigration) was entirely reasonable.""

The court's decision comes ahead of Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids scheduled for Sunday in nine major cities, including Los Angeles. City officials have come out against the impending raids -- the Los Angeles Police Department said Thursday that it ""does not and will not participate in the enforcement of civil administrative law,"" and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti tweeted suggestions Friday for how to deal with ICE agents.

The White House praised the court's decision, saying in a statement Friday that it ""reverses a lawless decision that enabled Sanctuary City policies, putting the safety and security of all Americans in harm's way.""

""The ruling upholds the right of the Department of Justice to ensure discretionary grants under its control are not being used to subsidize these jurisdictions' open assault on law-abiding Americans and their loved ones,"" the statement added.

Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer said the city would look at every option, including an appeal to a larger panel of the 9th Circuit, the Los Angeles Times reported Friday.

""If this decision were to stand, this or another administration could add other conditions, favoring jurisdictions that criminalize abortions or allow teachers to have guns in classrooms,"" Feuer said, according to the LA Times.

Feuer's office did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order in 2017 seeking to ""ensure that jurisdictions that fail to comply with applicable Federal law do not receive Federal funds, except as mandated by law.""

Community Oriented Policing Services funds are among those that can be blocked by the President without congressional approval, according to immigration law experts. The grants go toward developing innovative policing strategies and providing training and technical assistance to community members, local government leaders and law enforcement.

Garcetti at the time stood by Los Angeles' status as a sanctuary city, arguing that cutting funding to any city ""puts the personal safety and economic health of our entire nation at risk.""

Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dhs-leading-internal-investigation-into-raid-leaks-amid-allegations-against-acting-secretary-mcaleenan,"The Department of Homeland Security is leading an internal investigation into the leaks that forced the cancellation of planned U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids last month, as Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan battles allegations he was behind the unauthorized disclosure.

An ICE spokesperson told Fox News on Friday that the agency referred the leak to DHS’s Joint Intake Center after “operational plans” were leaked last month.

DHS BOSS MCALEENAN ACCUSED OF OPPOSING, LEAKING PLANNED ICE RAIDS

The Joint Intake Center (JIC) is the division of the agency that handles and investigated allegations of professional misconduct.

It is unclear, at this point, how long the investigation will last.

An official told Fox News that leaks on plans are sensitive and “jeopardize law enforcement safety.”

A senior administration source also told Fox News Friday that the investigation was opened after a request made by senior ICE officials.

McAleenan has vehemently denied the leak claims. In an interview with Brian Kilmeade on Fox News Radio last month, he said: ""Categorically, I did not and would not leak details of a law enforcement operation.""

McAleenan came under fire last month after officials and other sources publicly, and privately, accused him of leaking details of planned ICE deportation raids. The report in question, which was published by Washington Post immigration reporter Nick Miroff, said the raids would take place before dawn in major cities.

A source familiar with the matter told Fox News that McAleenan traveled on a government plane to the border with Miroff less than 24 hours before the story was published. The source also said that when the raids were in a planning phase, McAleenan was opposed and even ordered Morgan to call off the operation -- though Trump told him to proceed. The president, though, put the operation on hold after the leak amid talks with Congress.

The deportation operation was expected to target 2,000 families in up to 10 cities across the country, including Houston, Chicago, Los Angeles and Miami.

Justice Dept. asks Supreme Court to lift border wall ruling,https://www.politico.com,['Josh Gerstein'],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/12/supreme-court-trump-border-wall-1415651,"Construction of a portion of the border wall between Mexico and New Mexico in April 2018. | Herika Martinez/AFP/Getty Images) legal Justice Dept. asks Supreme Court to lift border wall ruling

The Justice Department is asking the Supreme Court to step in to lift court orders blocking President Donald Trump from proceeding with his plan to spend billions of dollars on border wall construction despite Congress’ efforts to limit that spending.

Administration lawyers filed a stay application Friday afternoon seeking to lift an Oakland-based federal judge’s order blocking border wall projects in California, Arizona and New Mexico.

Solicitor General Noel Francisco told the high court that the injunction is impairing federal officials’ ability to cut drug trafficking across the border with Mexico.

“The harm to the government and the public from enjoining DOD’s use of the transferred funds during litigation is significant. The injunction frustrates the government’s ability to stop the flow of drugs across the border in known drug-smuggling corridors,” Francisco wrote.

Justice Elena Kagan gave the environmental and border groups that obtained the injunction until next Friday to respond to the request.

The current injunction puts on hold about $2.5 billion Trump’s plan sought to spend through a provision allowing available Defense Department construction funds to be spent on unforeseen needs.

However, the language Congress passed adding that flexibility says that authority can’t be used for budget items previously denied by lawmakers. Congress appropriated only $1.375 billion for border wall work in the current budget, and nothing for the specific projects covered by the injunction, but Trump aides devised a plan to spend more than $8 billion on the broad effort.

Trump’s move in May, which included efforts to open up funding by declaring a state of emergency, immediately drew a series of lawsuits from environmentalists, border residents, states and the House of Representatives. The suits argue Trump is acting illegally by spending funds without the approval of Congress, which must approve all appropriations under the Constitution.

Last week, a federal appeals court panel voted, 2-1, to deny the Justice Department’s stay request.

“The Constitution assigns to Congress the power of the purse. Under the Appropriations Clause, it is Congress that is to make decisions regarding how to spend taxpayer dollars,” 9th Circuit Judges Richard Clifton and Michelle Friedland wrote. “Congress did not appropriate money to build the border barriers Defendants seek to build here. Congress presumably decided such construction at this time was not in the public interest. It is not for us to reach a different conclusion.”

The appeals judges were unsparing about some of the Trump administration’s arguments. Clifton and Friedland deemed “not credible” the Justice Department’s contention that Congress had not denied the administration the funds it was seeking to spend.

The groups that obtained the injunction, the Sierra Club and the Southern Border Communities Coalition, said they’ll urge the justices not to lift the order.

“The courts have twice ruled against Trump’s requests to stay this important court order stopping construction of his ruinous wall. Now he is asking the Supreme Court to step in and save his wall, but we will continue to vehemently fight these tactics,” Sierra Club attorney Gloria Smith said.

The Justice Department filing with the high court asks the justices to rule on the application by July 26 to allow the funding process to be completed by September 30. Previous filings from the administration said that process needed to begin by early July to be carried out while the funds are still available.

However, administration lawyers also told the Supreme Court on Friday they’ve discovered a mechanism that might allow that process to be compressed, permitting officials to formally obligate funds for the border projects closer to the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30."
"US government is running out of money faster than expected, Mnuchin warns",https://www.cnn.com,['Donna Borak'],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/12/politics/mnuchin-congress-letter-debt-crisis/index.html,"(CNN) Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Friday issued a warning Friday that the US government is at risk of running out of cash sooner than expected.

In a letter to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Mnuchin wrote that the US might default on its obligations as soon as early September, before Congress returns from its summer recess

""Based on updated projections, there is a scenario in which we run of out cash in early September, before Congress reconvenes,"" Mnuchin wrote in a letter.

The federal government has not been able to borrow money since March, when congressionally-mandated borrowing limits went back into force. The US Treasury, which is facing a growing deficit thanks in part to President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts, had said it had enough cash to last until the fall.

Pelosi and Mnuchin have spoken three times this week in an effort to jumpstart stalled budget and debt ceiling negotiations, and multiple sources say the new default projections have provided an accelerant for those efforts.

Updated at 1:09 p.m. ET

Debbie Baker thought she qualified for a federal program that helps teachers such as her, as well as nurses, police officers, librarians and others. The Department of Education program forgives their federal student loans if they make their payments for 10 years and work in public service.

For 10 years, Baker, who was a public school teacher in Tulsa, Okla., checked in with loan servicing companies and was told she was on track.

""I said, 'I'm qualifying for public service loan forgiveness,' and they said, 'OK, great,' "" she says.

But it turns out that her $76,000 in student loans didn't get forgiven. Baker was finally told she was in the wrong type of loan. If she'd known that at the beginning, she could have switched loans and ended up qualifying. But she says nobody ever told her.

""When this hit ... I didn't know whether to cry, throw up, get mad,"" she says. ""I honestly did not think the federal government would do this to someone.""

Now, Baker is a plaintiff in a lawsuit being brought by one of the biggest teachers unions in the country against the Department of Education. The suit alleges the loan forgiveness program for millions of public service workers is in such a shambles that it violates federal law and the Constitution.

Have you had problems qualifying for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program? Share your story with NPR.

The American Federation of Teachers filed the lawsuit Thursday in federal court. In the complaint obtained by NPR, the union is asking the court to order the department to fix the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program so that it meets legal standards. It's also asking the department to come up with an appeals process for people who believe they have been treated unfairly.

Congress created the program more than a decade ago to encourage public service. So, if you make loan payments for 10 years and you work in a qualifying job for the government or a nonprofit, the program promises to forgive the remainder of your federal student loan debt.

That promise sounded really good to a lot of people. More than 1 million have filed official paperwork to take part in the program. But there's a problem.

""The promise is broken, virtually all the time,"" says Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers. ""This is a debacle.""

Plenty of consumer watchdogs agree.

""The Department of Education just cannot seem to get this right,"" says Christopher Peterson, a law professor at the University of Utah and a former top attorney at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. ""They keep making mistakes and are not appropriately administering this program that Congress has created.""

By the department's last count, only 1% of the people who think they've made their 10 years of payments and apply for loan forgiveness are getting approved.

If you took all the people getting rejected and got them together in one place, Peterson says, you'd have ""football stadiums full of nurses, firefighters, teachers, law enforcement officers that are seeking to have their debts forgiven.""

He says they've made ""all of these payments under the impression that they were on track, and now they're being turned away in droves.""

As happened with Debbie Baker, if a student loan borrower is in the wrong type of loan, or the wrong type of repayment plan, they can't qualify for loan forgiveness.

There are different kinds of federal loans and a wide array of payment plans. If a student loan borrower is told they need to switch from one type to the other to qualify for the program, that's easy enough to do. For public service loan forgiveness, borrowers need to have a ""direct federal loan."" But if their loan servicer never tells them that, they can remain in the wrong type of loan or plan for years, thinking they're making progress toward loan forgiveness only to find out later that none of those payments counted towards forgiveness.

The teachers union lawsuit alleges that the Department of Education ""knows of — but completely disregards — repeated misrepresentations made by [student loan] servicers to borrowers who are attempting to qualify ... resulting in unwarranted denials of loan forgiveness.""

In other words, people like Baker aren't given the right information or advice, and many end up in the wrong types of loans or repayment plans and get unfairly disqualified. Government reports and investigations have found similar problems with borrowers getting bad information.

The lawsuit also alleges that loan servicers are having trouble keeping track of the number of qualifying payments people make — even when they are in the correct loan and payment plan and manage to do everything right.

Weingarten says the program is hurting the very people it's supposed to help. ""It is so broken, it is so unfair that it violates our basic United States Constitution requirement of due process,"" she says.

Another problem with borrowers getting rejected after many years of thinking they were on track is that many make life decisions based on the expectation of loan forgiveness.

Janelle Menzel is a high school math teacher in Brainerd, Minn. She says people would ask her: ""You have a degree in math, why are you teaching?"" She says they would tell her she could make ""so much more money in the private sector.""

Menzel says she loves teaching. And she thought she was going to get her student loans forgiven, so financially she decided it made sense. ""Oh yeah, definitely. That was a factor in it,"" she says.

But Menzel says that after 10 years of making payments, she was told by her loan servicer that she was in the wrong type of payment plan and couldn't qualify.

If a call center worker had told her that 10 years before, she easily could have switched into the right kind of loan. But she says nobody ever told her. And so that never happened.

She remembers after contacting her loan servicer repeatedly, trying to find a way to appeal, a call center worker told her, ""Look, you just need to give up.""

""And I remember sitting at the table watching my kids running around and playing and just thinking, man, I am stuck with this now,"" Menzel says. Thoughts of ""the freedom that would come with being released of the student loan debt kind of came crashing in in that moment,"" she adds.

Congress passed a partial fix, called Temporary Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness, that was designed to help at least some borrowers. But the teachers union lawsuit alleges the Department of Education ""has mismanaged [that program] as well."" As of March 2019, only 3.6% of applications for that new program have been approved.

The Department of Education says it can't comment on ongoing litigation. But the department's press secretary, Liz Hill, said in a statement to NPR on Thursday, ""the Department has improved internal processes and enhanced communications and outreach to borrowers."" As an example, Hill pointed to an automated PSLF Help Tool that assists borrowers in determining whether they are in the right types of loans and payment plans, and which forms to submit.

She also pointed to a department blog post about avoiding common mistakes.

The teachers union is asking the court to order a new appeals process through which the department could use its power to forgive or ""discharge"" loans for borrowers who were treated unfairly.

But in its statement, the department says it ""expects few people to be immediately eligible for a loan discharge under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program due, in large part, to complexities of the program Congress created more than a decade ago.""

For those borrowers interested in the program, the Education Department says submitting an Employment Certification Form annually is key to making sure that borrowers are on track to qualify for forgiveness.

Navient, one of the nation's largest loan servicer companies, is not commenting on the lawsuit. But the company said in a statement to NPR, ""We understand the frustration borrowers face in navigating a complex federal loan program, which is why we consistently advocate for policy reforms to simplify the system.""

The Department of Education recently implemented a dramatic fix to a different program, TEACH Grants, that's now returning grant money to thousands of people who had grants taken away unfairly.

Ocasio-Cortez wants to ax Homeland Security. Some conservatives didn’t want it to begin with.,https://www.washingtonpost.com,['Marisa Iati'],07-11-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/07/11/ocasio-cortez-wants-axe-homeland-security-some-conservatives-didnt-want-it-begin-with/,"

Although some activists have urged the government to abolish its immigration enforcement arm, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) came out in favor of eradicating the entire Department of Homeland Security.

The department’s creation after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, significantly threatened American civil liberties, Ocasio-Cortez said Tuesday on the WNYC podcast “the New Yorker Radio Hour.” She said she wanted to get rid of Homeland Security, the formation of which she called an “egregious mistake.”

“People sounded the alarm back then, that these agencies are extrajudicial, that they lack effective oversight, and it is baked into the core foundational structure of these agencies,” she told the New Yorker’s editor, David Remnick.

Conservative political figures immediately castigated the congresswoman’s proposal.

“Moronic, stupid, naive and dumb,” former White House deputy chief of staff Karl Rove said on Fox News.

""Absolute irresponsibility,” Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) told reporters, according to the Washington Examiner.

[‘Outright disrespectful’: Four House women struggle as Pelosi isolates them]

The usefulness of a Department of Homeland Security, however, wasn’t always taken for granted. President George W. Bush’s administration initially had “zero interest” in creating a new department to protect against terrorism, The Washington Post previously reported. Vice President Richard B. Cheney thought it would needlessly increase the size of government.

“Creating a Cabinet post doesn’t solve the problem,” White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said in March 2002, according to The Post.

Some members of Congress worried the White House was concealing the department’s true cost to avoid alienating Republicans who opposed the growth of government, USA Today reported in 2002. Certain conservative Republicans, meanwhile, said they would not oppose Bush’s proposal but wanted to move slowly, according to the Houston Chronicle.

When the House of Representatives initially voted on the department’s creation the following July, 132 members opposed the move, including 10 Republicans. Congress eventually passed the Homeland Security Act and Bush signed it into law that November, creating the Department of Homeland Security.

Ocasio-Cortez said Wednesday that her proposal was “not that radical,” citing the reluctance of some members of Congress to support the department’s creation less than two decades ago.

“When DHS was 1st formed by Bush 17 years ago, many members of Congress were concerned — incl GOP — that we were setting up a ticking time bomb for civil liberties erosion & abuse of power,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter.

It’s really not that radical.

Like some members of Congress, non-politicians also criticized the new department, which merged 22 federal agencies tasked with securing the country’s borders, protecting its infrastructure and guarding against terrorism.

James Bamford, a journalist and filmmaker who covers intelligence agencies, told CBS News in 2002 that creating Homeland Security was a public relations move that could actually decrease efficiency.

“Instead of moving people together, you should be moving information together,” Bamford told CBS. “You should be taking information and finding better ways to distribute it; faster ways to distribute it among people.”

In a 2003 article in National Review, conservative writer Ramesh Ponnuru criticized Bush’s record as president, noting that Bush had “raised defense spending, given new powers to law enforcement, federalized airport security and created a new cabinet department for homeland security. . . . More people are working for the federal government than at any point since the end of the Cold War.”

[‘I hate this mission,’ says operator of new emergency shelter for migrant children]

Homeland Security was originally staffed by 180,000 employees from the U.S. Customs Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other federal offices. It also encompasses the agencies that oversee immigration, including Customs and Border Protection, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Homeland Security now has a workforce of more than 240,000, making it the government’s third-biggest department, behind Defense and Veterans Affairs.

The Transportation Security Administration, which screens passengers at airports, was absorbed into Homeland Security just a year after it was created in response to 9/11 in November 2001. Conservatives at the time expressed concern that the new agency was unnecessarily bureaucratic and gave too much power to the government.

“Before 9/11, the prevailing conservative/libertarian/Republican opinion of the national-security state — of any government effort to protect Americans at the point of a gun and the touch of a rubber glove — was mistrust,” Slate reported. “The second most common opinion was fear.”

Republicans’ ire for the TSA survived a decade after the agency’s creation. Then-Rep. Paul Broun (R-Ga.) in 2011 said Americans were “no safer today than they were before 9/11,” according to Forbes. The GOP’s 2012 presidential platform called for the privatization of airport security.

[Border officials not told of massive surveillance breach until three weeks after subcontractor was first alerted]

Calls to abolish Homeland Security are now made year after year, in publications ranging from policy journals to mainstream news outlets. In a tweet from 2018 shared by Ocasio-Cortez on Thursday, Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.) recalled a time when conservatives viewed Homeland Security as overly bureaucratic.

“Conservatives used to want to abolish DHS — as well as many other departments and agencies that bloat government,” wrote Amash, who announced on the Fourth of July that he was leaving the Republican Party. “If only today’s members of Congress cared as much about defending the Constitution as they do about defending ICE, an agency that’s existed only since 2003.”

The bill, H.R. 299, enables homebuyers using a VA loan to borrow above the 2019 limit of $484,350 for most counties, without any down payment.

A VA spokesperson told HousingWire that the loan limit will be lifted for loans that are guaranteed or appraised on or after January 1, 2020, and that guidance for lenders would be coming ahead of this date, published on the VA home loan circular page of its website.

The VA also clarified other changes that will go into effect as a result of the bill.

In addition to alleviating limits for veterans looking to purchase a home, H.R. 299 temporarily increase rates for certain loans by 0.15-0.30%, the VA said.

The slight bump in loan fees is intended to help finance health care costs for veterans who are suffering the effects of Agent Orange exposure as a result of their service.

Additional changes to the VA’s loan guaranty program include the elimination of funding fee differences for borrowers who are veterans versus those who are members of the Reserve.

It also removes the loan limit for the Native American Direct Loan Program, exempts Purple Heart recipients from paying loan fees, and authorizes VA-designated appraisers to rely on third parties for appraisal-related information.

The bill’s passage comes after years of lobbying on behalf of numerous trade groups, including the National Association of Realtors, which teamed with other housing industry trade groups to ensure veterans’ health care benefits would be extended without a significant increase to VA loan fees.

Now that the bill has passed, it is expected to “fast-track” disability compensation for as many as 90,000 affected former service members, according to military.com.

President Trump and the citizenship question: Editorial Board Roundtable,https://www.cleveland.com,"['Editorial Board', 'Cleveland.Com', 'The Plain Dealer']",07-13-2019,2019,7,https://www.cleveland.com/opinion/2019/07/president-trump-and-the-citizenship-question-editorial-board-roundtable.html,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi charged this week that President Donald Trump just wants to “make America white again,” as Trump backed off his attempts to get a citizenship question added to the 2020 U.S. Census. The president instead issued an executive order directing federal agencies to share their citizenship-related data with the Commerce Department.

The July 11 order also set up an interagency task force “with a goal of making available to the [Commerce] Department administrative records showing citizenship data for 100 percent of the population;” ordered Commerce to consider ways to ""expand the collection of citizenship data in the future” and directed it to “strengthen its efforts, consistent with law, to obtain State administrative records concerning citizenship.”

The moves follow the federal courts’ refusal to accept the administration’s attempts to replace its legal team on the citizenship question. The prior team had accepted the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision that the Trump administration could not add the question to the 2020 Census.

The high court’s June 27 ruling had followed revelations of internal memos from a Republican operative that suggested the real rationale for adding the citizenship question was to puncture the political clout of Democratic states and areas.

However, on July 3, President Trump issued a surprise tweet saying the administration was “absolutely moving forward” despite the Supreme Court ruling to add the question to the 2020 census, and, in an unguarded moment, told reporters the rationale was “districting.”

The News Reports about the Department of Commerce dropping its quest to put the Citizenship Question on the Census is incorrect or, to state it differently, FAKE! We are absolutely moving forward, as we must, because of the importance of the answer to this question. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 3, 2019

Trump now has ended his quest to add the question to the census. In the background, meanwhile, are other administration moves that critics argue also are geared to trying to depress census participation by communities of color, immigrants and other marginalized groups. Among them: a “test” census questionnaire circulating to nearly 250,000 households that includes the citizenship question; reduced regular Census personnel to handle follow-ups with those who initially don’t respond; and a greater digitization of the questionnaire process.

So what does our editorial board roundtable make of this? Has the president acted appropriately in trying to expand the government’s access to citizenship data on U.S. residents?

Ted Diadiun, editorial board member:

This argument draws a bright line between those whose concern is helping to keep people hidden here illegally, and those who want everyone – immigrants included – to obey the law. Nancy Pelosi to the contrary, this is not about making America white again. It’s about following and enforcing the law, inconvenient as that might be to her and others who are pleased to ignore it when it suits their purposes.

Thomas Suddes, editorial writer:

President Trump (at the moment, anyway) has backed off from using the 2020 Census as a kind of immigrant trap. Congratulations. Common sense won.

Lisa Garvin, editorial board member:

You have to ask yourself, why does the Trump administration want citizenship information so badly that it’s willing to circumvent the Supreme Court? His order to dig through government agency records smacks of desperation. Trump’s own Freudian slip to reporters and evidence from deceased Republican operative Thomas Hofeller leave little doubt that the intent in gathering everyone’s citizenship status can only be nefarious.

Mary Cay Doherty, editorial board member:

President Trump rightly changed course; his hands were tied. But the citizenship question remains important. Illegal immigrants should not count toward congressional apportionment. If Congress secured our borders and reformed immigration law, the citizenship question wouldn’t be so critical. But they won’t, so it is. And Democrats fan needless fears. Digitization will encourage census participation so fewer workers are needed to reach the 10 percent of adults who are non-internet users.

Eric Foster, editorial board member:

In a couple of years, I expect someone to write a book about what it took to get the president to change course on the Census issue. Who was the Don McGahn in this scenario? “I know what you want to do, Mr. President, but the Supreme Court just said .…” The next president might want to give that person a Congressional Medal of Freedom.

Victor Ruiz, editorial board member:

Another failed and pathetic attempt by our president to break the law. This country’s demographics are changing rapidly, and this was an intentional and desperate attempt to conserve an America that has exploited many. The changing face of this country cannot be stopped, and while history will judge our current president, my question is how much longer will his supporters allow him to act as if he’s above the law?

Elizabeth Sullivan, director of opinion, cleveland.com:

President Trump has made no secret of his partisan political motives in trying to have Big Brother “document” who is a citizen and who is not. The best and most lasting cure: Congress needs to grow up and pass real immigration reform.

The department told the House Intelligence and Judiciary Committees last week that it was opposed to the testimony and had communicated its view to the two former members of Mr. Mueller’s team, Aaron Zebley and James L. Quarles III, according to a senior congressional official familiar with the discussions. A Justice Department official confirmed that account and said that the department had instructed both men not to appear.

It is unclear what effect the Justice Department’s intervention will have on the men’s eventual appearances, but it raises the prospect that a deal lawmakers thought they had struck last month for testimony from Mr. Mueller, the former special counsel, and the two prosecutors could still unravel.

Both Mr. Zebley and Mr. Quarles have left the Justice Department and are now private citizens, meaning that the department most likely cannot actually block their testimony. But the department’s view — depending on how strongly it is expressed — could have a chilling effect on two longtime employees and give them cover to avoid testifying."

Amid the many news releases issued each week by the Environmental Protection Agency, a few stand out. Such as these:

• “Politico Misleads On Trump EPA’s Progress Cleaning Up Superfund Sites.”

• “The Hill [newspaper] Gets It Wrong On New EPA FOIA Regulation.”

• “National Correspondent Misleads on Wheeler’s Remarks.”

While the Trump administration is not known for velvety smooth relations with the news media, federal agencies are far more likely to ignore reporters than to officially scold them. Not the EPA. Reporters whom the agency deems to have misreported can expect to hear about it, and not just through a polite phone call or an email requesting a correction.

Instead, the EPA goes public.

“A reader of Politico would have been rightfully confused about the results” of an inspector general’s report about a Superfund task force, the EPA declared in a June 24 release. “It is only fair to ask why they chose to ignore the key findings of this report.”

A day later, the EPA’s communications wing weighed in on the Hill’s story about a new regulation. “The Hill used a false premise and ran a grossly inaccurate story,” it said. It went on to list “THE HILL’s FALSE QUOTES,” “MORE OF THE HILL’S FALSE QUOTES” and “MORE FALSE REPORTING FROM THE HILL.”

A spokeswoman for the Hill, Lisa Dallos, said the publication stands by its story. Politico’s spokesman, Brad Dayspring, characterized the Superfund story as “fair and fact based.”

The EPA’s unusual approach is in some ways a return to its recent past. Under former administrator Scott Pruitt, who resigned a year ago amid various scandals, the agency attacked reporters on a semiregular basis. The pushback sometimes took on a nasty tone. Pruitt’s spokesman, Jahan Wilcox, who has also left the agency, once responded to a reporter who was seeking comment for a story by telling her, “You have a great day, you’re a piece of trash.”

Things simmered down with Pruitt’s departure, but have lately begun to grow toxic again.

The EPA’s top media manager says the approach nowadays is kinder and gentler but still firm. “I’m trying not to get into name calling or picking fights,” said Corry Schiermeyer, associate administrator for public affairs at the agency. “I honestly just want to ensure that when anyone reports about our policies and issues that the reporting is correct and accurate.”

The news releases, she said, are a way to establish an official record before a disputed story goes viral on social media: “If we sat back and didn’t do anything, it can spin out of control.”

Reporters on the beat, however, are somewhat baffled by the agency’s aggressiveness, especially because Pruitt’s replacement, former energy-industry lobbyist Andrew Wheeler, is more low-key than his predecessor.

Asked who decides when to publicly call out a news organization, Schiermeyer hedged. “That’s a good question,” she said after a pause. “I wouldn’t say it’s the policy of Corry Schiermeyer’s office. I would say it’s often done on a case-by-case basis, by my office or others within the agency who feel that something was an egregious mischaracterization.”

That includes Wheeler, who Schiermeyer said objected to a tweet by Yahoo News correspondent Alexander Nazaryan about a speech Wheeler gave in June. Wheeler’s apparent peeve led to a news release asserting that Nazaryan “deliberately spread false information on twitter by misreporting Administrator Wheeler’s comments.” In response, Nazaryan tweeted Yahoo News “stands by the accuracy of our reporting.” Nazaryan declined to comment for this story.

News sources typically seek redress through discussion and negotiation with reporters and their editors. But the EPA’s critiques of Nazaryan and Politico had one striking difference: The agency posted its news releases without seeking a corrections or retractions the organizations, effectively blindsiding both. Schiermeyer acknowledged officials failed to do so, but said neither Politico nor Yahoo contacted the agency before publication.

Most recently, the agency trained its fire on the Society of Environmental Journalists (SEJ), in effect challenging en masse reporters who cover the EPA. Agency officials objected to a letter written by the group to Wheeler about the agency’s new Freedom of Information Act regulations. In a news release, the agency criticized the letter, saying it included “numerous inaccuracies that were regurgitated from false articles.”

“They took it as an opportunity to discredit or suggest environmental journalists were misleading the public,” said Bobby Magill, SEJ’s president. “It’s part of a larger pattern of trying to smear the press.”

Magill, a reporter for Bloomberg Environment, said he objected to “the tone” of the EPA’s response. “It’s one thing to set the record straight,” he said. “It’s a whole other thing to suggest you’re intentionally misleading people.”

But by rebutting in such a public way, the EPA risks calling more attention to the stories it’s disputing, a potential example of the Streisand effect, in which an effort to rebut or suppress information has the unintended consequence of drawing more interest to it (the phenomenon was named for legendary singer and actor Barbra Streisand, whose attempts to keep an aerial photograph of her Malibu home out of public view led to a spike of interest in it). The disputed Politico story, for example, was available only through Politico’s subscription service, so few would have known about it before the EPA complained.

Schiermeyer, however, thinks the approach can prevent worse outcomes. The public naming and shaming “can slow things down and sometimes stop misinformation from continuing to be repurposed,” she said. “You might not be able to stop the first reporter, but at least the second and third and fourth reporter” will see information the agency considers accurate."

Intelligence official resigns after White House blocks his climate change testimony,https://www.pressherald.com,['Email Writer'],07-10-2019,2019,7,https://www.pressherald.com/2019/07/10/intelligence-official-resigns-after-white-house-blocks-his-climate-change-testimony/,"WASHINGTON – A State Department intelligence official who was blocked by the White House from submitting written congressional testimony on climate change last month is resigning from his post.

Rod Schoonover – who worked in the Office of the Geographer and Global Issues’ Bureau of Intelligence and Research – spoke about the security risks the U.S. faces due to climate change before the House Intelligence Committee on June 5. But White House officials would not let him submit the bureau’s written statement that climate impacts could be “possibly catastrophic” after the State Department refused to cut references to federal scientific findings on climate change.

Individuals familiar with the matter, who asked for anonymity in order to speak frankly, said that Schoonover chose to leave voluntarily. But the incident that helped lead to his departure underscores the extent to which climate science has become contested terrain under the current administration.

Andrew Rosenberg, who directs the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said in a phone interview Wednesday that federal experts should be free to provide their expertise with policymakers, even if it is at odds with the views of whoever occupies the Oval Office.

“This isn’t carrying forward your political opinions,” Rosenberg said, “this is bringing the work you’re hired to do in a policy setting.”

President Donald Trump has repeatedly questioned the scientific consensus that human activity is driving recent climate change, and that the planet’s warming poses a major security risk to the United States.

Asked about the matter Wednesday, a State Department official confirmed that Schoonover would step down July 12.

Schoonover, who has served in the federal government for roughly a decade, could not be reached for comment. Before working at the Bureau of Intelligence and Research, he had served as director of environment and natural resources at the National Intelligence Council and as a full professor of chemistry and biochemistry at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo.

Three divisions of the White House, the Office of Legislative Affairs, the Office of Management and Budget and the National Security Council all raised objections to parts of the intelligence bureau’s testimony, according to documents obtained by The Washington Post. Ultimately, the Office of Legislative Affairs made the decision not to submit the document to the House Intelligence Committee.

One of the statements White House officials objected to was the observation, “Absent extensive mitigating factors or events, we see few plausible future scenarios where significant – possibly catastrophic – harm does not arise from the compounded effects of climate change.”

Last month, after the Post reported that the testimony had been suppressed, the panel’s chairman, Adam Schiff, D-Calif., demanded the heads of two federal intelligence agencies provide documents about the incident.

Rosenberg said that even though Schoonover may have left on his own, the controversy surrounding his testimony could intimidate other experts within the federal government’s ranks.

“That’s just a terrible signal to federal professionals broadly, to people in the State Department who don’t know what they can say in their relations with other countries and the Hill,” he said.

Even as the fallout over last month’s climate hearing continues, the White House has decided to shelve one controversial idea: establishing a group to question the federal government’s own findings on climate change. The task force, championed by NSC senior director William Happer, has been under discussion for months but ran into opposition from members of the intelligence and defense community as well as some of Trump’s own scientific appointees.

E&E News first reported Tuesday that the climate science panel had been indefinitely postponed. Two individuals briefed on the matter, who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record, confirmed the delay.

Myron Ebell, who directs the Center for Energy and Environment at the conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute, attributed the decision to a political calculation by Trump’s reelection campaign consultants, saying they effectively told him: “We have polling showing that you need to stress your environmental accomplishments and not start controversial things that will get you bad press, like going after climate science.”

Officials at the National Security Council declined to comment on the status of the aborted climate panel.

Francesco Femia, CEO of the Council on Strategic Risks and co-founder of the Center for Climate and Security, welcomed the decision to nix the task force.

“The very lowest baseline is that the White House should never politicize science or intelligence analysis, so this isn’t anything to celebrate under normal circumstances,” Femia said in an email.

“But it is still good to see this politically-motivated effort fail. The national security, military, intelligence and science communities came out strongly against it, and the result affirms that standing up for the integrity of our democratic system matters, especially since too many of our political leaders won’t.”

VA Appoints First-Ever Artificial Intelligence Director,https://www.nextgov.com,['Jack Corrigan'],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.nextgov.com/emerging-tech/2019/07/va-appoints-first-ever-artificial-intelligence-director/158365/,"The Veterans Affairs Department on Wednesday appointed its first director of artificial intelligence as part of a broader push to expand research into the emerging tech.

The agency tapped Dr. Gil Alterovitz, a Harvard Medical School professor and member of the Computational Health Informatics Program at Boston Children’s Hospital, to spearhead its efforts to improve veteran care through AI-enabled solutions. Alterovitz will be based within the agency’s research and development office, according to a blog post on the VA website.

Beyond his professional medical experience, Alterovitz comes to the job with a number of government bona fides under his belt. He served as a presidential innovation fellow in 2017 and recently helped the White House update its national AI research and development strategy. According to his LinkedIn profile, he also sat on the Obama administration’s Precision Medicine Task Force.

In his new role, much of Alterovitz’s work will center on deriving more insights from the troves of data the agency holds on the more than 9 million veterans in its care, according to the department. Because AI can analyze so much information at once, medical professionals see enormous potential for the tech to spur new medical breakthroughs, improve diagnoses and personalize patient treatment.

“That is what you need to do optimal AI—a lot of deep knowledge,” Alterovitz said in the post. “AI is key to really taking advantage of that data to help vets and potentially others, as well.”

According to the post, he’s already leading an effort to connect the department with AI experts in academia and industry, which could ultimately lead to more research collaboration and information sharing. Alterovitz is also taking stock of the various AI projects already underway in different parts of the department, the department wrote.

“Given how health care is evolving, AI is really the only way to move forward in terms of reducing costs and providing better care,” Alterovitz said."
Looking Back At Secretary Alex Acosta's Tenure At The Labor Department,https://www.npr.org,[],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/2019/07/12/741237553/looking-back-at-secretary-alex-acostas-tenure-at-the-labor-department,"Looking Back At Secretary Alex Acosta's Tenure At The Labor Department

Secretary Alex Acosta stepped down Friday from the Department of Labor. NPR's Audie Cornish talks with Bloomberg Law senior reporter Ben Penn about Acosta's tenure at the department.

AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:

Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta resigned today. His resignation comes just days after his role in the more-than-decade-old plea deal of multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein was spelled out. Epstein was accused of sex crimes but received a light sentence after pleading guilty to lesser charges.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

ALEX ACOSTA: I do not think it is right and fair for this administration's Labor Department to have Epstein as the focus rather than the incredible economy that we have today. And so I called the president this morning; I told him that I thought the right thing was to step aside.

CORNISH: That's Acosta at the White House, standing next to President Trump, who said this.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But I just want to let you know - this was him, not me. Because I'm with him.

CORNISH: So what was Acosta like as secretary of labor? To learn more about Acosta's tenure, we have Ben Penn. He's senior reporter, covering labor and employment for Bloomberg Law. And welcome to the studio.

BEN PENN: Thank you for having me.

CORNISH: So to begin, this is a labor secretary who didn't have a business background, didn't have a labor background. So what made him unique to this position?

PENN: He came from a legal background. He was the dean of Florida International University Law School for about the previous eight years before he became labor secretary. He had been a U.S. attorney based out of South Florida - obviously, because of the Epstein case. So...

CORNISH: It seemed like he would have been on a judicial track.

PENN: Yes. So there was wide speculation, in part due to the fact that he is good friends with the Federalist Society's Leonard Leo, that his ultimate dream was to become a federal judge, and that is no longer a reality for him now that he is embroiled in the Epstein scandal. But it was definitely something that played a role in how he ruled the Department of Labor in a more legally-minded, deliberate, cautious manner.

CORNISH: How did his role change over time?

PENN: So in his first year and a half as labor secretary, he faced criticism from the business community and some of the more conservative forces in the White House for stalling deregulatory actions that businesses would have favored, such as a rule that would have been a more moderate approach than the Obama administration to determining who is eligible for overtime. And what we saw then, starting in 2019, once Mick Mulvaney became acting chief of staff, was Acosta really had some of his power taken away from him.

I reported earlier this year that Mulvaney instituted a formalized system where, whenever White House assistants and DOL agency heads below Acosta reached an impasse on a deregulatory matter, it would get automatically elevated up to Mulvaney for a final decision. And frequently, Acosta was getting overruled to the point that the Labor Department stopped exercising this system altogether because they knew that Mulvaney was going to have final say.

CORNISH: To that end, what kind of criticism did he get from, say, labor activists? How was he viewed?

PENN: Interestingly, labor activists did not really come out full throttle against Alex Acosta, and really, that's because they feel that Acosta gave them a fair shot. He was not a type of Cabinet member who sought to destroy the agency from the inside out, like other Trump Cabinet members have been criticized for. The perception was, among labor activists, that this was about as good of a labor secretary that they could ask for.

CORNISH: Who might take his place? What would the White House be looking for?

PENN: So right now, Acting Labor Secretary Patrick Pizzella - or at least he'll become acting labor secretary effective one week from today. Pizzella is well-liked by some members of the White House, I'm told, so it wouldn't surprise me at all if he already has an inside track on the nomination, if there were to be one.

CORNISH: That's Ben Penn, senior reporter with Bloomberg Law. Thanks for your reporting.

PENN: Thank you very much for having me.

EPA scientist confronts administrator over climate crisis at award ceremony,https://www.cnn.com,['Cat Gloria'],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/12/politics/epa-wheeler-employee-protest-climate-crisis/index.html,"Washington (CNN) An Environmental Protection Agency scientist confronted EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler about agency working conditions and how it is approaching the climate crisis Wednesday morning at an award ceremony in Washington.

""Administrator Wheeler, I'd like to ask you to please support a fair contract for EPA workers,"" Loreen Targos, an EPA scientist in the Great Lakes area, is seen saying in a video provided by the union. ""Please reward my award-winning labor by negotiating a fair contract.""

Targos was receiving a Silver Medal award on stage at EPA headquarters when she unveiled a banner reading ""Care about EPA workers having a fair contract to address public health & climate change, Do you?"" She also criticized the agency's recent unilateral change to the master bargaining agreement with the American Federation of Government Employees, one of several unions representing EPA employees.

Targos said a fair contract is needed to continue research into ""fighting climate change.""

This comes on the back of several instances where government workers have spoken out against the administration's policies, including when employees of the Department of Agriculture turned their backs to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue at a meeting last month in protest of the announced office relocation to Kansas City.

"Dem-led House checks Trump on Iran, votes to repeal president's war authority",https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Lauren Meier']",07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/jul/12/house-votes-repeal-presidents-war-authority/,"The House voted Friday to repeal the 2002 measure authorizing presidents to respond to the September 11 attacks, an open-ended authority that cleared the way for the 2003 invasion of Iraq and has been used by Presidents Bush, Obama and Trump to justify missions and deployments around the world over the past 17 years.

California Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee’s amendment specified that “any new authorization for the use of military force to replace the 2001 [Authorization for Use of Military Force] should include a sunset clause” that clearly defines its objective.

Lawmakers have long agreed that a new AUMF is necessary and that the 2001 and 2002 versions now in place are hopelessly outdated. However, there is far less of a consensus on what should replace it and how much latitude to give the president.

The House adopted the amendment by a 242-128 margin. It declares that the 2001 AUMF “has been utilized well beyond the scope that Congress intended, that it has served a blank check for any president to wage war at any time and any place.”

The amendment was written as tensions between the U.S. and Iran reached a boiling point and lawmakers feared President Trump could use military force against Tehran without Congress’ approval. Citing his existing authority, Mr. Trump said he ordered a planned retaliatory airstrike on Iran in the wake of the downing of an unmanned American military drone before calling it off at the last moment last month.

The Republican-controlled Senate’s version of the underlying bill, the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, does not contain a similar provision on the AUMF, and the White House is expected to oppose the Lee amendment as well.

Second federal judge blocks Justice Dept. bid to replace census attorneys,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Matt Zapotosky', 'National Security Reporter Covering The Justice Department', ""Matt Zapotosky Covers The Justice Department For The Washington Post'S National Security Team.

U.S. District Judge George J. Hazel in Maryland wrote in a six-page order that he shared the concerns of a federal judge in New York who similarly blocked the Justice Department maneuver this week, but noted that in his district, unlike the other judge’s, attorneys do not have to provide “satisfactory reasons for withdrawal.” He wrote he was concerned that “a shift in counsel at this late stage may be disruptive to an already complicated and expedited case.”

But Hazel also wrote that he was “inclined to ultimately permit the withdrawal” — if the Justice Department would, among other things, provide assurances that the new team was “aware of and prepared to address potential conflicts between recent developments in this case and positions repeatedly taken before this Court by the withdrawing attorneys.”

[Federal judge rejects Trump administration’s bid to swap out lawyers for census case on citizenship question]

The decision marks yet another headache for the Justice Department in what has become a fraught case. Earlier this week, the department sought to replace the team of lawyers assigned to it, after at least some career attorneys on the case grew frustrated with the Trump administration’s sudden shift in position on whether it could keep fighting.

That fight, which once seemed at its end, intensified Wednesday when a group of conservative lawmakers wrote a letter to Attorney General William P. Barr urging him to support President Trump adding the question to the census by executive order.

The letter controversially states that assessing the citizenship question is “germane to carrying out our duty to apportion representatives.”

The Trump administration has denied that adding the question is meant to boost its political fortunes through redistricting, but many Democrats charge that the question is meant to scare away Latinos from participating in the census, resulting in an undercount of that population.

The department filed motions this week to remove the lawyers in cases that are ongoing in multiple federal courts.

U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman of the Southern District of New York was the first judge to block the move, though he said the Justice Department could refile its request and provide more specific reasons for the change.

Hazel wrote that, because the Justice Department already had entered new lawyers into the case, his denying their request to replace the team would “not prevent the attorneys who have been representing the Defendants’ interests thus far from simply receding into the background as new counsel take the lead.”

He wrote he was “less focused on the formality of whose names appear at the bottom of future pleadings and more focused on the need for a transition of counsel that does not disrupt the orderly administration of justice.”

Hazel added that “while the Court is inclined to ultimately permit the withdrawal, under the unique circumstances of this request, more specific assurances will first need to be provided.”

The department, he wrote, would “need to provide specific assurances to the Court that one or more of the withdrawing attorneys are remaining available to the new DOJ team, as necessary, or provide detailed reasoning for why such an arrangement is untenable.” He questioned whether the new team could proceed without any help from the previous lawyers.

“As a practical matter, the Court cannot fathom how it would be possible, at this juncture, for a wholesale change in Defendants’ representation not to have some impact on the orderly resolution of these proceedings unless Defendants provide assurance of an orderly transition between the withdrawing attorneys and new counsel,” Hazel wrote. “This requires more than just the effort of the new DOJ team, but the involvement and availability of the withdrawing attorneys.”

Hazel also noted that the new lawyers should be prepared to address questions about the previous lawyers’ possibly misleading assertions to the court. Just last week, those lawyers believed the matter was over, because of an imminent deadline to start printing census forms and a Supreme Court decision that prevented the administration from adding a citizenship question. But Trump ordered the department to keep looking for ways to continue the fight, raising questions about what it had earlier told the court about the deadline.

“Defendants must realize that a change in counsel does not create a clean slate for a party to proceed as if prior representations made to the Court were not in fact made,” Hazel wrote. “A new DOJ team will need to be prepared to address these, and other, previous representations made by the withdrawing attorneys at the appropriate juncture.”

Justice Dept. Watchdog Is Preparing to Deliver Verdict on the Russia Investigation,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Adam Goldman', 'Charlie Savage', 'Matthew Rosenberg']",07-09-2019,2019,7,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/us/politics/ig-russia-investigation-steele.html,"Mr. Trump’s allies have sought to conflate the much broader Russia investigation with the dossier and have increased their attacks since the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, concluded that while the campaign welcomed and expected to benefit from Russia’s election interference, the evidence did not prove any conspiracy.

Investigators working for Mr. Horowitz have asked witnesses about whether the F.B.I. properly opened the Russia investigation and how the bureau handled a pair of informants, including Mr. Steele, whose work was financed by Mrs. Clinton’s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee. Reuters first reported the investigators’ interview of Mr. Steele. They have conducted more than 100 interviews and have begun drafting their report, Mr. Horowitz wrote to lawmakers last month.

Mr. Horowitz is expected to answer whether Mr. Steele’s information played a role in opening the Russia investigation, code-named Crossfire Hurricane. Former law enforcement officials have insisted it did not, saying they opened the inquiry in July 2016. The Steele dossier did not reach the relevant agents until Sept. 19, 2016, nearly two months later, people familiar with the matter have said.

But the primary focus of the inspector general’s inquiry is the role that Mr. Steele’s information played in investigators’ effort to obtain court permission to wiretap Carter Page, a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court approved the application on Oct. 21, 2016, about a month after Mr. Page had left the campaign, and the wiretap order — one of 1,559 the court issued that year — was renewed three times in 2017, including twice by Trump-era Justice Department officials.

In August 2016, a month before agents on the Russia investigation received the Steele dossier, they had already started discussions with the Justice Department about seeking a wiretap order targeting Mr. Page, according to people familiar with the investigation’s timeline. Agents identified Mr. Page as a potential conduit between the campaign and Moscow, if there was any, because he had close business ties to Russia, had traveled there in July after joining the campaign, and had been targeted as a potential recruit by Russian intelligence agents in 2013 — yet did not seem concerned when the F.B.I. talked to him about it.

Still, the arrival of the dossier in September kicked the deliberations over whether to seek a wiretap order into a higher gear, according to people familiar with the Russia investigation. By adding further weight to their reasons to be suspicious of Mr. Page, Mr. Steele’s information helped officials overcome bureaucratic reluctance stemming from fears that any leak of the existence of such a wiretap would be politically radioactive."
Ex-State Department Worker Gets 40 Months In Prison For Secret Dealings With China,https://www.npr.org,['Sasha Ingber'],07-10-2019,2019,7,https://www.npr.org/2019/07/10/740412768/ex-state-department-worker-gets-40-months-in-prison-for-secret-dealings-with-chi,"Ex-State Department Worker Gets 40 Months In Prison For Secret Dealings With China

A former State Department employee was sentenced to 40 months in prison for concealing her interactions with two Chinese intelligence agents, along with the extravagant gifts they gave her in exchange for government information.

Candace Claiborne began to work as an office management specialist at the State Department in 1999, according to court documents. She had a top secret security clearance and served overseas in such cities as Baghdad, Beijing and Shanghai.

But she ignored her responsibility to report foreign contacts, prosecutors said as they announced her sentence on Tuesday.

""Claiborne was entrusted with privileged information as a U.S. government employee, and she abused that trust at the expense of our nation's security,"" Acting Assistant Director John Selleck of the FBI's Washington Field Office said in a statement. ""The targeting of U.S. security clearance holders by Chinese intelligence services is a constant threat we face,"" he added.

Over the course of five years, Chinese agents allegedly gave Claiborne and her family ""tens of thousands of dollars"" in gifts and perks – including wired cash, a monthly stipend, overseas trips, tuition at a Chinese fashion school and an apartment that was fully furnished. In exchange for the gifts, Claiborne gave them a window into the State Department's inner workings through copies of internal documents about dignitary visits and other topics.

Prosecutors said she told a co-conspirator that the agents were ""spies"" and wrote in her journal that she could ""Generate 20k in 1 year"" by working with one of the agents.

Federal public defender David Walker Bos, Claiborne's attorney, did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment.

Her arrest came in March 2017 after a sting operation in January of that year. An FBI agent, posing as a Chinese agent, approached Claiborne on a street in Washington, D.C. She welcomed him to her home and their lengthy discussion ended with the undercover agent thanking her for helping the ""Ministry,"" NPR previously reported.

After the arrest, she pleaded not guilty to charges of obstruction and making false statements to the FBI. In April 2019, she pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to defraud the United States. In the plea agreement, prosecutors agreed to drop the other charges.

A judge ordered Claiborne detained pending sentencing, but she requested to self-surrender on June 5, the document stated.

In addition to a 40-month prison sentence, Claiborne received three years of supervised release and a fine of $40,000.

Her sentence comes after former CIA officer Jerry Chun Shing Lee pleaded guilty this spring to spying for China – and as U.S. officials have warned that Chinese espionage is the country's most serious security threat."

Rep.

Devin Nunes, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said Tuesday he believes the public will soon see that much of the Trump-Russia dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele was ""made up.""

According to a New York Times report, FBI officials questioned one of Steele's sources and ""came to suspect that the man might have added his own interpretations to reports from his own sources that he passed on to Mr. Steele, calling into question the reliability of the information.""

Steele was interviewed as part of Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz's probe of how the FBI used the unverified dossier, including its role in obtaining a surveillance warrant against then-Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

Reacting on ""Fox News @ Night,"" Nunes, R-Calif., said Steele refused to talk to the House Intelligence Committee while he served as chairman in 2017 and 2018.

""This is a man who made up this entire document. As you're starting to see it's unraveling, his sources are not real or if they are real they're second and third hand. So a lot of this is just made up out of whole cloth,"" said Nunes.

Shannon Bream then asked Nunes about a Politico report which suggested Steele's 16-hour grilling led to ""new and important information"" and could therefore ""dampen expectations among the president's allies who’ve claimed that Steele’s sensational dossier was used improperly by the bureau to 'spy' on the campaign.""

Nunes scoffed at that notion, saying either Steele had credible sources or he did not.

""The fact remains that they used that garbage that was paid for by a political campaign before a court,"" said Nunes, adding that there is information that is ""equally as bad or worse"" that has not been made public about Steele's work."

""Deportations occur all the time. Of those who have been ordered deported by an immigration judge, hopefully after they have exhausted their appeal rights and had an opportunity to have their asylum case heard, we simply have to enforce the law, particularly if someone has been ordered deported,"" Johnson said on Morning Joe Friday.

""In other words, they’ve exhausted all their appeal rights. And so, it's important for migrants to know they have rights. But enforcement actions themselves are not extraordinary,"" he added.

Johnson has been a unique voice in speaking out against Democrats' recent rhetoric on immigration. When Democrats started to criticize the Trump administration for keeping migrants in ""cages,"" Johnson said that practice did not begin when Trump became president.

“Chain link barriers, partitions, fences, cages, whatever you want to call them, were not invented on Jan. 20, 2017, OK?"" he said.

He also called out the 2020 Democrats' proposal to decriminalize border crossing because that ""is tantamount to declaring publicly that we have open borders."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Shuran Huang/NPR Shuran Huang/NPR

Thursday marks one year since a divided Senate confirmed Brian Benczkowski to lead the Justice Department's criminal division.

The 51-48 vote reflected Democrats' worry that he'd try to interfere with the investigation into Russia's attack on the 2016 election.

Things didn't work out that way.

Benczkowski promised to consult with career officials about any possible conflicts with the special counsel probe, but he said this week that never became necessary.

""I've kept the promises that I made,"" Benczkowski said. ""I didn't have anything to do with the Mueller investigation. Nothing came across my desk. There was nothing that I had to deal with.""

Instead, Benczkowski has spent the past year advancing the administration's priorities: punishing transnational gangs; cracking down on corrupt doctors and pharmacists who fuel the opioid crisis in Appalachia and beyond; and making the process of investigating companies and business executives more transparent.

United States v. Guzman

It started with what Benczkowski said could be the biggest criminal trial in U.S. history: the effort to bring to justice former Sinaloa cartel leader Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman.

That trial extended nearly three months and coincided with a federal government shutdown, bringing uncertainty to DOJ lawyers about whether their hotel bills would ever be paid.

In the end, prosecutors from the criminal division at Justice worked with their counterparts in U.S. attorney's offices in Brooklyn and Miami to secure conviction of Guzman on all 10 of the drug and conspiracy charges.

Authorities recently asked for forfeiture in the amount of $12,666,181,704. Guzman faces mandatory life imprisonment when he is sentenced in New York City on July 17.

Benczkowski said he plans to be in court to support the team.

DOJ's opioid strike force

Benczkowski expressed concern early in his tenure that DOJ wasn't targeting the region that was hardest hit by the opioid crisis. So the criminal division put together a strike force that spans 10 areas in Appalachia.

He secured approval and funding to send 14 health care fraud prosecutors into the region, culminating in dozens of indictments of doctors, pharmacists and other medical professionals last April.

That team continues to crunch data from health care providers and insurance programs to help uncover fraud. Benczkowski said he anticipates another round of prosecutions in Appalachia before the end of the year.

""We're going to keep going at it until we drive down the addiction rate and we drive down the overdose rate in those districts,"" he said.

The white-collar cases

Benczkowski said his third priority is bringing more ""transparency"" to white-collar crime investigations.

So the Justice Department issued new guidelines for prosecutors about recommending independent monitors to oversee errant corporations. Benczkowski also revamped the way that prosecutors assess whether a company is complying with the Justice Department.

Now, DOJ publishes online the times it declines to bring charges against companies that have behaved appropriately and deserved credit for that.

That sends a message, he said, and it makes his own prosecutors work ""a little bit harder."" Lawyers defending companies can point to those decisions and fashion arguments for their own leniency.

""Certainly it's going to give outside lawyers a little bit more ammunition to advocate with,"" he said, arguing that transparency will make government decisions more just.

Benczkowski's comment may prove controversial with consumer protection and shareholder advocates, as well as critics who argue the Justice Department has abandoned its responsibility to police corporate misconduct.

But the Justice Department said it has charged 211 people with fraud so far this year, about half of whom have pleaded guilty, an increase from last year in the same period. Benczkowski also said financial recoveries from corporate resolutions this year will be ""well north"" of $2 billion, about double the amount in 2018.

Benczkowski said he expects to pick a new chief of the DOJ fraud section, which prosecutes such offenses, by the end of the month.

Robert Zink has been filling the job in an acting role since January and may be in line to get the job on a permanent basis, two sources told NPR.

The ransomware menace

Prosecutors are also in the middle of responding to a wave of ransomware attacks that have victimized small and midsize cities in Florida, Georgia, Maryland and elsewhere.

Benczkowski said criminal groups are becoming sophisticated in how they identify their targets: municipalities big enough to afford to pay ransom, but not so sophisticated they're prepared for these kinds of threats.

Benczkowski said he has a message for those cities:

""Invest in the basic cybersecurity protections for your systems that you need, have redundant offline systems that you can turn to in the event that you're attacked, come to law enforcement early in the process ... so that we can help you get better prepared."""
US yield curve continued to steepen overnight; Fed Chair Powell’s Senate testimony didn’t break any new ground; equities and currencies have consolidated overnight; NZ 10 year swap rate traded 6bps hi,https://www.interest.co.nz,[],07-12-2019,2019,7,https://www.interest.co.nz/currencies/100669/us-yield-curve-continued-steepen-overnight-fed-chair-powell%E2%80%99s-senate-testimony,"The US yield curve continued to steepen overnight, with a higher than expected US core CPI release and a very weak 30 year US bond auction pushing up longer-dated rates while shorter-dated rates remained anchored by expectations of near-term Fed rate cuts. Fed Chair Powell’s Senate testimony didn’t break any new ground and the market prices 31bps (of cuts) for the Fed’s meeting later this month. Equities and currencies have consolidated overnight after moving sharply in response to Powell’s dovish testimony to Congress the previous night.

After falling in response to Powell’s dovish testimony to Congress on Wednesday night, US rates headed higher overnight, led by the long-end of the curve. The 10 year Treasury yield increased 6bps to its highest level since mid-June, at 2.12%, while the 30 year bond yield rose 7bps to 2.65%. Global rates have also risen overnight, with the 10 year gilt yield up 8bps and Germany 10 year bund yield rising 4bps to -0.23%. The NZ 10 year swap rate traded 6bps higher than the NZ market close in London, at 1.815%.

Core CPI rose a higher than expected 0.3% in June, taking the annual rate of increase to 2.1% (vs. 2.0% expected). Some of the idiosyncratic factors that have weighed on US core inflation this year reversed in June, with used car prices rising 1.6% (the first rise in five months) and apparel inflation turning positive. The heavily-weighted shelter category – which makes up around 40% of the core index – increased 0.3% in June. Low vacancy rates and a strong labour market have supported higher rates of rental inflation over recent years, in turn boosting the rate of core CPI inflation. Shelter, however, comprises a much lower (around 18%) weight in the Fed’s preferred measure of core inflation, the core PCE inflation, which is currently running at 1.6%.

A very weak 30 year Treasury bond auction added upward pressure to long-end rates. The 30 year bond auction tailed 2.5bps, tentatively suggesting some investor resistance to the low levels of rates.

The short-end of the curve meanwhile has been more sticky – the 2 year Treasury yield is only 2bps higher – with market participants sceptical that the upside surprise to CPI will dissuade the Fed from cutting rates later this month, although the implied probability of a 50bp move was marked down slightly. There is now 31bps priced-in for the July meeting, suggesting a not insignificant risk of a 50bp move, compared to 33bps yesterday. The market prices 67bps of cuts by the end of the year and 96bps by the end of 2020.

Coming only a day after his dovish testimony to Congress, Fed Chair Powell’s Senate appearance unsurprisingly wasn’t market moving. The underlying tone of Powell’s comments was dovish, as he noted that “the neutral interest rate is lower than we had thought and I think we’re learning that the natural rate of unemployment is lower than we thought…so monetary policy hasn’t been as accommodative as we had thought.” The median estimate of the so-called ‘neutral rate’ was marked down by Fed officials at the June meeting from 2.8% to 2.5%.

There have also been a number of Fed officials on the wires overnight, including NY Fed President Williams, Atlanta Fed President Bostic and Richmond Fed President Barkin. Barkin and Bostic, neither of whom are voting members on the FOMC this year, both sounded unconvinced on the need to cut rates at this stage. Barkin noted that “with unemployment so low and consumer spending so healthy, it’s equally hard to make a case for stepping on the gas” while Bostic said he thought inflation wasn’t as low as some had suggested and he was sceptical about the need for a July cut. While a rate cut In July still seems like a foregone conclusion, and the core of the FOMC (Powell, vice-Chair Clarida, and Williams) have outlined the rationale for easing, the resistance among some regional Fed presidents probably argues more in favour of a 25bp move.

Equity markets have been little moved, despite the increase in longer-dated Treasury yields, with market participants seemingly taking comfort in the Fed’s likely rate cut later this month. The S&P500 is flat on the day, as it consolidates around the 3,000 mark. Trump tweeted that “China is letting us down in that they have not been buying the agricultural products from our great Farmers that they said they would. Hopefully they will start soon!”, but there was little market impact.

The USD continued to drift lower through yesterday’s Asian trading session and into the London morning as the market digested Powell’s dovish message from his Congressional testimony. But the higher than expected CPI release halted the decline in the USD and it has since moved higher. The USD is down slightly since this time yesterday, by about 0.1% in index terms.

The NZD and AUD have outperformed (both around 0.25% higher over the past 24 hours), with the NZD trading around 0.6665. The NZD remains firmly mid-range.

There was little reaction to the release of the minutes to the ECB’s June meeting which noted that there was “broad agreement” among Governing Council members that the ECB might need to ease policy again. Since the June meeting, ECB President Draghi has effectively foreshadowed a new round of monetary policy easing, unless there was an improvement in the outlook for growth and inflation.

US Suspends Low-Level Radioactive Waste Shipments to Nevada,https://time.com,['Scott Sonner'],,,,https://time.com/5624166/nevada-radioactive-waste-shipments-rick-perry/,"(RENO, Nev.) — A Nevada congressman called for U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry’s resignation Wednesday after the department acknowledged multiple shipments of low-level radioactive waste to a site north of Las Vegas may have been mislabeled and out of compliance with safety regulations for years.

The department had announced earlier that shipments of the waste from Tennessee to Nevada have been suspended while it investigates whether the materials were “potentially mischaracterized” as the wrong category of low-level waste. Low-level waste can include equipment or worker’s clothing contaminated by exposure to radiation, while mixed low-level waste can include toxic metals.

Deputy Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette also has ordered a department-wide assessment of its “procedures and practices for packaging and shipping all radioactive waste types,” according to a memo.

Department spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes said none of the materials shipped to Nevada as early as 2013 from the Y-12 facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, posed any health or safety threats to workers or the public.

But she acknowledged the shipments slated for disposal at the Nevada National Security Site were not in compliance with the site’s acceptance criteria.

The department’s National Nuclear Security Administration has launched an internal investigation “to determine how this went undetected for a six-year period,” Hynes said in a statement on Wednesday.

The low-level waste material is unrelated to weapons-grade plutonium that the department secretly shipped to the same Nevada site last year from South Carolina and is currently at the center of a legal battle with the state of Nevada in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

But Rep. Steven Horsford, D-Nevada, said in calling for Perry to “resign immediately” that the new disclosure is further evidence that Nevada has been covertly “coerced” into illegally receiving nuclear materials “through negligence or outright trickery.”

Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak and other members of Nevada’s congressional delegation stopped short of demanding Perry resign but were equally critical of his department’s handling of the waste.

“The level of incompetence at the Department of Energy is only matched by its dishonesty,” Rep. Dina Titus, D-Nevada, said.

Sisolak said Brouillette telephoned him on July 3 to inform him that the department “has been shipping incorrectly labeled low-level waste” from Tennessee to Nevada.

Sisolak also released a letter he and Democratic Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen sent to Perry on July 5 expressing their concerns and demanding more details.

The Democratic governor said he was more fully briefed on the situation during both classified and unclassified meetings in Las Vegas on Tuesday with senior department officials, including Lisa Gordon-Hagerty, head of DOE’s National Nuclear Security Administration.

Sisolak said he originally was told the waste shipped out of compliance with the department’s criteria governing low-level waste disposal at the Nevada site included 32 total shipments that began in 2013 and ended last December. But his office clarified there were six shipments that included a total of 32 canisters.

Sisolak said the department hasn’t determined yet whether the material labeled as low-level waste may have included mixed low-level waste, which is regulated more stringently under state and federal guidelines and requires treatment prior to disposal.

For example, Sisolak said the Energy Department entered into a settlement agreement with the state in May after DOE was cited for accepting low-level radioactive waste at the Nevada site that was subsequently found to be contaminated with chromium at a toxicity level higher than is allowed by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act — “thereby rendering it a mixed, low-level radioactive waste.”

Hynes said Wednesday the department leadership first was notified on July 3 that certain shipments of waste managed by a contractor at the Y-12 facility failed to comply with the Nevada site’s criteria, and may have been “mischaracterized” as low-level waste.

“The components that were shipped have been disposed of in a safe and secure manner at the NNSS, and as a precaution, planned future shipments of components from Y-12 have been temporarily suspended,” she said.

NAJIB HAVOC TAKES DOWN GLOBAL BANKING GIANTS: U.S. NOW INVESTIGATING DEUTSCHE BANK OVER 1MDB DEALINGS – WSJ,https://www.malaysia-chronicle.com,[],,,,https://www.malaysia-chronicle.com/?p=168570,"The United States Justice Department is investigating whether Deutsche Bank AG violated foreign corruption or anti-money-laundering laws in its work for state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), the Wall Street Journal said on Wednesday.

The news comes after the bank announced plans to scrap its global equities unit, cut some fixed-income operations and slash 18,000 jobs globally in a 7.4-billion-euro ($8.34bn) restructuring program.

Deutsche Bank’s work for 1MDB included helping to raise $1.2bn in 2014 as concerns about the fund’s management and financials had begun to circulate, the newspaper said, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.

Authorities in the US estimate some $4.5bn was stolen from the fund, which was established in 2009, and the fraud is under investigation in at least six countries.

US prosecutors are mainly looking into the role of Tan Boon-Kee, a colleague of a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc executive, Tim Leissner, who worked with him on 1MDB-related business, the paper said.

She left Goldman to become Asia-Pacific head of banking for financial institutions clients at Deutsche Bank, where she was involved with further 1MDB dealings, it added.

In an emailed statement, Deutsche Bank said it had fully cooperated with all regulatory and law enforcement agencies that made inquiries about the fund.

“As stated in asset forfeiture complaints filed by the US Department of Justice, 1MDB made ‘material misrepresentations and omissions to Deutsche Bank officials’ in connection with 1MDB’s transactions with the bank,” the bank told Reuters.

“This is consistent with the bank’s own findings in this matter,” it added.

A US DoJ civil asset-forfeiture complaint repeatedly describes Deutsche Bank as being misled by 1MDB officers, the WSJ said.

Tan left Deutsche Bank last year, after it discovered communications between her and Jho Low, the Malaysian financier the Justice Department has described as the central player in the 1MDB scandal, it added.

A representative of insurance company FWD Group, Tan’s current employer, said the company and Tan declined to comment.

The DoJ did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.

Last month, Malaysia’s anti-corruption agency began legal action to recover 270 million ringgit ($65.1m) embezzled from 1MDB, and estimates assets overseas worth a further $5bn may also be recoverable.

Latheefa Koya, the chief commissioner of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC), said the agency has filed complaints against 41 individuals and entities to recover money given to them by former Prime Minister Najib Razak.

Najib was overthrown in a shock defeat in general elections last year and is currently on trial in Kuala Lumpur in the first of a series of cases related to the scandal at 1MDB. He pleaded not guilty when the trial opened and has denied any wrongdoing.

Asked during a presidential candidate town hall hosted by the League of United Latin American Citizens what he thought of Johnson's so-called friendly fire, Castro said the criticism was ""obviously not friendly.""

Interior Dept. says it spent $2.45M in public funds on Trump’s ‘Salute to America’,https://wtop.com,['News Traffic Weather'],07-11-2019,2019,7,https://wtop.com/dc/2019/07/interior-dept-says-it-spent-2-45m-in-public-funds-on-trumps-salute-to-america/,"Interior Secretary David Bernhardt put estimates of department's share of costs for President Donald Trump’s July 4 ""Salute to America"" at $2.45 million.

In a letter to lawmakers on Capitol Hill made public Thursday, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt put estimates of the department’s share of costs for President Donald Trump’s July Fourth “Salute to America” at the Lincoln Memorial at $2.45 million.

Bernhardt called the use of public funds justified, and cited past administrations’ spending for concerts, parades and other celebrations in and around the National Mall.

Interior’s costs included crowd accommodations, such as temporary fencing and portable toilets.

The disclosure confirms what The Washington Post had previously reported: that close to $2.5 million was diverted from the National Park Service, which normally uses the money from entrance and recreation fees to make improvements to U.S. parks.

Arizona Democrat Raul Grijalva, chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, said the public funds were used to “celebrate President Trump.”

There are further concerns from local leaders as well.

In a Tuesday letter to Trump, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said the president’s Fourth of July event on the National Mall, as well as protests by others, have left the city’s security fund bankrupt, and that it will be running at a deficit of more than $6 million by the end of September.

She attributed the Emergency Planning and Security Fund (EPSF) numbers to estimates by the District’s Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency and said the total cost for the District is estimated at $1.7 million.

The EPSF covers public safety at events, anti-terror efforts and support for the Secret Service.

Security for the annual “A Capitol Fourth” concert, which was held the same day on the National Mall, was provided by the federal Capitol Police and U.S. Park Police, not D.C. police.

Bowser also said D.C. still hasn’t been reimbursed the $7.3 million extra it spent for Trump’s 2017 inauguration.

“These overages can be attributed to declining reserves, increased demand for heightened security, and a one-time draw down of $7.3 million to cover security costs associated with the 2017 presidential inauguration,” Bowser wrote.

The White House debates that figure.

Reached for comment about Bowser’s letter, the White House said: “We have received the letter and will respond in a timely manner.”

Senators are also seeking to probe the cost of the event, which included military flyovers and tanks on the National Mall.

WTOP has submitted a Freedom of Information Act request with the National Park Service, via the Interior Department, to see a cost breakdown for the event.

A Defense Department spokesperson confirmed Wednesday that the Pentagon spent $1.2 million on the “Salute to America” celebration, which does not factor in the cost of flyovers, since the flyovers are being listed as training flights to “facilitate flying hours, which are imperative to military readiness.”

That puts known cost estimates for “Salute to America” at $5.35 million.
